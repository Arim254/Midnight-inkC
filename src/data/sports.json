    "body": "\n        Two teams hoping to finally put together a winning streak will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers. San Fran (7-4) has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games and is coming off a 41-22 victory over Arizona in Week 11. Carolina (6-5) has alternated wins and losses over its last five contests, most recently knocking off Atlanta, 30-27 in overtime, on Sunday. The Niners entered NFL Week 12 ranked seventh in the NFC standings, with the Panthers ninth.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Niners have won the last two matchups, with the most recent meeting coming in 2022. San Francisco is the 7.5-point favorite in the latest Panthers vs. 49ers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5. Before making any 49ers vs. Panthers picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Carolina has covered in five of six games versus NFC opponents in 2025, and its MNF opponent has major defensive holes. The Niners can neither get to the quarterback nor take the ball away as they rank dead last in defensive sacks and also have the second-fewest picks. That should bring comfort to Young in the pocket, while he also has the league's No. 4 rusher in Rico Dowdle to lean on. Finally, there doesn't appear to be much of a home-field advantage for the 49ers who have eight giveaways versus just one takeaway at Levi's Stadium this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the 49ers can coverA finally healthy Brock Purdy showed what San Francisco is capable of last week as the Niners scored a season-high of 41 points after averaging just 22 on the season. The offense, however, runs through Christian McCaffrey, who leads the NFL in scrimmage yards and is on pace for 1,000-yard seasons both on the ground and through the air. George Kittle has also made an impact since coming off IR, with four scores over his last four games, and San won't see the most threatening of offenses come Monday.

    "body": "\n        Top-10 scoring offenses meet on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at SoFi Stadium at 8:20 p.m. ET. It should be a fertile setting for offense with Los Angeles averaging 27.2 points per game, while Tampa Bay averages 25.2 points. The NFL DFS player pool for this showdown slate includes big names like Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Baker Mayfield and Emeka Egbuka.Injuries are a factor, especially for Tampa Bay, with Mike Evans (collarbone) and Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) both out, and Chris Godwin (fibula) listed as questionable. How should that impact your NFL DFS lineups? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Buccaneers vs. Rams, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to 'Sunday Night Football'   and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks.

One of the top receivers in the league, the third-year pro out of BYU has put together a 73-850-4 receiving line thus far despite missing a game due to injury. He's found the end zone in four of his past six games, and the Rams added a new wrinkle last week as he took two carries as well. The Bucs rank 21st in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers, setting up a golden opportunity for Nacua to return value in this spot. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bucs tight end Cade Otton. He had a quiet day last week against the Bills, but he's just two weeks removed from a big 9-82 day against the Patriots. He hasn't been targeted less than five times in his past six games, and with Mike Evans still on injured reserve, Otton will likely continue to be a big target that Mayfield can lean on. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Buccaneers vs. RamsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

Kirk Cousins will start, and the 37-year-old looked his age in his first start, completing 21 of 31 passes for 173 yards and no touchdowns in a 34-10 loss to the Dolphins in Week 8. Cousins has been a reliable starter for the majority of his NFL career, and the Falcons hope he has a few more of those performances left. Expectations weren't high for Kellen Moore in his first season as the New Orleans head coach, and although the Saints only have two victories, three of their eight losses have come in one-score contests, so they haven't been totally outclassed. The Saints are favored for just the second time this season, and the only other time they were favored, New Orleans defeated the Giants, 26-14, on their home field. They'll seek a similar result on Sunday, coming off just their second win of the season before a bye week.Model's Falcons vs. Saints score prediction, picksThe SportsLine Projection Model knows that the Falcons will rely on one of the best running back tandems in Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier, as the Falcons are 13th in the NFL in yards per rush (4.5). It also knows the Saints have a big-play receiver in Chris Olave, who had 104 yards and a touchdown in his last game against the Panthers and is 15th in the NFL at 664 receiving yards.

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is likely to slow down for the upcoming holiday, but teams still have a few days to get some winter shopping done before Thanksgiving. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Sunday's most notable rumors and transactions in one convenient place.Tigers, others interested in Helsley as starterThe Tigers are one of several teams who are interested in signing and converting reliever Ryan Helsley into a starter, according to The Athletic. \nHelsley, 31, has never started a game in the majors and hasn't made a professional start at any level since 2018. Nevertheless, teams are hopeful that he can follow in the cleatprints of Reynaldo López, Michael King, and Clay Holmes, among others, and make the transition to the rotation.Helsley split last season between the Cardinals and Mets, amassing a 4.50 ERA (92 ERA+) and a 2.52 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 58 appearances. He's struggled with command throughout his career, issuing nearly four walks per nine innings. Helsley does have three pitches that grade as average or better: his fastball and two breaking balls, though he seldom uses his curveball.\nThe Tigers are believed to be in pursuit of a starting pitcher regardless of whether or not they keep ace Tarik Skubal, who is slated to hit free agency after next season. Giants interested in ImaiYou can count the Giants among the suitors for incoming Japanese right-hander Tatsuya Imai, according to MLB Network's Jon Morosi. Imai, 27, was recently posted for MLB consideration by NPB's Saitama Seibu Lions. He'll have until Jan. 2 to sign a deal with an MLB team. The Lions will receive a posting fee proportional to the value of his signed contract.Here's what CBS Sports wrote about Imai when ranking him as the 12th-best available free agent:\nRelative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.Logan Webb and Robbie Ray will lead the San Francisco rotation in 2026 and Landen Roupp looked like a solid starter before an August injury, but beyond that is a question mark.The Giants are likely to face stiff competition for Imai's services, with the usual highrollers -- the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, and Cubs -- looking like potential suitors as well.The Giants have made several splashes since installing longtime catcher Buster Posey as their top executive. Those include signing shortstop Willy Adames, trading for infielder Rafael Devers, and hiring former college coach Tony Vitello as their new skipper.Cubs seek top starterThe Cubs have already added a few notable pitchers to their staff this winter, with left-handed starter Shota Imanaga returning after accepting the qualifying offer and reliever Phil Maton agreeing to a multi-year pact. Yet that doesn't mean Chicago is done shopping for quality arms. \nRather, the Cubs continue to seek a front-of-the-rotation starter, according to The Athletic's Sadahev Sharma.If the Cubs add their starter through free agency, they could pursue Framber Valdez, Dylan Cease, Michael King, Ranger Suárez, or Zac Gallen, among other options. Sharma notes that it's possible the Cubs' addition comes through a trade, however, going so far as to name Marlins right-hander Edward Cabrera as a potential target. The Cubs rotation currently consists of Imanaga, Horton, Jameson Taillon, Matthew Boyd, and either Colin Rea or Javier Assad. Justin Steele, who had elbow surgery last spring, is expected back at some point during the summer, too.\n            ",

The injury happened early in the first quarter of Denver's eventual win over the Houston Rockets in NBA Cup action on Friday.\nGordon, 30, did not play in Saturday's loss to the Sacramento Kings. Charania noted Gordon has been dealing with issues in both hamstrings this season and played through a Grade 2 left hamstring strain in Game 7 in the second round of the playoffs against the Oklahoma City Thunder last season.The high-flying forward has been outstanding this season, averaging a career-high 18.8 points per game on a career-high 44.4% 3-point shooting, a top-20 mark in the NBA so far this season. Gordon's injury comes just over a week after fellow starting wing Christian Braun sprained his left ankle. The Nuggets announced Braun would be re-evaluated in six weeks.The overlapping injuries leaves Denver very thin on the wing; Spencer Jones and Peyton Watson both started against the Kings alongside Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Cameron Johnson. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Bruce Brown both played more minutes than usual off the bench, and Hunter Tyson joined the bench rotation as well.\nDenver is 12-4 on the season and second in the Western Conference, only behind Oklahoma City (16-1).\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Florida State will give Mike Norvell another season in 2026 with the university's president, athletic director and board of trustees aligned in support, the school announced. Firing the sixth-year coach would have resulted in a hefty buyout due to the significant contract extension through signed after the Seminoles' excellent 2023 season. Norvell's return includes a pledge to make changes in the areas of recruiting and player development.\"Our responsibility is to do what gives Florida State the strongest competitive position – not just today, but for years to come,\" said Florida State athletic director Michael Alford in a statement. \"Florida State has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in its football program over the past few years with high expectations. Chairman Collins, President McCullough and I are aligned in partnering with Coach and improving our ability to compete for championships. Our mission is unwavering in putting Florida State football at the forefront of college athletics.\"  Florida State deteriorated after a surprising 3-0 start and top-10 ranking that included a win over Alabama with six losses in its last eight games and still needs another win at Florida to avoid missing bowl eligibility for the second straight year.Norvell is 38-33 (22-26 ACC) at Florida State, but it only 7-16 overall since going 13-1 and winning the ACC with an unbeaten league record that season.\nFlorida State's overtime loss at Stanford last month was the program's 11th setback in 12 ACC contests, a new low punctuated by 13 penalties, a confrontation between Norvell and a player on the sideline and faulty execution late as a 17.5-point road favorite.After that overtime setback, Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said the university would reassess Norvell's contract situation at the end of the year. A bye week followed the Stanford loss and lukewarm vote of confidence before Florida State picked up a home win over Wake Forest -- its first conference victory in more than a calendar year. From there, the Seminoles lost on the road to Clemson before beating the Hokies at home in Week 12.\"This program has been built on belief, sacrifice, and putting the team first,\" Norvell said in a statement. \"That set of values has always guided my actions, and those of our players. The driving motivation behind this is to make certain that we are doing everything properly to obtain and retain elite players, add critical pieces, and sustain long-term success. I love Florida State, and I am fully committed to this program, and our shared goals.\"  \nNorvell's up-and-down tenure in TallahasseeNorvell's tenure opened with two losing seasons with the Seminoles before winning 10 games in 2022 and finishing No. 11 in the final AP poll following a bowl win. He carried that success into the following campaign after Florida State ran roughshod through the ACC, finished the regular season undefeated and unfortunately became the first Power conference unbeaten to be snubbed by the College Football Playoff's selection committee.More than a dozen players for the Seminoles opted out of the Orange Bowl that season in disgust, resulting in a 63-3 loss to Georgia. Florida State hasn't been the same under Norvell since that embarrassing outcome outside of this season's opening win over then-No. 8 Alabama in Tallahassee.The Seminoles finished 2-10 and at the bottom of the conference last season before making wholesale changes to their coaching staff, including the additions of Gus Malzahn as offensive coordinator and Nebraska's Tony White to lead the defense in 2025.\nThe changes and personnel alterations showed up roses in September before Florida State's first loss of the season -- an overtime struggle at Virginia -- shifted the program in a different direction. After beating Wake Forest to snap a nine-game ACC skid, Norvell was emotional. \"I am grateful for the opportunity to coach these players,\" Norvell said. \"I know what we ask them to do. I know what we ask them to do on the field; I know what we ask them to do off the field, in the classroom, the challenge that they must embrace being a part of this program. When you come up short in games, when your record is not what you want it to be, the identity is going to be put on display.\"I don't just say it because it sounds good; they're my heart. They're family to me, and they said yes to being a part of this program, and we said yes to them. I think it's a team that is very capable, and just to see them continue to try to grow and to be better and to go and showcase what they're able to do, even with a lot of challenges and probably a lot of things on the outside that make it difficult in today's age of college athletics.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        T.J. Watt has passed a familiar face on the NFL's career sack list. The Steelers' pass rusher now has more than his older brother JJ Watt, a current CBS Sports NFL color analyst who enjoyed a Hall of Fame career with the Texans and Cardinals. Fittingly, Watt's history-making sack set up a Steelers' go-ahead touchdown during the second quarter Sunday's game against the Bears. Watt's strip-sack of Caleb Williams was scooped up in the end zone by fellow linebacker Nick Herbig. The score gave the Steelers a 14-7 lead over the Bears Watt now has 115 career sacks, which is 26th on the all-time list. \"Hell of a way to break my record,\" said JJ Watt, who is serving as a color analyst for Sunday's game.\nA three-time Defensive Player of the Year, JJ Watt was one of the NFL's most effective players during his 12-year career. He led the NFL in sacks twice while also pacing the league in tackles for loss three times. \n\"I was spoiled to be able to watch him play,\" T.J. Watt said of his older brother during an interview with CBS Sports. \"He was getting 1-2 sacks, three TFLs a game, batting passes every single game. It just seemed so normal that I took it for granted. \"When I got to the NFL, it wasn't until then that I realized how hard it is to do what he's been doing his whole career. I just have a great amount of respect for him and everything that he's been able to accomplish, because it is so hard to succeed at this level.\"It didn't take long for T.J. to develop his own reputation in the NFL after being selected by the Steelers in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2018, earned his first of three consecutive All-Pro nods in 2019 and won Defensive Player of the Year in 2021 after Michael Strahan's single-season sack record. \nThe younger Watt's success has earned him the respect of many of the NFL's great defenders who played before him, his big brother included. \n\"I think he's the best defensive player in the game,\" JJ Watt said of his brother shortly after he announced his retirement after the 2023 season. \"He's the best defensive player in the world, and I'm looking forward for the rest of the world to see it again.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Beaver Stadium didn't wait for the final whistle to make its preference known. Long before the clock drained in Penn State's 37-10 win against Nebraska, a verdict had already been delivered. Throughout the second half, a low rumble built into a full-throated chant -- \"Terry! Terry!\" -- echoing from the student section outward throughout Happy Valley.Those chants didn't stop when the game ended, either. As interim coach Terry Smith did his on-field interview, several players clustered behind him holding signs that read, \"Hire Terry Smith.\" Moments earlier, Smith walked to midfield to shake hands with Matt Rhule -- the coach who gave him his first FBS opportunity at Temple more than a decade ago. It carried a certain symmetry: acknowledgment from a former mentor, followed by an unmistakable message from the roster Smith now leads.Smith, elevated to interim coach after James Franklin's firing on Oct. 12, didn't try to downplay how much the night meant.\"I'm very motivated by the support,\" Smith said. \"My players love me unconditionally. I love them unconditionally. Their support means everything to me. The fans were unbelievable again tonight. ... It encourages us. It motivates us. It gives us energy.\"\nSince taking over, Smith hasn't attempted to overhaul Penn State's identity. What he has done is steady the operation. The sideline looks more organized, and the Nittany Lions are playing with a looseness -- a sense of actually enjoying football again -- that had been missing earlier in the year as a preseason national title contender. The changes aren't dramatic, but they are visible in how Penn State executed over the past few weeks. Under Smith, the team looked more settled, more connected, more like a group pulling in the same direction.Saturday's win was the clearest example yet. The defense swarmed early, refusing to let Nebraska find any rhythm and repeatedly forcing true freshman quarterback TJ Lateef into rushed decisions. Offensively, Penn State found balance -- a run game that witnessed Kaytron Allen become the program's all-time leading rusher, a passing attack that sought efficiency while hitting several explosives and a sideline that stayed composed rather than combustible. None of it was flashy. All of it was effective. And most importantly, it looked sustainable.Before the chants and the signs, the night hit Smith in a quieter way. He described walking into the stadium pregame with his granddaughter, only for her to hear thousands of fans chanting her grandfather's name.\n\"How would you feel?\" Smith said. \"It's amazing. She experienced something that very few people get an opportunity to experience.\"As candidate pool shrinks, homegrown choice growsWhat once felt like a wide-open coaching search tightened considerably. The initial wave of outside candidates -- the type of names that dominate early wish lists -- has largely evaporated. Several of them are now off the board altogether. Curt Cignetti signed a massive extension at Indiana. Matt Rhule did the same at Nebraska. Mike Elko is staying put at Texas A&M. And even Jeff Brohm -- another early name -- is reportedly closing in on security of his own in Louisville. With each move, the list of realistic external targets grows shorter.Against that backdrop, Smith's candidacy shifted from a feel-good storyline to a practical, compelling option. Penn State will conduct a formal interview with Smith this week, per Brandon Marcello. Meanwhile, James Madison's Bob Chesney remains a name to watch, even as he emerges as a leading candidate for the UCLA opening, according to 247Sports.\nSmith's case is rooted in what has unfolded on the field and inside the program. Since assuming control on Oct. 12, he calmed a wobbling team. The locker room appears steadier. The sideline looks organized. The performances have become cleaner and more cohesive. And the roster -- loudly and visibly -- has aligned itself behind the coach leading them now. The \"Hire Terry Smith\" signs weren't a gimmick; they were an endorsement from players who believe it's their best path forward.There's also the matter of timing. The transfer portal window and early signing period hit in December, and Penn State cannot afford turbulence. Smith is the one candidate who might be able to keep the roster intact, maintain recruiting relationships and preserve the program's identity without disruption. A national search may offer bigger résumés, but none offer a smoother transition.He is a four-year letter winner at Penn State (1987-91), a former wide receiver under Joe Paterno, and a longtime assistant who knows the recruiting terrain as well as anyone on staff. He honored that history Saturday with a \"Joe 409\" pin on his jacket.\nSaturday's performance only amplified the case. Smith presented a version of Penn State that looked confident and capable of climbing again. And as the second half lead grew larger, Beaver Stadium responded in the loudest way possible, making it clear the homegrown option may also be the right one.\n            ",

Helping Sanders is just part of the reason why Watson made the trip, as he is now healthy enough to travel and be on the sideline for a game.Sanders took first-team reps this week with Dillon Gabriel sidelined by a concussion, and Watson reportedly helped him digest the game plan. Mark Kay Cabot reported that Watson has been a great help to both Sanders and Gabriel this season behind closed doors.Sanders is looking to become the first Browns quarterback since 1995 to win his first career start. Browns quarterbacks are a combined 0-17 in their first pro starts since 1999. Cleveland has trotted out an NFL-high 42 different starting quarterbacks since 1999, a list that now includes Sanders, and has started at least three different quarterbacks in seven out of the last 12 seasons.\nThe son of NFL legend Deion Sanders saw his first NFL action last Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens, and struggled. Sanders completed 4 of 16 passes for 47 yards and threw one interception, but there's no denying he has potential at the pro level. In his final season at Colorado, Sanders was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year after completing 74% of his passes for 4,134 yards, 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Sanders left the college football ranks with the highest career completion percentage (71.8%) in FBS history.\n            \n    ",

The loss nuked 15th-ranked USC's shot at reaching the College Football Playoff as well as the Big Ten Championship Game. Now 10-7 against conference competition since joining the Big Ten ahead of 2024 season, Riley got testy following a question about one of the Oregon pre-game signs that read \"Extend Lincoln Riley,\" a clear shot at USC's early struggles on the national stage. The Trojans are 0-5 against top-10 opponents during Riley's tenure and dropped to 0-7 overall against teams who wound up finishing inside the top 10.\"That might be the dumbest question I've been asked as long as I've been a head coach, and I've been asked a lot of questions,\" Riley said. \"You ought to be a little embarrassed to ask that question. This is a professional thing. You ought to try it.\"\nRiley entered the 2025 season on the proverbial hot seat. Their only top 25 finish under Riley came in his first year (2022), but that will change as long as USC ends its regular season with a win over UCLA.Entering Saturday's showdown at Oregon, the Trojans (8-3) were still in the thick of the playoff conversation and Big Ten title picture. A win at Autzen Stadium would have pressured Ohio State next weekend to beat Michigan, or else the Trojans could earn a berth in the conference championship with a win over UCLA.\nUSC has not won in Eugene since 2011 and the Trojans lost four straight to the Ducks in the series. USC's third road loss to a nationally-ranked opponent this season trumps what were momentum-building wins over Michigan and Iowa in Los Angeles.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first big event of this unique WNBA offseason is just hours away. The 2026 WNBA Draft Lottery, which will determine which team receives the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft, as well as the full lottery order, is set for Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET. Sunday's lottery comes amid a bitter labor fight between the league and the players, which has been waged for over a year. The two sides are yet to come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement ahead of the deadline on Nov. 30, and the risk of a work stoppage remains. Until a new CBA is in place, the expansion draft, free agency and the 2026 Draft cannot take place, but the league is able to hold the lottery. Notably, the five teams that missed out on the playoffs in 2025 -- the Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Los Angeles Sparks and Washington Mystics -- are not the five teams in the lottery. \n        \n            \n                2026 WNBA Draft Lottery: Where to watch, date, time, TV, livestream, teams involved, odds for No. 1 pick\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Sky owe their first-round pick to the Minnesota Lynx and the Sparks owe their first-round pick to the Seattle Storm. In addition, the Sun owe swap rights to their first-round pick to the Sky. Because the Sky also own the Phoenix Mercury's first-rounder, the Sky will get the more favorable of the Sun/Mercury picks, while the Sun will get the least favorable of those selections. With the Sun in the lottery and the Mercury in the playoffs, the Sky are guaranteed to receive the Sun's pick. \nHere's a quick reminder of the odds. TeamCombined 2024 and 2025 recordOdds of winning No. 1 pickWings \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t19-65  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t42% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSky (owe to Lynx) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t23-61 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t26.1% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSparks (owe to Storm) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t29-55 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t16.7% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMystics \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t30-54 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t9.5% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSun (owe to Sky) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t39-45 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t5.5% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAs you can see, the Wings have by far the best chance at the No. 1 pick. But which team needs the No. 1 pick the most? Let's break things down team-by-team.  5. Minnesota Lynx The Lynx were seconds away from winning the 2024 title and tied the all-time single-season wins record in 2025 before suffering a playoff collapse that was partly the result of injuries. Barring an unexpected exodus from Minneapolis this winter, the Lynx are going to have one of the best rosters in the league again next season.  Could they use the No. 1 pick? Sure, who couldn't? Do they need the No. 1 pick? Absolutely not. The bad news for the rest of the league is that they have the second-best odds to get it at 26.1%.  One interesting thing to consider with the Lynx is whether they would trade the top pick (or whichever pick they wind up with) for a more established player(s) who could help them win a title right now. Nearly every single veteran being a free agent this winter could make that tricky, though.  The No. 1 pick hasn't been dealt since 2022, when the Mystics traded it to the Atlanta Dream, who ended up selecting Rhyne Howard.   4. Seattle Storm Despite another underwhelming regular season in 2025, the Storm were seconds away from upsetting the eventual champion Las Vegas Aces in the first round of the playoffs. Instead, the Storm went home early for the second year in a row -- they've won one playoff series since their title in 2020 -- and coach Noelle Quinn was fired. She has since been replaced with Sonia Raman, who was most recently an assistant with the New York Liberty. More so than most teams, it will be interesting to see what the Storm do in free agency this winter. They've had plenty of talent over the last few seasons, but the sum has been less than its parts. Do they attempt to run it back with a new coach? Or do they make a few alterations to try and find a group that fits better? Barring a complete teardown, which is unlikely, the Storm are going to have a strong roster again. At the very least, their promising young group of Dominique Malonga, Jordan Horston and Nika Mühl -- the latter two missed the 2025 season with torn ACLs -- will be around to provide a path to the future. If the Lynx win the No. 1 pick, that would be unfair for the rest of the league. No one would say the same if the Storm get it, but Seattle definitely does not need it as much as the three teams above them.  3. Washington Mystics The Mystics were more competitive than everyone expected last season, and hovered around .500 and the back-end of the playoff picture until mid-August. A deadline deal that sent All-Star guard Brittney Sykes to the Storm helped ensure they would not accidentally make the postseason, and they ended up losing their final 10 games.  This is the second consecutive lottery appearance for the Mystics, who once again have three first-round picks: their own, the Storm's first (No. 9) via the Sykes deal and the Liberty's first (No. 11), which was re-routed their way in the Aaliyah Edwards for Jacy Sheldon trade.  The Mystics nailed last year's draft. Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen were both All-Stars as rookies, and look like long-term franchise cornerstones. Georgia Amoore missed last season due to an ACL injury, but she'll be back in 2026 and even Lucy Olsen contributed as a second-round pick. They also traded for Sheldon, have Shakira Austin as a restricted free agent and Madison Scott and Emily Engstler as reserved free agents.  There is an abundance of young talent in Washington, and the future looks bright, especially with three more first-round picks on the way next spring. The No. 1 pick would be a huge bonus for the Mystics, but they're already on the right path with their rebuild.  2. Dallas Wings The Wings won the Paige Bueckers sweepstakes last season when they secured the No. 1 pick for just the second time in franchise history. As expected, she was tremendous in her rookie campaign. She finished fifth in the league in scoring, ninth in assists and sixth in assists, tied the single-game rookie scoring record, won Rookie of the Year, was named an All-Star and made the All-WNBA Second Team.  A good rule of thumb is that if a franchise won the previous draft lottery, it cannot be the one most in need of the top pick again the next year -- especially when the prize was a player of Bueckers' caliber. The Wings put that rule to the test, however.  Last season did not go to plan in Dallas. The team was beset by injuries, traded DiJonai Carrington and NaLyssa Smith and finished in last place at 10-34, which tied the league's single-season losses record. Chris Koclanes, who appeared out of his depth as a head coach, was fired shortly after the end of his first season in charge.  While the Wings need a lot of help, there is hope for the future. First and foremost, Bueckers is already an All-WNBA caliber player and will likely be in MVP discussions at some point in her career. Aziaha James and JJ Quinerly also had some promising moments as rookies, and Maddy Siegrist and Diamond Miller are under contract for 2026. There is young talent in Dallas and Curt Miller is a widely respected executive. Plus, new coach Jose Fernandez is far more experienced -- albeit on the collegiate level -- than Koclanes was.   The Wings could really use the No. 1 pick, especially given their lack of depth in the frontcourt, but they aren't No. 1 on this list. \n 1. Chicago Sky Since their inception in 2006, the Sky have missed the playoffs 11 times, but have never won the lottery. In fact, aside from the Golden State Valkyries and the two incoming expansion teams, the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire -- all three of which have never been in the lottery -- the Sky are the only active franchise that has never had the No. 1 overall pick.  That alone qualifies them to be at the top of this list, nevermind the fact that their 2025 campaign was an abject disaster.  General manager Jeff Pagliocca made a number of win-now moves last winter, only for the team to go 10-34 and tie the league's single-season losses record. Injuries didn't help, but even when everyone was healthy, the team wasn't good enough. Despite finishing tied for the worst record in the league, the Sky are lucky to even have a lottery selection. They owe their 2026 first to the Lynx, but through a series of other deals have control of the Sun's first-rounder \nTo make matters worse, the organization appeared to alienate star forward Angel Reese after suspending her for one half following an interview she gave to the Chicago Tribune in which she publicly criticized her teammates. Reese is under contract through 2027, when the Sky have a team option, but how long she'll remain on the roster remains to be seen. A trade request this winter would not be a major surprise.  As long as Reese is in town, the Sky have a star to build around. She's the best rebounder in the league, a strong defender, and, after a dreadful start to last season, made tremendous strides on the offensive end with her finishing and playmaking. Outside of Reese, however, there's not much to write home about.  Kamilla Cardoso is a very solid player, but has been inconsistent to start her career and it's unclear if she and Reese can actually coexist. Hailey Van Lith really struggled during her rookie campaign and Maddy Westbeld didn't do much outside of the final game. Ajša Sivka is an exciting prospect who should come over this season, but we've never seen her in the WNBA.  \nThe Sky desperately need the No. 1 pick, even if the top two prospects right now appear to be bigs (Awa Fam and Lauren Betts), which is a bit unlucky given their biggest need is in the backcourt. But because the Sky are in the lottery via the Sun, they only have a 5.5% chance to get the top pick.  \n            ",

The Patriots sit at 9-2 and are coming off a 27-14 divisional win against the New York Jets. The 3-7 Bengals are coming off a 34-12 divisional loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers.One of the biggest stories to watch this week is the status of Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who is progressing with his turf toe injury, but will not play on Sunday. However, for the first time in two months, the two-time Comeback Player of the Year was a full participant at practice.With another year of a struggling defense and Burrow sidelined for some time, the Bengals are essentially out of the playoff race. This week, one of their offensive stars not named Burrow will definitely be sidelined. Last week, wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase was seen spitting on Jalen Ramsey and he received a one-game suspension for his actions.While the Bengals offense will be missing a key contributor, the Patriots offense may get two key offensive players back. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) and wide receiver Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) could see action this week. \nIf the regular season ended today, the Patriots would be the No. 2 seed in the AFC. That's quite a climb considering that at this point a year ago New England was in contention for the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft.Here's a look at how to watch the game live, along with betting odds and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Bengals liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, OhioTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -7.5; O/U 50.5 (via DraftKings)    Patriots vs. Bengals: Need to knowThe Ja'Marr Chase suspension. The Bengals offense will be without their star wideout, who was suspended for one game for unsportsmanlike conduct after video showed him spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers' Jalen Ramsey during their Week 11 meeting. Chase appealed the suspension, but it was upheld. The suspension costs Chase a total of $507,156. So far this season, Chase leads the Bengals with 861 receiving yards and is second on the team with five touchdowns, so this is going to hurt.Bengals defense struggles. Cincinnati's offense may have been putting up decent numbers, but their defense isn't matching that play. The unit has allowed the fifth-most passing yards (2,651), the most passing touchdowns (25), the second-most rushing yards (1,609) and has recorded second-fewest sacks (14). Going up against a Patriots offense who currently has the second-most passing yards (2,937) and are tied for the third-most passing touchdowns (20) will present a challenge.Patriots vs. Bengals prediction, pick\nThe Patriots offense has been firing on all cylinders lately and I don't see that slowing down against a defense that has shown problems not only this year, but in recent years. Drake Maye is making his MVP case and I believe he will be able to find success again on Sunday. Pick: Patriots -7.5, Over 50.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss did not play football this week, yet the Rebels felt like the center of the college football world. All eyes are on Lane Kiffin as he mulls his coaching future while, at the same time, leading Ole Miss to arguably its greatest season in program history. It seems patently absurd that while the Rebels are gearing up for their regular-season finale against top rival Mississippi State and a likely College Football Playoff appearance beyond that, Kiffin is meeting with top brass at Florida and LSU about their coaching vacancies. The noise became so cacophonous that Ole Miss athletic director had to release a statement saying that Kiffin's final decision will come the Saturday after the Egg Bowl. Think about that for a minute. An active head coach is on the precipice of abandoning his team before it heads to the biggest stage in the sport for the first time in college football history. Pundits and living legends like Nick Saban can blame the athletic calendar all they want -- and it's absolutely something that needs fixing -- but the simple truth of the matter is that Kiffin cannot help himself. Not only is he the biggest villain in college football, Kiffin actually wants to be the biggest villain in college football. \nHis entire persona is built around grabbing attention and manufacturing interest. He craves the spotlight. It's why he's treating this whole process like he's a five-star recruit leading schools on until national signing day, cryptic Tweets of daily affirmations and all. Kiffin doesn't care if you love him or hate him. Kiffin doesn't care about Ole Miss, or what the fans will think if he leaves the Rebels out to dry. He just cares that you're watching and if controversy is the easiest path to get eyes on him, controversy is what Kiffin will create. \n\n        \n            \n                Tom Fornelli's CFP Vibe Check, Week 13: Even in a 'big' win, James Madison feels like a Saturday loser\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLincoln Riley is an overpaid Clay Helton USC spent over $10 million to fire Clay Helton four years ago and then dumped over $100 million into hiring... Clay Helton. Well, not exactly. Lincoln Riley and Clay Helton are not biologically the same person.But they're delivering similar results. Riley completed his 51st game with the Trojans yesterday. They were eliminated from College Football Playoff contention in a 42-27 loss to No. 7 Oregon. That brought Riley's record at USC to 34-17. Helton's record in that same timeframe, not counting his year as USC's interim coach? It was 34-17. \nIn fact, there's an argument to be made that Helton did a better job. He at least delivered USC a Pac-12 title and a win in the Rose Bowl during his tenure. Riley went to a Pac-12 Championship Game, and lost, and he also lost to Tulane in the only New Year's Six bowl that he's led the Trojans to. BYU is a playoff lock No. 11 BYU, quietly, has one of the best playoff résumés as the end of the regular season approaches. Smack an SEC or Big Ten logo on their jerseys and there's no doubt that the selection committee would rank the Cougars as a top-10 team, without question. They should be a lock for the 12-team field anyway. BYU went on the road in Week 13 and beat a good Cincinnati team 26-14. With that, the Cougars now have wins over 9-2 Utah, 8-3 Arizona and four teams with a 7-4 record. \nTheir strength of record ranks sixth in the country, per ESPN's FPI, which ranks ahead of Ole Miss, Oklahoma, Alabama, Texas Tech and Notre Dame. For those that like to use the strength of schedule argument which, unlike strength of record, does not account for the actual results of games played, BYU still lands at a respectable 28th. That's better than Ole Miss, Texas Tech and Notre Dame. It's also better than fellow bubble teams like Michigan and Miami. The Cougars have won three of their last four conference games by at least two possessions, so they pass the eye test. By every conceivable metric, BYU is a playoff team. It should beat UCF to close the regular season and then it should be playing in the first round, regardless of what happens in the Big 12 Championship Game. \nJeremiyah Love is the most important player in college football No single player means more to his team than Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love. No quarterback even comes close to matching the singular impact that Love has for the Fighting Irish. He could -- and, honestly, has -- singlehandedly win games for his team. Take Notre Dame's Week 13 win against Syracuse, for example. It helps that the Fighting Irish opened a 21-0 lead before the offense even took a snap, but they went on to put 70 points on the board while their quarterback threw for a combined 67 yards. The whole game. Love had 171 yards and three touchdowns on eight carries. He scored on almost half of his touches before Notre Dame decided to shut him down for the evening. \nIn Notre Dame's two ranked wins against USC and Pittsburgh, Love rushed for a combined 375 yards and two touchdowns on just under eight yards per carry. He had 92 more yards rushing (228) than Notre Dame had passing against the Trojans. That's Heisman Trophy level stuff, especially since Love is carrying Notre Dame to a repeat playoff appearance. Never expect anything of Illinois again This was billed as one of the biggest seasons in Illinois' history. Certainly, the Fighting Illini had a greater preseason outlook than they're used to. They landed at No. 12 in the initial AP Top 25 poll and then climbed to No. 9 amid a 4-0 start to the year. \nThey were once lauded as a Big Ten dark horse, ready to run with the conference's big dogs, and a College Football Playoff appearance was absolutely on the table. And then things fell apart. Illinois lost 63-10 to Indiana in its first conference test. Those 63 points are the most that a top-10 Big Ten team has ever allowed. It's been downhill from there. Illinois is 3-4 since that 4-0 start and it hit rock bottom in Week 13's loss to a rudderless Wisconsin. This iteration is worse than the Illinois we saw last year, even though a lot of the same faces are back. \nIllinois hit its peak as a modern program before the year began. It's doubtful the Illini ever climb that high again. \n            ",

The victory catapulted the No. 8-ranked native of Ecuador into instant title contention. During his postfight interview, Morales gestured toward UFC CEO Dana White, who was cageside, and said, \"Boss, Dana, my belt, my belt.\" Morales, who enjoyed advantages of three inches in height and seven inches in reach, towered over his opponent from the start. But Brady (18-2), a native of Philadelphia who is known for his relentless wrestling style, never shot for a takedown and ultimately paid for it. \nDespite showing a quick and accurate jab early on, Brady was visibly hurt by a big Morales right hand. Brady then pump-faked a takedown attempt and instantly ate another left hook.\nMoments later, a looping right hand hurt Brady once again and the left hand that followed dropped him. Referee Blake Grice jumped in shortly after to stop the fight at 3:27 of the opening round. \"We knew that [Brady] was a stocky welterweight and someone that is really strong so the coaches said to keep the center of gravity low and the knockout would come,\" Morales said.Morales improved to 7-0 in the UFC with five knockouts since his debut in 2022. \nBrady entered the fight with a three-fight win streak, including a fourth-round submission over former champion Leon Edwards in May. The loss was his first since a second-round TKO against future champion Belal Muhammad in 2022. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        UFC 322 is likely the most stacked card of the year. Islam Makhachev and Zhang Weili attempt to become two-division champions when they fight Jack Della Maddalena and Valentina Shevchenko, respectively, in New York City on Saturday.Welterweight champion Della Maddalena has a stiff first test as champion. Makhachev vacated the lightweight title after setting a record number of title defenses to prepare for a welterweight conquest at UFC 322. If Makhachev beats Della Maddalena, he joins an exclusive club as a double champion and an even rarer company by tying Anderson Silva's 16-fight winning streak.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 322, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!Shevchenko vs. Zhang is a historic fight between the current top two pound-for-pound women's fighters. Shevchenko is already a fixture on the women's MMA Mt. Rushmore. A successful showing on Saturday furthers that case: breaking her tie with Amanda Nunes for most combined title defenses, and earning arguably the best win of her career. For Zhang, it's a chance to win the women's flyweight title and carve her own face on that figurative stone mountain.\n        \n            \n                UFC 322 fight card predictions: Expert picks for Jack Della Maddalena vs. Islam Makhachev, every bout in NYC\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPlus, there's plenty of intrigue at welterweight throughout the night when Sean Brady takes on Michael Morales and former titleholder Leon Edwards takes on Carlos Prates. Brady is looking to hold serve as the No. 2 ranked fighter in the division against the fast rising knockout artist out of Ecuador. Edwards needs a bounce back win in a bad way and gets another tough test in Prates, who carries power in both hands.\nElsewhere, veteran lightweights meet to open the PPV when Benoit Saint Denis takes on Beneil Dariush. Top prospect Bo Nickal looks to bounce back from his first career defeat when he takes on Rodolfo Viera at middleweight in the preliminary main event.

A wild brawl involving mixed martial artist Dillon Danis broke out near media row just as the pay-per-view main card was set to begin.  Danis appeared to exchange words with members of former UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev's team before the action turned physical. The action was caught by CBS Sports' Brian Campbell, who was cageside for the event.\nUFC CEO Dana White said that he found out Danis had a ticket for the event right before the brawl broke out and realized the issue it would cause.\"They told me that Dillon Danis was here and he was moving around sitting in fighters' seats and not sitting in his own seat that he had a ticket [for], and they said 'do you want us to throw him out of here?'\"I said 'If the guy has a ticket, let him sit in his seat and let him do what he's doing, and keep an eye on him.' It never even crossed my mind, as stupid as this could be, that the entire Muslim brotherhood was here tonight and in the first five rows for Islam,\" White said. \"And as soon as it broke out, I go 'f---, I know exactly what that is.\" The brawl will no doubt bring to mind the wild scene that followed Khabib Nurmagomedov's win over Conor McGregor at UFC 229, when Nurmagomedov's team brawled with McGregor and his team at the conclusion of the fight.\n\"You will never see Dillon Danis at a UFC fight ever again,\" White said. Danis converted from the grappling world to mixed martial arts, where he was seen as an elite prospect as he rattled off two quick submission wins under the Bellator banner between 2018 and 2019. Danis would not fight another professional fight until this past August when he fought for Misfits Fighting, a promotion founded by social media influencer KSI, and defeated Warren Spencer in just 15 seconds.In between those fights, Danis lost an exhibition boxing match to social media influencer and WWE star Logan Paul in which Danis threw almost no punches before being disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nWhite said he declined to press charges against Danis.  \n            \n    ",

The finish came at 4:44 as Blanchfield avenged a split-decision loss to Cortez on the regional MMA scene at Invicta FC 34 in 2019.\"I'm really excited,\" Blanchfield said. \"I really wanted to avenge this [loss].\"Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 322, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!Cortez controlled the opening round with her quick hands and knees to the body in the clinch. But it was a competitive round in which Blanchfield failed to attempt a single takedown. \nThat eventually changed in Round 2 after a series of even exchanges on the feet that saw both flyweights bleed from the nose. But it was Cortez who ultimately shot first with a successful double-leg takedown that Blanchfield reversed.Blanchfield's first shot came shortly after but it was Cortez, thanks to a blatant grab of the fence that referee Blake Grice never saw, that quickly returned to her feet. A visibly frustrated Blanchfield then turned a standing clinch into a running takedown attempt across the cage that ended with her quickly taking the back of Cortez on the ground. \nShortly after Blanchfield applied the choke and fell backwards, Cortez was quick to tap out.\n\"I actually didn't think the choke was super tight but I could feel the pressure forced her to tap out,\" Blanchfield said. With the win, Blanchfield improved to 8-1 in the UFC after winning her second straight following a loss to Manon Fiorot in a 2024 No. 1 contender's bout via unanimous decision. Cortez, who began her UFC career with five straight wins, accumulated her second loss in her last three fights. \n            \n    ",

At UFC 322, Makhachev became a two-division champion and tied a long-standing UFC record by beating Jack Della Maddalena. Topuria doesn't see it that way. Topuria only saw one boring champion and another disappointing one. Shortly after Saturday's main event concluded, Topuria condemned Makhachev's performance as dull. Where many, including UFC CEO Dana White, celebrated Makhachev's grappling dominance as a sign of his greatness, Topuria was more confident than ever about shutting off the new welterweight champion.\"Islam, you need something you can't train: emotion. You're the most  boring thing in this game,\" Topuria wrote on Twitter. \"Every day, I'm more certain I put you to  sleep.\"  Topuria wasn't any kinder to former champion Della Maddalena. The Australian entered New York City as a solid betting underdog, but many fighters and analysts thought his improved grappling defense and boxing technique could surprise Makhachev. Instead, Della Maddalena looked progressively more dejected with each passing round where he failed to mount a meaningful offense.\n\"Jack needs an entire camp dedicated just to wrestling. What a disappointment of a champion,\" Topuria wrote earlier in his message. \"You should go to Georgia to learn something.\"Makhachev, when asked about his next opponent in the cage, didn't shed  light on who he'd fight next, only that he wants to compete at UFC's  White House card next year. A return to lightweight to challenge Topuria  would be the biggest fight in the sport. However, if Makhachev prefers  to stay at welterweight, he'll have a swathe of new challengers. Michael Morales and Carlos Prates  scored first-round knockouts at UFC 322, while ranked welterweights  Belal Muhammad and Ian Machado Garry co-headline UFC Fight Night Qatar  later this month. Makhachev was specifically asked about fighting Topuria when speaking to the media afterwards. The new welterweight champion said he was healthy and would make light work if Topuria were his next opponent.\n\"I am ready,\" Makhachev said at the UFC 322 post-fight press conference. \"Who is gonna be next? Let's do this. I will make it easy.\"   \n            \n    ",

The bout was contested at a catchweight of 157.2 pounds after Dariush (23-7-1) missed weight on Friday. The native of France instantly climbed the Octagon wall and gestured to the crowd that is deserving of a shot at Ilia Topuria's 155-pound title following consecutive stoppage wins of Kyle Propelec in May and Mauricio Ruffy just two months ago. \nDariush, a 36-year-old native of Iran, briefly dropped Saint Denis in the early going with a hard calf kick. BSD also ate a flush knee to the face as he attempted to rise back up to his feet. But the left hook from Saint Denis that followed was enough to send Dariush to his third defeat over his last four fights dating back to 2023.\"I will do whatever the UFC tells me to do and will return soon,\" Saint Denis said after the fight.\nThe 29-year-old Saint Denis, who entered as the No. 13-ranked lightweight (against No. 9 Dariush) continued to show his recuperative ability following a knockout loss to Dustin Poirier in 2024 (in which BSD was battling an illness) and a TKO defeat six months later to Renato Moicano (after the cageside doctor ruled BSD couldn't continue due to a damaged eye).  \n            \n    ",

Mariscal uses his pace, pressure and grittiness to intimidate his opponents and wear on them. His volume-striking attack makes him dangerous, but it's his ability to grapple and scramble that give him the edge in this matchup. Sabatini is a Ju-Jitsu ace, with 13 of his 19 pro wins coming by submission. He is a savvy grappler who can keep his opponents pinned to the mat. However, I have a hard time seeing him do that to Mariscal, who has never been submitted in his 18-6 pro career. Mariscal has a 73% takedown defense rate and has shown the ability to get up when taken down. If this fight plays out on the feet, Mariscal's relentlessness will overwhelm Sabatini.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev picksVithlani has strong picks for Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev and other bouts on the UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev card.

    "body": "\n        CHESTER, Pa. – The U.S. men's national team's 2-1 win over Paraguay closed out with a brawl between the two teams, which saw one player sent off and two players receive yellow cards.In the first minute of stoppage time of the USA's 2-1 win, the ball went out of play near the midfield line and both the USMNT's Alex Freeman and Paraguay's Gustavo Gomez went for the ball. Within moments, Gomez placed Freeman in a headlock, with players from both teams charging to the touchline as a fight broke out. Players and staff duked it out on the sideline for about a minute, a water bottle flying out of the scuffle at one point and separate fights breaking out, including one with Max Arfsten on the side.\nThe crowd eventually dissipated, and in the end, the referee issued a red card to Omar Alderete, who was an unused substitute for Paraguay, while the USMNT's Cristian Roldan and Paraguay's Junior Alonso got a yellow card.\"I'll keep the diplomatic,\" USMNT goalkeeper Matt Freese said afterwards. \"I was very happy, the way that we supported each other and there were a few cheap shots thrown from their end to be honest, but it's part of being a team and we're going to be standing out for each other no matter the moment, no matter the end of the game, beginning of the game, in the middle of the game, on the sideline like that. That's what it means to be a team and I don't think I've ever moved that quickly yet, didn't I?\"\nFreese also tied it back to the fighting spirit that head coach Mauricio Pochettino has tried to instill in the players as part of his reinvention of the group.\"We got in the locker room after the warm-up and the first thing that was said was [Cristian Roldan] screaming, 'We're not going to wait to get punched first. We're going to be on the front foot, we're going to win our duels,' and then obviously that culminates at the end in an actual fight,\" Freese said. I think the more important part is the fight in the individual duels and in the individual moments and then where does this start? It starts in building the culture, but it also starts on the training field with the intensity that we bring. It was a very intense week of training and heavy tackles, things like that. Nothing bad, obviously. We're all teammates, but creating that intense competitive environment is the start of it, and then it translates into the matches.\"Pochettino, though, said he did not see how the fight started but said it described it as a \"dangerous situation.\"\n\"It was difficult to see because I was looking [in] another direction,\" he said. \"That type of situation are very, very, very dangerous, very dangerous situation. I think we need to pay attention because anything can happen. Yes, I don't like. I don't like this type of situation. How it start[ed], I cannot say nothing because I need to … see on the tv why all this started.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Multiple NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, have been asked by the league to hand over cell phones and documents as part of its continued investigation into illegal sports betting, according to The Athletic. Late last month, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player and coach Damon Jones were arrested by the FBI amid a wide-ranging investigation into rigged poker games and illegal sports betting. The scandal rocked the NBA and the sports world and the league has recently faced scrutiny from Congress over its gambling policies and relationship with sportsbooks. \"The NBA engaged an independent law firm to investigate the allegations in the indictment once it was made public,\" an NBA spokesman told The Athletic in a statement. \"As is standard in these kinds of investigations, a number of different individuals and organizations were asked to preserve documents and records. Everyone has been fully cooperative.\"In particular, Congress has sought answers as to why Rozier was allowed to continue playing after the league looked into suspicious betting patterns regarding a March 2023 game. Rozier played in more than 100 games before he was arrested in October. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the league \"couldn't find anything.\"\n\"Terry, at the time, cooperated and gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. We ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence -- despite that abberational behavior -- to move forward,\" Silver said. \"We then worked directly with law enforcement -- as they said at the press conference, the league has been cooperating. That was obviously over two years ago. The federal government has subpoena power, can threaten to put people in jail, can do all kinds of things that the league office can't do. We've been working with them since then.\"\n        \n            \n                NBA gambling scandal: Adam Silver makes first public comments, says he was 'deeply disturbed' by allegations\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter meeting with Congress, the NBA, through an outside law firm, reportedly began contacting teams to request phones, phone records and other items and documents as part of an expanded investigation into illegal gambling. At least 10 Lakers employees are reportedly expected to be asked to surrender phones and phone records. Lakers assistant trainer Mike Mancias and executive administrator Randy Mims have already surrendered their phones and are cooperating with the investigation, per The Athletic. \nNeither Mancias nor Mims have been charged with a crime, nor were they named in either of the indictments filed by the Department of Justice. According to prosecutors, Jones sold information relating to the injury status of Lakers players and on at least one occasion allegedly received information from an unnamed trainer. The players were not named in the indictment, but context points to them being LeBron James and Anthony Davis. \n        \n            \n                NBA gambling investigation: Damon Jones allegedly sold information about LeBron James, Lakers\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJames reportedly had no knowledge that Jones was selling information about his injury status. \nOn Nov. 6, Jones pleaded not guilty to two charges. He was released on a $200,000 bond and he is prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime as part of the bond terms.In the wake of the DOJ's indictments, the NBA has begun the process of reviewing its gambling policies and exploring methods to protect the league and its players. \"Given the spread of legal betting to the majority of U.S. states, the recurrence of integrity issues across sports, and the emergence of novel betting formats and markets,\" the league said in a memo last month. \"this is an opportune time to carefully reassess how sports betting should be regulated and how sports leagues can best protect themselves, their players, and their fans.\"\nThe league is also \"barreling toward substantial changes in team rules for reporting injury statuses,\" according to The Athletic.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama's doubled up Oklahoma in yardage, but the Sooners' defense dictated the moments that mattered most.Now, the Sooners' College Football Playoff hopes not only have life, but momentum heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.Their hard-hitting 23-21 victory at Alabama was as impressive as any in the sport this season. The Sooners were out-gained 406-212 by the Tide, but forced three turnovers and scored 17 points off those miscues to hand Kalen DeBoer his first home loss as Alabama's head coach.Their 212 yards?  The fourth-fewest yards by an FBS team in a win against a top-five team since 2000. Historic stuff.\nDefensive mastermind Brent Venables was at his best Saturday night inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. He spun Ty Simpson in circles with several exotic blitzes -- a slot cornerback abandoning a tight end to knife in for a second-half sack in the second half was straight out of a mad scientist's lab.The go-ahead 24-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter came only after a strip-sack produced by a backup forced into duty. Reserve defensive end Taylor Wein stepped in for star edge R. Mason Thomas and made life a living nightmare for freshman right tackle Michael Carroll, beating him twice for hurries.Alabama fell in an early 10-0 hole after Ty Simpson threw an 87-yard pick six -- the first of his career -- to Eli Bowen. The Tide bounced back, as they have most of the season, but the turnovers didn't slow and neither did Oklahoma's swarming defense, which sacked Simpson three times in the second half.\n\"They give us a spark whenever we need it,\" OU quarterback John Mateer said after the win. \"They didn't get a whole lot of turnovers at the beginning of the year, but the football gods loved them back because of how hard they play.\"That spark has turned into a fire. Oklahoma's defense has ranked among the nation's best all season, but the lack of takeaways had led to close calls and the rivalry loss to Texas. In the first eight games? Just four turnovers. In back-to-back road wins over ranked opponents? Six takeaways leading to 30 points.This wasn't easily predictable, either. Alabama ripped off three explosive plays on its opening drive of the third quarter and grabbed a 21-20 lead on Daniel HIll's touchdown. The Tide looked like they had answers coming out of halftime.\nThen Oklahoma slammed the door.The Sooners held Alabama to 15 total yards on the next three possessions, including a drive-ending sack and fumble. When Alabama mounted one final push from its own 4-yard line midway through the fourth quarter, Kip Lewis buried a crucial 11-yard sack as Alabama tried to push across midfield. Three snaps later, a last-ditch throw skipped harmlessly short of Ryan Williams as Peyton Bowen closed in.This wasn't your typical blueprint, but the Sooners again proved defense is not only important, it's paramount in heavyweight fights. Venables' pressure packages, even without star players, harkened to his championship game plans as Clemson's defensive coordinator in the mid-2010s. \nThe Sooners now share the national lead in wins over AP-ranked opponents -- tied, fittingly, with Alabama.The Tide may still win the SEC title, but their playoff odds look no better than Oklahoma's.

Among the most intriguing pits the Seattle Seahawks (7-2) against the Los Angeles Rams (7-2) with first place in the NFC West on the line. Another huge matchup has the nine-time defending AFC West-champion Kansas City Chiefs (5-4) battling the Denver Broncos (8-2), who hold the top spot in the division.

    "body": "\n        There is a lot of meat on the bone in Week 11. No matter which way you look, you'll be able to find an intriguing matchup, making this one of the more compelling slates of the entire regular season. Just looking at Sunday's collection of games, there are seven divisional matchups, which include the heavyweight showdown between the Rams and Seahawks at SoFi Stadium. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers are heading up to Buffalo to take on the Bills, and the Lions and Eagles wrap things up on Sunday night from Philly. When you also factor in that we have our final international game of the season with the Commanders and Dolphins duking it out from Madrid, Spain, we have a long day ahead of ourselves. Before we get kickoff for what is promised to be another wild wee in the NFL, let's make sure you're situated with your bets. Below, you can find our best bets for the Week 11 slate along with picks for every other contest. Teams on bye in Week 11: Indianapolis and New Orleans.  NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

On the one hand, the Eagles are 7-2 and atop the NFC as the projected No. 1 seed entering Week 11. On the other hand, however, they are still clunky on offense and are coming off an ugly win over Green Bay. Saquon Barkley (3.9 yards per carry in 2025) hasn't been as efficient as he was a year ago, and the Lions are a solid run defense, which could continue to slow down the Eagles offense. Defensively, Philly was able to shut the Packers down. While I do think the addition of pass rusher Jaelan Phillips will be big for them down the stretch, I have questions about whether or not it'll be enough in this matchup vs. Detroit. After all, the Packers were still finding their way without Tucker Kraft in the fold, and also didn't have first-round rookie receiver Matthew Golden either. The Lions present far more players to account for at the skill positions, including Jahmyr Gibbs. Backing the Lions in prime time is always a good way to lean as they are 13-2 straight up over the last four seasons when under the prime-time lights. Detroit is also 12-6 ATS as an underdog over the last four seasons. \nProjected score: Lions 27, Eagles 24The pick: Lions +2.5Washington Commanders at Miami Dolphins (in Spain)Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET (NFL Network | Fubo, try for free)\nI don't like the spot here for Miami, and that's the primary driver in picking Washington here. The Dolphins are coming off their biggest win of the season on Sunday as they upset the Buffalo Bills at Hard Rock Stadium. While that was an impressive victory, this is still one of the worst teams in the NFL and could be due for a letdown, particularly as they head internationally to Spain for this matchup. It's hard to imagine they'll play with the same vigor. As for the Commanders, they'll again be without Jayden Daniels and Terry McLaurin, but I think Marcus Mariota is a backup quarterback capable of leading his team to an upset win, particularly against a defense that is giving up 25.6 points per game (ninth-highest in the NFL) and is tied for the fourth-highest yards per play allowed (5.9). I'm also curious to see if Dan Quinn taking over play-calling duties on defense will spark that side of the ball. It's also worth noting that the Dolphins are 1-5 straight up and against the spread in their last six games following a win. \nProjected score: Commanders 24, Dolphins 21The pick: Commanders +2.5\n        \n            \n                Pete Prisco's Week 11 NFL picks: Seahawks upset Rams in NFC West showdown; Chiefs get a must-win vs. Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSeattle Seahawks at Los Angeles RamsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nI don't think I've been as excited for a game this season as I am for Seahawks-Rams on Sunday. It feels like a potential NFC Championship preview between two rivals, who are both 7-2 and knotted atop the NFC West. Both Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold are playing at an MVP level, and each club boasts stout defenses, so this is truly a heavyweight battle. But there can only be one winner, and I'm planting my flag with Seattle. I certainly love taking them with the points, slipping a field goal in my pocket in a game where the margin is razor-thin. That said, I also like them to pull off the upset. The Seahawks have shown us this season that road environments don't faze them, coming into Week 11 with a perfect 4-0 ATS and SU road record. They are also extremely balanced on both sides of the ball when they have their foot on the gas. Seattle has the best points per game differential (+14.2) in the first three quarters since the 2007 New England Patriots. Projected score: Seahawks 24, Rams 21The pick: Seahawks +3Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo BillsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)\nEach of these clubs is coming off losses in Week 10, but Buffalo's was more dire. After losing to the Dolphins, they've fallen further behind in the division standings, while the Bucs still are in first place in the NFC South and have been missing key figures on offense. I think Buffalo will throw the kitchen sink at this matchup to right the ship at home, but it'll be close, and I expect Tampa Bay to keep it within the number. That is largely due to the looming return of Bucky Irving. If he suits up, it's a great spot for him to burst back onto the scene. The Bills are giving up 5.5 yards per rush this season, which is tied for the league high. If the Bucs can dominate on the ground, it'll keep them within range. \nTampa Bay is also 2-0 following a loss this season, and Baker Mayfield is 17-8 ATS as an underdog since joining the Buccaneers in 2023. Projected score: Bills 27, Buccaneers 23The pick: Buccaneers +5.5Rest of the bunchPanthers at FalconsProjected score: Panthers 23, Falcons 21The pick: Panthers +3.5Bears at VikingsProjected score: Vikings 24, Bears 20The pick: Vikings -2.5Bengals at SteelersProjected score: Steelers 30, Bengals 27The pick: Bengals +5.5\nPackers at GiantsProjected score: Packers 27, Giants 17The pick: Packers -7.5Texans at TitansProjected score: Texans 24, Titans 14The pick: Texans -5.5Chargers at JaguarsProjected score: Chargers 24, Jaguars 20The pick: Chargers -349ers at CardinalsProjected score: Cardinals 24, 49ers 23The pick: Cardinals +3Ravens at BrownsProjected score: Ravens 28, Browns 17The pick: Ravens -7.5Chiefs at BroncosProjected score: Chiefs 24, Broncos 20The pick: Chiefs -3.5Cowboys at Raiders (Monday)Projected score: Cowboys 28, Raiders 24The pick: Cowboys -3.5\n            ",

The Patriots have played well on offense with Drake Maye, and much of the media focus has been there, but the defense needs to be getting more attention for how well that unit has played. That matters against an anemic Jets offense. Pats will keep rolling. Pick: Patriots 30, Jets 10 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookWashington Commanders at Miami Dolphins (-2.5) (in Spain)Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET on NFLN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Commanders will once again start Marcus Mariota at quarterback for the injured Jayden Daniels. But the big problem is the defense. They don't cover, tackle or rush the passer. The Miami offense played well against the Bills last week and I look for that to carry over here. Look for De'Von Achane to again have a big day.

The Panthers have trouble throwing the football, which will be a challenge here. The Panthers need more from Bryce Young, but I don't think they get it. Falcons win it. Pick: Falcons 24, Panthers 17 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookChicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Vikings need to get their offense going with J.J. McCarthy in this one. The Bears are 6-3 and have played well on offense, but the defense has been leaky at times. I also think the Vikings' pass rush and blitzes will impact Caleb Williams into turnovers. Vikings take it. Pick: Vikings 27, Bears 20 | Odds via BetMGMCincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Bengals are off a bye, while the Steelers are coming off a road loss Sunday night to the Chargers.

Stroud back for this one against a Titans team coming off a bye. The Titans have major offensive issues and the Texans defense is No. 1 in the league. That's trouble. But something says the Titans stay around in this game with the Texans offense mustering little on the other side. The Texans will win a close one.Pick: Texans 23, Titans 19 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookLos Angeles Chargers (-3) at Jacksonville JaguarsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)This is a long trip for the Chargers after a Sunday night game, but they are getting a Jaguars team coming off a demoralizing loss last week to the Texans. How will they respond? I look for Justin Herbert to have a good day against a team that doesn't rush the passer or excel in coverage. Chargers win it.Pick: Chargers 27, Jaguars 20 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)This a big game for both teams, but much bigger for the Bills. They looked awful in losing to Miami last week. The Bucs might be going into a game against a team that is desperate to get a win. Josh Allen didn't play well last week. He will in this one. Bills take it. Pick: Bills 30, Buccaneers 23 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (+3) at Los Angeles RamsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)This is the game of the week. Both teams have a real shot to be the top seed in the NFC. Both teams can throw it deep and both teams can rush the passer. Matthew Stafford has been on fire, but this Seattle defense is special. They will get after him and that will be the difference in the game, with the short fields from turnovers leading to Seahawks points. Seattle wins in an upset.   Pick: Seahawks 24, Rams 23 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSan Francisco 49ers (-2.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)These two suffered bad losses this past weekend, giving up over 40 points each. The Cardinals will start Jacoby Brissett again at quarterback, while it should be Mac Jones again for the 49ers. Look for Jones to get it to Christian McCaffrey a bunch, both as a runner and receiver, to find a way to win it. Pick: 49ers 30, Cardinals 24 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookBaltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns (+8)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Ravens have come to life with Lamar Jackson back, but they are playing consecutive road games. It won't matter. The Browns have a good defense, but the offense is limited. The Ravens and Jackson will win it, but it's close thanks to the Cleveland defense. Pick: Ravens 22, Browns 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookKansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)The Chiefs are coming off a bye and Andy Reid's teams are great off the bye. The Broncos are rested having played last Thursday. Their offense is an issue right now with Bo Nix struggling. Look for the Chiefs defense to limit him and Patrick Mahomes will do enough to win it. Pick: Chiefs 23, Broncos 17 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDetroit Lions at Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)The Lions are playing consecutive road games, while the Eagles are playing on a short week. That kind of cancels them out. The Eagles have had trouble scoring, while the Lions rolled up big numbers last week. But at home, look for the Eagles defense to slow down the Lions, while the Eagles get their offense going for the win.          Pick: Eagles 31, Lions 27 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookDallas Cowboys (-3.5) at Las Vegas RaidersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)This is a bad Monday night game, but it features two national teams with a high profile. That matters to the networks. The Cowboys made some improvements to the defense at the trade deadline, which will help that unit make some strides in the right direction. The Dallas offense can score. The Raiders offense has issues, which will again show up. Look for the Cowboys to win it behind Dak Prescott.Pick: Cowboys 31, Raiders 20 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know. It's clear that anytime touchdown wagers have become a popular bet among gamblers these days. Whether you're trying to string together a few touchdown scorers for the group-chat parlay or looking for a long shot, it's fun to bet on the chosen few who find pay dirt on Sunday.Last week, Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams rushed in a game-winning touchdown, Parker Washington of the Jacksonville Jaguars found the end zone twice, once as a receiver and once on special teams, and Seattle Seahawks defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence scored TWO touchdowns! He became the first defensive lineman in the Super Bowl era to return two fumbles for touchdowns in the same game. Imagine if you bet on the Seahawks defense to score multiple touchdowns vs. the Arizona Cardinals.It's possible Week 11 could be the best week of the 2025 NFL regular season. Joe Flacco and Aaron Rodgers look to engage in another shootout, two of the top teams in the NFC face off with the Seahawks at Los Angeles Rams and the Detroit Lions travel to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 11. These will not be predictable choices like Derrick Henry or Jahmyr Gibbs, but they won't be wild long-shots such as the Seahawks defense. Let's begin with the NFL game being played in Madrid. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:1. WR Jaylen Waddle, Miami Dolphins (+105)\nIf it weren't for the Dallas Cowboys or Cincinnati Bengals, I would nominate the Washington Commanders for having the worst defense in the NFL. Riding high following their upset victory over the Buffalo Bills, Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins now get a chance to take advantage of a short-handed secondary. Jaylen Waddle has recorded 80 yards receiving in three straight games, and is averaging 14.6 yards per reception. He's caught a touchdown in two out of the past three games, and I think this matchup is a great one for him. If you're curious, De'Von Achane, who scores more often than not, is listed at -175. 2. RB Kareem Hunt, Kansas City Chiefs (+105)\nIsiah Pacheco is going to miss another game due to his MCL sprain, meaning Kareem Hunt is going to be the lead back again. He rushed 11 times for 49 yards and a touchdown in Kansas City's last outing vs. the Bills, and scored two touchdowns vs. Washington the game before that. 3. TE Theo Johnson, New York Giants (+230)\nTheo Johnson has seen at least six targets in each of the past two games, and caught seven of eight targets last week vs. the Bears. Jameis Winston is going to start in place of the injured Jaxson Dart, so we don't exactly know who Winston's favorite targets are, but I'll take a flier on the tight end that interim coach Mike Kafka clearly values. 4. QB Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles (+120)\nJalen Hurts hasn't scored a rushing touchdown since Oct. 9. He's due, right? Hurts scored rushing touchdowns in 10 games played last season. Lions coach Dan Campbell defended the Eagles' tush push this week, labeling himself a \"purist\" that doesn't want to see the play outlawed. It would be ironic to see Hurts score on the tush push vs. Detroit. 5. WR Cooper Kupp, Seattle Seahawks (+400)\nCooper Kupp has caught one touchdown all season, and enters Week 11 ranked 61st in receiving yards. However, he's playing his former team this week. Kupp left L.A. as the franchise's No. 4 all-time leading receiver with 7,776 yards, and ranks No. 3 in receptions (634) and receiving touchdowns (57). Back in 2021, he won the receiving triple crown with 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns. At +400 in a revenge game, this is good value. Sam Darnold finds Kupp for a short touchdown.\n            ",

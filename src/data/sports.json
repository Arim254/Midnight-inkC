The first big game came during the early slate with the Buccaneers traveling to Buffalo for a huge matchup with the Bills and the game actually lived up to the hype. The Bills escaped with a 44-32 win -- a SCORIGAMI -- thanks in large part to a super human performance from Josh Allen. The Bills QB threw for three touchdowns and ran for three touchdowns. Although the Bills won by 12 points, there were nine lead changes, which is tied for the second-most in a game in NFL historyAllen now has 75 rushing touchdowns in his career, which is tied with Cam Newton for the most in NFL history by a QB. In another early showdown, the Jaguars handed Jim Harbaugh the worst loss of his NFL career by beating the Chargers, 35-6. In late afternoon games, the Denver Broncos delivered a gut punch to the Chiefs' division title chances by knocking off Kansas City, 22-19. The biggest difference between the two teams is that the Broncos have been clutch this year and the Chiefs haven't.The Broncos are 7-2 in one-score games, which is the most wins by any team in the NFL this year. The Chiefs are 0-5 in one-score games, which is the worst record in the league. It's also surprising when you consider that Kansas City went 12-0 in one-score games last year. The Los Angeles Rams also picked up a huge victory with a 21-19 win over the Seattle Seahawks. In the Sunday night game, the Eagles capped off the day of showdowns with a dominant 16-9 win over the Lions. \nSo what kind of grade do you get when you hold one of the best offenses in the NFL to under 10 points? Let's get to the grades, starting with Philly's win over Detroit. Philadelphia 16-9 over DetroitBuffalo 44-32 over Tampa BayDenver 22-19 over Kansas CityL.A.

    "body": "\n        Week 11 in the NFL had no shortage of drama, as many of the early games went down to the wire. Out of the gate, the Sunday slate opened up with a back-and-forth affair between the Dolphins and Commanders from Madrid, which required overtime to make Miami the winner. And as we migrated to the early afternoon slate, one-possession games were a theme throughout. The Bears and Texans notched another win in the column thanks to last-second field goals, and the Packers narrowly escaped New York with a victory against the Jameis Winston-led Giants. There was plenty to digest throughout the Sunday slate, and there's a plethora of storylines bursting from all this action. But let's sift through some of those main storylines and decipher which we should take seriously and the other with grains of salt, as they don't mean as much as they may seem. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 11 grades: Josh Allen wills the Bills to an 'A-,' Broncos earn 'B+' for upset win over Chiefs\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDolphins are back in the AFC playoff conversationOverreaction or reality: OverreactionMiami enters its Week 12 bye on a high note. The club has won three of its last four games to move to 4-7 on the season. While that has somewhat righted the ship and cooled the seat under coach Mike McDaniel, this recent surge isn't going to thrust them back into the playoffs. This positive run could continue out of the bye with matchups against the Saints and Jets (road) in Week 13 and Week 14, but the schedule gets much tougher after that. Assuming they take care of business in those two games and claw to 6-7, the final month will make it difficult for them to get to or exceed .500. They take on the Steelers in Pittsburgh on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 15 before back-to-back home games against the Bengals (likely with Joe Burrow back at quarterback) and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Then, they wrap up the year in New England against the Patriots. Miami likely won't be favored in any of those final four games, so this recent upward swing may come in vain with a knockout blow over the final four weeks.\nChargers at risk of missing the playoffsOverreaction or reality: RealityThat was a rough showing by the Chargers, who were blown out by the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, 35-6. Justin Herbert continues to take his fair share of hits, but the quarterback also laid an egg. He completed 10 of his 18 passes for just 81 yards and an interception. This loss now drops the Chargers to 7-4 on the year, and doesn't do them any favors in the playoff race. They've lost a key head-to-head tiebreaker to Jacksonville (6-4) in the wild card race and still have a daunting schedule in front of them following the Week 12 bye.WeekOpponentWeek 12BYE WEEKWeek 13vs. Las Vegas RaidersWeek 14vs. Philadelphia EaglesWeek 15at Kansas City ChiefsWeek 16at Dallas CowboysWeek 17vs. Houston TexansWeek 18at Denver BroncosThe following three opponents for Los Angeles each boast a strong pass rush, which could further exploit the Chargers' weakness at protecting Herbert. After seeing the offense go silent with him under siege again on Sunday against Jacksonville, their footing in the AFC playoff picture doesn't feel secure.  Vikings should bench J.J. McCarthyOverreaction or reality: OverreactionOverall, McCarthy wasn't good against Chicago, even as the Vikings nearly pulled off another fourth-quarter comeback against their division rival. McCarthy completed just 16 of his 32 passes for 150 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions. So far, McCarthy has eight interceptions in five career starts and is the first quarterback to record an interception in five straight games to begin his career since Zach Wilson in 2021. Not exactly the company you want to keep in the NFL record books. But does this take us to the point where Minnesota should bench McCarthy? That feels a touch too far, at least right now. The Vikings used a first-round pick on McCarthy in 2024 and moved off of Sam Darnold this offseason to see that selection through. Five total starts is too small a sample size to move off of him and effectively give up hope that he's their franchise quarterback going forward. It hasn't looked great, but the organization needs to grit through and give McCarthy the rest of the season before making any long-term proclamations. Packers are not a serious Super Bowl threatOverreaction or reality: RealityGreen Bay once again played down to its competition. While it didn't result in a loss this time around, the Packers needed a go-ahead touchdown drive and two-point conversion to fend off the New York Giants. Remember, this is a Giants team that had just fired its coach, and their budding star at quarterback, Jaxson Dart, was out with a concussion. Despite that lopsided talent disparity, Green Bay allowed the Jameis Winston-led Giants to post 336 yards of total offense. New York edged out the Packers in total yards and time of possession in Week 11. Again, this is a Giants squad that is going to be in contention for the No. 1 overall pick. When you pair this performance (albeit in a winning effort) with earlier losses this season to the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, it's hard to look at the Packers as a serious Super Bowl threat in the NFC at the moment. Dave Canales is off the hot seatOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Carolina Panthers (6-5) are back above .500 with a dramatic overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. The club completed the season sweep of their division rival and is second in the NFC South, just a game behind the Buccaneers in the loss column (6-4). Carolina has been one of the surprise teams of the 2025 season, and Dave Canales has been getting the most out of his roster, particularly with quarterback Bryce Young. All of that has cooled what had previously been one of the hotter seats in the NFL. However, has Canales taken himself off the hot seat entirely? Not yet. The road in front of the Panthers is very difficult as they face the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams over the next two weeks before their Week 14 bye. Over the final month, they have two divisional matchups against the Buccaneers and a contest against the Seattle Seahawks. That rough schedule in the second half could end the 2025 campaign on a low note, leaving questions about Canales' future despite this positive run at the moment. Shedeur Sanders is not a starting-caliber QBOverreaction or reality: RealityI think we saw a brief window into why Kevin Stefanski hasn't been chomping at the bit to see Shedeur Sanders under center. While coming in under duress following Dillon Gabriel's concussion isn't exactly the cleanest debut, Sanders didn't exactly rise to the occasion either. The game looked fast for him as he completed just four of his 16 pass attempts for 47 yards, an interception, and was sacked twice. He may get the starting nod next week if Gabriel can't clear protocol, but Sanders didn't do much in this showing to embolden those who believe he's a starting-caliber NFL quarterback. Sam Darnold has turned into a pumpkinOverreaction or reality: OverreactionFour interceptions. Yuck. It was a horrendous showing by Sam Darnold, who registered the third game of four-plus interceptions of his career and the first since his infamous \"Seeing Ghosts\" game with the Jets in 2019. Despite his remarkable resurgence over the last two years, Darnold's 30 turnovers since 2024 are the most in the NFL, so seeing his game deteriorate like we did on Sunday is concerning. Does that mean he's totally turned into a pumpkin, though? I don't think we should go that far. Darnold has been one of the better quarterbacks in the league this season, but was going up against one of the top defenses in the league in the Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay also seems to have his number, as they were able to shut him down during Wild Card Weekend last season as well. May just chalk this up to a bad performance against a team that's a bad matchup for him, rather than this being the first sign of Seattle's playoff hopes evaporating. 49ers are in play for the No. 1 seed in the NFCOverreaction or reality: RealityWelcome back, Brock Purdy! With their franchise quarterback reinstalled under center after missing the bulk of the season with a toe injury, San Francisco dropped a season-high 41 points en route to a blowout win over the Cardinals. The Niners are now 7-4 on the season and in a prime position to push for a playoff spot. In fact, there's a path for this team to pile up enough wins down the stretch to threaten for the No. 1 seed. The next two weeks include a home matchup against the Carolina Panthers (currently a touchdown favorite) and a road contest with the Cleveland Browns, which could realistically see them with a 9-4 record entering the Week 14 bye. After that, three of their final four games are at home, with their final road contest coming in Week 16 at Indianapolis. Outside of that matchup, they host Tennessee (Week 15), Chicago (Week 17), and Seattle (Week 18). Even if they go .500 over that final month, you're looking at an 11-6 record, which could be good enough, especially as they currently have the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 record after Week 11) over the NFC West-leading Rams (2-1) and a stellar 7-2 conference record (another key tiebreaker). Chiefs hopes of winning AFC West are dashedOverreaction or reality: Reality\nKansas City's bid for 10-straight AFC West titles is on life support. With Sunday's loss to the Broncos, the Chiefs not only dropped back down to .500 on the season at 5-5, but Denver has extended its lead in the division by a sizable amount. At 9-2, they are two games up on the Chargers and three games up over K.C. in the loss column. That's not even accounting for the current head-to-head tiebreaker advantage they earned in Week 11. The road doesn't get easier for the Chiefs either, as they'll now have to host a Colts team that'll be fresh off its bye week before turning around and visiting the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. It would require a herculean effort by Patrick Mahomes and Co. and an utter collapse by the Broncos to even make their final matchup in Week 17 carry any sort of weight in this division race. Detroit's offense is brokenOverreaction or reality: OverreactionIt was an awful showing by the Lions offense on Sunday night in Philadelphia. The unit mustered just nine points, failed to convert any of its five fourth-down opportunities, and Jared Goff was spooked from the jump. The Detroit QB completed just 14 of his 37 passes for a career-low 38% completion rate. Specifically, he finished the game, completing just two of his final 18 attempts. Gross. While Goff and the offense certainly deserve a big slice of the blame pie for their loss, that would also discredit Philadelphia for having one of the best defenses in the NFL. The Eagles defense came into this matchup after putting Green Bay in a similar blender in Week 10, so this could speak more to Philly's unit than any big-picture problem with Detroit's offense.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NWSL Championship matchup is set, and it will be Gotham FC and the Washington Spirit next Saturday night for the title, which will take place at San Jose's PayPal Park. The match kicks off at 8 p.m. and will be broadcast on CBS and Paramount+.The last four NWSL champions -- the Orlando Pride, Gotham FC, Portland Thorns and Washington Spirit -- made it to the penultimate round of the NWSL playoffs to duke it out for the league's top prize, which set up the wild weekend that was. Gotham got a late free kick golazo from Jaedyn Shaw to top the Orlando Pride.In the first of the semifinal battles, it was the Spirit who kept their title dreams alive, winning 2-0 over the Thorns thanks to goals from Gift Monday and Croix Bethune. In an added bonus for the D.C. side, superstar Trinity Rodman returned to the field as a late substitute in the second half, marking her first minutes played since an MCL injury threatened to end her season early. Those minutes, plus however long she manages to play in the final, could mark the last time she suits up for the Spirit, as Rodman's contract winds down at the end of the season.   In the quarters, the victories were just as crazy. The Pride notched a 2-0 over the Seattle Reign in regular time, but the other three quarterfinals all went to extra time in closely contested matches. The Thorns notched a 1-0 win over the San Diego Wave, while the Spirit needed a penalty shootout to beat postseason first-timers Racing Louisville.The most stunning result of the quarterfinals, though, was Gotham's upset win over the Kansas City Current. The Current were arguably the favorites to win the NWSL Championship for the first time in club history after winning the Shield and ending the regular season with a 21-point advantage over second place. A last-gasp winner from Katie Stengel in the 121st minute, though, ensured the Current's playoff run would end as soon as it started.2025 NWSL Playoffs bracket\n2025 NWSL Playoffs scheduleAll times U.S./EasternQuarterfinalsFriday, Nov. 7Orlando Pride 1, Seattle Reign 0Saturday, Nov. 8Washington Spirit 1, Racing Louisville 1 (Spirit win on PKs, 3-1)Sunday, Nov. 9Gotham FC 2, Kansas City Current 1Portland Thorns 1, San Diego Wave 0SemifinalsSaturday, Nov. 15Washington Spirit 2, Portland Thorns 0Sunday, Nov. 16Gotham FC 1, Orlando Pride 0FinalSaturday, Nov. 22Gotham FC vs. Orlando Pride, 8 p.m. (CBS.

If finalized, it will be the first major free-agent signing of the offseason.Naylor, 28, is coming off a 2025 season in which he slashed .295/.353/.462 in a combined 147 games for the Diamondbacks and Mariners. Seattle acquired Naylor from Arizona leading up to the trade deadline. After the trade, Naylor had an OPS+ of 138 in 54 regular-season games for the Mariners en route to their winning the American League West title for the first time since 2001. Naylor in the ALCS batted .417 with three home runs. The Mariners lost that series in seven games to the Toronto Blue Jays.Naylor in 2024 as a member of the Guardians earned his first and thus far only All-Star selection. For his career, he owns an OPS+ of 116 with a WAR of 8.4 over parts of seven MLB seasons. \nComing into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Naylor as the No. 23 available free agent in the class. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: To oppose Naylor is to grow weary of his excitable, borderline vexatious qualities. To embrace him is to grow appreciative of his skilled offensive game, particularly against righties. Naylor has a knack for squaring up the ball that, when combined with his strength and pull-and-lift tendencies, enables him to launch 20ish home runs annually. It's to be seen if his next employer lets him run as freely as the Mariners did, but even if not he should remain a worthy most-days option at the cold corner. Seattle this winter is aiming for as much roster continuity as possible as they remain in contending mode. \"Same goals, same priorities,\" general manager Justin Hollander told reporters at the recent GM meetings in Las Vegas. \"I think No. 1 for us is ideally keeping as much of the group that we had last year, that we really believed in, together. And then filling in the rest of the roster as required. Our offseason is largely going to start with the guys who were on the team last year and try to bring as many back as possible.\"\nWith Naylor now back in the fold, the M's may turn their attention to their two remaining notable free agents, third baseman Eugenio Suárez and infielder Jorge Polanco. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Following a Week 10 slate in the NFL that felt as though it were straight out of an alternate dimension, the league had more chalky results in Week 11. Miami's performance over the past two weeks may be working the franchise out of quarterback range if it elects to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins' latest victory came at the expense of Washington, which is back in top 10 overall projection after a trip to the NFC Championship game. Looking ahead, there are two games involving opponents currently in position to pick in the top 10: Browns at Raiders and Falcons at Saints -- the latter being the first of two meetings between the teams this season. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.\nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:1. Tennessee Titans (1-9)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee scored a touchdown late to push Houston to the brink of overtime, but Davis Mills executed a drive that set up a last-second game-winning field goal. The Titans remain the league's only one-win team. 2. New York Giants (2-9)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTJameis Winston brought some much-needed energy after losing Jaxson Dart to a concussion. New York had an early lead and didn't go down without a fight, but ultimately succumbed to the Packers. \n3. Cleveland Browns (2-8)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland's defense did everything in its power to give the team a chance to win this game, but the offense was limited with Dillon Gabriel and even more so when Shedeur Sanders was forced into action. A meaningful game, in relation to the draft order, against the Raiders is on the docket for next week. 4. New Orleans Saints (2-8)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans was on a bye this week after winning in Week 10. 5. New York Jets (2-8)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEJustin Fields and the Jets jumped out to an early lead on Thursday Night Football, but the Patriots eventually pulled away.6. Las Vegas Raiders (2-7)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas will host the Cowboys on \"Monday Night Football.\" Neither team has more than three wins on the year. \n7. Washington Commanders (3-8)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRIt was Marcus Mariota under center for the Commanders in Spain. They continue to fall out of the playoff picture a year after appearing in the NFC Championship Game. 8. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (3-7)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles' pick from Atlanta continues to rise as the Falcons suffered an overtime loss to the Panthers on Sunday.9. Cincinnati Bengals (3-7)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati was without Joe Burrow, but Pittsburgh would be without Aaron Rodgers by the end of the afternoon. Burrow is slated to make his anticipated return on Thanksgiving or shortly thereafter, but the Bengals may be too far out of the hunt.\n10. Arizona Cardinals (3-7)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBJacoby Brissett completed an NFL-record 47 passes on Sunday against the 49ers to little avail. San Francisco nearly doubled them up at home.11. Miami Dolphins (4-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami has won back-to-back games for the first time this season. Once perceived to be dead in the water, the Dolphins have life in the wake of general manager Chris Grier's dismissal. 12. Dallas Cowboys (3-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDefensive tackle Quinnen Williams will make his Dallas debut on Monday night against the Raiders. \n13. Minnesota Vikings (4-6)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy and Caleb Williams each completed exactly 50% of their pass attempts Sunday. McCarthy led a late scoring drive to take the lead, but the Vikings defense surrendered a late scoring drive of their own.14. Baltimore Ravens (5-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBCleveland played Baltimore close but was swept by its division rival in the regular season. Baltimore has now worked its way back to .500 after starting the season 1-5.15. Kansas City Chiefs (5-5)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TETravis Kelce willed his way into the end zone late against Denver, but the Broncos responded with a last-second field goal to win the game.\n16. Houston Texans (5-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe Texans are back to .500 on the season having won three of their past four games. Davis Mills was once again at quarterback, and Houston needed a last-second field goal to escape the Titans. 17. Carolina Panthers (6-5)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina needed a late touchdown from Bryce Young to Tetairoa McMillan to send the game into overtime. There, the Panthers kicked a field goal to secure their fifth win over the past seven.18. Detroit Lions (6-4)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit drops to third in the NFC North after getting shut down by the Eagles on \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe AFC East has been unkind to Tampa Bay over the past two weeks. The Buccaneers went 0-2 after being competitive in both games. 20. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (6-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville's game against Los Angeles was important to its playoff odds. The Jaguars scored early and continued to pile on for a convincing, morale-building victory.21. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-4)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLTight end Darnell Washington and the Steelers offense ran through a vulnerable Cincinnati defense. It was an important win for Pittsburgh knowing that Baltimore is gaining in the rearview mirror. \n22. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers were a no-show in what amounted to a midseason playoff game. The offensive line has been ravaged by injuries, but the franchise has to find a way to pull out some wins.23. San Francisco 49ers (7-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEBrock Purdy returned to the starting lineup for Kyle Shanahan's offense, but it was the George Kittle show. The veteran tight end had two touchdowns against division rival Arizona.  24. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (6-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBMalik Willis had to come into the game for Jordan Love at one point against a Giants team that was also without its starting quarterback. Jordan Love was able to play most of this game, but it was a rushing attack by committee that pushed Green Bay over the top. \n25. Chicago Bears (7-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTIt was not exactly an explosive day for either offense, but the Bears continue to win games they would have found a way to lose in the past.   26. Buffalo Bills (7-3)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo's game against Tampa Bay was much closer than the final score suggested. After going back and forth for most of the afternoon, the Bills put their foot on the gas late to salt away a two-score win. 27. Seattle Seahawks (7-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRMatthew Stafford did not need to do much for the Rams because Sam Darnold did all the work for them. Darnold had his worst day as a Seahawk by throwing four interceptions. 28. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-2)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLIndianapolis must be feeling good about itself sitting at 8-2 during its bye week.29. Los Angeles Rams (8-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLKyren Williams nearly had as many rushing yards as Matthew Stafford had passing, but the Rams didn't need to do much more than protect the football against Seattle. 30. New England Patriots (9-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye and the Patriots continue to take care of business against lesser foes. An easy schedule continues the rest of the season.31. Philadelphia Eagles (8-2)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia retains the No. 1 seed in the NFC over the Rams with a dominating defensive effort against Detroit.32. Denver Broncos (9-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTIt has not always been pretty for the Broncos this season, but they have positioned themselves as well as any other team in the AFC. Sunday's win over Kansas City was important from a narrative perspective in addition to the pecking order in the AFC West.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        NFC teams vying for the top seed in the conference meet when the Detroit Lions take on the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The Lions (6-3) lead the NFC North, while the Eagles (7-2) have a 3.5-game bulge in the  NFC East standings over the Dallas Cowboys. The game will feature Lions quarterback Jared Goff against Eagles signal caller Jalen Hurts. Both players figure into several NFL player props or a Sunday Night Football SGP. Detroit tight end, Sam LaPorta (back), is out as he was recently placed on injured reserve.Goff has played at a high level all season, completing 74% of his passes for 2,235 yards and 20 touchdowns. Hurts, meanwhile, has been equally as impressive. In nine games, he has completed 68.9% of his passes for 1,860 yards and 16 touchdowns.

    "body": "\n        In Week 11, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 12 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Sean Tucker, RB, BuccaneersTucker has flashed with the Buccaneers during his short career in Tampa but he has been buried on the depth chart behind Bucky Irving and Rachaad White. With Irving still unable to suit up on gameday, Tucker has taken a considerably larger role in the backfield. In Week 11, Tucker broke out with 106 rushing yards on 19 carries. He had two rushing touchdowns including a long 40-plus explosive touchdown run. Tucker also added two receptions for 34 yards and caught a touchdown. A three touchdown performance should lock in some kind of role even once Irving returns to the lineup. However, for as long as Irving is out, it's clear the Buccaneers have turned to Tucker as their lead back over White. In an offense this potent -- one of Fantasy's highest scoring and most consistent -- that's a valuable every-week Fantasy starter. Once Irving comes back, he'll be relegated to a desperation FLEX. Enjoy it while it lasts.Michael Wilson, WR, CardinalsWith Marvin Harrison ruled out for Week 11, Wilson was expected to take over as the defacto first read in the passing game. No one could've expected these kind of numbers, however. Wilson went off for a career-high 170 receiving yards on 13 receptions. He was targeted a whopping 15 times. Now let's establish the context. The Cardinals were trailing in this game by multiple scores for almost the entire game. They were throwing early and often. Not every game will feature this kind of volume for Wilson, but it's clear Arizona is a more consistent dropback passing team when Jacoby Brissett is at quarterback. The expectation is that Harrison may miss another week after undergoing surgery for appendicitis. This is not guaranteed. For as long as Harrison is out, Wilson should serve as a locked-in WR2 with obvious weekly upside. Tyrell Shavers, WR, BillsKeon Coleman was made a surprise healthy inactive by the Bills for Week 11. Later, we found out this was due to disciplinary reasons. Coleman's role in the offense moving forward remains uncertain, but his absence allowed for Shavers to break out in week 11. Shavers caught four passes for 90 yards and a touchdown on five targets in a wild shootout. His production moving forward should be hard to predict and uncertain. He is best left on waiver wires. Emanuel Wilson, RB, Packers Wilson was less of a breakout and more of an immediate waiver wire alert after Josh Jacobs got injured during Green Bay's Week 11 win over the Giants. Jacobs got hurt early, tried to return and then left the game for good. Wilson finished with 11 carries for 40 yards and a rushing touchdown. He also added a reception for nine yards on his lone target. More importantly, Wilson operated in a workhorse role once Jacobs left the game. If Jacobs is forced to miss any time, Wilson could immediately operated as a borderline RB1 in Fantasy lineups. \nIsaiah Hodgins, WR, Giants Fans of the Giants are left pondering why this move didn't happen sooner, but Hodgins immediately resumed his role as the lead possession receiver for New York in Week 12 with Darius Slayton sidelined. Hodgins had a run with the Giants back in 2022 and knows the offensive system inside out. He immediately operated in a starter role. If Slayton is forced to miss more time, Hodgins could operated as a back-end WR3/FLEX.Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JaguarsTuten finally cashed in on his rookie promise with a big Week 11. Tuten racked up 74 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the red zone. More importantly, he operated as a 1B to Travis Etienne's 1A in the Jaguars backfield. Tuten could have some back-end RB2 upside running behind a rush scheme that has found success under head coach Liam Coen.Xavier Legette, WR, Panthers Legette continues to operate as Bryce Young's donwfield threat with four receptions for 83 yards and a highlight-reel touchdown. What's more important is that he racked up eight targets in this game. Legette's volume and TD upside make him a back-end WR3 option. \nDevin Singletary, RB, Giants Singletary is operating as the 1B in the Giants backfield but for Fantasy Football purposes he might as well be the 1A. Singletary is the preferred option in the red zone and he is cashing in on his red zone opportunities. Singletary scored two touchdowns in Week 11 for the Giants in addition to 47 total yards. \n            ",

The Chiefs tight end scored his 84th career touchdown -- passing Priest Holmes for most in franchise history -- with a go-ahead 21-yard touchdown catch from Patrick Mahomes in Week 11 against the Broncos.\nKelce, 36, tied Holmes in Week 8 against the Commanders, reeling in a 10-yard pass from Mahomes. That was also Kelce's 100th career touchdown scored including his 17 postseason touchdowns, but records (unless stated otherwise) only take regular-season stats into account.\nKelce, who has spent his entire 13-year career with Kansas City, already held the franchise records for receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. However, adding in two rushing touchdowns and a fumble recovered for a touchdown, his 84 total touchdowns scored are now a franchise best as well.Most touchdowns scored, Chiefs historyTravis Kelce84Priest Holmes83Tony Gonzalez76Tyreek Hill67Jamaal Charles64Even though he no longer holds the record, Holmes' mark is truly incredible considering he only played 65 games with the franchise considering he started his career with the Ravens and had his career cut short due to a spine/neck/head injury.\nKelce's record is a testament to not only his skill but his longevity. He has had at least three touchdown receptions all of his NFL seasons except his rookie year, and he scored 33 touchdowns from 2018-2020, his age-31 to age-33 seasons. He is inside the top dozen all time in receptions regardless of position and third among tight ends, only behind Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Forty-five days ago, the Los Angeles Rams lost to the San Francisco 49ers inside this building at SoFi Stadium in one of the best games of the 2025 NFL season. Rams coach Sean McVay rolled the dice in overtime and went for it on fourth-and-1, but running back Kyren Williams was stopped short, which ended the game and resulted in a 26-23 loss.Since that moment, Los Angeles has been playing like it's in a different weight class among all NFC contenders. The Rams have been nearly flawless on offense, and quarterback Matthew Stafford has been playing at an MVP-level at 37 years old.That loss to the 49ers -- and the weeks in between -- have been part of a buildup to Sunday's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, which was arguably the most intriguing game on the Week 11 NFL slate. While the recipe during Los Angeles' win streak has been a heavy dose of offense, it was the defense that made a statement during a dramatic 21-19 win, which moved them into sole possession of first place in the NFC West. \nLos Angeles forced four turnovers and was able to hold on for a dramatic victory after Seahawks kicker Jason Myers missed a 61-yard attempt with no time remaining.\n\"We learned how to be a good team,\" Rams star edge rusher Jared Verse told CBS Sports. \"Like how to hold ourselves together, hold each other to a high standard. I'll never hold somebody to something I won't hold myself to.\"The Rams are the favorites to win the NFC West (-220) and have the second-best odds (3/1) to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LX behind the Philadelphia Eagles after their fifth consecutive win, per FanDuel. The Eagles currently hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Rams because of a dramatic 33-26 win earlier this season. During that game, Los Angeles led by as many as 19 points before the Eagles stormed back.Rams defense picks up Stafford, the offenseIt's no secret that Stafford wasn't firing on all cylinders in this game like he had been during the last month. Stafford finished 15 of 28 for 130 yards and two touchdowns, which included firing a 1-yard touchdown strike to star receiver Davante Adams for his 1,000th career reception. \nStafford's 15 completions and 130 passing yards were both season lows. However, over the last seven games, Stafford has thrown 22 touchdown passes and zero interceptions. The only quarterbacks who have thrown at least 25 touchdown passes and two interceptions or fewer through the first 10 games are Stafford, Drew Brees and Patrick Mahomes.Even though Stafford missed throws against Seattle like he had been making with ease in previous weeks, it didn't matter. Stafford's defense picked him and the offense up despite being on the field for a majority of the game. Seattle won the time of possession (37:49 to 22:11) behind a balanced offensive attack. There was a clear goal to keep a potent Los Angeles offense on the sidelines.\n        \n            \n                Rams teammates endorse Matthew Stafford for NFL MVP as odds favor veteran QB\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We are never going to apologize for finding ways to be able to win,\" McVay said. \"This is a resilient group. Love what I saw from our defense. ... There are never out of the fight. Defense and special teams did an excellent job and made enough plays offensively.\"\nEarlier this offseason, the Rams permitted Stafford's agents to contact other teams to figure out what a contract would look like if he were to be traded elsewhere. However, the almost no-brainer decision to restructure his deal to bring him back has paid off in a major way. As of Sunday evening, Stafford is still the favorite to win NFL MVP (+170) on FanDuel ahead of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye despite a lackluster performance to his standards.\"He's a wizard man,\" Verse said. \"I don't know how the hell he's doing it at his age. He's just a dawg throwing the ball and dotting it up. That's just Stafford. I have seen it all, camp. That's just who he is.\"Sam Darnold turns back the clock ... in the wrong wayThe lowlight from Seattle's loss was the play of Darnold. The Seahawks' franchise quarterback posted solid box score numbers by completing 29 of 44 attempts for 279 yards, but his four interceptions tied a career-worst. In fact, the last time Darnold threw four interceptions in a single game was in Week 7 loss against the New England Patriots during the 2019 campaign.\nIn that game, Darnold finished 11 of 32 for just 86 yards. Why that game might sound familiar, you may ask? It's when Darnold infamously told reporters that he was \"seeing ghosts\" after having the worst statistical performance of his career.Seattle signed Darnold this offseason after trading away Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders to give the franchise stability after he had a career revival with the Minnesota Vikings during the 2024 season. However, Darnold's tenure with Minnesota ended sourly after a 27-9 loss in the wild card round to this very Rams team. Sunday was the first time Darnold had faced the Rams since. Since taking over as a starter last season, Darnold is 21-7. However, he is now 0-3 against the Rams.\n\"You can't turn the ball over as much as I did today,\" Darnold said. \"I will learn from it. Watch the tape, grow from it. ... I got to be better, personally, and I know we will bounce back and learn and grow from this one.\"Darnold and Seattle will have a chance at redemption next month when they play the Rams at home in Week 16. For now, though, the Rams control the NFC West title picture. And after this game, Los Angeles sure looks like the team to beat from the NFC, too, with just seven weeks remaining in the regular season.\n            ",

The reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles are the third team in the last 30 years to start 7-2 or better over four straight seasons, while the Lions offense hasn't missed a step without coordinator Ben Johnson. The 31.4 points per game they average ranks second in the NFL behind the Indianapolis Colts, and Jared Goff just tied Matthew Stafford for the most 300-yard, three-touchdown, zero-interception games in Lions history with nine.Bet Eagles vs. Lions at Fanatics Sportsbook, where new users get up to $2,000 in No-Sweat Bets in FanCash with the promo code CBSFAN:Let's break down this exciting NFC matchup, but first, here's how you can watch the game:\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Eagles liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 16 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Lincoln Financial Field -- Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaTV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -2.5; O/U 46.5 (via FanDuel)Lions vs. Eagles: Need to knowDan Campbell the play-caller. After the Week 9 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Campbell confirmed to reporters that he took over play-calling duties from offensive coordinator John Morton. However, he made sure to emphasize that it's still a collaborative effort. In his first game calling the shots, the Lions racked up a season-high 546 yards of total offense, 30 first downs and did not punt once. However, this Eagles defense is a bit better than the Commanders defense.Could rushing attacks rule the day? This is the first time the Lions and Eagles have faced off since Week 1 in 2022, a matchup which saw the Eagles win on the road, 38-35. There were seven combined rushing touchdowns in that game, compared to two passing touchdowns. That could happen again, as Jahmyr Gibbs has scored 41 total touchdowns in 41 career games and Saquon Barkley is the reigning Offensive Player of the Year. He's averaging just 64.3 rushing yards per contest and 3.9 yards per rush after averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per rush in 2024, but you know he can turn it on at any point. A.J. Brown's struggles. Brown's frustrations this season are well-documented. He caught just two of three targets for 13 yards against the Packers. He has caught 31 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns in eight games played this season. Brown's 51 receiving yards per game is a career low, and entering Week 11, he ranks 44th in the NFL. He's tied for 61st in receptions, and ranks 50th in receiving yards. Lions vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe Eagles have a shot to repeat as Super Bowl champions, and it's easy to trust them in tight games. However, I want to go with the more explosive team in this matchup -- and that's clearly the Lions. Detroit has also thrived as an underdog. According to CBS Sports Research, the Lions are an NFL-best 12-6 against the spread as an underdog over the last four seasons, and an NFL-best 13-2 in prime-time games. Campbell has the best cover percentage (65%) by any coach since 1970, with a minimum of 75 games.

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 11 has already produced lots of drama.The Miami Dolphins kicked off the day overseas with an overtime win over the Washington Commanders in Spain, where former New England Patriots prospect Jack Jones came up with a critical takeaway. The Jacksonville Jaguars suddenly roared to life with a surprise blowout of the Los Angeles Chargers, who couldn't carry over momentum from a prime-time win. And the Pittsburgh Steelers routed the rival Cincinnati Bengals, but the win came at a cost, with Aaron Rodgers exiting due to a hand injury.That's not even accounting for the wildness of the Buffalo Bills' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Josh Allen scored six total touchdowns to outduel Baker Mayfield, or the Chicago Bears miraculously claiming their seventh win in eight weeks thanks to a walk-off field goal by Cairo Santos against the Minnesota Vikings.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 11 overreactions: Chargers on verge of second-half collapse? Bench J.J. McCarthy?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich players, coaches and teams were the biggest winners and losers of Sunday's games? Here goes:\nWinner: BroncosOK, maybe it's time we take Denver seriously. The Broncos are dragging opposing teams into the mud rather than routing them with high-octane fireworks, but Sunday's tight-knit win over the reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs was a statement victory. That makes eight straight for Sean Payton's squad, which might boast some of the most clutch performers in the league on both sides. Bo Nix remains a late-game fiend. And the defense, featuring the rangy Ja'Quan McMillian, is a terror.Loser: Sam DarnoldThe Seattle Seahawks gunslinger has had a rock-solid 2025 campaign, but he coughed up at least a bit of goodwill against the rival Los Angeles Rams, throwing four interceptions in a battle of first-place hopefuls in the NFC West. Granted, the Rams boast a persistent and physical defense, but Darnold too often looked frenetic in the pocket in Seattle's first loss since October. The Seahawks remain a force, but if that Darnold shows up late in the year, just like at the close of 2024 in Minnesota, look out.Winner: JaguarsJacksonville had lost three of its last four prior to Sunday's matchup with the Chargers. Then the Jaguars' entire defense got a confidence booster against Los Angeles' depleted offensive front, with Josh Hines-Allen and Co. swallowing up Justin Herbert to the tune of three sacks, five tackles for loss and a big-time pick. Jim Harbaugh's Bolts were rendered totally uncompetitive in the most impressive showing of Liam Coen's first season atop the Jaguars, suddenly reviving Jacksonville's playoff hopes.\nLoser: Raheem MorrisThe Atlanta Falcons coach might already be on the hot seat. If he wasn't before Sunday, however, he almost surely is now. Yes, Michael Penix Jr. was forced to leave the club's rematch with the Carolina Panthers, who previously blanked Atlanta in a 30-0 September meeting. But not even Kirk Cousins, the demoted man under center, could save the Falcons from their own defense. Morris' unit somehow managed to let Bryce Young, one of the NFL's most sluggish passers, air it out for 448 yards.Winner: Ben JohnsonAre the Bears playing clean, dominant football? Not necessarily. Are they playing winning football? There's no denying it. Chicago logged its seventh win in eight weeks on Sunday, and the conditions of the matchup weren't ideal for a Chi-Town win, with Brian Flores' Vikings defense playing host at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Still, Johnson produced another scrappy ground game (140 total yards) while his handpicked defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen, forced third-down stops basically all afternoon.Loser: BengalsThe stage was set for Cincinnati to embarrass the rival Steelers on the road on Sunday, with Aaron Rodgers leaving the contest due to a hand injury and Jalen Ramsey drawing an ejection for some extracurricular scuffling with Ja'Marr Chase. Instead, Zac Taylor's underachieving AFC North squad got basically no push from the Joe Flacco-led offense, with the aging fill-in quarterback finishing 23 of 40 with a pick, and video appeared to depict Chase spitting on Ramsey during their interactions. This is a sad, slumping team.\nWinner: Josh Allen's MVP oddsAllen had been enjoying a solid, if relatively unspectacular, season prior to Sunday. His Bills, after all, were more scrappy than special considering the high expectations they carried into 2025. But boy did the Superman version of Allen show up against the Buccaneers. Yes, there were hiccups, like off-kilter interceptions. But No. 17 put on his cape as a true dual threat to outlast Baker Mayfield's own heroics, accounting for six scores and almost 350 total yards while spreading the ball to 10 different receivers.\n            ",

The shakeup would be the third change at No. 1 in as many rankings updates including the preseason, giving the preseason No. 1 Boilermakers a bump back up one spot.Houston won't fall far this week, though, just like Purdue didn't fall far last week. My projection below of the full top 25 has the Cougars dropping to No. 2 and the trio of UConn, Duke and Arizona -- in that order -- rounding out the new top five.\nBelow is how I expect the AP Top 25 poll to shake out Monday.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Purdue will be back at No. 1 this week and is set to leapfrog Houston after handling business Sunday night at home vs. Akron. It beat No. 8 Alabama, 87-80, on Thursday in Tuscaloosa.  Last week: No. 22\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    I'm of the belief that the No. 1 team should remain No. 1 until it loses a game. But this is a special case where Houston -- which narrowly hung on vs. No. 22 on Sunday -- will likely lose its No. 1 ranking despite remaining unbeaten. That says more about Purdue than it does about Houston.  Last week: No. 13\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    UConn narrowly outlasted BYU on Saturday, 86-84, despite at one point leading by 20 points. The win's a good one nonetheless and should keep the Huskies at No. 3 this week.  Last week: No. 34\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Two outings and two wins by an average margin of 46.5 points this week against Army and Indiana State, respectively, will keep Duke comfortably inside the top five.

Will it be enough for voters to push the Wildcats above them this week after beating UCLA on Friday night? It's possible. But for now I think voters will keep the status quo. Last week: No. 56\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    A 96-88 win over Kentucky and a 106-81 win over Ohio this week should push Louisville past rival Kentucky and into the top 10 for the first time since the 2019-20 season.

Its 81-77 win over Texas Tech on Tuesday will be a victory that ages well for its NCAA Tournament resume late in the season. Last week: No. 148\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    Let's hope voters are paying attention to just how good Gonzaga's been so far. A big bump is warranted. It has double-digit wins over OU, Creighton and Arizona entering Monday's game vs. Southern Utah. Last week: No. 199\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Michigan is 3-0, but it had to win in OT vs. Wake on Tuesday and narrowly outlasted TCU -- picked to finish 10th in the Big 12 this season -- on the road Friday. Expecting it to take a small hit in the ranks. Last week: No. 610\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    A resounding 96-80 win over Mississippi State this week combined with a 3-0 overall record will give Iowa State a shot at sneaking into this week's top 10.

The win should keep it in the 10-13 range this week.

That'll likely knock the Tide out of the top 10 this week.  Last week: No. 813\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    Where voters land on placing Alabama should determine where St. John's sits. Bama with its head-to-head win over the Johnnies should put them above St. John's and leave the two somewhere in this range come Monday. Last week: No. 1314\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    Despite an 86-84 loss to UConn on Saturday, BYU acquitted itself well by showing its resilience and nearly erasing a 20-point deficit. AJ Dybantsa scored 25 points and looks the part of an All-American already. That's a huge development for the Cougars' title hopes this season.  Last week: No. 715\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    There will be a small price to pay in the polls Monday because Kentucky's 96-88 loss at Louisville on Tuesday.

Carter had numerous team rules violations dating back to the summer, and those continued issues contributed to his departure. The 5-foot-11, 200-pound defensive back did not appear in Tennessee's win Saturday over New Mexico State and was absent from the sideline.\"At the end of the day, there's a standard you've got to meet to be in that locker room,\" Heupel said after Tennessee's win. \"He was not out on the field with us.\"Carter entered his sophomore season expected to be one of Tennessee's key players in the secondary. He's been reasonably productive with 25 tackles and 4.5 tackles for loss. Carter hasn't started any games, however, failing to follow up on an excellent debut season as a freshman in 2024. \nCarter had a tumultuous offseason with the Vols. He missed numerous team activities over the summer and was at one point confronted by team leaders, which led to Carter stepping away from the team for a stretch in July. He did eventually return to the program with Heupel saying there were \"some things he's got to accomplish\" to get back out on the field with us. Even ahead of Carter's dismissal, the Vols considered Carter a likely candidate to transfer, sources told CBS Sports. The former four-star recruit could be a popular player in January depending on how teams evaluate his time in Knoxville. \nCarter finished his Tennessee career with 63 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and an interception. \n            \n    ",

Quarterback Jordan Love briefly left the game but returned sustaining a left shoulder injury, however, running back Josh Jacobs did not return to action after sustaining a knee injury during the second quarter. Following the Packers 27-20 win, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said that Jacobs' injury is not expected to be season-ending and that more tests will be done on Monday. \"I think anytime a player, especially of his magnitude, but anytime a player doesn't finish a game, you're always concerned about the welfare of them,\" LaFleur said.  \nJacobs went to locker room after getting injured during Green Bay's first scoring drive. The three-time Pro Bowl player had 40 yards on seven carries prior to getting injured. \nWith Jacobs out, the Packers' ground attack was led by backup Emmanuel Wilson, who rushed for 40 yards on a touchdown on 11 carries. Green Bay ran for a solid 128 yards and one touchdown on 23 carries despite Jacobs' absence. After leaving the game, Love went to the medical tent before heading to the locker room. He was labeled as questionable to return shortly thereafter. While it doesn't appear to be season-ending, it does seem that Jacobs suffered a rather significant injury. That's clearly not good news for the Packers, as Jacobs has been one of their most productive players since the start of the 2024 season. \nLast season, his first with the Packers, Jacobs rushed for a career-high 15 touchdowns while helping Green Bay clinch a playoff berth. He's rushed for 648 yards and 11 touchdowns this season for the Packers, who improved to 6-3-1 on the year following Sunday's win. \n            \n    ",

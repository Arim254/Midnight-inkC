    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Two months from now, when Cathy Engelbert walks to the podium to announce the No. 1 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft, she may call Azzi Fudd's name. At the very least, Fudd is set to become the latest UConn star selected in the lottery. Fudd arrived in Storrs in 2021 as the No. 1 overall recruit in her class, but has not had an easy road to this point. She suffered a devastating knee injury during high school that required multiple surgeries to repair a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee, then played just 42 games in her first three seasons at UConn due to an array of injuries, including another torn ACL in her right knee. Over the last two seasons, Fudd has finally gotten healthy, which has allowed her to show why she was so highly regarded as a prospect. She was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player last season after helping the Huskies win their first national championship since 2016, then decided to use her extra year of eligibility to return to school and further develop her game. Through 27 appearances this season, Fudd is averaging 17.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.4 steals on 49.5/46.3/94.9 shooting splits for the 27-0 Huskies, who are ranked No. 1 in the country and have a real chance to pull off another undefeated season. \nAfter 14 consecutive wins by at least 30 points, the Huskies ran into a bit of trouble on Saturday afternoon in front of a sold-out crowd at the Al McGuire Center on Marquette's campus. The Golden Eagles jumped in front early, and the game was tied in the middle of the second quarter. Fudd, who finished with a game-high 25 points and four steals, helped lead a 16-4 run to close the half, however, and the Huskies held on for a 71-56 win -- their third-closest contest this season. I was lucky enough to sit courtside for the Valentine's Day matchup, and spent the afternoon focused solely on Fudd, who didn't come out until 2:30 remaining, when the game was finally in hand. Here are my observations from watching one of the top prospects in this year's draft class from a unique vantage point. DefenseFudd is largely discussed as an offensive prospect, and for good reason, but the biggest thing that stood out from watching her in person was her defense, particularly off the ball. \nUConn was switching just about everything in the halfcourt, and Fudd often made sure she took whoever was in the weakside corner. That allowed her to remain on the backline and act as a roamer to help shut off the middle of the floor. She was excellent in this role. She was constantly scanning the floor and talking to her teammates. Her awareness of what was happening in front of her, and her timing on when to help, was almost always on point. Time and again, Fudd was in the right place to deny a pass, force a more difficult shot or create a turnover. \nBecause of UConn's switching tactic, there were times Fudd found herself matched up against bigger players, such as Halle Vice or Skylar Forbes. She never shrank from the challenge. While the 5-foot-11 Fudd isn't the biggest guard, she's not small either. Most importantly, she's willing to fight in those situations when she has to, and smart enough to know when she should get out of there. \nOne possession in the third quarter stood out, when Fudd got switched onto the 6-foot-3 Forbes, who tried to bury her in the post. Fudd fought to get in front of her and denied an easy entry pass. As Vice hesitated and swung the ball to the opposite wing, Fudd immediately yelled \"Sarah! Sarah!\" and coordinated a switch with Sarah Strong. Fudd scrammed out to the wing with high hands, which forced Kennedi Perkins to throw something of a lob down into Forbes. Strong was able to read the pass and pick it off. \nFundamentals are often an offensive conversation, but Fudd was so sound defensively. She constantly had her head on a swivel and played with active hands. Even something as basic as the way she slid her feet in UConn's full-court press was flawless. Fudd finished with four steals, one short of her season-high, and took two of them coast-to-coast for layups. \n\"She's putting herself in positions to do that, as opposed to previous years, I think she was very cautious. She played the game cautiously on defense,\" Geno Auriemma said after the game. \"If I would say there's one thing that I'm glad we're seeing, is her ability off the ball to be in the right spot at the right time and to have the confidence to go for it and not worry about what happens if I'm not successful. It's been like that all year, and it's great when you have someone that's that kind of offensive player that's willing to play like that on the other end.\"ShootingFudd's shooting prowess is no secret. She's a 42.3% career 3-point shooter and is making a career-high 46.3% of her attempts this season. Fudd's textbook form is a big part of her success. Pre-game warm-ups provided an opportunity to watch her release over and over in a less chaotic environment than a game, and it was incredible to see up close. Here are a few stills from a video I shot. It doesn't get better than this. \nFudd's perfect form It was also interesting to see how repeatable Fudd's shot was. It looks the same every single time, which is a testament to the work that she's put in, and really translates to game action. Of course, Fudd's lightning-quick release is another aspect of her success. It's one thing to watch on TV, it was another to see it in person from courtside. The speed with which she's able to catch, square herself and fire -- again, with the same, perfect form every time -- is really remarkable. The dismay from Marquette on a few of her 3s was palpable. Finally, it was fun to watch Fudd read and react to the defense. She did a great job of using screens and relocating to create space for herself. Her first 3 of the day was a perfect example. She faked a cut toward the basket, which got Jordan Meulemans to take one step the wrong way, then sprinted into a hand-off with Jana El Alfy. Instead of curling around El Alfy, she stopped right behind her and was wide open. \nOn-ball creationIf there's a clear area of improvement for Fudd, it's her on-ball creation. She is one of the best shooting prospects of all time, but remains largely an off-ball threat. Against Marquette, Fudd did not initiate UConn's offense except on occasion in transition. She generally started in the corner and utilized screens and cuts to get open. While she was willing to put the ball on the deck when the Golden Eagles ran her off the line, she was almost exclusively looking for one- or two-dribble pull-ups. Her form remains impeccable on those attempts, but she's clearly not as comfortable shooting off the dribble. Against Marquette, she was 2 of 7 on pull-up 2s and 0 of 2 on pull-up 3s. \n\"Definitely something I could have been better at today,\" Fudd said about her self-created offense after the win. Notably, Fudd finished with zero assists, and on two of the rare times she went to the basket in the halfcourt, she was rejected by Forbes. Though still an excellent lateral athlete despite the knee injuries, Fudd isn't an explosive vertical athlete and often tried to finish with underhand scoop layups. Fan reactionFinally, just a note about the incredible fan support Fudd and UConn received. When I arrived a few hours before tip-off, there were already hundreds of fans lined up waiting to get in, most of them sporting UConn gear. There were plenty of Fudd jerseys and shirts, and multiple \"Fudd Around and Find Out\" signs. Again, the game was in Milwaukee, not Storrs. \nPost-game, when Fudd sat at the announcer's table doing an interview with FS1, dozens of fans immediately flocked to that side of the bleachers just to take pictures and selfies in her presence. When she eventually walked to the locker room, the screams were deafening. UConn and Fudd's popularity is not a surprise at this point, but Saturday's game felt different from even their previous trips to Milwaukee. Whichever team drafts Fudd be acquiring a massive fanbase in addition to a great player. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture, including the Daytona 500. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel and DraftKings require a user's first bet to win, while bet365 provides bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets, but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook that consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there are season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. \"Today's exciting announcement is about strengthening our competitive profile and creating value for the membership,\" MAC Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a release. \"We were presented with an opportunity to add an institution with demonstrated success in football, a record of investment and commitment to the continued growth of the institution and community.  Sacramento State is ready and poised for this next step.  I welcome the Hornets to the Mid-American Conference and expect they will become a competitive and contributing member to the long history and legacy of one of the oldest Division I conferences.\"According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama. Sac State is also scheduled to face Fresno State in Week 2, as outlined in the Pac-12 schedule release. \n\n        \n            \n                Longtime FCS standard bearer North Dakota State seeks fresh challenge with leap to FBS\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSac State moved all non-football sports to from the Big Sky to the Big West last summer and applied for a waiver to join the FBS as an independent.

We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"The Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State.

The Monday college basketball schedule features a top-five clash with No. 5 Iowa State hosting No. 3 Houston at 9 p.m. ET, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick from this contest as part of Monday college basketball best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Iowa State is favored by 2.5 points at home, according to the latest college basketball odds.The SportsLine Projection Model has also locked in a pair of Monday college basketball best bets, including Over 142.5 total points for No. 4 Duke vs. Syracuse, and Drexel to cover as 3.5-point underdogs against Stony Brook in an 8 p.m. ET matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and it enters Week 15 on a sizzling 11-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and is on an 11-5 run on top-rated CBB side picks. Anyone following its college basketball betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookDuke vs. Syracuse: Over 142.5 total points (-112)Drexel (+3.5) vs. Stony Brook (-102)Houston (+2.5) vs. Iowa State (-115)Combining the three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +600 (risk $100 to win $600). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):Duke vs. Syracuse: Over 142.5 total points (-112)The Over is 5-1-1 over the last seven Syracuse games, and 9-2-1 over its last 12 contests. A significant reason why is that Syracuse has the No. 108 scoring defense, allowing 72.2 points per game this season. Meanwhile, Duke is averaging 82.8 ppg this season. Duke vs. Syracuse contests have gone Over this number in six of their last nine meetings, and that's a trend the model expects to continue Monday. Duke freshman Cameron Boozer is fourth in the nation in scoring at 22.2 ppg, and he'll be a problem for the Orange. The model projects the Over to hit in 73% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nDrexel (+3.5) vs. Stony Brook (-102)Drexel and Stony Brook have identical 7-6 records in CAA play this season, and the line favors Stony Brook with this contest being played on its campus on Long Island, New York. However, Drexel has split its last four road games, and it is 7-3 over its last 10 contests. Stony Brook has played in tight battles at home recently, with five of its last six home games either decided by five points or fewer or going into overtime. Drexel defeated Stony Brook, 56-37, at home in their first matchup this season, and Drexel defeated Stony Brook on the road, 67-51, last year. The model projects Drexel to cover in 83% of simulations. Back Drexel to cover at DraftKings here:Houston (+2.5) vs. Iowa State (-115)\"Houston (23-2) rides in on a six-game winning streak,\" SportsLine expert Micah Roberts said. \"The Cougars are visiting Ames, Iowa, where they will be underdogs for the first time this season against Iowa State (22-3). Houston has returned to its traditional format of controlling games with defense, staying Under the total in its last five games. Houston is now No. 2 nationally, allowing 61.3 points a game. Iowa State averages 84.2 points and shoots 50.6 percent from the field, and the Cyclones come off a beatdown of Kansas after losing at TCU. Iowa State has stayed Under the total in its last three games. This total is only 134.5, which is built on both teams' defensive trends. While the Cyclones are 14-0 at home, I bet on the Houston defense.\" Back Houston to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The All-Star weekend came and went, providing players with a much-needed rest. Heading into the final two months of the regular season, the direction for certain teams appears to be clear. While this could provide fantasy managers with at least some clarity, sit/start decisions are still going to be far from obvious. Much like last week, this week also has only four days of action, with the Jazz suiting up just once. Meanwhile, 13 teams will suit up three times, leaving the remaining 16 teams with two games each. Sitting players who only go one or two times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Three Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DEN, IND, LAC, NYK, ORL, PHI, PHO, WASTwo Games: BOS, DAL, DET, GSW, HOU, LAL, MEM, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, OKC, POR, SAC, SAS, TOROne Game: UTAHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the 18th week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Nolan Traore, BKNOpponents: @CLE, @OKC, @ATLDespite some shifts in the Brooklyn rotation, Traore appears to be relatively safe at the moment. Outside of an illness that cost him two games in late January, Traore has been able to carve out a consistent role, having now started in eight straight games. He has scored double digits in four consecutive appearances, handing out 32 assists during that period. At this stage, his fantasy value is largely tied to points and assists, meaning he won't be the best fit for everyone. However, with three games in four nights, the potential for him to flirt with top 100 value is there. Consider starting: Jaden Ivey, CHIOpponents: TOR, DET, NYKWhen it comes to forward thinking in Chicago, the track record is certainly not favorable. Although Nikola Vucevic was finally traded, the Bulls then subsequently acquired multiple guards, one of whom was Ivey. However, since arriving in the windy city, Ivey has seemingly established himself as a part of the short-term future. In four appearances for his new team, he has averaged 11.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two 3-pointers. The eventual return of both Josh Giddey and Tre Jones is going to complicate matters, that's for sure. However, assuming Ivey can maintain a 28-minute per-night role, he would be able to provide fantasy managers with adequate value moving forward.Consider sitting: Ty Jerome, MEMOpponents: UTA, @MIAAlthough Jerome has been a real bright spot for the Grizzlies since returning from injury, the schedule is simply working against him this week. Not only does Memphis have two games, but they also come on back-to-back nights. Based on what we have seen since Jerome returned, there is a decent chance we will only see him for one of the two games, limiting his opportunities. With 13 teams playing three times, this is really just a case of simple math. One game of Jerome, who could very well end up playing fewer than 25 minutes, is not enough to warrant a starting spot. \nForwardsConsider starting: Jarace Walker, INDOpponents: @WAS, @WAS, DALSeen as a priority stash heading into the trade deadline, Walker's role received a small bump after Johnny Furphy was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a knee injury. Walker has now played at least 30 minutes in three of his past four games, providing fantasy managers with serviceable production on both ends of the floor. In fact, in 14 games over the past month, he has averaged 14.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.1 steals,s and 1.9 3-pointers, shooting 48.4 percent from the field and 73.8 percent from the line. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but given the opportunity that lies ahead of him, he should be rostered in all formats.Consider sitting: Lauri Markkanen, UTAOpponents: @MEMAnother team that appears to be prioritizing losses over wins, Utah's shenanigans were seemingly found out by the NBA after fines were issued last week. However, this is unlikely to have an impact on the ultimate goal, meaning Markkanen is going to continue to miss games. Not only does Utah have one game this week, but it is against another tanking team, the Indiana Pacers. Factoring in everything we know about how these teams approach matchups such as this, we could very well see Markkanen on the sideline, giving him potentially zero games in four nights.Consider sitting: Ace Bailey, UTAOpponents: @MEMIt's basically rinse and repeat when it comes to any Utah player, Bailey included. Although he has been able to turn things around after a disappointing start to his rookie season, one game of Bailey just isn't enough to warrant a starting spot, outside of deeper formats. Unlike Markkanen, Bailey should at least be available to play, given he has suited up in 18 straight games, avoiding all of the roster shuffling. While there should be a spot on most rosters for Bailey moving forward, starting him this week is just too risky.\nCentersConsider starting: Tristan Vukcevic, WASOpponents: IND, IND, CHAAlthough it's been another disappointing season for Vukcevic, things could be about to flip. Alex Sarr has been ruled out for at least the next week with what Washington is calling a hamstring strain. Based on what we know about soft-tissue injuries, that timeline could certainly extend to multiple weeks. Coupled with the fact that Washington is looking to lose as many games as possible, we have a situation where Vukcevic could find himself as the starting center for the foreseeable future. In three games over the past week, he has been a top 120 player in just 17.2 minutes per game, averaging 14 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 3-pointers, and 1.4 combined steals and blocks. If his role extends to 28 minutes per game, we could have a top 80 player on our hands. Consider sitting: Santi Aldama, MEMOpponents: UTA, @MIAAlthough the path to minutes for Aldama is relatively clear following the Jaren Jackson trade, ongoing knee issues have limited him to just two games in the past month. That alone should at least make managers question his spot in the rotation. Memphis also has two games this week, both of which come on consecutive nights. Given the fact that Aldama's knee concerns have been lingering, there is almost no way he plays in both games, and that's assuming he returns at all. This is a simple one for managers.\n            ",

The Wolverines are once again the undisputed powerhouse in college basketball after a week in which they picked up dominant wins against Northwestern and UCLA. It has now been well beyond a month since Michigan suffered its last loss on Jan. 10 against Wisconsin. In 10 games since, the Wolverines are beating their opponents by an average of 16.5 points per game. That type of dominance alone befits a No. 1 team in the nation, but Michigan's ascendance was helped, in part, by Arizona's first real stumbles of the year. The previously undefeated Wildcats dropped to No. 4 in the Coaches Poll after suffering their first two losses of the season to No. 12 Kansas and No. 13 Texas Tech. Arizona is still positioned well to snag a top four seed nationally once the NCAA Tournament rolls around. Elsewhere in the Big 12, Houston continued to climb ahead of a big week for the Cougars. Houston jumped past Arizona to No. 2 ahead of a monumental clash against No. 6 Iowa State Monday night. Houston also meets Arizona Saturday as the Cougars look to take a commanding lead in the Big 12 race. Here's a look at the Feb. 16 Coaches Poll in its entirety.First-place votes in parenthesis\nCoaches Poll Michigan (31) HoustonDukeArizonaUConnIowa StatePurdueGonzagaNebraskaIllinoisFloridaKansasTexas TechVirginiaMichigan State St. John's ArkansasVanderbiltSaint LouisNorth CarolinaLouisvilleBYU Miami (OH) ClemsonWisconsin Others receiving votes: Alabama 32; Villanova 30; Utah State 20; Tennessee 19; Iowa 7; Kentucky 6; Saint Mary's 2; Miami (FL) 1\n            \n    ",

In the last week alone, the conference has given the country Arizona vs. Kansas, Texas Tech vs. Arizona and Kansas vs. Iowa State.On Monday night, the Big 12 will stage another scintillating showdown when the No. 2 Houston Cougars and the No. 6 Iowa State Cyclones collide at Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa.The Cougars (23-2, 11-1 in Big 12) lead the Big 12 by one game over Arizona (23-2, 10-2). They have won six in a row behind freshman guard Kingston Flemings and a suffocating defense that ranks second in the country with 61.3 points per game allowed. Meanwhile, the Cyclones (22-3, 9-3) are tied for third in the Big 12. They are coming off an 18-point blowout win over Kansas on Saturday, which was their biggest victory over the Jayhawks since 1973. The win also improved Iowa State's home record to 14-0 this season. The Cyclones are 2.5-point favorites over the Cougars on Monday.While Houston vs. Iowa State is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a partial college basketball schedule.

The Blue Devils (23-2, 12-1 in ACC) lead the conference by one game over Virginia (22-3, 10-2). Duke is anchored by likely national player of the year Cameron Boozer, who ranks fifth in the country in scoring (22.8 points per game) and 14th in rebounding (9.9 per game). On Monday, he and the Blue Devils will take on a Syracuse team that has been relatively mediocre defensively this season, ranking 130th in the nation in points per game allowed (72.2). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says there's a 73% chance the teams combine for 143 points or more and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 142.5.No. 2 Houston at No. 6 Iowa StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 134.5 | Expert: Houston +2.5 (Micah Roberts)\nBecause both of these teams are known for their defenses, the offenses have been overshadowed. The Cougars rank 12th in the country in offensive rating (125.0 points per 100 possessions), according to KenPom, while the Cyclones (123.9) are 17th. Both teams feature players who can fill it up. Flemings (16.4 points per game) is on pace to break the program record for single-season scoring average by a freshman. Meanwhile, Iowa State's Milan Momcilovic leads the country in 3-point percentage (51.6). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's an 80.4% chance the teams combine for 135 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 134.5. Looking aheadChampions League: Atalanta at Borussia DortmundTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Dortmund | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 2.5 | Expert: Over 2.5 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo teams on a roll square off in the first leg of a Champions League knockout phase playoff when Borussia Dortmund and Atalanta face off at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund have won their last six matches in the Bundesliga to move into second place in the table. Atalanta, which installed Raffaele Palladino as coach midseason, have six wins and two draws over their last eight matches in Serie A. \"My belief is that with this being a two-legged playoff, Dortmund are going to press heavily at home in this first leg, knowing that playing in Italy is going to be tough,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It projects 3.3 total goals and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 2.5.Paris Saint-Germain at MonacoTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Monaco | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: PSG -188 | Expert: PSG -1 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo French sides will meet in European competition for the first time when Monaco host PSG at Stade Louis II. PSG sit in second place in the Ligue 1 table with 51 points, behind only Lens (52). Monaco are eighth with 31 points. At the end of November, Monaco stunned PSG 1-0 in a Ligue 1 match in Monaco. But the reigning league champions currently lead Ligue 1 in both goals (49) and goal differential (+30). \"PSG will be desperate for the chance to correct that abysmal 1-0 loss,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. Its simulations say the average score for this match is 3.7-0.7 and gives a strong \"A\" grade to the PSG money line (-188). \n            ",

That doesn't mean Judge is content with his game. Rather, he's looking to add a new dimension this year.\"Baserunning's on my mind this year a lot,\" Judge told reporters on Monday. \"I saw a lot of guys around the league with 40, 30 bases that you don't usually normally expect to be running that much. Especially with how the game's changed with the pickoffs and the pitch clock, I think that's one way we can utilize, or, at least, I can utilize some of my skills a little bit more, getting into scoring position.\"With the lineup we have, this was probably the best offense in all of baseball last year. If I can find a way to get myself in scoring position, if they're going to walk me or do something, then some good things are going to happen.\"\nTo Judge's point, 17 different players swiped at least 30 bases in 2025. That group included the likes of Juan Soto (38) and Josh Naylor (30), neither of whom fits the conventional picture of a high-volume thief. In fact, Soto and Naylor both finished in the 13th percentile or worse in Statcast's sprint speed, suggesting their steals were the products of their smarts -- and their leveraging of the aforementioned pickoff limit and pitch clock rules -- instead of their wheels. Judge, for comparison, ranked in the 42nd percentile in that measure, which helps to explain why he's been a legitimate center-field option for the Yankees in the past despite his size.\nJudge, 33, has never stolen more than 16 bases in a single campaign despite succeeding at around a 75% clip. The key matter for the Yankees is whether or not the additional value he'd provide in running more often would be worth the downside of increasing his injury risk. Given how much Judge produces at the plate (he's hit .312/.445/.674 and averaged 49 home runs over the last three years), the Yankees can be excused if they decide by Opening Day to give him the red light just as often as in the past.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe second year pf the new format of the UEFA Champions League, brought plenty of chaos on the final day of the league phase as 18 matches kicked off at the same time. Storylines can get muddled along the way during a jam-packed period of action but one stood out above the rest, fully embodying the drama of the day.Real Madrid started the day well-positioned to finish in the top eight and book a direct spot in the round of 16, a favorable match against a Benfica team who were poised for elimination awaiting them. The script fully flipped, though -- Benfica came out with an improbable 4-2 win, rounded out by a red card for Real Madrid's Raul Asencio and the final goal of the game coming from shot-stopper Anatoliy Trubin. Benfica, coached by ex-Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, snuck their way into the knockout phase playoffs while Los Blancos were doomed to play another two games in the hopes of booking a spot in the last 16.It makes for an unusual but perfect set-up for a rematch three weeks later, a painful reward for Benfica despite their hard work and a golden opportunity for Real Madrid to fully put that Matchday 8 defeat behind them.How to watch Benfica vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 16 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio da Luz -- Lisbon, PortugalLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Benfica +280; Draw +290; Real Madrid -115Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

We will play the first leg with our heads, with ambition and confidence. We know what we did to the kings of the Champions League … Real Madrid is Real Madrid, with history, knowledge, ambition. The only comparable thing is that we are two giants. Beyond that, there is nothing else. But football has this power and we can win.\"The circumstances could see Mourinho change his approach from the teams' last meeting, too. Benfica were more forward-thinking than usual in their win over Los Blancos, in large part because they simply needed to score to even have a shot at advancing, but the calculus is usually different over a two-legged tie. A team can attempt to grind the opponent down in an attempt to lock their attack out, something Mourinho teams have done time and time again. Benfica's attack-focused approach on Matchday 8 was atypical to their Champions League experiences since Mourinho took over after a Matchday 1 loss to Qarabag – they performed well above their average of 14.1 shots per game and 1.5 expected goals, instead taking 22 shots and generating 3.01 expected goals. Even with the 3-2 defeat to Qarabag factored in, Benfica are a solid defensive side – they have conceded just 10.1 nonpenalty expected goals against in eight games.The question, then, is if this imperfect version of Real Madrid can find a way to break through a tough defense. Even in a season full of ups and downs, it feels hard to bet against the Spanish giants. They rank inside the Champions League's top five for goals with 21 and expected goals with 18.99, their sheer ability to score papering over a handful of cracks. That is especially true since Xabi Alonso's January ouster as the coach, his mission to build a more balanced Real Madrid abandoned despite the progress he made. Since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge, Los Blancos have fully switched to a strategy in which Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior share the field at the same time, kicking the can down the road on the longstanding question about the pair's compatibility.Both in Spain and in Europe, Real Madrid's inherent attacking might is enough to survive their own inconsistencies and notch enough wins to keep them in the conversation for silverware. Mbappe himself is on pace for a career-best season with 39 goals across all competitions so far, while Vinicius has delivered since Arbeloa took charge with four goals and two assists in his last seven matches. Individually, the pair are a cheat code as Los Blancos continue to sort through their issues and will be enough of a challenge for Benfica's defense over the next week and change.The team, though, has received a boost in the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who notched his first start since December in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday. He will provide some attacking balance for a team that is at times overly reliant on Mbappe, already providing a preview of what's to come with an assist over the weekend. The England international is a uniquely creative player as a right back, though his range of passing and positional awareness means he can kickstart an attack from just about every area of the pitch.For all their flaws, Real Madrid have a perfect opportunity to put a sizable loss behind them, even if they are still unwilling to answer the big problems that plague their squad – and their pursuit of trophies, for that matter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Home-field advantage can feel like a fortress some weeks and a myth the next. Entering 2026, it's clear just how rare sustained dominance at home has become. Fourteen Power Four programs (and Notre Dame) began 2025 with home win streaks of at least four games, but at season's end, only Indiana still had its streak intact.Georgia's 34-game run snapped the same weekend Washington's 22-game streak came to an end, while Alabama, Arizona State, Missouri and Oregon all reached double-digit streaks before falling. That leaves Indiana and Ole Miss as the only Power Four teams with home win streaks of at least 10 games entering 2026. The rest of the field is full of shorter streaks that developed last season, with nine Power Four teams going unbeaten at home in 2025. There were 10 Power Four teams that finished without a home loss in 2024, showing just how quickly these streaks can form and end.Here's a look at the longest active home win streaks among Power Four teams entering the 2026 season and the notable tests each will face in trying to keep those runs alive.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indiana (15)Indiana hasn't lost at home since Curt Cignetti arrived in Bloomington ahead of the 2024 season, building a 15-game run that enters 2026 as the longest active streak in the FBS.

Only one of the 15 wins at \"The Rock\" since has come against a ranked opponent -- and Ohio State and USC both visit this fall as teams ranked in Brandon Marcello's way-too-early top 25 for 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ole Miss (12)Pete Golding has a pretty firm runway at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium ahead of his first full season in charge. He is already 1-0 at The Grove after leading Ole Miss to a CFP first-round win in Oxford last December, pushing the Rebels' home win streak to 12 games. The real juice comes early this fall, when Lane Kiffin returns with LSU. A challenging SEC schedule includes visits from Georgia and Missouri, so the streak won't coast quietly.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas (9)The Longhorns finished unbeaten at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium for the second time in three seasons, with the only home loss in that stretch coming against Georgia in 2024. That current nine-game home win streak will be tested almost immediately in 2026 when Ohio State visits Austin in the return leg of a home-and-home. Most of the toughest games on the Longhorns' schedule are away from Austin, with Ole Miss the only other way-too-early top 25 team coming to town.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio State (8)No team in the FBS has a better home record in the 21st century than Ohio State -- 160-15 (.914). The Buckeyes rarely lose at Ohio Stadium in Columbus. So, it's no surprise they enter 2026 with one of the longest active home win streaks among the Power Four. The only teams to beat Ohio State at home in the past eight years are Michigan (twice) and Oregon, the two teams from Marcello's way-too-early top 25 that Ryan Day and the Buckeyes will host this fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas Tech (8)Texas Tech posted its first undefeated home record in 17 years, finishing flawless at Jones AT&T Stadium in 2025. Can the Red Raiders keep that streak alive in 2026? Of the next six teams just below them in Shehan Jeyarajah's way-too-early Big 12 power rankings, Texas Tech is set to host four: Arizona, Arizona State, Houston and TCU. That promises a much sterner test than 2025, when the Red Raiders faced just one opponent at home that finished with a winning record.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    BYU (7)BYU would be tied for second on this list with Ole Miss if not for a shocking home loss to Kansas at LaVell Edwards Stadium in 2024 -- the Cougars' only defeat at home over the past two seasons. In 2026, BYU faces a daunting slate at home: not only do they host a national championship contender, but they also welcome Arizona and Arizona State, two of the top five teams in the way-too-early Big 12 power rankings.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota (7)The Golden Gophers were quietly one of just nine Power Four teams to go unbeaten at home in 2025 while struggling on the road (0-5). It was the first Minnesota team to finish a season without a home loss since 1967. The 2026 slate has an early nonconference test against Mississippi State in Week 2, then the first two Big Ten home games are rivalry matchups against Iowa and Michigan. Minnesota has lost 18 straight at home to Michigan and five in a row to Iowa.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USC (7)Lincoln Riley has figured out how to win at home in the Big Ten, though road games remain a different story for the Trojans. A silver lining for 2026 is that a majority of the toughest matchups are at the LA Memorial Coliseum, giving USC a potential advantage on their own turf. That list includes Ohio State, Oregon and Washington, three teams already in Marcello's way-too-early top 25 rankings, setting up a challenging stretch that could end this current streak.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Vanderbilt (7)Vanderbilt enjoyed a magical 2025, finishing undefeated at home for the first time since 1982 and only the fourth time since 1945. But keeping that streak alive in 2026 will be a tall order, as Alabama, Ole Miss and Tennessee all come to FirstBank Stadium in Nashville. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A day like today was always coming for the Dolphins. Maybe it was before the season. Maybe it was when they started 0-3, or when wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a brutal knee injury in Week 4, or when they fired GM Chris Grier and sold at the trade deadline. When they benched Tua Tagovailoa and, a few weeks later, fired coach Mike McDaniel, the writing was officially on the wall.The Dolphins, as we knew them for the past four seasons, were a thing of the past, and their roster teardown began in earnest Monday when they released Hill, edge rusher Bradley Chubb, offensive lineman James Daniels and wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.Hill and Chubb are the headliners. When the Dolphins were at their best, making the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, so, too, was Hill. He had 1,710 receiving yards in 2022 and 1,799 in 2023. He not only became the first player in NFL history with 1,700+ yards in multiple seasons, but he did it in consecutive seasons. Miami's offense hummed along; it led the NFL in yards and was second in points in 2023.Chubb was part of the effort to elevate the defense to, if not a similar level, at least a viable level. The Dolphins sent a first-round pick to the Broncos in 2022 and signed Chubb to a five-year, $110 million extension. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, with Chubb racking up 11 sacks and a league-leading six forced fumbles in the latter.\n\n        \n            \n                Tyreek Hill landing spots: Chiefs, Bills and other AFC contenders among top fits after Dolphins release WR\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe excitement came to an end even faster that it had arrived, a tale as old as time in the NFL. The Dolphins' playoff duds revealed serious flaws. Tagovailoa struggled with concussions. Chubb missed the entire 2024 season with a torn ACL. Miami missed the postseason each of the last two seasons.Now, new GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and new coach Jeff Hafley -- both from the Packers -- are turning over a new leaf. Monday's releases clear $56 million in 2026 cap space, per NFL Media. That duo still has much to do, though.The fact that Sullivan comes from Green Bay shouldn't be lost. The Packers once moved on from a veteran quarterback and didn't skip a beat. They built the NFL's youngest roster and loaded it with talent.\nDon't expect a similar path in the immediate future from Miami, which is in a very different spot. Miami can begin to dig itself out of its mess this offseason, but this is very much a multiyear project. Here are the first steps.Figure out Tua Tagovailoa's futureThis is the elephant in the room. Last week, Sullivan said the Dolphins were \"getting close\" on a decision regarding the embattled quarterback, and he has previously said the team would look at all options at quarterback this offseason.The expectation is that the Dolphins move on. It's much easier said than done. As Jordan Dajani wrote earlier this month:\nThe former No. 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension prior to the 2024 season after a career year. Trading Tagovailoa would be ideal, but Miami would have to eat a chunk of the $54 million guaranteed salary he has in 2026. Plus, there would be a $45.2 million dead cap hit if Tagovailoa is traded before June 1 as well. It would appear a cut is more likely, but that has ramifications, too.Tagovailoa release with post-June 1 designation (via Spotrac) 2026 dead cap$67,400,0002027 dead cap$31,800,0002026 savings$-11,132,353Parting ways with Tagovailoa would leave 2025 sixth-rounder Cam Miller (originally drafted by the Raiders) and 2025 seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers as the only quarterbacks under contract for the 2026 season.\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Tua Tagovailoa, A.J. Brown among 15 players who could be traded or released in 2026 offseason\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFigure out quarterback plans for 2026 (and beyond?)The name that comes up most often with Tagovailoa's impending departure is Russell Wilson. In 2024, the Broncos released Wilson, incurring a $53 million dead cap hit. That's still the record; Tagovailoa's $67.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 would shatter it.Sullivan and Hafley have a blank canvas here. Ewers looked like a seventh-round rookie playing out the string last year. If they want to give him another year -- or see what they have in Miller -- they could, but it would likely mean they're punting on the season. Since the NFL Draft shrunk to seven rounds in 1994, only one rookie drafted in the seventh round won double-digit games in his second year or earlier: Brock Purdy. If Sullivan and Hafley believe they have the next Purdy (and the next Kyle Shanahan in offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik), more power to them. In all likelihood, neither Ewers nor Miller is the answer.One of the main reasons the Broncos were able to rebound from the Wilson disaster is they had the 12th pick in the quarterback-rich 2024 draft. They selected Bo Nix and, alongside coach Sean Payton and a strong defense, emerged as one of the NFL's top teams in short order.The Dolphins don't have the luxury of a quarterback-rich draft. Fernando Mendoza is the only surefire first-round quarterback; the 2024 class had six quarterbacks in the top 12. Miami could opt for a mid-round quarterback if Sullivan and co. find one they like.Before that, though, the Dolphins will have opportunities in free agency. The most obvious tie is Malik Willis, who played well in relief of Jordan Love in Green Bay. Willis is a wild card in this class. Is he viewed as a bridge quarterback or one worthy of a sizable long-term contract? His play in Green Bay was admirable; it also came in very small doses and under a premier offensive mind in Matt LaFleur. If Sullivan and Hafley want to reunite with Willis, it will have to be at a cost that isn't prohibitive given the incoming financial implications of the Tagovailoa departure.Other options include a veteran who could provide a viable baseline -- think Wilson, Joe Flacco or Marcus Mariota -- or a trade for a low-end starter, like Mac Jones. Sullivan might be reticent to give up draft capital, though, and that would make sense given the situation.The best path forward could be a combination of sorts: a veteran plus a mid-round pick, neither of whom would preclude them from drafting a quarterback in 2027, when the quarterback pool is projected to be much stronger.Improve the trenches and the defensive secondaryIn a significant win for the Dolphins, Aaron Brewer came out of nowhere to be one of the NFL's premier centers in 2025. A second-team All-Pro, Brewer is 28 and has one more year left on his deal. He will be a key holdover for Miami in its new era. Left tackle Patrick Paul, a 2024 second-round pick, showed significant improvement in his second year, too.Around them, though, are major questions. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick in 2025, struggled mightily as a rookie. Right guard Cole Strange was marginally better. Right tackle Larry Borom was OK.\n2025 Dolphins OLPFF rankLT Patrick Paul43rd out of 84 OTsLG Jonah Savaiinaea79th out of 79 OGsC Aaron Brewer2nd out of 37 CsRG Cole Strange57th out of 79 OGsRT Larry Borom58th out of 84 OTsAn upgrade or two would help whomever plays quarterback in 2026 as well as De'Von Achane, who figures to be a fulcrum after a breakout 2025.The Dolphins have now moved on from both Chubb and Jaelan Phillips (traded to the Eagles at the deadline), two edge rushers who looked to be a significant part of Miami's future just a few months ago. Again, things change quickly in the NFL. Miami would love to see a bounce-back campaign from 2024 first-round pick Chop Robinson and a major leap from 2025 first-round pick Kenneth Grant. Absent those developments, there's a dearth of young talent on the defensive front -- another imposing challenge moving forward.The Dolphins could also use upgrades in the secondary around Minkah Fitzpatrick, who continues to provide solid play, if not his previous All-Pro level. Cornerback will be a major area of focus after injuries derailed the group in 2025.\nRealize it won't all happen in one yearLet's go back to the 2024 Broncos. As outlined above, this isn't the 2024 class at quarterback. The 2026 Dolphins also won't be the 2024 Broncos when it comes to young talent. Denver had three All-Pro defenders in cornerback Patrick Surtain II (the Defensive Player of the Year), edge rusher Nik Bonitto and defensive lineman Zach Allen. All were in their age-27 season or younger. If the Dolphins have one young defender become an All-Pro in 2026, it'd be a significant success in the short and long terms.One of the worst things an NFL team can do is lie to itself about where it is. Sullivan and Hafley need and deserve a long runway, and they need to use every inch of it. This is a roster in a bad spot in terms of current talent and means to acquire it. That's what happens when a $212 million bet on a quarterback goes bust, and the roster was already in a tenuous spot.Miami has its own first- and second-round picks and three third-round picks. That's five picks in the top 90. Before they even get there, though, they owe it to themselves to find the right free agent crop.\nIt doesn't have to be the \"best\" crop -- and it won't be. But it needs to be the right crop. Veterans who can establish a solid, dependable baseline and foster a culture for the youngsters. Swings on players in or approaching their primes who needed a change of scenery.Rome wasn't built in a day; Miami's new era won't be either. But with a smart, measured approach to free agency, hits in the draft and internal development, the Dolphins can gradually build toward a bright future -- something they haven't had in several years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The divorce between 2010s NFL All-Decade Team wide receiver Tyreek Hill and the Miami Dolphins finally came to fruition Monday, as the team announced his release.Hill, who will turn 32 on March 1, was set to carry a $51.1 million cap hit in 2026 -- the final year of a three-year, $90 million extension -- which would have given him the highest cap number among non-quarterbacks this coming season. He tore his ACL in Week 4 of the 2025 season against the New York Jets in late September, meaning he likely won't return until roughly a quarter of the way through the 2026 campaign.Those two factors led the Dolphins' new regime -- head coach Jeff Hafley and general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan -- to move on before free agency opens in March. The decision leaves Miami with $28.2 million in dead money, but it also creates $22.9 million in cap savings by jettisoning Hill now.After being acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 2022 season, Hill was arguably the NFL's most dominant receiver in his first two years in South Florida. From 2022 to 2023, he led the league in receiving yards (3,509) and receiving yards per game (106.3) while ranking second in receptions (238) and third in receiving touchdowns (20). His production began to tail off in 2024, and he ended that season by saying he was \"out\" after Miami's Week 18 loss to the Jets.\nTyreek Hill's career with Dolphins2022-232024-25Games played3321Receptions238102Receiving yards per game106.3*58.3Receiving yards per reception14.712.0Receiving yards3,509*1,225Receiving touchdowns207* Led NFL While there's a lot working against Hill, he should still command a free-agent market. His 11,363 career receiving yards rank ninth-most by a player in his first 10 seasons in NFL history, and his 28 touchdowns of 50 yards or longer are the fourth-most all time. Only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice (36), three-time Pro Bowler DeSean Jackson (34) and Hall of Famer Randy Moss (29) have more.So where could Hill land in 2026? Here's a look at six potential landing spots for the five-time first-team All-Pro.\n        \n            \n                What's next for Dolphins after Tyreek Hill, Bradley Chubb releases? Tua Tagovailoa's future, new roster moves\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThis is the obvious one. The Chiefs have salary cap work to do to become compliant before the new league year begins March 11, but a reunion makes sense. Since trading Hill in 2022, Kansas City hasn't had a true No. 1 wide receiver alongside future Hall of Fame tight end Travis Kelce.Hill accounted for just over 25% of Kansas City's receiving yards in his final two seasons there (2020–21). Since his departure, Kelce leads the team at 22.7%, with wide receiver Rashee Rice second at just 10.2%.Hill and quarterback Patrick Mahomes would also be returning from ACL injuries suffered in 2025, potentially putting their timelines in sync. Hill tweeted about his intrigue regarding offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy's return to Kansas City. With Kelce possibly entering his final season in 2026, the Chiefs could reunite their championship trio for one last ride.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills If a Chiefs reunion doesn't materialize, the wide receiver-needy Bills could call their former rival to help quarterback Josh Allen. Khalil Shakir led Buffalo with just 719 receiving yards in 2025, and the team's receiver usage was unstable, with a league-high eight players logging 100-plus snaps.Like Kansas City, Buffalo must navigate cap constraints, but Allen's elite arm talent could entice both sides in a shared push for Super Bowl relevance.Hill also tweeted sympathy for the Bills following their overtime playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, so perhaps he wouldn't need much persuading to join Buffalo.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersHill to the Chargers makes sense on several levels. Financially, Los Angeles can afford it, entering the offseason with $78.6 million in effective cap space. That's second-most in the NFL, per Over the Cap.Quarterback Justin Herbert's arm strength is another draw. His 24,820 passing yards rank second-most through a player's first six seasons, trailing only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning (24,885).There's also scheme familiarity: former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel now serves as the Chargers' offensive coordinator. Hill could step into a system he already knows and produce quickly once healthy. Hill even tweeted that McDaniel's move to Los Angeles caught his attention.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersThe Raiders are primed for an offensive overhaul after hiring Super Bowl LX champion Klint Kubiak as head coach following his title run as Seattle's offensive coordinator.They also hold the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, widely expected to become Indiana national championship-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner.Las Vegas already features 2024 No. 6 pick running back Ashton Jeanty and 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, plus $76.99 million in effective cap space, third-most in the NFL.Hill would also fit Kubiak's system since the new head coach also worked as a San Francisco 49ers assistant coach under Kyle Shanahan -- just like McDaniel did before thriving with Hill in Miami. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots The Patriots won the AFC but ran out of steam in Super Bowl LX, falling behind 19-0 in an eventual 29-13 loss to Seattle. Hill could inject needed explosiveness into a receiver room led by Stefon Diggs, who is currently dealing with legal issues. After Diggs' 1,013 receiving yards and tight end Hunter Henry's 768, Kayshon Boutte ranked next among Patriots wideouts with 551 yards in 2025.Hill has shown interest in New England, tweeting his happiness after their AFC title. The Patriots also have $36.9 million in effective cap space -- 11th-most in the NFL -- and could make another win-now move while Drake Maye remains on his rookie deal.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersThe 49ers ran out of bodies in 2025, a season that ended with a 41-6 divisional-round loss in Seattle. San Francisco lost 270 player games to injury -- the most of any playoff team -- and the attrition showed in the biggest games.\nReceiver uncertainty looms, with Jauan Jennings set for free agency and Brandon Aiyuk missing in action. Brock Purdy still delivered elite efficiency, however, despite missing eight games with a turf toe injury: 58.3% of his third- and fourth-down pass attempts combined produced first downs, the highest rate in the last 35 seasons, per CBS Sports Research.San Francisco enters the offseason with $37.5 million in effective cap space (10th-most). Hill fits the team's win-now window with Christian McCaffrey still producing and Trent Williams still chasing a title. Hill played for a Shanahan acolyte in Mike McDaniel. In San Francisco, he'd play for the architect of the offensive system that helped him soar in Miami.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ilia Malinin came into the 2026 Winter Olympics as the heavy favorite to win gold in the men's figure skating competition, but after a disastrous free skate routine that included two falls and other miscues, the 21-year-old American found himself off the podium entirely. Malinin is far from the first star to struggle living up to expectations at the Olympics, as the weight of the moment can present challenges for even the most talented athletes. While Malinin won't have another chance to capture a medal at this year's games, he will skate one more time at the closing exhibition on February 21 that ends the figure skating competition. On Monday, Malinin posted a video on social media teasing a routine for that exhibition that will explore the mental battle of dealing with that kind of pressure and what he called \"an inevitable crash.\" \n\n\"On the world's biggest stage, those who appear the strongest may still be fighting invisible battles on the inside,\" wrote Malinin. \"Even your happiest memories can end up tainted by the noise. Vile online hatred attacks the mind and fear lures it into the darkness, no matter how hard you try to stay sane through the endless insurmountable pressure. It all builds up as these moments flash before your eyes, resulting in an inevitable crash. This is that version of the story.\"Malinin admitted prior to the short program that he was feeling the nerves of the moment, but went out and put together a tremendous routine that put him on top of the standings by more than five points heading into the free skate. The widespread assumption was that he'd back that up with another strong performance and run away with the gold, but he hints at mental struggles that clouded his ability to perform at the level we've grown accustomed to from the consensus best male figure skater in the world over the last three years. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn speaking with reporters after the competition, Malinin explained that he was overwhelmed with negative thoughts as he stood at center ice waiting to begin his routine. \"The nerves just went, so overwhelming,\" he said, \"and especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head. So many negative thoughts that flooded into there and I could not handle it.\"It was clear watching that Malinin wasn't his normal self from the start, as he bailing on two of his four opening quad attempts, and things spiraled from there with a pair of falls as he never got into his typical rhythm. While Malinin is a three-time world champion, the Olympic pressure was something totally foreign to the 21-year-old, and the knowledge that a four-minute skate will define the next four years of your career can be, understandably, overwhelming. \nNow the challenge for Malinin is to shake that off and continue his dominance on the ice while waiting four more years for his chance at Olympic redemption. His approach appears to be to steer into the skid and tell the story of what went wrong through his skating, which will start with Saturday's closing exhibition. \n            ",

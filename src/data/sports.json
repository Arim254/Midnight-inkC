    "body": "\n        Jon Scheyer had a painstakingly long offseason to think about just how slim the margins are between victory and defeat. The nightmares of blowing a 14-point lead in the Final Four to Houston, including a last minute from the depths of hell, will never fully go away.One has to wonder if those all-too-familiar thoughts started to reverberate on Tuesday when No. 15 Florida erased a 15-point deficit to take a 66-64 lead with 35 ticks remaining on a Boogie Fland pull-up trey. Ten seconds prior, Pat Ngongba had taken one of the most ill-advised shots a Duke player had taken all season to crack open the window for a gutsy Florida comeback.This time, Duke made those three big plays in winning time that befell it last April in the Alamodome. Jon Scheyer dialed up a ghost screen for Cameron Boozer to find Isaiah Evans for the go-ahead triple. Caleb Foster, like the veteran warrior he's becoming, turned it up to force a Boogie Fland turnover, and Maliq Brown deflected a Duke inbound pass to seal a victory at the buzzer.No. 4 Duke 67, No. 15 Florida 66.\nStacking winning plays. Games like Tuesday can prove to operate as daily deposits for a young team like these Blue Devils to learn what it takes (and what to avoid) to beat desperate outfits like Florida.\nNot only did Duke improve to 9-0, but it found a closer. Duke's late-game offense was a source of frustration multiple times a year ago, but Boozer showed the toughness and smarts to be an ultra-valuable fulcrum in crunch time. His nothing-but-net trey with 2:10 remaining was enormous. So was his strong left-hand drive and finish over Florida's Rueben Chinyelu, who is aptly described as a mountain of a man. Boozer poured in 29 points to go along with six rebounds and two more dimes. He entered the night averaging over 33 points created a night. He scored 29 and assisted on six more points to finish with a mind-blowing 35 points created. It's one of the top marks in all of the sport. Scheyer also showed just how far he's come. Duke scored 18 monster points after timeouts in this one. That's tied for the most of any game of the Scheyer era. Duke not only has one of the most talented rosters in the sport, but it also has one sharp offensive coordinator in Scheyer. Hopefully, the ice packs and ice baths in Durham are up to par because the Blue Devils will need 'em to heal up from Tuesday's brawl ahead of Saturday's showdown with ultra-physical No. 8 Michigan State.\nThey'll head to East Lansing with an unblemished record and a defined closer in its bullpen. Oh, what a glorious feeling that must be.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The penultimate edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State maintaining its grip on the No. 1 spot ahead of Indiana for the fourth straight week as a new team moved into the top four, set to receive a bye through the first round of the bracket. It was a Lone Star State fiasco during Rivalry Week as Texas A&M fell on the road to Texas, vaulting Texas Tech into the No. 4 spot behind Georgia, which moved up one spot, with conference championship games still to play.  The Red Raiders, which have never participated in the playoff, are in the midst of a tremendous 11-1 season under fourth-year coach Joey McGuire. Their 29-7 win over BYU stands as the feather in their cap with the Big 12 Championship Game ahead.  Meanwhile, the reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024). Ohio State will match up with Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game seeking to go wire-to-wire in the No. 1 spot.  The Buckeyes toppled rival Michigan, 27-9, on Saturday for their first win in The Game since 2019. The Hoosiers demolished Purdue, 56-3, to set up one of the most anticipated clashes in the sport this season.  \nThe Bulldogs is set to play Alabama in the SEC Championship Game with it appearing as if the Crimson Tide have locked up an at-large bid given they moved in front of Notre Dame for the No. 9 spot.  Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 12, takes the 11th projected bid from the CFP Selection Committee as the highest-rated team from the ACC. However, it will be Virginia squaring off with Duke in the ACC Championship Game, which will award the league's automatic bid as the fourth-highest rated conference title winner. The Hurricanes will have a chance to earn a bid as an at-large team.  Tulane claims the last of the 12 committee-projected playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 20. However, the Green Wave will face North Texas in the American Championship game with the winner earning a bid given the 12-team playoff model grants automatic entry to the five highest-ranked conference champions.  \nJames Madison is ranked for the first time this week at No. 25. JMU could earn a second Group of Five bid if it wins the Sun Belt and Duke beats UVA in the ACC title game.        College Football Playoff Rankings, Dec. 2  * First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five team  Ohio State (12-0) *Indiana (12-0) *Georgia (11-1) *Texas Tech (11-1) *Oregon (11-1) ~Ole Miss (11-1) ~Texas A&M (11-1) ~Oklahoma (10-2) ~Alabama (10-2)Notre Dame (10-2)BYU (11-1)Miami (FL) (10-2)Texas (9-3)Vanderbilt (10-2)Utah (10-2)USC (9-3)Virginia (10-2)Arizona (9-3)Michigan (9-3)Tulane (10-2) ^Houston (9-3)Georgia Tech (9-3)Iowa (8-4)North Texas (11-1)James Madison (11-1)Ole Miss secures home game despite Lane Kiffin's exitAt No. 6 in the updated rankings, the Rebels (11-1) are locked into a first-round home game following Kiffin's departure to LSU. Committee chair Hunter Yurachek previously stated that Kiffin leaving the school for another job would create a new \"data point\" for the committee, but Ole Miss' overall grade was not diminished as a result. Several members of the coaching staff are staying through the postseason, including offensive assistant Charlie Weis Jr., who will call plays in Kiffin's absence. Weis followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge on Sunday but has returned to Ole Miss temporarily to help quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and this offense see it through in the playoff. CBS Sports reported over the weekend the promotion of Pete Golding to head coach was due in part to keep much of what remained of the Rebels' coaching staff intact ahead of the penultimate playoff rankings reveal. Keeping Ole Miss in a first-round home game designation will reportedly generate more than $60 million for Oxford, Mississippi. Kiffin said Sunday he requested to remain with the Rebels through the playoff, but athletic director Keith Carter refused. If the current seeding stands, Ole Miss will host the No. 11 seed -- perhaps the ACC champion -- on Dec. 19 or 20 in the opening round.\nACC vs. Group of FiveNo. 17 Virginia can make it easy on the committee this weekend with a win over Duke in the ACC Championship Game, but a doomsday scenario is on the table for the conference if the Blue Devils upset the Cavaliers. That could bring 25th-ranked James Madison -- the projected champion of the Sun Belt -- into the conversation. If the Dukes beat Troy for a conference title, they could get the 12-seed in Sunday's final bracket with the winner of Tulane-North Texas in the American garnering the No. 11 designation. No. 20 Tulane remains the committee's highest-ranked Group of Five team for the second consecutive week. Looking closer at the metrics, there's a possibility that Duke's strength-of-schedule edge over JMU could potentially put the Blue Devils -- with five losses -- in the playoff if they're ranked higher than the 12-win Dukes on Sunday afternoon should both teams win this weekend. Duke was not ranked in Tuesday's poll.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why James Madison at No. 25 could spell disaster for the ACC\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCommittee avoids SEC distrust  Alabama's push ahead from No. 10 to No. 9 Tuesday night ahead of Notre Dame means the Crimson Tide (10-2) are safe, independent of Saturday afternoon's result in the SEC Championship Game against third-ranked Georgia. Now, the committee will not have to answer any questions concerning the idea of a three-loss SEC title game loser being left out of the bracket after this decision. If Alabama wins, we're projecting the Crimson Tide to move into first-round bye status with Georgia hosting in the first round. Previously unbeaten Texas A&M sliding to No. 7 was expected after its loss to Texas. The Aggies' lone ranked win this season against a team currently slotted inside the committee's top 25 came at Notre Dame on Sept. 13.\nBYU's simple missionAt No. 11 behind Notre Dame and ahead of Miami, the Cougars are in with a win over Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. It appears that's the only direct path for two representatives from the conference. Cougars coach Kalani Sitake will be able to maintain his focus on getting this team to the playoff the rest of the week following an extension -- thanks to Crumbl's CEO and other boosters stepping up to keep him -- in wake of his flirtation with Penn State. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark suggested a blind resume grading system Tuesday afternoon ahead of the reveal, effectively backing BYU's at-large stance in case the Cougars fall in their finale. The committee has spoken, however, and that's not going to matter if Texas Tech beats BYU for a second time. \"Let's not look at logos. Let's look at résumés,\" Yormark said. \"Any blind résumé comparison has BYU in the top 10. No question about it. In comparison with Notre Dame as an example, BYU has a better overall record, better strength of record and better strength of schedule. I am confident that the CFP will get it right for BYU.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent starter Cody Ponce on a three-year pact worth $30 million, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Ponce is the second starter the Blue Jays have added in the past week. They also officially announced their seven-year deal with Dylan Cease, a $210 million pact that's the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the Toronto franchise. Ponce, 31, has not pitched at the MLB level since 2021. He spent last season with the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization, starting 29 times and amassing a 1.89 ERA and a 6.15 strikeout-to-walk ratio. CBS Sports ranked Ponce as the 45th-best player on the market. Here's what we wrote at the time:Ponce, 32 come April, will return stateside after spending a few years overseas, first in Japan and then in South Korea. He'll look nothing like he did during his first 20 career MLB appearances. These days, he's capable of touching into the upper-90s with his heater and throws, among other secondaries, a quality splitter. There are enough KBO-to-MLB pitching success stories -- ranging from someone with staying power, in Merrill Kelly, to more fleeting cases, like Erick Fedde and Chris Flexen -- to envision a team giving Ponce a rotation spot on a multi-year pact to demonstrate where he lands on that spectrum.Here's more to know about the Ponce signing.The Blue Jays have a rotation surplusIn addition to Cease and Ponce, the Blue Jays had Shane Bieber remain in his contract rather than execute an opt-out clause and enter free agency. Factor in Kevin Gausman, star rookie Trey Yesavage, and José Berríos, and Toronto has the luxury of having more capable starters than rotation slots. And that's without mentioning Bowden Francis, who has started nearly 30 times the past two years, or Eric Lauer, who had a 3.18 ERA in 104 innings in 2025.PitcherIPERASO/BBKevin Gausman1933.593.78Trey Yesavage (MLB)143.212.29Shane Bieber40.13.575.29José Berríos1664.172.46Dylan Cease1684.553.03Cody Ponce (KBO)180.21.896.15Of course, that's a good problem to have at this or any point in time because it gives the Blue Jays options and contingency plans. They can entertain trading from that group, and they can toy with shifting a couple members to the bullpen. They can also enter camp knowing that if and when an injury happens -- and pitchers are known for getting hurt on occasion -- they have internal backups already in place.\nKeep in mind, the Blue Jays didn't have that luxury entering last year, when they had to rush to sign Spencer Turnbull and José Ureña to serve as stopgaps on an injury-ravaged staff.Bullpen, shortstop remain questions for AL champsWhat else do the defending American League champions need to do this winter? A few things.Foremost, the Blue Jays have been linked to most of the high-leverage relievers of note, including right-hander Pete Fairbanks. It stands to reason they'll attempt to add quality instead of quantity to their relief corps. That's because Toronto is starting to run into a numbers game with its pitching staff. With Ponce included, the Blue Jays now have nine pitchers who cannot be optioned to the minors. If Yesavage is part of the Opening Day rotation -- and you would assume he is -- then Toronto really has only three \"flex\" spots, depending on how they proceed with the rest of the winter. \nElsewhere, the Blue Jays have to figure out if they're going to retain free agent Bo Bichette, turn to an internal replacement, or try to land a new shortstop from outside the organization. Bichette, considered one of the best free agents available, hasn't yet generated much rumor mill buzz ahead of the start of next week's Winter Meetings. Should the Blue Jays stay in house, the path of least resistance would have them slide Andrés Giménez to short and install Ernie Clement at second base. \n            ",

Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday, per NFL Media. The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.\n        \n            \n                Vikings release Adam Thielen: Minnesota parts ways with veteran WR, who wants larger role before retiring\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            \n    ",

The Steelers have reportedly filled Slay's roster spot with Asante Samuel Jr., who made his season debut during Pittsburgh's Week 13 loss to the Buffalo Bills.  A six-time Pro Bowler, Slay was part of the Steelers' re-vamped secondary that also included the acquisition of seven-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Injuries, however, and inconsistent performances ultimately led to Slay losing his starting job to James Pierre prior to Pittsburgh's Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Slay was a healthy scratch during this past Sunday's 26-7 loss to Buffalo. Slay's release comes just several weeks after Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said that -- when healthy -- Slay would continue to remain in the starting lineup. Hours before releasing Slay, Tomlin said that him being a healthy scratch this past Sunday was less about Slay and more about him wanting to give Samuel (a former second-round pick who joined Pittsburgh's practice squad last month) an opportunity to play. \nWhile Slay begins the process of looking for his next opportunity, the Steelers will once again have to made sudden adjustments to a secondary that has already gone through through a myriad of them through the season's first 12 weeks. Pittsburgh started the season with Slay, Ramsey and Joey Porter Jr. as their starting cornerbacks and Juan Thornhill and DeShon Elliott as their starting safeties. On Sunday, Pierre is slated to continue starting alongside Porter and Brandin Echols, who entered the starting lineup after Ramsey was moved to free safety after Thornhill was released. Kyle Dugger, who was acquired via a trade with the New England Patriots on Oct. 31, has replaced an injured Elliott at starting strong safety. \nThe Steelers' pass defense -- which is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed -- will face another stiff test Sunday in Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has also faced his share of struggles this season. Over his past four games, Jackson has completed well under 60% of his pass attempts with just one touchdown and three interceptions. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The most significant ranking in the penultimate College Football Playoff Rankings had nothing to do with Miami or Texas. Instead, the playoff committee showed their hand. With the final spot in the rankings, the CFP Committee ranked James Madison at No. 25 in the country. The Dukes are 11-1 and face Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game on Friday. By winning, James Madison can all but assure itself a spot in the final rankings for the first time in program history. But if JMU accomplishes the feat and finishes as a ranked conference champion, it could set off a nightmare scenario for the ACC that would leave them out of the playoff entirely. For clarity, let's go back to the protocol. The top five conference champions are guaranteed auto bids in the College Football Playoff field. It's very specifically the top five conference champions; the Power Four conferences are not implicitly guaranteed a spot. Technically, all five spots could be taken by Group of Six champions, if they were earned in the rankings. \nWhen the CFP bracket is mocked, No. 12 Miami plays the role of the fourth conference champion auto-bid. There's just one problem: The Hurricanes -- the best team in the ACC -- aren't eligible for the auto-bid. In fact, thanks to a bloated conference and convoluted set of tiebreakers, unranked Duke plays No. 17 Virginia for the ACC crown. And in Duke, the ACC has its perfect, disastrous storm. The Blue Devils had a lackluster season, limping out to a 7-5 record. Three of those losses came in nonconference play, with horrendous performances against Illinois, Tulane and UConn. But when it comes to conference contention, none of those games matter. Duke's only losses came against Georgia Tech and Virginia. And therefore, Duke is now in the ACC Championship Game as one of the weakest conference finalists in years. As only 3.5-point underdogs, the Blue Devils have a serious chance of pulling the upset. But with five losses, Duke would be all but guaranteed to finish behind both the American Conference champion and Sun Belt champ James Madison, despite winning a power conference championship. \nIf James Madison was unranked, it would be easy for the committee to sit back and say that they consider the Blue Devils and Dukes as comparable teams. A win over No. 17 Virginia would supersede any on JMU's schedule. But by ranking James Madison, the committee has shown their hand. James Madison is a top 25 team in the eyes of the committee. Duke is not. And furthermore, based on their resume, the Blue Devils aren't anywhere close. If Duke wins the ACC, the conference could become the first power league to ever miss the 12-team College Football Playoff. At the Group of Six level, conferences are much more sensitive about tiebreaker rules setting up their teams for failure. Some work around it with blatant playoff-driven advantages. The primary tiebreaker in the American Conference is simply CFP Rankings. Even though No. 24 North Texas has a better record, No. 20 Tulane is hosting the title game for the express purpose of giving them an easier path to the playoff. Not so in the ACC. \nSMU was painfully close to helping the league avoid this fate. The Mustangs led California late in the fourth quarter on Saturday night. A win would have elevated SMU and Virginia as 7-1 teams. Instead, the Mustangs' loss pushed them into a five-way tie for second. And coming out of the tiebreaker -- combined conference opponent record -- was perhaps the weakest team in the group. Virginia is favored to win the ACC Championship Game on Saturday. If the Cavaliers do, they'll easily slot into the CFP with the No. 11 seed. Their chances wouldn't be great in a road game against No. 6 Ole Miss, but at least the ACC would send a champion to the postseason. But thanks to James Madison's No. 25 ranking, the ACC is officially on the hot seat. A Duke conference championship would spell disaster for the league, and end with two Group of Six teams in the field for the first time ever. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Days ahead of the Big 12 Championship Game between BYU and Texas Tech, the Cougars have agreed to a long-term contract extension with coach Kalani Sitake. Sitake emerged as the target of Penn State's search on Monday, per multiple sources. He was offered by the Nittany Lions and momentum seemed to be trending toward the 50-year-old taking the Penn State job. However, sources told CBS Sports that BYU made an aggressive push over the last 24 hours to keep Sitake home. That culminated Tuesday when BYU announced its new deal with Sitake. \"We are excited to announce a long-term agreement to extend Kalani Sitake as BYU's head football coach,\" athletic director Brian Santiago said. \"He is a proven leader, and we are grateful he is once again choosing BYU. His legacy of building a championship program the BYU way will continue on. He is one of the best people in the business. We are excited to continue to ride the wave of positive momentum with him.\"All of this came to a head the day before the start of the early signing period and just a few days out from BYU's first appearance in the Big 12 title game. The 11th-ranked Cougars (11-1) remain a strong College Football Playoff contender and would clinch a spot in the 12-team bracket with a win over No. 4 Texas Tech on Saturday. Amid all the Penn State discourse that emerged Monday, Sitake met with his team, per a source. He didn't shoot down the Penn State rumors in that meeting. \n\n        \n            \n                Penn State's cookie problem: Crumbl CEO, other BYU donors make push to keep Kalani Sitake in Provo\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut the BYU donor base has deep pockets, including Crumbl founder Jason McGowan, and they rallied to keep Sitake, an alumnus of the program, for the foreseeable future. \"I am humbled and full of gratitude for the outpouring of love from BYU fans and the trust and support provided to our football program by our university leadership,\" Sitake said. \"I'm thankful to President Shane Reese, Vice President Keith Vorkink and our Athletic Director Brian Santiago and his leadership team for the confidence they continue to place in me to lead our program and to take care of our players, coaches and staff. This is good for the stability and future of BYU football. I'm excited about our future.\" Sitake is in Year 10 with the Cougars and has a 83-44 overall record with the school. He helped BYU navigate the transition to the Big 12 in 2023. The Cougars are 22-3 over the last two seasons. \nPenn State's coaching search has been a labored and secretive process, with a wide range of candidates rumored. Coaches who have been linked with the process include those like Vanderbilt's Clark Lea, Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz and Nebraska's Matt Rhule. All three have received contract extensions since the job opened. Interim head coach Terry Smith has also been a factor in the search.  \n            ",

The height of Brown's offensive success with his tempo-based NASCAR philosophy came in 2017 when he lifted Troy to a win over LSU, snapping the Tigers' 46-game non-conference home winning streak. The Trojans went on to finish with an 11–2 overall record, the program's best regular-season finish since joining the FBS in 2001.Before his time at Troy, Brown served as the offensive coordinator at Texas Tech and Kentucky.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Neal Brown as our next head football coach,\" Mosley said. \"Neal is a proven leader who builds programs with integrity, vision and an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of elevating rosters, developing talent and producing results in highly competitive leagues makes him an ideal fit for North Texas. We are confident that his leadership will position the Mean Green for sustained success, and we look forward to the impact he and his family will have on our program and our community for years to come.\"\n            ",

The deal will keep him in Lubbock through the 2032 season and pay McGuire more than $7 million annually by its conclusion, with incentives that could push his total compensation even higher. The contract comes as the No. 5 Red Raiders prepare to face No. 11 BYU in the Big 12 Championship Game this Saturday. Texas Tech enters at 11-1, marking the program's first appearance in the conference title game. With their record and strong résumé, the Red Raiders are considered essentially locked into the College Football Playoff regardless of the outcome. McGuire, who is in his fifth season at Texas Tech, has steadily built the program into a contender, and this year has been a long-awaited breakthrough for the Red Raiders. Off the field, the school's aggressive investment in NIL deals and revenue-sharing has helped attract and retain top-level talent, a key factor in the team's turnaround. Texas Tech brought in the No. 2 transfer portal class in the country last cycle, according to 247Sports. Hired before the 2022 season, McGuire owns a 34-17 overall record at Texas Tech, leading the program to bowl appearances each year -- only the second coach in school history to do so after the late Mike Leach. His 24 wins in the Big 12 are the most among any current conference team, and Texas Tech is the only program to post an above-.500 conference record each year during that span. \nBefore taking the Texas Tech job, McGuire established himself as one of Texas' top high school coaches, spending more than a decade leading Cedar Hill High School. During his tenure, he turned a struggling program into a state powerhouse, winning three state titles, reaching four championship games, and making the playoffs 12 consecutive seasons.  His success at the high school level earned him a role at Baylor, where he served as an assistant in various roles. McGuire helped improve the Bears' defense and strengthened the recruiting pipeline, further cementing his reputation as a developer of talent and a skilled recruiter. \nThe new contract reflects the program's rising profile and McGuire's success, cementing his place at the helm as Texas Tech seeks to make a run in both the Big 12 and the College Football Playoff. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other ",
    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Nats listening on MacKenzie Gore The Nationals under new lead decision-maker Paul Toboni are listening to trade offers on 26-year-old lefty MacKenzie Gore, ESPN reports, but they're not inclined to move him unless they get a particularly strong proposal. \nGore is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he earned his first All-Star selection, but he faded badly down the stretch. One of the key return pieces in the 2022 trade that sent Juan Soto to the Padres, Gore has an ERA+ of 98 across four MLB seasons. He's under team control through the end of the 2027 season. Reds remain in on SchwarberCount the Reds as one of the teams still pursuing designated hitter Kyle Schwarber, according to MLB.com. Cincinnati would like to upgrade an offense that ranked in the middle of the pack in runs scored and in the bottom 10 in park-adjusted offense last season. For whatever it's worth -- and the answer is, usually, \"not much\" -- Schwarber happens to from Ohio. The Phillies, Mets, and Red Sox, among others, are also believed to be involved in the bidding on Schwarber, suggesting he may have to take a serious hometown discount if he's to end up with Cincinnati. \nBrewers inclined to keep PeraltaAfter the Brewers signaled that they may be looking to trim payroll ahead of the 2026 season, many justifiably assumed that ace Freddy Peralta might be on the trade block this winter. While that might yet be the case, ESPN reports that the Brewers for now are inclined to hold the line and enter the 2026 season with Peralta at the front end of a strong rotation that also includes Brandon Woodruff, Jacob Misiorowski, and Quinn Priester. Edwin Díaz return still a possibility for MetsThe Mets' signing of high-leverage reliever Devin Williams gives them an option at closer for 2026 and beyond, but the Williams addition doesn't mean a reunion with Edwin Díaz is out of the question. \nDiscussions with Díaz are ongoing, but to get a deal the two sides will need to bridge a gap in terms of contract length, the Athletic reports. Díaz's side is angling for five years coming off a stellar 2025, but the Mets would prefer not to commit more than three years to the right-hander who's going into his age-32 campaign. Notably, Williams is willing to work in a setup role, which at least in theory clears the decks for a Díaz return. First, though, comes the much more significant hurdle of agreeing to terms. \nWillson Contreras willing to consider tradeCardinals catcher-turned-first baseman Willson Contreras has for some time said he prefers to remain with St. Louis through what's taking shape as a significant rebuild. However, the Athletic reports that stance has changed and Contreras is now willing to consider waiving his no-trade clause for a deal to a contender.\nContreras in 2026 had an OPS+ of 123 with excellent quality-of-contact indicators. He's signed through 2027 and owed $36.5 million over the final two years of his contract. He moved off of the catcher position last season in order to reduce wear and tear and to give way to the Cardinals' glut of catching prospects arriving in the majors. A willingness to return to catching on a part-time basis would likely enhance Contreras' trade value, but it's not yet known whether that's a consideration. Angels add ManoahThe Angels are signing right-hander Alek Manoah to a one-year pact worth less than $2 million, according to ESPN. Manoah, 27, did not pitch in the majors last season and has seldom been healthy and productive at the same time since finishing in third place in the American League's Cy Young Award race in 2022. He figures to compete for a rotation spot next spring.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It looks like the Oregon Ducks will see both of their coordinators leave for head-coaching jobs at the end of their College Football Playoff run, as Tosh Lupoi is on the verge of returning to his alma mater to be the next coach at Cal, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Lupoi, the defensive coordinator for Dan Lanning ever since he took over at Oregon in 2022, has emerged as the top target of Cal's search after the school fired Justin Wilcox. Lupoi, 44, played defensive line at Cal from 2000-05 and began his coaching career as Cal's defensive line coach from 2008-11. From there, he worked as a defensive assistant at Washington and Alabama before stints as the defensive line coach for three NFL teams -- the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars. At Alabama, Lupoi worked his way up from an analyst in 2014 to defensive coordinator in 2018 under Nick Saban, earning a reputation as a strong recruiter. His defense at Oregon has been among the best in the country, finishing the 2025 regular season eighth nationally in scoring defense at 14.8 points per game allowed. Should the deal be finalized, Lupoi will head back down the coast to Berkeley to take over a Cal team that finished 7-5 this season, but general manager Ron Rivera fired Wilcox after nine seasons at the helm following an embarrassing 31-10 rivalry loss to Stanford on Nov. 23. Wilcox had a 48-55 overall record at Cal, including a combined 12-12 (5-10 ACC) mark in two seasons since the program transitioned from the Pac-12 to the ACC. \n\n        \n            \n                Kentucky hires Will Stein: Wildcats tab Oregon offensive coordinator after firing Mark Stoops\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe first order of business for Lupoi will be attempting to keep star freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele from entering the transfer portal. Sagapolutele completed 63.6% of his passes for 3,116 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a true freshman starter, at times putting a tantalizing display of talent on the field that points to an extremely bright future. If Lupoi can keep Sagapolutele as a Golden Bear, he'll have a great chance to hit the ground running with a team that can compete in the ACC. Cal will expect Lupoi to be able to improve their defense that finished the season 76th in the country in scoring defense, allowing 26.5 points per game. \nLanning now faces the challenge many top programs do after finding consistent success, as he has to replace both of his coordinators. Along with Lupoi's looming departure to Cal, offensive coordinator Will Stein is returning to his home state of Kentucky to coach the Wildcats, and Lanning will have to identify two new coordinators to take over for the Ducks in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Vanderbilt has landed a historic recruiting win as five-star quarterback Jared Curtis flipped to the Commodores from Georgia, 247Sports' Tom Loy reports. Curtis, the No. 3 player in the Top247 rankings, becomes by far the best recruit in program history. The Nashville native was recruited by nearly every program in the country and committed to Georgia in May over a bevy of offers. However, Vanderbilt's breakout season was hard to ignore for the star, who preps at Nashville Christian. Earlier in the day, Curtis took to social media to express his frustration at his decision leaking early to the media. But later in the day on Tuesday, Curtis confirmed his commitment to Vanderbilt. \"This morning I was really disappointed to see some media put it out there that I flipped from Georgia to Vandy,\" Curtis said as part of a statement posted to social media. \"I actually hadn't told anyone my final decision, not even my parents or agent. I wanted to talk to the coaches from both staffs after school and practice were over, and have one last heart to heart with my family before making an announcement. Never had a chance and that was really disappointing.\nI haven't said much the past couple months, obviously there's been a lot going on, but I just wanted to control what I could on the field and focus on winning another chip with my boys. And that's what we've been preparing to do on Thursday.I do love Georgia, I love the coaches and players there. They have been so good to me and my family. I know they would do everything to help me be successful. They have been the best program in the country for a reason. The past year it's where I wanted to be and definitely where my parents have wanted me to go. That's part of what makes this so hard. You try to make everyone who has been good to you and done so much for you happy, and when you can't it sucks. But I gotta walk my path that feels right in my heart, at the end of the day this has to be my decision.Being here in Nashville and seeing what Vandy has been doing this season has been amazing and over the past few weeks, I felt more and more that I wanna be a part of that, to be close to home, to play in front of my family and friends and to be what I love to be, an underdog. I am excited to be a Dore and excited to be part of building something here at home with Coach Lea.\"\nNow, Curtis is next in line to replace star quarterback Diego Pavia. The Commodores posted a breakout 10-win season in 2025, putting themselves on the edge of the College Football Playoff. Pavia is the betting favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. As a junior, Curtis exploded for 2,830 yards, 40 touchdowns and three interceptions with 18 rushing scores. Ironically, 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins compares Curtis to Vanderbilt legend Jay Cutler. In a scouting report, Ivins noted that Curtis could be a candidate to start as a true freshman; that could work perfectly for Vanderbilt as the Commodores lose star quarterback Diego Pavia to graduation. \"Gifted quarterback prospect with the arm, size, creativity and swagger to emerge as a high-level distributor for a College Football Playoff contender,\" Ivins wrote. \"Can paint all different corners of the field as he generates easy torque with a rapid and upper-body heavy release. Likes to operate from a sturdy base, but is more than capable of serving up accurate off-platform tosses with his balance.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\nWeek 13 was tough for favorites, with the Chiefs, Ravens, Eagles and Rams notably losing to seemingly inferior opponents. However, if you tailed SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman's favorites money line parlay for Week 13 you did not get hurt by any of those upsets. On the flip side, more underdogs winning means the potential for the underdog money line parlay to also be a factor as the 2025 NFL regular season nears its conclusion.If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 14, you need to see what Hochman has to say. He's put together two money line parlays for Week 14, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 14 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a 3-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL moneyline favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-2024, NFL moneyline favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 13, NFL betting favorites faced challenges, finishing with a record of 9 wins and 7 losses, with four of those defeats occurring on Thursday and Friday. So far this season, favorites have won 133 of 193 games, for an overall success rate of 68.9%. What does this imply for Week 14? Will the favorites continue to dominate as they did on Sunday and Monday? Take a look at Jeff's top moneyline parlays featuring favorites and underdogs.Cleveland Browns over Tennessee TitansI am entirely out on the Titans. Last week was a great spot and they absolutely laid an egg. The Browns should bounce back after some stupid, silly gaffes and coaching decisions last week against the 49ers. Cleveland is ranked ninth in third-down defense, 10th in red zone defense, and 11th in opponent passer rating, far ahead of the Titans. Both teams have flawed offenses but the Browns defense is a real difference-maker.Cleveland is significantly better in every key defensive metric and far ahead at pressuring QBs (Myles Garrett advantage). Tennessee's offense and offensive line are the NFL's worst by most advanced metrics. Both offenses average under five yards per play, near-league worst marks, and both teams play at slow paces, so you might want to take a hard look at the Under. The Browns' defensive front (Garrett, Collins, Graham) should dominate the Titans' poor offensive line, creating short fields and third-down stops.My betting model predicts the Browns to win by five points, with an average total of 30 points. Cleveland wins with a final score of 17-13.Kansas City Chiefs over Houston TexansThis is another good spot for the home team to at least get a victory. We have a dome team playing in extreme cold (high in the low 20s). C.J. Stroud played well (19-for-28, 245 yards, 0 TD) in similar conditions in last year's AFC Divisional round, where the Chiefs won 23-14 as 10-point favorites. Houston struggled in the red zone, which could be a problem again, as the Texans rank 31st in red zone scoring, while the Chiefs rank seventh in red zone defense. Kansas City is 2-0 after previously losing two consecutive games this season and will have ten days to prepare for this contest.Houston's top-ranked pass defense, allowing a passer rating of 74.2, creates a challenging situation for Mahomes, as its elite defensive line, ranked sixth in sacks, applies constant pressure. However, the extreme cold weather diminishes many of the Texans' advantages. At 6-6, Kansas City needs to win out. And while I lean toward Houston on the spread at +3.5 or higher, Andy Reid and company will keep their season alive in what should be an electric atmosphere on Sunday Night Football.Philadelphia Eagles over Los Angeles ChargersI love this spot for the Eagles after dropping two in a row. They have played the much more demanding schedule (No. 4 vs. No. 31) and will have extended rest after their defense was on the field for 85 plays and 39:18 possession time. The Eagles have a 12-25 career record in games where right tackle Lane Johnson has not started since the beginning of the 2016 season, including 0-2 in 2025. The stud right tackle could be back for this game but even if he's out, the Eagles have allowed just one sack without Johnson.These two teams are evenly matched with the Eagles sporting a +1.9-point differential and the Chargers a +2.1 but as mentioned above, Los Angeles has played the second-easiest slate. Bo Nix is the best QB the Chargers have played since facing Patrick Mahomes in Week 1. Last week, the Chargers had a +17-point differential while the Eagles were -9. The public will remember what they saw last week and hammer the home team. Be careful. There might be more Eagles fans than Chargers fans present at SoFi Stadium.Justin Herbert, who has a broken left hand, is likely to play and his availability will be a significant factor to watch as the week progresses. The Chargers are set to face the Chiefs next week and have a 3-5 record before playing Kansas City since 2021. It's always scary to fade a short home underdog on MNF. My gut tells me the Eagles are the best option for a money line bet.Week 14 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Jacksonville Jaguars over Indianapolis ColtsI can't get over all the injuries to the Colts, including Daniel Jones playing on a gimpy leg, which hinders his running ability. They will utilize Jonathan Taylor, who has gained 1,282 yards but Jacksonville's run defense is elite, allowing only 82.4 yards per game (ranked first in the NFL). The Jaguars don't have to worry about Jones and the read option, which is a significant advantage. Indianapolis is 1-2 in outdoor road games this season and 2-3 against winning teams. They have played an easier schedule (No. 20 vs. No. 8) through Week 13.The Jaguars counter with home-field advantage and special teams superiority. They find ways to win. Jacksonville ranks sixth in special teams while Indianapolis ranks 12th. I think the wrong team is favored, as my model has Jacksonville as a -125 home favorite (-2.1-point spread).New York Jets over Miami DolphinsHave you seen Tua Tagovailoa play when the temperature is below 40 degrees? It has not been pretty. This is a significant fade on a Dolphins team that has won three consecutive games despite being out-gained in two of those matchups, all while playing at home. Miami hits the road after playing four straight home games. This is a revenge game. The Jets lost to Miami 27-21 back in September despite out-gaining them 404-300. It's an excellent spot to fade the fish.The Jets have an elite third-down defense, ranked sixth with 35.7% conversion rate allowed, while Miami's defense ranks 23rd at 41.4%. This structural advantage makes field position critical. This forces Miami to be efficient on early-down offense or face third-and-long situations, which Tagovailoa has struggled with in extreme cold. Tyrod Taylor completed 19 of 33 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown while rushing eight times for 44 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 27-24 win over the Falcons. I'm comfortable with Taylor under center. New York has the better special teams and could be the difference in what projects to be a tightly contested game.Chicago Bears over Green Bay PackersGreen Bay has dominated the Bears, going 9-1 in the last 10 meetings. The Bears' victory occurred last January 24-22 as 10.5-point road underdogs. Chicago's roster, coaching, and QB play are much better than last year's team, and they have a top-7 third-down offense and defense. This is not a team that lacks potential; Chicago has a real chance to win.The Packers are favored for several reasons as they hold a significant advantage in total DVOA (No. 5 vs. No. 19). While the Packers have a +0.9 net yards per play and the Bears are -0.5, Green Bay could be without several starters on defense. Ben Johnson has been in this division for years and knows how to scheme against Green Bay's defense. Also, extreme cold weather creates high variance. We know division games are ripe for upsets between two winning teams. My model has Green Bay favored by just under 5 points, so getting the Bears at +250 seems like good value.\n            ",

In my leagues it seems about a third to half of the league has something to play for. The rest of the league is either eliminated or has already locked up their bye or playoff spot. I can't help those of you eliminated, and the rest of this article is for those teams that are fighting for position in Week 14. But at the top I would like to offer some help for those teams who have already locked in their playoff seeding.For starters, congratulations. Now, let's take a look at the playoff schedule at the wide receiver position. This is a position where we need stashes to emerge more than any other. I don't have 24 wide receivers I want to start this week. But I do have a few lower end guys I believe could emerge.It will not surprise any of you to learn that Luther Burden is at the top of that list. He still leads the Bears in yards per route run (2.20), targets per route run (22.8%), and yards per target (9.65). He has played half of the offensive snaps each of the last two weeks. If we could bump that up to 67% I truly believe we could have a must-start wide receiver. And he is still only rostered in 25% of leagues.Fellow rookie Pat Bryant is even less rostered at 5%. In Week 13 he ran 77.1% of the Broncos routes, playing over Troy Franklin for the first time all season. He has 13 targets in his last two games and scored 13.2 Fantasy points against the Chiefs in Week 11. Denver is at home in Week 16 and Week 17 and Bo Nix has been much better playing in Denver. I don't think he is as likely to break out as Burden, but his roster rate should be much higher.\nOther rookies I would like to stash are Jayden Higgins, Isaac TeSlaa, Matthew Golden. Also, the top guy on the waiver wire this week could be better than all these guys, but I put him in the section below because you could also start him this week.Here is the rest of the Week 14 WR Preview:\n\n        Week 14 WR Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            29.8% -- In his last three games Adonai Mitchell has a 29.8% target rate. That ranks sixth in the NFL. Make sure he is rostered in your league.85.7% -- Since joining the Jaguars Jakobi Meyers has caught 85.7% of his targets. I am starting him as. WR2 this week.27.6 -- Michael Wilson averaged 27.6 PPR FPPG in two games without Marvin Harrison Jr. If Harrison is out this week, start Wilson.33 -- A.J. Brown has 33 targets in his last three games. He's back.2.27 -- Christian Watson is averaging 2.27 yards per route run this year and has been the Packers number one target as of late. Start him in Week 14.8 -- Emeka Egbuka has been frustrating iin the second half, but he still has at least eight targets in six straight games. I am not going away from him.31.1% -- Terry McLaurin led the Commanders with a 31% target share in his return despite playing less than half the snaps. I am starting him this week.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Waiver Wire Targets\n                \n                    \n            Week 14 Adds (WR Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

In Week 14 the rarest of things could save us. We have a player who is 5% rostered who is top six in target share over the past three weeks and just finished as WR6 in Week 13. Mitchell is a an outstanding route runner who seemingly always gets open and often disappoints when the ball comes his way. He is the top waiver add at any position this week and worth whatever FAB you have left if you are desperate at wide receiver.

View him as a touchdown dependent flex and hope the Bears put the Packers in a position to pass the ball a little more in Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NO\n                    \n                         \n                        New Orleans\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 27\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        TB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    TB -8.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                42nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                2%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    184\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    4.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Vele has 15 targets in his last two games and looks like the clear WR2 in this offense behind Chris Olave. The Saints are perpetually playing from behind and they are an up temp offense, so there is a reasonable chance for seven targets per game from Vele rest of season. I am not sure he has much upside, but he should have a decent floor that keeps him in the borderline WR3 conversation.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n

Harrison is out, Wilson will be the chalk you don't want to fade at the wide receiver position. He had 33 targets in two games without Harrison and scored more than 21 Fantasy points in both. Because Harrison came back last week, Wilson's price is all the way down at $5,700. He's a top-12 receiver without Harrison.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Minnesota\n                    \n                                            • #18\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        WAS\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIN -1.5\n                                    O/U 42\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12.3\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    105\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    799\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Yes, Jefferson has been a disaster lately. More accurately, his QBs have been awful. That's why he's cheap and that's why no one wants to play him. But the Commanders have one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL and Jefferson is still an elite wide receiver. It only takes a few accurate passes from McCarthy and Jefferson can do the rest of the work.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 14 Fantasy football projections for every position are now available on Sportsline.

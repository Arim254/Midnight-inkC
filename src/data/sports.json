Miller Moss, who spent his last four seasons at USC and threw for 2,555 yards for the Trojans last year, has made the Cardinals one of the most consistent offenses in the nation by breaking 20 points in all nine games. He's thrown for 2,132 yards with 11 touchdowns this season. Star Louisville running back Isaac Brown will miss his second straight game, which means the Cardinals will likely rely on Miller even more on Friday. Meanwhile, Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has thrown for 2,136 yards with 14 touchdowns compared to five interceptions this season, and he's two weeks removed from throwing for 385 yards in a 45-point effort for the Tigers against Duke. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Spurs to defeat the Warriors (-142)\"Am I a huge Steph Curry fan? Not really,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"In many ways, he has ruined the NBA with his crazy pull-up/step-back 3-pointers because he is so gosh-darn amazing that everyone thinks they can do it. Do I think schematically Curry was good for basketball? Absolutely not. But I would argue he has changed the NBA, maybe more than Jordan has. My point is that Steph can win a game by himself. He did Wednesday on the Riverwalk with 46 points. It's just so hard to sweep one of these baseball-type series, though -- especially away. Remember, we were in this spot last Sunday with Orlando. With trepidation, I played the Magic to sweep Boston in a similar home/home type thing. They didn't.\" Back San Antonio at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Iowa (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-112)\"On the wrong end of an 86-67 scoreline vs Santa Clara on Monday actually flatters the Musketeers, who only picked up the pace in garbage time when Richard Pitino let transfer guard Roddie Anderson (ex-UCSD and Boise State) shoot to his heart's content in the second half, when he scored 25 of his 29 points,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"A more accurate barometer of the X came in the first two games when laboring past LeMoyne and Marist, and the first half vs. SCU when held to 20 points. Good things are expected at Iowa under new head coach Ben McCollum, who made Drake the rage of the Missouri Valley last season and has the Hawkeyes shooting out the lights (57% from the floor!) in the first two games.

This time, the shot came from Minnesota Timberwolves coach Chris Finch.Finch took a swipe at Redick almost as soon as he hit the couch on a live episode of \"The Zach Lowe Show.\" When discussing Lowe's return to podcasting earlier this year, Finch said the veteran journalist now has the resume necessary to coach in Los Angeles.\"I mean, it'll qualify you to coach the Lakers,\" Finch said with a smirk.\nRedick launched a podcast while still playing and continued to hold a prominent voice in the space after his playing career ended in 2021. Redick jumped off the mic and into a coaching gig with the Lakers while the 56-year-old Finch took the scenic route to the NBA, spending more than a decade with various teams in Europe before getting a G League gig with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in 2009.\nEven when Finch did break through into the NBA, he spent a decade as an assistant before the Timberwolves hired him to be their head coach in 2021. Finch even coached Redick when he was an assistant with the New Orleans Pelicans from 2017-20.In fairness to Redick, he's had some success in the first 94 games of his coaching career. Last season, he coached the Lakers to a 50-32 record before they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Finch's Timberwolves.\nThis year, the Lakers are off to an 8-4 start with a pair of wins over the Timberwolves, and that has all come with star LeBron James sidelined due to injury. Minnesota, meanwhile, is 7-4 on the year. The Lakers and Wolves won't face off again until March 10 in Los Angeles. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The path towards the 2025 NWSL Championship is getting narrower as the postseason is down to the final four teams. Washington Spirit and Portland Thorns are the top seeds remaining and will clash on Saturday (CBS, 12 p.m.) at Audi Field in Washington, D.C., while Orlando Pride and Gotham FC meet on Sunday. All remaining teams know the glory of lifting the NWSL trophy, as each semifinalist has been to the final over the last four seasons, and the experience of reaching the biggest stage. For the Spirit, they're carrying the memory of runners-up in the 2025 NWSL Championship, while the Thorns are itching to return for the first time since 2022. The matchup will be a battle of contenders where the margins of success between them will be razor thin. Despite both teams having recent playoff appearances and NWSL Championship trophies, this marks the first time that Portland and Washington face off in the postseason.Here's how to watchNWSL Playoffs semifinal scheduleAll times U.S./EasternSaturday, Nov. 15(No. 2) Washington Spirit vs. (No. 3) Portland Thorns, 12 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)\nSunday, Nov. 16(No. 4) Orlando Pride vs. (No. 8) Gotham FC, 3 p.m. (ABC, ESPN+)Thorns find joy in being underratedThe Portland Thorns are no strangers to high stakes moments. This will be the club's tenth semifinal match in franchise history, the most by a single club in league history, three more than any other side. The Thorns have appeared in four NWSL Championships since the league's inception and won three NWSL Championship titles (2013, 2017, 2022). However, Sunday's match will be a first-time semifinal appearance for the majority of Portland's roster. Several key names retired just last season, including Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghann Klingenburg, and international leading goalscorer Christine Sinclair.There are only five players remaining from the 2022 NWSL Championship team, with only three active players in Sam Coffey, Olivia Moultrie, and Bella Bixby. Sophia Wilson has been out on maternity leave this year, while Morgan Weaver has been out with a season-ending injury.\nThe question marks around how the team would fare in light of such absences have been answered with a return to the postseason and another semifinal in front of them. Ultimately, it would take everyone, from the starters to the bench, to have a successful season. \"I think we've had a good bit of momentum in the later half of the season, and we've strung together some really good performances,\" Thorns midfielder Jessie Fleming told the media.\"I think different players have stepped up in different games, which I think is a special part of this team. Everybody's kind of showed up when we needed them to. So yeah, I think we feel good as a team, and we really enjoy being around each other. So I think last week, honestly, everyone was just stoked to get to spend an extra week together, to get to play one more game together. I know it was especially special for us getting that home match at Providence Park. And so I think we take a lot of energy from that.\"\nWhile the Thorns' defense has undergone a complete overhaul since 2022, the backline is in stable form heading into the semifinal. They've recorded three consecutive shutout victories and match the Spirit in 2025 with eight clean sheets. They'll rely on the recent organized performances, as tempo in playoff games can often be unpredictable.\"I mean, I honestly think that's something that we've gotten better at throughout the season. I think you kind of saw that in our last game against San Diego. They're such a good team, and there [were] definitely a lot of moments in that game where we kind of had to to manage some waves of their pressure, and we had to do a lot of defending,\" Fleming said. \"But, I think you saw how this group has matured throughout the season, and how we're able to handle those shifts in momentum, which are always going to happen when you're playing against a good team, when you're playing away from home. I was really proud of how our group has matured throughout the season, and we've gotten better at managing those moments.\"\nSpirit leads the contender packWashington Spirit is now the top seed left in the playoffs, with 2025 NWSL Shield winners Kansas City eliminated. It's not a scenario they're unfamiliar with, as they were in the chase as a second-place team against last year's NWSL Shield and Championship winners, Orlando Pride. They're coming off a dramatic quarterfinal where they eliminated Racing Louisville on penalty kicks. If they want another shot at the title, they'll have to knock down one more hurdle in a rising Thorns side. It's often a close match when the two sides meet. The Spirit holds a 5-16-9 all-time series record against the Thorns with a -26 goal differential (29-55), but the home side is currently on a two game home win streak against the Thorns, thanks to stoppage time winners by midfielder Leicy Santos and forward Trinity Rodman the past two seasons. Plenty of attention will be on whether or not Rodman suits up and plays for the Spirit. The winger has been out with an MCL sprain since Oct. 11 and was on the game day roster during the quarterfinal, but did not play. Prior to Rodman's MCL sprain, the forward was managing a back injury that kept her out for a large portion of the season. She had a triumphant return to play in August, where she scored the game winning goal against the Thorns after 114 days away from the pitch.\nThe Spirit will host its fourth consecutive playoff sellout at Audi Field on Saturday. Washington sold out its home quarterfinal and semifinal matches in 2024 before selling out last weekend's quarterfinal. The 2025 semifinal will also be the Spirit's sixth home sellout in the past 17 months. PredictionMost NWSL playoff games can lead to slim scorelines due to tense tempos. That might not be the case between two top teams and a sell-out crowd to entertain or silence. There will be goals, there will be a winner, but it'll still be narrow. Pick: Spirit 2, Thorns 1\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Oregon Ducks have a chance to improve their College Football Playoff profile Friday when they host the Minnesota Golden Gophers in a national showcase game. Kickoff from Autzen Stadium is set for 9 p.m. in the Big Ten Showdown. Oregon currently sits at No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings (No. 7 in the AP poll) and could make up ground with an impressive performance combined with the potential stumble of teams in front of them. For instance, No. 3-ranked Georgia could be in for a challenge against an improving No. 10-ranked Texas club. The Ducks have won three straight since their 27-20 home loss to Indiana, which vaulted the Hoosiers into the No. 2 spot in the rankings. They are coming off an unspectacular but gritty 18-16 road win over a gritty Iowa team despite missing several key offensive players to injury. Wide receiver Dakorien Moore and tight end Kenyon Sadiq missed last week's game and both are reportedly questionable for Friday's contest. Minnesota (6-3) has been erratic but has still managed to become bowl eligible with three games to spare. A month ago, the Gophers had their best performance of the season in a 24-6 home win over Nebraska as a touchdown underdog, followed by a 41-3 bludgeoning at the hands of Iowa the following week. In fact, all three of their losses have come by double figures. Another lopsided defeat for the Gophers is indicated in the college football odds, as the Ducks are favored by 25.5 points with an over/under of 44.5 points. However, Minnesota's solid defense that allows 21.6 points per game likely represents its best chance of making it a competitive contest. In addition to the CFB contest, we'll preview NBA and NHL matchups. The following is a snapshot of what to watch for Friday, Nov. 14. All times Eastern. CFB best bets today, where to watchMinnesota at Oregon Time: 9 p.m. | Location: Eugene, Ore. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 44.5 points The SportsLine Projection Model offers a slight lean to the underdog Golden Gophers against the spread, with its projected final score of 38-17 indicating a cover rate of about 59% for the Gophers. However, its 10,000-game simulation forecasts much more offense than the posted total suggests, as it sees the Over hitting nearly 70% of the time. The projected 38 from Oregon would be right about their season average, but the 17 for the Gophers is about a touchdown above expectation, per the sportsbooks implied odds. This outlier forecast on Minnesota is the catalyst for the model's A-rated selection on the Over. More CFB best betsModel's top CFB plays for FridayNHL best bets today, where to watchIslanders at Mammoth Time: 9 p.m. | Location: Salt Lake City | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Expert: Mammoth -1, -134 (Matt Severance) SportsLine NHL expert Matt Severance (+433 on Utah picks) notes that the Mammoth have been a value-heavy team for bettors this season, and he's backing them against the Islanders and backup goalie David Rittich on Friday. He notes Rittich has one road start this season, and he gave up six goals at Carolina in that outing. The Islanders have won three straight, but Severance expects a letdown performance from the road-weary club against the Mammoth, who snapped a three-game losing streak with a 5-2 home win over the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday. The analyst is willing to lay a goal with the favorite in exchange for the moderate price. \nNBA best bets today, where to watchWarriors at Spurs Time: 9:30 p.m. | Location: San Antonio | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 235.5 points The SportsLine Projection has been high on Overs in Warriors games of late, and recent recent results suggest it is on to something. The Warriors have seen the Over hit in four of their past six contests, including in their 125-120 win over the Spurs (total of 232.5) on Wednesday in the first of this back-back-back road set. The model offered a top-rated pick on the Over in that contest and is going back to the well for another such A-rated release Friday.The model's 10,000-game simulation offers an average final score of 120-118 in favor of the Spurs, suggesting a slight lean on Golden State with the points but an outcome that sends the total Over about 55% of the time. \n            ",

We will update this post with the final injury report for Monday Night Football once that's released on Saturday, and we will also update with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Washington Commanders vs. Miami Dolphins (9:30 a.m. ET, Madrid) WASH QB Jayden Daniels (elbow, out)WASH WR Terry McLaurin (quad, out)\nThe Commanders haven't put Jayden Daniels on injured reserve yet, but after his elbow injury a few weeks ago, it's unlikely we see the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year anytime soon, opening the door for another Marcus Mariota start. Mariota once again will be without Terry McLaurin, who has played just four games this year due to a nagging quad strain. Miami is favored by 2.5 points, and the total sits at 47.5. Green Bay Packers at New York Giants (1 p.m. ET)NYG QB Jaxson Dart (concussion, out)NYG WR Darius Slayton (hamstring, out)NYG OT Evan Neal (hamstring, out)GB WR Matthew Golden (shoulder, questionable)\nThe Giants will have an entirely new look this week. Brian Daboll is out as head coach, and Mike Kafka is the interim man in charge. Jaxson Dart is out with a concussion, opening the door for Jameis Winston to get the start. New York's offense has been beat up all year, and both receiver Darius Slayton and right tackle Evan Neal are out as well. Green Bay may be without rookie receiver Matthew Golden, who's questionable with a shoulder injury. Green Bay is a 7-point favorite on the road. The total is 42.5.Houston Texans at Tennessee Titans (1 p.m. ET)HOU QB C.J. Stroud (concussion, out)TENN WR Calvin Ridley (hamstring, questionable)TENN DT Jeffery Simmons (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Texans will be without quarterback C.J. Stroud once again as he remains in concussion protocol for the second week in a row. Houston will turn to Davis Mills against a Titans team that's hopeful to get its top receiver back in Calvin Ridley and top defender back in Jeffery Simmons for this AFC South tilt. Houston is a 6-point road favorite, and the total is 37.5. Carolina Panthers at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET)ATL WR Drake London (illness and back, questionable)\nThe Panthers are in good shape in the health department, especially with star running back Rico Dowdle good to go for Sunday. The big one to watch is with star Atlanta receiver Drake London, who is questionable with both a back injury and an illness. Atlanta is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 42. Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThese NFC North rivals meet for the second time this season as the Vikings won in Week 1 thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback. The Bears are tied for first place in the division right now while the Vikings are in last place. Both sides enter this game relatively healthy, and Chicago hasn't listed either of its top receivers -- Rome Odunze and DJ Moore -- on the final injury report of the week. Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite at home, and the total is 48.5.Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (shin, questionable)JAX WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle, questionable)JAX TE Brenton Strange (hip, out)\nThe Chargers' offensive line remains an issue with the team's top tackles out for the year, but besides that, they're in solid shape entering this week. The biggest injury to watch on the L.A. side is receiver Quentin Johnston, who is questionable. Jacksonville will be without tight end Brenton Strange, and Brian Thomas Jr., who was out last week, is questionable.The Chargers are favored at -3. The total sits at 43.5.Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (1 p.m. ET)TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, out)TB WR Chris Godwin (fibula, out)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring, out)\nDespite some promising reports coming out of Bucs practices, Bucky Irving and Chris Godwin will again be inactive for this week's game in Buffalo. The biggest Bills injury is tight end Dalton Kincaid, who's out with a hamstring injury. Kincaid leads the team in touchdown receptions. The Bills are favored by 5.5 points at home. The total is 46.5.Cincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (1 p.m. ET)CIN DE Trey Hendrickson (hip, out)CIN QB Joe Burrow (toe, out)CIN RB Samaje Perine (ankle, out)PITT CB Darius Slay (concussion, out)\nThis game was a shootout last time these teams faced off, and this has the makings for another high-scoring affair. Cincinnati's top defender, Trey Hendrickson, is again out. Steelers corner Darius Slay is also out. Joe Burrow is technically listed as out as the team opened his 21-day practice window, but he won't return for at least one more week. Chase Brown also figures to be extra busy with No. 2 back Samaje Perine out for the Bengals.The Steelers are favored by 5.5. The total is one of the highest of the slate at 49.5.San Francisco 49ers at Arizona Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)SF QB Brock Purdy (toe, will play)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (illness, out)AZ RB Bam Knight (ankle, questionable)\nFor the first time since Week 4, Brock Purdy will be under center for the 49ers. The young quarterback is off in the injury report and will make just his third start of the year after battling a major toe injury. Mac Jones had been starting in Purdy's absence, and San Francisco is 6-4 on the year. The Cardinals are last in the NFC West and will be without top receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. due to illness. Bam Knight, who has helped lead the Cardinals' backfield after injuries to both James Conner and Trey Benson, is questionable. The 49ers are favored at -3. The total is 48.5.Seattle Seahawks at Los Angeles Rams (4:05 p.m. ET)SEA WR Tory Horton (groin and shin, out)LAR WR Davante Adams (oblique, questionable)\nThe Seahawks and Rams meet for the first time this year with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line. Both teams are relatively healthy for this matchup, too. Seattle will be without rookie standout receiver Tory Horton, while the Rams have listed star receiver Davante Adams as questionable as the veteran receiver battles an oblique injury. The Rams are 3-point favorites. The total is 48.5.Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)KC RB Isiah Pacheco (knee, out) DEN RB J.K. Dobbins (foot, out)DEN CB Patrick Surtain II (pectoral, out)\nBoth teams are down notable running backs as Isiah Pacheco is out for Kansas City and J.K. Dobbins is out for Denver. Dobbins, whose career has been derailed by injuries in recent years, is off to a great start in Denver but is reportedly in danger of missing multiple weeks, opening the door for rookie R.J. Harvey to get extended playing time. The Broncos are also without reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II for this key AFC West battle.The Chiefs are favored by 3.5 in Denver, and the total is 45.Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns (4:25 p.m. ET)BAL WR Rashod Bateman (ankle, out)BAL RB Justice Hill (toe, out)\nThe good news for the Ravens is Lamar Jackson has no injury designation after missing practice earlier this week with a knee injury. The team will be without receiver Rashod Bateman, as well as backup running back Justice Hill, who opened the year as the team's No. 2 back but has lost playing time recently to Keaton Mitchell.Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points. The total is 39.Detroit Lions at Philadelphia Eagles (8:20 p.m. ET)DET TE Sam LaPorta (back, out)DET S Kerby Joseph (knee, out)DET OT Taylor Decker (shoulder, questionable)DET OT Penei Sewell (ankle, questionable)\nThe Lions are beat up entering Sunday Night Football. Four Detroit players are out, including standout tight end Sam LaPorta and safety Kerby Joseph. Meanwhile, the team has also listed 10 players as questionable, including starting tackles Taylor Decker and Penei Sewell. As for Philly, the team has just one player questionable, and it's a backup offensive lineman in rookie Willie Lampkin.The Eagles are 2.5-point favorites. The total is 46.5.Dallas Cowboys at Las Vegas Raiders (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)No major injuries of note\nThe final injury report for Monday Night Football will be revealed Saturday, and we'll update this section accordingly once that information is made available. But as of now, it appears both teams are in good shape in the injury department heading into Week 11.Dallas is favored by 3.5 points, and the total is 50.5, the highest of the Week 11 schedule.\n            ",

After a brutal 1-5 start to the season, the Ravens have won three straight and will look to get to .500 for the first time since Week 2 when they visit the Browns for a Week 11 AFC North clash.Baltimore's lone win during that 1-5 start was a 41-17 domination of the Browns in Week 2. Lamar Jackson threw four touchdown passes, and Roquan Smith returned a Joe Flacco fumble 63 yards for a touchdown in what was a comprehensive win and what remains the Ravens' highest-scoring game this season. That game, however, was in Baltimore. This one will be in Cleveland, where the Ravens have lost three of their past four games. The Browns will be looking to make life difficult for Jackson and Derrick Henry -- who had just 23 rushing yards in the Week 2 meeting -- while hoping to get improved offense following their extended break.Kevin Stefanski has stuck with Dillon Gabriel as his starting quarterback despite the rookie out of Oregon struggling, and he'll be looking to turn things around and get the 2-7 Browns back in the win column.Here's how to watch this divisional matchup as well as odds, keys to the game and a pick.\nWhere to watch Browns vs. Ravens liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 16 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, OhioTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7.5; O/U 39.5 (via FanDuel)Browns vs. Ravens: Need to knowLamar Jackson is playing at an MVP level. Jackson likely won't win MVP considering he missed three games with a hamstring injury, but he has nevertheless been one of the league's very best this season. Jackson entered Week 11 leading the NFL in passer rating (127.1) and touchdown rate (10.2%) and in the top five in touchdown-to-interception ratio (15 to 1), yards per attempt (8.5) and completion percentage (70%). His presence has completely revitalized an offense that floundered without him, and he'll need to play at a high level against a talented Browns defense.Ravens' defense has experienced a major turnaround. Though Jackson garners most of the headlines, Baltimore's defense has had a dramatic mid-season turnaround. Through the first five weeks of the season, the Ravens were 28th in yards per play allowed and were giving up big plays left and right while hardly creating any havoc with turnovers or pressure. But the trade for safety Alohi Gilman has been a huge boost, allowing Baltimore to play three safeties -- Gilman, Kyle Hamilton and Malaki Starks -- as its base defense. Since Week 6, the Ravens have allowed just 14.5 points per game, third-best in the NFL.Beware of Myles Garrett. The Browns are going through yet another trying season, but that hasn't stopped Myles Garrett from making another strong run at Defensive Player of the Year, an award he won in 2023 and finished third in the voting for last year. Garrett already has 11 sacks this season, an NFL high and on pace to challenge the all-time single season record of 22.5, shared by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). Garrett had a five-sack day against the Patriots in Week 8 and had 1.5 sacks of Jackson in Week 2.Browns vs. Ravens pick, prediction\nThough Cleveland has been a tough place to play for the Ravens in recent years, we can't see Baltimore dropping another game there. Jackson is too good, the defense is heading in the right direction, and the Ravens, with no room for error, will continue to play sound, focused football in a straightforward victory. Pick: Ravens -7.5, Over 39.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        John Beam, the Laney College athletic director and former football coach who was featured in Netflix's \"Last Chance U,\" died Friday morning after being shot on campus Thursday, authorities said. A suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting, the Oakland Police Department said Friday.\"This was a very targeted incident,\" assistant chief James Beere said. \"In this case, I can just tell you that the individual that was arrested went specifically to the campus for a specific reason.\"Beere said the suspect and Beam knew each other but did not have a close relationship. The suspect was not a Laney student and was known to loiter around the campus, per Beere. The suspect had played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not during Beam's tenure there. Investigators have not discussed a motive and charges had not yet been filed as of Friday afternoon.\"We are devastated that John Beam our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend has passed,\" his family said in a statement. \"Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers well wishes and thoughts.\"\nThe incident, the second school-related shooting in Oakland in as many days, occurred just before noon Thursday at the college's fieldhouse. Officers found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, and he was taken to a hospital. The college was placed on lockdown shortly afterward.\"My thoughts are with coach John Beam and his loved ones,\" Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee shared in a statement. \"We are praying for him.  Coach Beam is a giant in Oakland -- a mentor, an educator and a lifeline for thousands of young people. For over 40 years, he has shaped leaders on and off the field, and our community is shaken alongside his family.\"Beam, 66, became a nationally recognized figure after \"Last Chance U\" chronicled Laney's 2019 season. Before retiring as coach in 2024 and moving into the athletic director position, he led the program to two league championships and a 2018 state title, a season in which Laney finished 11-2 and was ranked the top community college team in the country. He also maintained a 90% graduation and transfer rate for his players, according to CBS News.\nBeam's legacy in Oakland extends to Skyline High School, where he coached for 16 years and won 11 section and 15 league championships before joining Laney. The shooting involving Beam unfolded a day after a Skyline High School student was injured in gunfire on that campus.Beere told reporters the incident involving Beam appeared to be isolated and not related to the previous shooting.\"This is the second shooting on an Oakland campus in two days, and it is devastating,\" Lee said in the statement. \"Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.  We are standing together, praying for coach Beam and his loved ones.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through the first 11 weeks of the season, the NFL still hasn't flexed a single game and that streak will continue into Week 12, because the deadline has already passed for flexing a game next week. That means the first time we could see a game get flexed this year will come in Week 13 and the NFL should give some serious thought to pulling the trigger on a schedule change.It won't be easy to flex a game that week because it's Thanksgiving, which means there are four games that can't be moved (The three Thanksgiving games plus the Black Friday game). However, a flex would still make a lot of sense. Before we get to that, though, let's take a look at the rules for flex scheduling: Sunday night flexing: The NFL can flex up to two games between Weeks 5-10. For Weeks 11 thru 17, the league can flex as many games as it sees fit. The league has to decide and announce any changes no later than 12 days in advance of the game. Monday night flexing: Flex scheduling can be used any time between Weeks 12 thru 17. The league has to decide and announce any changes no later than 12 days in advance of the game. Thursday night flexing: The NFL can flex up to two games between Weeks 13-17.Although the league is allowed to flexing a Thursday night game is permitted, that won't be happening in Week 13. For one, it's too late: A Thursday flex has to happen with 21 days notice. Also, the league doesn't flex Thanksgiving games, those are set in stone. \nIn Week 13, there are the two games eligible to be flexed out of prime time: Sunday night: Broncos (8-2) at Commanders (3-7)Monday night: Giants (2-8) at Patriots (9-2)With most fans locked into their holiday travel plans, I would be shocked if the NFL flexed out the Patriots game, because that would mean moving the game to Sunday and moving a Sunday game to Monday. So we're going to focus on the Broncos-Commanders game. That's the one game that probably needs to be moved. The NFL has to make the call on possibly moving the Broncos-Commanders game by Tuesday, so the league can watch what happens in Week 11 before making a decision. If the Commanders lose to the Dolphins on Sunday in Spain, that would drop them to 3-8. To make matters worse, Jayden Daniels is currently out with en elbow injury and it's unlikely he'll be ready to play in Week 13 although he will be re-evaluated following Washington's Week 12 bye. And let's not forget, the Commanders have one of the worst defenses in the league. The NFL already had to deal with Broncos playing a prime time game against a team with a backup QB and a bad defense, and things got ugly. Back in Week 4, Denver beat the Bengals, 28-3, on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nThe Commanders have also lost four straight games by at least 20 points, which is the second-longest losing streak by 20 points or more in NFL history. Basically, they're getting blown out every week and that doesn't make for good TV. Of course, if the NFL is going to flex a game out of Sunday night, you have to find a game to flex in and there seems to be one interesting option:Vikings (4-5) at Seahawks (7-2)The NFL has the chance to put the Sam Darnold revenge game in prime time. Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 record last season, but for some reason, Minnesota decided to let him walk away during the offseason. Without Darnold, the Vikings have struggled this year while the Seahawks have thrived with their new quarterback. \nThis flex option will only make sense if Minnesota beat the Bears on Sunday. If that happens, the Vikings will be either 6-5 or 5-6 going into Week 13, depending on what happens in Week 12 against the Packers. As for the Seahawks, they only have one primetime game the rest of the season and that doesn't come until Week 16, so it would make sense to put them in the national spotlight at least one more time since they've been one of the best teams in the NFL this year. Even if the Vikings are 5-6 going into this game, there is precedent for a team with a losing record getting flexed into Sunday night. Last season, the NFL flexed a 4-5 Bengals team into a Week 11 Sunday night game against the Chargers. The flex announcement was made after Week 9 and the Bengals lost in Week 10, so they were actually 4-6 going into the game. One other option: Texans (4-5) at Colts (8-2)The Colts have been one of best teams in the NFL this year, but most people probably haven't gotten a chance to watch them because they haven't played a prime time game yet. The Colts only have one prime time game on their schedule and that won't come until Week 16 against the 49ers. The Texans would be a riskier pick, but if they beat the Titans on Sunday, that would put them at 5-5 heading into Week 12. They do play the Bills in Week 12, so they'd either be 5-6 or 6-5 going into Week 13. The one problem with this game is that if it gets moved, that would put the Texans in primetime for three straight weeks (They play the Bills on Thursday night in Week 12 and the Chiefs on Sunday night in Week 14). \nThe Bills and Steelers also play in Week 13, but with that being the 4:25 p.m. ET game going to most of the country, it would be somewhat surprising if that got flexed to Sunday night. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Injuries are a constant (and annoying) presence throughout the NFL season. While teams do their best to fend off the injury bug, it takes its fair share of bites, so it's worth monitoring how teams are handling that area of the game to better get a sense of how they'll perform from week to week. As we turn our attention to Week 11, injury storylines are front and center. Two of the game's brightest young quarterbacks, Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud, are still on the shelf. However, there is a positive development as it relates to injured quarterbacks, as the San Francisco 49ers are slated to get Brock Purdy back after he's missed the bulk of the year due to a toe injury. On top of the quarterback position, we're monitoring the statuses of some key contributors like Davante Adams, Bucky Irving, and Trey Hendrickson. Below, you can find the final injury designations for those players and more as teams turn in their final reports heading into the Week 11 slate.NFL odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

As for Sinnott, he popped up on the injury report on Thursday with an ankle injury and did not practice Friday, so his status is in true doubt. Chubb was a late addition to the injury report, popping up on Friday with a foot injury that now has him questionable for Sunday's international matchup. Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBearsT.J.

McCarthy logged a full practice for the second-straight day after he was limited to begin the week with a right hand injury. He carries no designation for Week 11, so he's in line to start. Carolina Panthers at Atlanta Falcons (-3.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPanthersLathan RansomSHandOutTrevin WallaceLBShoulderOutFalconsDee AlfordCB ConcussionOutJosh WoodsILBHamstringOutMalik VerdonILBShoulderOutLeonard FloydEDGEHamstringOutMatthew BergeronIOLAnkleOutSam RobertsDLKnee, ankleOutDrake LondonWRIllness, backQuestionableJamal AgnewWRFootQuestionableMike HughesCBNeckQuestionableBrandon DorlusDLObliqueQuestionableChris LindstromIOLFootQuestionableFeleipe FranksTEFootQuestionableZach HarrisonDLKneeQuestionableNeither Ransom or Wallace was able to practice this week and have since been ruled out. On a more positive note for Carolina, running back Rico Dowdle logged a full practice on Friday and carries no injury designation for Week 11, meaning he'll play. London missed Wednesday's practice due to an illness, but was limited for the rest of the week with an added back ailment. His status will be worth monitoring up until kickoff. \nGreen Bay Packers (-7) at New York GiantsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPackersNate HobbsCBKneeOutMatthew GoldenWRShoulderQuestionableLukas Van NessDLFootQuestionableSavion WilliamsWRFootQuestionableGiantsJaxson DartQBConcussionOutChauncey GolstonDLNeckOutEvan NealOLHamstringOutDarius SlaytonWRHamstringOutKayvon ThibodeauxOLBShoulderOutTyler NubinSNeckDoubtfulRakeem Nunez-RochesDLToeDoubtfulPaulson AdeboCBKneeQuestionableBobby OkerekeLBShoulderQuestionableHobbs is the only player officially ruled out by the Packers after not practicing throughout the week. Meanwhile, Golden, who missed Monday's game against Philadelphia, was able to practice on a limited basis throughout the week, leaving him open to a potential return. New York officially ruled out Dart as he continues to deal with his concussion, which means Jameis Winston will start for the Giants against Green Bay. He'll do so, however, without Slayton at his disposal, while the defense will be missing Thibodeaux. Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBuccaneersBucky IrvingRBFoot, shoulderOutChris Godwin Jr.WRFibulaOutBen BredesonIOLHamstringOutHaason ReddickOLBAnkle, kneeOutMarkees WattsOLBHandOutBillsDalton KincaidTEHamstringOutPhidarian MathisDTShoulderOutTaron JohnsonCBGroinQuestionableCam LewisDBCalfQuestionableShaq ThompsonLBHamstringQuestionableDespite being limited throughout the week of practice, the Buccaneers will go at least another week without starters Godwin and Irving. The pass rush will also be thin with Reddick and Watts both sidelined. Ona more positive note, Vita Vea and Antoine Winfield Jr. both do not carry an injury designation, so they will play this week after appearing on the injury report. \nBuffalo will be without its top tight end target in Kincaid. He did not practice at all this week due to a hamstring injury. The Bills also could be thin in the secondary with Johnson and Lewis both questionable. Each practiced on a limited basis on Friday. Los Angeles Chargers (-3) at Jacksonville JaguarsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChargersBobby HartOT KneeQuestionableQuentin JohnstonWRShinQuestionableScott MatlockFB/DLChestQuestionableElijah MoldenDBKneeQuestionableTarheeb StillCBKneeQuestionableJaguarsAnton HarrisonOLKnee, ankleOutJourdan LewisCBNeckOutHunter LongTEHip, kneeOutBrenton StrangeTEHipOutBrian Thomas Jr.WRAnkleQuestionableJohnston will be a name to watch leading up to kickoff as the veteran receiver is officially questionable due to a shin injury. While Johnston's status remain up in the air, Ladd McConkey (ankle) does not carry an injury designation after being limited this week. Jacksonville was without Thomas Jr. last week due to an ankle injury, but could get him back into the lineup in Week 11. After practicing on a limited basis throughout the week, he's listed as questionable. \nHouston Texans (-6) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusTexansJalen PitreSConcussionOutDamon ArnetteCBAnkleOutHarrison BryantTENeck, shoulderOutKa'imi FairbairnKRight quadOutC.J.

Meanwhile, Arnette popped up on the injury report on Friday as a DNP and will play play in Week 11. Despite having the bye week in Week 10 to rest up, Tennessee is still a little banged up. Specifically, we'll be monitoring the status of both Ridley and Simmons, who are each dealing with hamstring injuries. Both practiced on a limited basis on Friday, which is a positive sign. Cincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBengalsJoe BurrowQBToeOutTrey HendericksonDEHip, pelvisOutSamaje PerineRBAnkleOutShemar StewartDEKneeOutLucas PatrickGCalfQuestionableSteelersDarius SlayCBConcussionOutCole HolcombLBIllnessOutAlex HighsmithLBPectoralOutCory Trice Jr.CBHamstring, kneeQuestionableIsaac SeumaloGPectoralQuestionableCincinnati welcomed Burrow back to practice this week, but the team is still a ways away from activating him and installing him as the starter again. With him officially ruled out, it clears the way for another start for Joe Flacco. Meanwhile, the Bengals defense will be missing two key figures in Hendrickson and Stewart off the edge. \nPittsburgh has ruled out Slay after he suffered a concussion against the Chargers. He did not practice at all this week. The defense will also be missing Highsmith after the pass rusher suffered a pectoral injury against Los Angeles. Seattle Seahawks at Los Angeles Rams (-3)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawksTory HortonWRGroin, shinOutJalen SundellCKneeOutRamsDavante AdamsWRObliqueQuestionableKobie TurnerDEBackQuestionableHorton began the week as a limited participant in practice, but then logged back-to-back DNP, which has led to him being ruled out. Coach Sean McVay told reporters on Friday that, despite both Adams and Turner officially being listed as questionable, each are expected to suit up against Seattle.  \nSan Francisco 49ers (-3) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatus49ersDeommodore LenoirCBCalfQuestionableCardinalsBaron BrowningLBConucssionOutHayden ConnerGKneeOutMarvin Harrison Jr.WRIllnessOutWill JohnsonCBBack, hipOutDadrion Taylor-DemersonSAnkleOutJonah WilliamsOTShoulderOutMack WilsonLBRibsOutKelvin BeachumOTGroinQuestionableWill HernandezGKneeQuestionableZonovan KnightRBAnkleQuestionableWalter NolanDTKneeQuestionableB.J.

The secondary will be without Lenoir, who popped up on Thursday with a calf injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan did note that Lenoir will undergo an MRI. It was announced earlier this week that Marvin Harrison Jr. would not play for the Cardinals in Week 11 as the wideout underwent surgery for appendicitis on Monday night. Meanwhile, linebacker Baron Browning did not practice all week due to a concussion and is out. Baltimore Ravens (-7.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRavensRashod BatemanWRAnkleOutJay HigginsLBKneeOutJustice HillRBToeOutMarlon HumphreyCBFingerOutMike GreenOLBAnkleQuestionableBrownsAlex WrightDEQuadOutMaliek CollinsDTObliqueQuestionableLamar Jackson logged his second consecutive full practice on Friday and carries no designation heading into Week 11, so he is good to go. This comes after he popped up on the injury report on Wednesday and was held out from that practice due to a knee injury. \nWright did not practice all week for the Browns, so the defensive end being ruled out isn't a surprise. That said, Collins popped up on the injury report Friday, being listed as a limited participant in the session due to an oblique injury that now has him questionable.  Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChiefsIsiah PachecoRBKneeOutBroncosJ.K.

The Chiefs will have left tackle Josh Simmons after he had been away from the team due to personal reasons, along with pass rusher George Karlaftis, who was limited this week due to a thumb injury. Denver will not have J.K. Dobbins in the backfield on Sunday due to a foot injury. That injury looks like it'll keep him sidelined much longer than Week 11, however, as NFL Media characterizers it as \"significant\" and injured reserve is a possibility.  \nDetroit Lions at Philadelphia EaglesSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusLionsTerrion ArnoldCBConcussionOutKerby JosephSKneeOutSam LaPortaTEBackOutJosh PaschalEDGEBackOutMarcus DavenportEDGEShoulderQuestionableTaylor DeckerOTShoulderQuestionableMiles FrazierGKneeQuestionableD.J.

In the secondary, they could be stretched thin with Arnold and Joseph already ruled out along with Reed and Robertson questionable. Meanwhile, the offensive line has key stars like Sewell listed as questionable. Sewell did not practice on Friday, which isn't an encouraging sign. Meanwhile, Philly's injury report is the polar opposite of Detroit's. Lampkin is the lone player listed, but he practiced fully throughout the week, despite his questionable status.

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                    What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                    To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game.

    "body": "\n        Saturday is a chance for Islam Makhachev and Zhang Weili to make history as both fighters have vacated championships to move up a weight division and challenge for a second title in the featured fights of UFC 322.In the main event, Makhachev will battle welterweight champion Jack Della Maddalena. Makhachev won the lightweight championship in 2022 and successfully defended the title four times before vacating to move to welterweight. Dealla Maddalena will be making his first defense of the title he won in May with a decision win over Belal Muhammad.Weili vacated the women's strawweight title after three defenses in her second reign as champion. Shevchenko is on her own second reign as champion. She successfully defended the title seven times before a March 2023 upset loss to Alexa Grasso. Shevchenko battled Grasso to a draw before finally getting a win and regaining the title. She has made one successful defense since regaining the belt.There are many other big fights scheduled for Saturday night, as the UFC has loaded up the card for the promotion's return to Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 322: Why Islam Makhachev's early UFC loss set him on the path to become a potential two-division champ\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities that you can consider before hitting the sportsbooks.UFC 322 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookIslam Makhachev -285 vs. Jack Della Maddalena (c) +230, welterweight titleValentina Shevchenko -135 (c) vs. Zhang Weili +115, women's flyweight titleSean Brady -130 vs. Michael Morales +110, welterweightsCarlos Prates -175 vs. Leon Edwards +145, welterweightsBenoit Saint Denis -180 vs. Beneil Dariush +150, lightweightsBo Nickal -205 vs. Rodolfo Vieira +170, middleweightsGregory Rodrigues -185 vs. Roman Kopylov +154, middleweightsErin Blanchfield -258 vs. Tracy Cortes +210, women's flyweightsMalcolm Wellmaker -590 vs. Ethyn Ewing +440, featherweightsKyle Daukaus -425 vs. Gerald Meerschaert +330, middleweightsPat Sabatini -130 vs. Chepe Mariscal +110, featherweightsFatima Kline -520 vs. Angela Hill +390, women's strawweightsBaisangur Susurkaev -1050 vs. Eric McConico +675, middleweightsMatheus Camilo -162 vs. Viacheslav Borshchev, lightweightsUFC 322 predictions, picksWith such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse, Shakiel Mahjouri, Michael Mormile and Brandon Wise.   CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseDella Maddalena (c) vs. MakhachevMakhachevDella MaddalenaMakhachevMakhachevMakhachevShevchenko (c) vs. WeiliShevchenkoShevchenkoShevchenkoShevchenkoZhangBrady vs. MoralesBradyBradyBradyBradyBradyEdwards vs. PratesEdwardsEdwardsEdwardsPratesPratesDariush vs. Saint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisJack Della Maddalena vs. Islam Makhachev predictionsCampbell: Della Maddalena has the size, power and toughness not to be taken lightly in Makhachev's pursuit of history as a potential two-division champion. JDM also showed enough improvements in his takedown defense against Belal Muhammad that it might not be as easy as some might think for Makhachev to drown him in the grappling department. Still, it's hard to look past just how evenly well-rounded Makhachev's game has truly become and how much of a finishing threat (with 18 stoppages in 27 pro wins) he truly is, whether on the feet or on the ground. Della Maddalena will definitely make him earn it, but this is still Makhachev's fight to lose. And the 10-month layoff that the former lightweight champion enters with should help him feel comfortable at the new weight class. At the end of the day, Makhachev's technical advantages should prove to be the difference.  \nBrookhouse: I'm often guilty of overthinking simple fights, and maybe that's what I'm doing here. Something about Della Maddalena's skillset feels like it's close to what a fighter needs to deal with Makhachev's game. On the feet, Makhachev is solid, but Della Maddalena will have the edge. Makhachev will get takedowns in the fight, but Della Maddalena has good scrambling skills, and training with Craig Jones is sure to have taught the champion a few tricks. Either way, I believe this will be a difficult fight for Makhachev as he meets a tricky fighter in a new weight class.Mahjouri: Della Maddalena is a live dog, don't let Makhachev's well-deserved reputation fool you. Della Maddalena is an elite boxer with rapidly evolving grappling defense. The champ stuffed most of Belal Muhammad's takedowns and, more importantly, wasn't held down for long stretches. Pair that with Makhaev's relative struggles striking with Dustin Poirier, and you can see a case for JDM. With all that said, I'm still siding with Makhachev. The former lightweight champ is a better grappler than Muhammad. Makhachev lands more takedowns more accurately, controls better, and finishes more. Size shouldn't be a major factor either. Della Maddalena, by his own admission, isn't a large welterweight. That'll benefit Makhachev, whose physicality should translate well enough at welterweight. Expect to see Makhachev build his Hall of Fame legacy with a finish.Valentina Shevchenko vs. Zhang Weili predictionsCampbell: There's a reason why this fight has been a virtual pick 'em from a betting standpoint throughout the build to it. A pair of future Hall of Famers and decorated champions with completely evolved skill sets and nary a hole in their respective games to speak about. Both are also as technical as they are tenacious. But something will inevitably have to give in a matchup this close on paper and the biggest things separating the two fighters seems to favor Shevchenko entirely. The former bantamweight contender is slightly bigger, has more big-fight experience and is a more refined striker, particularly as a counter puncher. If Shevchenko's game is slipping at age 37, her back-to-back recent decision wins over former champion Alexa Grasso and Manon Fiorot over the past 14 months haven't shown it. While Zhang is a bit more explosive and could have an edge from the standpoint of five-round cardio should this fight be contested at a high pace, Shevchenko has too much craft not to find a way to hold her off in a technical thriller. \nMahjouri: Zhang has rounded out her game excellently, but you won't find a better all-around fighter than Shevchenko. The women's flyweight champion can strike and grapple with fantastic technique and defensive responsibility. Zhang's KO power will probably carry up in weight, but against Shevchenko, who hasn't been KOed in 18 UFC fights, it's hard to see the former strawweight queen getting a finish. Shevchenko is a hard fighter to beat on the scorecards. The judges love her, and they'll greet Shevchenko again at the finish line.Sean Brady vs. Michael Morales predictionsBrookhouse: From our UFC 322 best bets: \"This fight may come down to wrestling. Brady averages more than 3.5 takedowns per 15 minutes while Morales defends takedowns at a success rate of 89%. Of course, Morales hasn't faced a murderer's row of great wrestlers and Brady presents a host of new tests for the Ecuadorian. Brady is more battle-tested against better opposition, and -135 feels like a good price on the higher-ranked, more proven fighter.\"Mahjouri: Brady vs. Morales is one of the more compelling fights on the card. Brady is a powerhouse with phenomenal grappling. Morales is a slick knockout artist. What makes the fight curious are their defensive lapses. Brady is a responsible defensive striker, but it's hard to shake how Muhammad -- who has two knockouts in 20 UFC fights -- finished Brady on the feet. Morales' takedown defense isn't foolproof, but no one has managed to keep him down. A grappler vs. striker fight that could go either way, I'll lean with Brady's experience over Morales, the latter of whom has yet to be tested by an elite prime welterweight. \nWho wins UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Justin Thomas announced Friday evening that he underwent a microdiscectomy this week to repair a disc injury that was causing him nagging hip pain over recent months. Thomas, who has already been discharged from the hospital, posted a video while standing up, indicating he was recovering well from the procedure. Thomas did not set a timetable for his return to the golf course but noted he will miss the start of the 2026 PGA Tour season at a minimum.\"My next few weeks will be a lot of resting before the rehab process begins,\" Thomas wrote. \"I have a great team behind me who I fully trust to get me back to a better place than I was before! Before you ask, I'm not putting any tournament on the calendar or specific time for returning. While I will miss some events in the beginning of 2026, I want to be very smart and patient in letting my disc fully heal so it isn't an issue again. I'm very lucky that the game of golf allows us to play at a high level for a long time, and that's what I plan on doing - this procedure will allow me to do that injury free in the future. Can't wait to see y'all back out there.\"\nThe 2026 PGA Tour season will start later than usual after The Sentry was cancelled due to drought conditions in Hawaii. Thomas won't set a target date, noting he will be patient and allow the disc to fully heal in hopes of avoiding any lingering issues. \nAlong with missing PGA Tour events, Thomas will no longer participate in the upcoming Skins Game competition on Black Friday. He was scheduled to compete with Keegan Bradley, Tommy Fleetwood and Xander Schauffele at his Panther National golf course in Florida. A replacement for Thomas was not immediately announced Friday. Thomas will also sit out the start of the TGL season. The second year of the simulator golf league begins Dec. 28, and if Thomas is going to miss tournaments in the 2026 season, he will assuredly be out for at least a portion of the TGL season for the Atlanta Drive. \nThe 2025 campaign was a return to form for Thomas, who picked up his first win since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and added three runner-up finishes among his eight top 10s. That showing earned Thomas a spot on the United States Ryder Cup team and pushed him back into the conversation among golf's best. Thomas' performance tapered off later in the year with just one top 10 in his last six events, and it has now become clear some of that was due to hip pain caused by a disc issue. \n            \n    ",

Dobbins for this Sunday's divisional matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs and possibly some time after due to a significant foot injury, according to the NFL Network. The report states that Dobbins is \"believed to be out for the foreseeable future\" and is exploring all options, including injured reserve. Dobbins suffered the injury in Week 10's win over the Raiders.If he is placed on IR, Dobbins would miss at least four games, meaning he'd be sidelined for matchups against the Washington Commanders, Las Vegas Raiders and Green Bay Packers if he is designated before the Week 11 game.So far this season, Dobbins has played in 10 games where he has totaled 772 rushing yards and four touchdowns.Injuries have plagued Dobbins' career, with the former second round pick missing 43 games over four years with the Baltimore Ravens and four games with the Los Angeles Chargers last season. If he misses more than one game, it will mark the fifth straight year he missed multiple games.\nDobbins' absence means a heavier workload for rookie RJ Harvey this week and potentially for the next few games. The rookie out of UCF has 214 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 50 carries so far this season while adding 175 receiving yards and four scores through the passing game.The running back room also includes Tyler Badie and Jaleel McLaughlin.\nThe 5-4 Chiefs and 8-2 Broncos will face off at Mile High at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. The Chiefs are favored in the matchup (-3.5), per DraftKings.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Legacies are on the line Saturday at UFC 322 as two fighters look to join the exclusive group of fighters who have held UFC championships in two different weight classes. In the main event, former lightweight champion Islam Makhachev moves up to welterweight to challenge champion Jack Della Maddalena. The co-main event features Zhang Weili jumping from strawweight to flyweight to face champ Valentina Shevchenko.Both Makhachev and Weili vacated their titles for the chance to jump a division and challenge for a new title. Shevchenko, the longtime dominant force in the division, has turned away similar challenges from former strawweight champions.Meanwhile, Della Maddalena is making the first defense of his title, which he won by dominating Belal Muhammad in May.There are plenty of interesting fights to follow on Saturday night that could have huge implications on divisional outlooks. Specifically, Saturday night is a big one in the welterweight division. Sean Brady looks to hold his spot and potentially move toward his first title shot when he takes on the fast rising Michael Morales. Plus, former champion Leon Edwards looks to get back in the title picture when he takes on rising contender Carlos Prates. Whoever emerges victorious in these two bouts could have an argument for challenging the winner in the main event.\nWith such an intriguing card, we once again looked at the full main card to deliver our best bets for each of the five main card fights on the UFC 322 card.After going 3-1 for our best bets for UFC 321, our 2025 record sits at 27-20. We'll look keep our roll going on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Beneil Dariush\tvs.\tBenoit Saint DenisBenoit Saint Denis moneyline (-192)Saint Denis built a lot of excitement over a five-fight winning streak that saw him flash good striking and a solid ground game. With some buzz building that he could be a future title contender, Saint Denis was given a brutal reality check when he was stopped by Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano in back-to-back fights. Since those losses, Saint Denis has picked up a pair of submission wins to begin to build momentum again. Dariush's story is not dissimilar, emerging as a title contender while riding an eight-fight winning streak before first-round knockout losses to Charles Oliveira and Arman Tsarukyan. Dariush got back in the win column in his most recent fight, taking a decision over Moicano. Dariush has faced a better level of opposition overall, but he's the older man and Saint Denis has a decided edge in power. With wrestling games that likely cancel each other out, I lean toward taking Saint Denis' striking to carry the day.\nLeon Edwards vs. Carlos PratesLeon Edwards via decision (+275)This is a very stereotypical crossroads matchup, with Edwards as the old veteran seemingly on the downside of his career. After winning the welterweight championship against Kamaru Usman, defending it in the rematch and taking care of Colby Covington, Edwards lost the title to Belal Muhammad before being submitted by Sean Brady in March. Prates is only two years younger than Edwards, but he's the fighter on the upswing, looking to take out a former champion and emerge as a potential title challenger. Prates is a flashy striker who has scored a knockout in his 11 most recent victories. Edwards is a patient, technical striker who has an underrated wrestling game. Prates' lone UFC loss came against Ian Machado Garry, who utilized a gameplan of mixing up striking and wrestling to tire Prates out while not allowing him to get his big strikes going. That's a very easy gameplan for Edwards to follow with his skills. If Edwards wins, it seems most likely he does it on the scorecards, so that's the play.\n        \n            \n                UFC 322: A look at champions who have earned second division title and those who came up short\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSean Brady\tvs.\tMichael MoralesSean Brady moneyline (-135)The great matchmaking at UFC 322 continues with this pivotal welterweight clash. Brady is ranked No. 2 at welterweight in the UFC's official rankings while Morales sits at No. 8. The fighters have a combined 36-1 record with 23 wins by stoppage. Brady is already in line for a title shot, though Makhachev's decision to move to the division allowed him to jump the line -- and Brady. To maintain his spot, Brady will have to overcome a similarly aggressive opponent who has yet to taste defeat. This fight may come down to wrestling. Brady averages more than 3.5 takedowns per 15 minutes while Morales defends takedowns at a success rate of 89%. Of course, Morales hasn't faced a murderer's row of great wrestlers and Brady presents a host of new tests for the Ecuadorian. Brady is more battle-tested against better opposition, and -135 feels like a good price on the higher-ranked, more proven fighter.Valentina Shevchenko vs.\tZhang WeiliFight to go the distance: Yes (-225)The fight to go over 4.5 rounds is -270, so you're getting a much better price to bet on that final 2:30 ticking away. These are two of the best fighters in the history of women's MMA. Shevchenko hasn't picked up a stoppage win since September 2021. Weili has more recent stoppages, but is also coming up a division to challenge for Shevchenko's title. Two skilled fighters in a division with a low stoppage rate makes betting on the full five rounds a solid play. Shevchenko is also very good at slowing down explosive strikers, and if Weili can't be explosive on the feet, the chances of a stoppage plummet. It would be a surprise if Shevchenko is drawn into extended firefights and will likely look to grind on Weili along the cage and work takedowns. All of that adds up to a fight that goes to the scorecards.\nJack Della Maddalena vs.\tIslam MakhachevOver 3.5 rounds (-135)I want to pull the trigger on Della Maddalena at +230 because of a nagging feeling that he presents some of the problems that troubled Makhachev in the first fight with Alexander Volkanovski. Della Maddalena isn't the wrestler Volkanovski is, but he is solid on the ground and has very good striking. Makhachev looks like he has bulked up appropriately ahead of vying for 170-pound gold, and his wrestling and top game is as good as almost anyone in the world. That's all holding me back from making the upset our best bet pick. Instead, we're taking the fight to go over 3.5 rounds, relying on Della Maddalena to be able to survive some uncomfortable positions while winning some exchanges on the feet. Makhachev may wear Della Maddalena down over time and find the stoppage, but I'm not seeing it happening early. And, if you're feeling spicy, you can fire an extra bullet on the upset.Who wins UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

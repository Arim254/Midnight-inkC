The 49ers will not have Brock Purdy (toe) available on Sunday, leaving Mac Jones in line for his fourth appearance.  Kickoff from Raymond James Stadium is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

The defense is more middle-of-the-pack, but the 49ers have still found ways to grind out wins. Christian McCaffrey has been forced into a hybrid role since the receiving corps is so injured, and he still hasn't tallied a rushing touchdown this season. He will be challenged on Sunday by a Bucs defense that is only allowing 92.4 yards on the ground per game.  Tampa Bay's pass rush isn't quite as solid and has allowed four of five opposing quarterback this season to throw for over 200 yards and at least one touchdown. (Sam Darnold threw for 341 yards with four touchdowns in Week 5.) Mayfield and the Bucs offense has been picking up the slack, however, and have been averaging 353.8 total yards and 27.0 points per game. The Bucs are dealing with injuries, as running back Bucky Irving and wide receiver Mike Evans have both been ruled out, although Rachaad White and Emeka Egbuka have been successfully filling those roles.Click here to bet 49ers vs. Buccaneers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's 49ers vs. Buccaneers score prediction, picksBoth teams are 3-2-0 ATS this season and have the ability to keep games close despite dealing with injuries to key players.

The run game is decimated now that Omarion Hampton has joined Najee Harris on the IR, and the Chargers will be down two top offensive tackles if Joe Alt can't play in Week 6. There are bright spots for LA, however, as the defense remains solid and is responsible for the last four games hitting the Under. This will be key as the Chargers face a struggling Dolphins offense.   Miami's offense is generating just 278.6 total yards per game, while the defense is allowing 386.6 total yards per game. Tyreek Hill's absence loomed large in Week 5, even as Tagovailoa threw for three touchdowns. De'Von Achane has just one rushing touchdown on the season and has had trouble generating any kind of momentum, even against a subpar team like the Panthers. The Dolphins can often depend on the Florida climate to give them an edge in October football, although they enter Week 6 with just one home victory.Click here to bet Chargers vs. Dolphins at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Chargers vs. Dolphins score prediction, picksBoth teams have covered the spread just twice heading into Week 6.

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts (4-1) look to stay hot at home as they host the Arizona Cardinals (2-3) in NFL Week 6. Daniel Jones and the Colts got back into the win column in Week 5 with a decisive 40-6 victory against the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray and the Cardinals suffered a second-half meltdown their last time out that resulted in a 22-21 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Kickoff from Lucas Oil Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET.

Murray ran the ball into the end zone in the first quarter but was held without a touchdown pass on the day. Then, safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson picked off Cam Ward but fumbled the ball, leaving room for Tyler Lockett to recover it for a Titans touchdown. Now the injuries are piling up on offense including a foot injury Murray sustained against Tennessee, which could make the Cardinals more vulnerable against an opportunistic Indianapolis team.  The Colts were brought back down to earth by their Week 4 loss to the Rams, but were able to coast to victory against the subpar Raiders. Jonathan Taylor had three touchdowns in Week 5 and now leads the league in rushing yards (480) and touchdowns (6). The defense is giving up 315.0 total yards per game but only allowing 17.8 points, so the Colts should have their work cut out for them against a banged-up Cardinals offense.Click here to bet Cardinals vs. Colts at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Cardinals vs. Colts score prediction, picksThe Cardinals are 6-2 ATS in their last eight games against the AFC South but are 2-3-0 ATS on the season, while the Colts are 4-1-0 ATS.

Cincinnati, which has lost three straight games, made headlines this week when it acquired quarterback Joe Flacco from the Cleveland Browns and named him Sunday's starter over Jake Browning. Meanwhile, Jordan Love and the Packers emerge from their Week 5 bye, which was preceded by a 40-40 overtime tie with the Dallas Cowboys.  Kickoff from Lambeau Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

The Bengals defense isn't faultless, however, since it is allowing the third-most total yards per game (391.2) and points per game (31.2) in the NFL. Cincinnati's offense has gotten an upgrade -- at least on paper -- with Flacco under center, but the same porous defense will be going up against a Packers team that can march the ball downfield.  Love had his best game of the season in Week 4, completing 31 of 43 passes for 337 yards with three touchdowns against Dallas. He's averaging 250.0 yards per game while Josh Jacobs controls the rush with 66.5 yards per game and four rushing touchdowns on the season.

Maye didn't throw a touchdown pass against the Bills but was still 22-for-30 with 273 passing yards as he continues to improve week over week. New England's defense has been solid all year and should be able to pressure Rattler through a weak Saints offensive line in Week 6.  Rattler did his part by connecting with Rashid Shaheed in New Orleans' upset against New York, and has gone two straight weeks without throwing an interception. While the Saints offense has shown signs of life, the defense is allowing 326.2 total yards per game. It has been particularly inconsistent against the run game, so it's anyone's guess if or how they will be able to contain Rhamondre Stevenson.Click here to bet Patriots vs. Saints at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Patriots vs. Saints score prediction, picksNew England is 3-2-0 ATS on the season and 9-3-0 ATS over their last 12 road games.

    "body": "\n        This is why everyone collectively holds their breath on No. 4 Ole Miss as a legitimate College Football Playoff contender under coach Lane Kiffin. Saturday's 24-21 escape against Washington State, who entered as a 33-point underdog, produced a lot of \"surrender cobras\" and lengthy sighs from Rebels fans who sensed the game was heading in the wrong direction throughout for one of the SEC's lone remaining unbeaten teams. Unfortunately, it's a feeling those in Oxford know all too well under Kiffin, whose two losses last season against unranked competition cost the Rebels a spot in the CFP. A loss to the Cougars Saturday would've been the most improbable of his tenure, considering the gaffes last fall came in SEC play against Kentucky and Florida.\"Hats off to Washington State, those guys played really hard ... we didn't make plays at the end to close it out,\" Kiffin said after the game. \"I guess maybe survive and advance mentality. [We] were very erratic ... we had them stopped on third down, late hit on quarterback. really not a clean day, but we got through a trap game and we've got to go play a lot better.\"\nThe Rebels needed a defensive stop in the final minute with Washington State out of timeouts to preserve the victory -- this, after the Rebels failed to run out the clock and were instead forced to punt the ball back to the Cougars. Adamant earlier this season about his program not having the resources to compete with a \"$30 million roster\" following a 59-24 loss to Washington, Cougars coach Jimmy Rogers and his bargain bin two-deep were only a couple plays away from taking down one of the SEC's top titans with the most shocking upset of the season.Kiffin has practically written the book on how to overlook outmanned competition courtesy of bad execution, a litany of missed opportunities and the excuse of another sleepy, early kickoff dooming his supposed contender. Two plays after a hands to face penalty on the Rebels — the team's third personal foul of the contest and one of eight penalties on the day — Washington State running back Kirby Vorhees took a dive play 46 yards to the end zone for a 14-10 lead with 10:19 to play in the third quarter. \nMore than 2,100 miles away from its own campus, Washington State's first trip to Oxford was nearly complete before the Rebels' depth — specifically along the defensive front — took over late.In his sixth season at Ole Miss, Kiffin is now 50-18, with eight of those losses coming against unranked opponents. He nearly had another in Week 7 that would've been unconscionable given the Rebels' start as one of the nation's top squads.Last season, Kiffin said the home loss to Kentucky as a double-digit favorite was \"really hard to deal with\" before murmuring some of the same stuff after falling at Florida in November ended playoff hopes.\nThe fastest to 50 overall wins in program history, Kiffin dismissed that number after a headache-inducing performance from his team.\"I don't know ... we barely won today, so I ain't worried about that,\" Kiffin said.Wake-up call for Ole Miss before GeorgiaIt's easier to stomach teachable moments after a win than the alternative, and luckily for the Rebels, their defense was efficient down the stretch and harassed Washington State quarterback Zevi Eckhaus. The first three possessions of the contest for Ole Miss resulted in a turnover on downs, a missed field goal and a lost fumble before scores on three of its next four possessions pushed the Rebels out front for good.\nOle Miss took a 17-14 lead on Trinidad Chambliss' 17-yard scramble drill touchdown late in the third quarter before his touchdown pass to Cayden Lee with 6:51 left pushed the lead to 10 points.Kiffin joked at halftime that he told Chambliss to get it together and focus on what the Rebels did right to end the opening half with consecutive scoring drives. \"Early on I said, 'Let's not go back to that Division II stuff,'\" Kiffin said.Foolish banter from Kiffin aside, Saturday's effort in any of the Rebels' five remaining games against SEC competition will take this top-five team out of the league title conversation and ultimately, remove them from playoff consideration, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a Week 1 win over Alabama, no one expected Florida State coach Mike Norvell to end up on the hot seat again in 2025, but three consecutive losses in ACC play to Virginia, Miami and Pittsburgh turned up the pressure once again on Norvell in Tallahassee, as frustrations continue to mount over back-to-back seasons of major ACC struggles. The loss to Pittsburgh dropped Norvell's record in Tallahassee to 36-30, as the Seminoles, now 3-3, have seen extremely high highs and tremendously low lows since he took over in 2020. The high point was the 2024 season when they went undefeated in the regular season and won the ACC Championship, only to controversially get left out of the College Football Playoff at 13-0. After that season, his second straight season with double-digit wins, Norvell was awarded a massive new contract extension that takes him through 2031. Since signing that deal, Florida State has gone 5-13 overall and 1-10 in the ACC. But if Florida State's boosters are itching to make a change, they will have to dig deep into their pockets to move on from Norvell. \n\n        \n            \n                Pitt stuns No. 25 Florida State as historic slide continues under Mike Norvell with eight straight ACC loss\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat is Mike Norvell's contract buyout at Florida State?Norvell's extension tacked six more years on to his original contract and bumped his annual salary up north of $10 million per year, putting him in line with the elite coaches in college football. Norvell's buyout is 85% of his remaining contract, and from 2025 to 2031, Norvell is scheduled to make $72.7 million. That means his buyout before this season was $61.8 million and his buyout after this season would still be $53.3 million. The buyout can be paid in full or in monthly installments through the 2031 season. Norvell did agree to restructure his deal after last year's 2-10 debacle, taking a one-year pay cut of $4.5 million for the 2025 season to help with potential revenue sharing. However, he has the opportunity to make that money back in bonuses through the remainder of his contract -- and would get the full amount back in his buyout if fired after this season -- and then a pro rated amount of that $4.5 million, decreasing by $750,000 each year until his contract runs up in 2031.\nNorvell's buyout being north of $50 million makes him one of the ten most expensive coaches in the country to fire. That means things would have to go from bad to worse for Florida State to consider firing him. But after a 3-0 start pushed the Seminoles up into the top 10 in the rankings, things have gone south quickly for Norvell and he will need to steady the ship to avoid his seat getting even hotter. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We had a successful Game 5 of the ALDS, hitting our two plays and coming damn close on the bonus play (scoreless through five innings; it was 1-0 through five), so what do you say we have a big Game 5 over on the NL side? It's the Cubs and Brewers in Milwaukee at 8:08 p.m. ET. The Cubs will use lefty reliever Drew Pomeranz as the opener, while the Brewers will likely lean on Jacob Misiorowski heavily as the bulk-inning guy for the Brew Crew. The Cubs can use starters Shota Imanaga and/or Colin Rea in relief before getting to their high-leverage guys. \nLet's grab a little action, with the lines courtesy of DraftKings.Michael Busch 2+ H+R+RBI (+106)The Cubs' lefty leadoff man is one of the most underrated sluggers in baseball and he's been showing it all postseason, riding the wave from a late-season hot streak. In his last 17 games in the regular season, Busch went 19 for 59 (.322) with six doubles, a triple, eight home runs, 14 RBI and 13 runs. So far in the playoffs, he's 7 for 24 (.292) with four home runs. In eight games in American Family Field this season, Busch has three home runs, six RBI and four runs.\nOver 7.5 runs (-110)I'll avoid picking a winner here because it's kind of a toss up to me. The Brewers are correctly favored at -149, but I don't want that much juice. The Cubs have a good number at +122, but the Brewers are more likely to win. The run line has the Cubs at -167 for +1.5, and that's too much juice. The Brewers run line (-1.5, +137) might be the best play, but it sure feels like a one-run game is highly likely. Instead, we'll chase the runs. Neither team has a dominant starter on the hill and while Misiorowski is capable of dominating, it won't be for a long time. He went for three innings and 57 pitches in Game 2. Both teams have seen an awful lot of the bullpens in this series and the offensive players will find enough success to get us over here. It doesn't even have to be overly high scoring. A 5-3 final score gets us home.\nBonus: First inning run (+105)There have been runs scored in the first inning in every single game this series, so why stop now? Here's where things stood after the first inning in each game: \nGame 1: Brewers 6, Cubs 1Game 2: 3-3 tieGame 3: Cubs 4, Brewers 1Game 4: Cubs 3, Brewers 0The NRFI (no run first inning) play is a popular one in some betting circles, but it's a loser in this series. We're going with the YRFI (yes run first inning!) again. \n            ",

It's a fresh matchup. The two teams have only faced each other once in the playoffs and that was the Wild Card Series in 2022, with the Mariners winning two games to none. The Blue Jays haven't been to the ALCS since 2016 and haven't been to the World Series since 1993. The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant. They remain the only team of 30 in MLB to have never played in the World Series. They'll have their chance to advance here, but they have to deal with a hungry Blue Jays team.

They had to use three starting pitchers in the game, with George Kirby going five innings, Logan Gilbert working two innings, and Luis Castillo 1 ⅓. Relievers Matt Brash and Eduard Bazardo had to get six and eight outs, respectively, while All-Star closer Andrés Muñoz threw 25 pitches. Basically, their pitchers are gassed with only one day off before Game 1. This is one of the best offenses in baseball on the road, though, led by 60-homer catcher Cal Raleigh. Blue Jays: The Blue Jays scored 34 runs in their four games against the Yankees in the ALDS. It was a continuation of a stellar regular season for their offense. They were third in the majors in OPS this season. After the All-Star break, they scored 358 runs in 66 games, the most in Major League Baseball. They have a hot-hitting star in Vladimir Guerrero Jr., but also an excellent supporting cast with George Springer, Daulton Varsho, Alejandro Kirk and a host of others being big performers. The rotation is led by veteran Kevin Gausman and rookie sensation Trey Yesavage. \n Series prediction This is a remarkably unpredictable series, especially with Seattle's T-Mobile Park being such an oppressive venue for offense. We'll go with the Blue Jays in seven here, but nothing would surprise us. It'll be excellent theater.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

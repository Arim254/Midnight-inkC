    "body": "\n        What could have been a miraculous comeback story at the Olympics ended in heartbreak for Lindsey Vonn, who was airlifted to a hospital after a devastating crash in the women's downhill final on Sunday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games. Vonn announced after undergoing surgery that she sustained a complex tibia fracture during the catastrophic run and that she will have to undergo multiple more procedures to repair her broken leg.Vonn had already fought through a torn ACL -- which she sustained in a training accident just one week ahead of the Olympics -- and would have been the greatest recovery stories in all of sports had she gotten to the medal podium while racing on a bad knee. Instead, her competitive career may be over for good.In the wake of her agonizing incident on the mountain in Italy, Vonn released a statement via social media:\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would. It wasn't a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.\"Unfortunately, I sustained a complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets. Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself. I also knew that racing was a risk. It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport.\"And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life. We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is the also the beauty of life; we can try.\"I tried. I dreamt. I jumped.\"I hope if you take away anything from my journey it's that you all have the courage to dare greatly. Life is too short not to take chances on yourself. Because the only failure in life is not trying.\"I believe in you, just as you believed in me.\"Injuries, unfortunately, largely defined Vonn's career. She will always be heralded as one of the greatest skiers of all time, but her battles with knee issues and other ailments are more than just a footnote on her remarkable résumé. The most recent torn ligament and broken bone may spell the end of an unforgettable two-plus decades as one of the faces of the sport.Olympic skiing figures defend Vonn for competing on torn ACLThe consensus from the Olympic skiing community is clear: Don't blame Vonn for pushing the limits, and don't think that her crash was a result of her torn ACL.Leaders of international skiing bodies and some of Vonn's fellow competitors set the record straight that Sunday's crash was entirely unrelated to her preexisting injury.\"Totally incorrect,\" Vonn's teammate Keely Cashman said, via the Associated Press. \"People that don't know ski racing don't really understand what happened yesterday. She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70 miles an hour, and so that twists your body around. That has nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to with her knee. I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot people don't [know] what's going on.\"International Ski and Snowboard Federation president Johan Eliasch called Vonn \"incredibly unlucky\" and said the incident was a \"one in 1,000\" situation.The downhill is alpine skiing's fastest and most dangerous event. A myriad of things could go wrong on any given run, often with dramatic consequences. A fully intact ACL would have done nothing to prevent Vonn from tumbling down the mountain after clipping the gate on that fateful jump.Vonn's dramatic exit from the downhill final precipitated a wave of hindsight-aided reactions from fans and pundits. The American skiing legend should have played it safe and backed out of the competition the moment she tore her ACL, some argued. But those most experienced in the sport emphasized that Vonn was able to train at a high caliber despite the injury, and they noted that she consulted with qualified trainers and coaches before making the decision to race.\"This decision was really hers and her team to take,\" International Olympic Committee sports director Pierre Ducrey said. \"She made the decision and unfortunately it led to the injury, but I think it's really the way that the decision gets made for every athlete that participates to the downhill.\"Vonn's competitive future in question after latest injuriesThat Vonn elected to compete in such a dangerous and demanding event at less than full strength may have led some to question her sanity, others commended the three-time Olympic medalist for her courage and commitment to the sport. The latter argument only solidifies her legacy as an all-time great. But with health being such a large part of her competitive story at this point in her career, it is reasonable to wonder just how much more Vonn has left in the tank.\nIf it were up to her father, Vonn would hang up her ski boots for good at the end of this Olympic run.\"She's 41 years old and this is the end of her career,\" Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said to the Associated Press. \"There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.\"Vonn retired from competition in February 2019 after the World Championships, citing her already lengthy injury history. She announced nearly six years later that she was coming out of retirement, and with the goal of qualifying for the 2026 Winter Olympics, she returned to the slopes in December 2024. Two months ago, Vonn became the oldest downhill skiing World Cup winner at 41.\nIf this is the end of the road for Vonn in her professional endeavors, it will be a bitter exit from the sport for a fervent competitor.\"She's a very strong individual,\" Kildow said. \"She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she's able to handle it. Better than I expected. She's a very, very strong person. And so I think she's handling it real well.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mornings for golf fans frequently consist of brewing a pot of coffee, flipping on PGA Tour coverage and answering emails with one eye on the golf in the background. Dew still rests on fairways as perfectly manicured golf courses, ideal weather and birdsong flood living rooms and in-home offices. Fans' appetites are whetted by coverage of rookies before marquee groupings finally make their way to the first tee.For some, that routine has been altered this year, largely due to Patrick Reed.The 2018 Masters champion has entered the winner's circle in two of his last three DP World Tour starts with wins at the Dubai Desert Classic and Qatar Masters sandwiching a playoff loss at the Bahrain Championship. Reed has ascended to No. 1 in the Race to Dubai, all but assuring him a full-time PGA Tour card for the 2027 season; those are offered to every golfer who finishes inside the top 10 of the season-long race, not otherwise exempt.Reed's point total has already reached 2,260 through four tournaments. Last season, Jordan Smith claimed the final PGA Tour card through the Race to Dubai with just 2,203 points. The year prior, Tom McKibbin did the same with 1,897 points (though he ultimately decided to play for LIV Golf instead).Reed will climb the priority rankings for the 2027 season after banking on using a past champions' exemption to play some PGA Tour events after deciding not to re-sign with LIV Golf. That will no longer be necessary as the American has jumped to No. 17 in the Official World Golf Rankings ahead of names like Collin Morikawa, Ludvig Åberg, Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick.\nAs it goes with runs of form like this, fans now want to watch Reed on the biggest stage (PGA Tour), wondering why he's not already back on the circuit. A Returning Player Program got conjured out of thin air to bring Brooks Koepka back to the PGA Tour, but Reed does not come close to meeting those marks based on his past success.But you know what? That's OK. After all, what Reed is doing ... that's rare ... and you can follow his journey just the same.Reed's travel itinerary for the last four weeks featured Dubai (twice), Bahrain and Qatar. The ultimate grinder did just that through the Middle East. Next up are Africa and Asia before the schedule settles into its European stretch.\nThe 35-year-old could become the second American to ever win the Race to Dubai (Collin Morikawa, 2021, playing 10 tournaments) and first to do it while participating in a full-time DP World Tour schedule. Not since Tommy Fleetwood in 2017 has a Race to Dubai champion played more than 20 DP World Tour events.Reed could become a thorn in Rory McIlroy's side again as the five-time major champion looks to win his fifth straight Race to Dubai and tie Colin Montgomerie for the most all-time with eight. McIlroy averaged 5,755 points in his run of four straight season-long crowns; Reed is roughly 40% of the way there.Remember their rivalry? The Ryder Cup singles match in 2016 with the hooting, hollering, shushing and finger waving? Reed throwing a tee at McIlroy on the range in Dubai a few seasons back? That has the potential to be rekindled. Those two could share meaningful tee times on a stage that is not a major championship.\nIt would be great if this was happening on the PGA Tour, but all it will take is a shift in your morning schedule to watch Reed accumulate point after point and trophy after trophy on golf courses of which you may not be familiar, against players whose names you may not be able to pronounce.Take the time to watch a man going about it his own way, making his way back through the only way he knows how. In the process, Patrick Reed might even win you over, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NFL season officially over, sports bettors will take a closer look at the hardwood, and the current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Monday features a 10-game NBA slate, including the Los Angeles Lakers hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder at 10 p.m. ET. Both teams will be without their leading scorers, with Thunder guard and reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (foot) out and Lakers superstar guard Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but NBA legend LeBron James isn't on the injury report, and the Lakers are coming off a 103-97 win over the Warriors on Saturday without Doncic. Despite SGA being out, the Lakers are still underdogs, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees value in that. The model is backing the Lakers as 6.5-point underdogs as one of its Monday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for total points scored in Lakers vs. Thunder is 222.5.The model is also backing the Miami Heat to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Utah Jazz, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a college basketball bet on Xavier vs. No. 22 St. John's at 6:30 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Not tonight, however, as we suspect there is little chance the Red Storm (nine wins in a row) suddenly goes flat against Papa Rick Pitino's son Richard and his Xavier, which already took a good shot at the Johnnies in Cincinnati two weeks ago and put a scare into Papa in an 88-83 St John's escape,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers, however, have absorbed a couple of heavy losses since and been outclassed multiple times on the Big East trail, and dealing with the Storm's excellent balance, near 85 ppg offense, and productive frontliners Zuby Ejifor and Bryce Hopkins looms difficult.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)The Heat are coming off a 132-101 victory over the Wizards on Saturday, and similar to Washington, Utah isn't exactly playing the most inspiring basketball in a 16-37 season. The Jazz are 2-12 over their last 14 games, with eight of those losses coming by double digits. Meanwhile, five of the Heat's last six wins have come by double digits. Although the Heat are just 6-5 over their last 11 games, it's hard to picture them losing straight up to the Jazz, and given the way their wins have gone recently, the model likes their chances of a win by a wider margin. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and eight rebounds on Saturday, as one of seven Heat players to finish with at least 10 points. The model projects the Heat to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Heat to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)The Thunder have struggled without SGA, while the Lakers have continued to win without Luka Doncic over the start of their current absences. The Thunder are 1-2 with SGA sidelined with his current foot injury, while the Lakers rallied from trailing when Doncic exited on Thursday with a hamstring injury to defeat the 76ers. Then, the Lakers defeated the Warriors on Saturday. Austin Reaves had 35 points on Thursday, and he's averaging 26.1 points per game this season. LeBron James continues to showcase his greatness, including posting 20 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Saturday with Doncic out. James has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games. The Lakers host OKC on Monday, and they are 14-8 in Los Angeles this season. The model projects the Lakers to compete with the NBA-leading Thunder, who are missing SGA, with the Lakers covering in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

Meanwhile, Arizona has seen its last two games overall go under, in addition to five of its last six fail to reach the total.Even with the Wildcats' potency on the offensive end, their defense is their strongest unit. Arizona is second in the nation in defensive rating and allows the eighth-lowest field goal percentage in Division I. Kansas star Darryn Peterson is projected to be held under his season average as the Under hits 55% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits over 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Arizona vs. Kansas, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Arizona vs. Kansas spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a potential landmark ruling for the future of college sports, a judge denied Alabama basketball player Charles Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules, according to court documents obtained by AL.com. Bediako, who returned to the Crimson Tide after signing an NBA contract and playing in the G League, will no longer be permitted to play college basketball under NCAA bylaws.Bediako became the first former pro to return to college when he received a temporary restraining order against the NCAA in January. That order prohibited the NCAA from enforcing its eligibility rules on the 7-footer and paved the way for him to play in five games for the Crimson Tide, across which he averaged 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.The temporary restraining order was always a stopgap solution to get Bediako on the floor. His ultimate goal was to receive an injunction which would effectively clear him to play the rest of the season. Bediako and his counsel were back in court last Friday for the injunction hearing, and after deliberating on the matter over the weekend, judge Daniel Pruet ruled in the NCAA's favor and denied the injunction.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball drew the ire of many throughout the sport, and it even prompted SEC commissioner Greg Sankey to sign an affidavit against his cause. Days before the injunction hearing, Sankey asked the judge to uphold the eligibility rules \"which are essential to the integrity of college sports, to the educational mission they serve, and to the opportunities they provide for current and future student-athletes.\"This case delivered numerous twists, including an extension of Bediako's temporary restraining order, the recusal of a judge who was an Alabama booster and the postponement of the injunction hearing. All the while, Bediako was on the floor for the Crimson Tide for the first time since the 2023 NCAA Tournament.\n\"We are disappointed in today's court ruling, denying the injunction for Charles Bediako,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"While we understand the concern around competitive and developmental implications of former professional athletes participating in college, it is important to acknowledge reality.\"The NCAA has granted eligibility to over 100 current men's basketball players with prior professional experience in the G League or overseas. Granting eligibility to some former professionals, and not to others, is what creates the havoc we are currently in and why consistency from decision-makers is so desperately needed.\"The NCAA does routinely grant eligibility waivers to athletes with professional experience -- namely those who played for G League Ignite before its fold in 2024 and those who come to the United States from overseas -- but only if they have not yet played American college basketball. The association strictly prohibits players like Bediako from leaving for the NBA or another pro league and then returning for a second stint of college basketball.\nBediako ruling could impact other ongoing eligibility casesWhile Bediako was the first professional player to return to college, he is not the only athlete seeking additional eligibility through the court system. His denial of an injunction could have ramifications for those other cases.All of these arguments exist on the basis that the NCAA's four-year eligibility limit unfairly restricts athletes' abilities to earn compensation for their name, image and likeness. Bediako sought to utilize the years he forwent when he declared for the NBA Draft. Others, like Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar and Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, argue that the seasons they spent in junior college should not count toward their four-year eligibility clocks.Both Aguilar and Chambliss went to state courts to seek another year with their respective football programs. Now that there exists legal precedent in one of these cases, the judges presiding over their respective cases could cite the Bediako ruling in decisions to rule against their injunctive relief. The quarterbacks' cases are different enough, however, that such an outcome is no guarantee.\n            ",

I hope to bring some of that to the Illini. I can't wait to get started.\"On Feb. 4, Hauck, 61, retired as the Grizzlies' coach after two remarkable runs, the first from 2003-09, the second from 2018-25. Over those 14 seasons, Hauck won 151 games and eight Big Sky titles and made 13 FCS playoffs, including four FCS National Championship games. The 151 wins are a Big Sky record.Hauck spent 2010-14 at UNLV, where he went 15-49. He then spent 2015-17 as the San Diego State special teams coordinator before returning to the Grizzlies.\"There's never a convenient spot in the college football calendar to announce you're retiring, so today's as good as any,\" Hauck said on Feb. 4. \"I wasn't going to have them spread my ashes on the practice field because I dropped dead out there. There comes a juncture where it's time to do something else.\"\nHauck lamented the changing college football landscape in his retirement press conference, saying, \"A lot of the head coach stuff in current day Division I college football is not enjoyable. I think it's the perfect time for me to retire.\"But apparently the draw of being a Big Ten coordinator was too good to pass up. The Illini have steadily improved under Bielema, winning 19 games in the past two seasons. Now, they'll hope the addition of Hauck helps continue the upward trajectory. The Grizzlies were a top-10 scoring defense in FCS in 2021 and 2023 using Hauck's 3-3-5 scheme.\"I am excited to welcome Coach Hauck and his family to our Illini FamILLy,\" said Bielema. \"Since meeting Coach Hauck early on in my head coaching career, I have had tremendous respect for who he is, what he stands for, and the program he has built. He is a family man with incredible attention to detail and a great ability to teach the game to both his staffs and players. Coach Hauck's aggressive defensive scheme, which he learned at San Diego State and developed at Montana, will be an exciting new style that has never been seen here at Illinois.\"\nWide receivers coach Bobby Kennedy has taken over for Hauck at Montana.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kenneth Walker III knew his impending free agency would be a topic ahead of Super Bowl LX, but the Seahawks running back kept his eyes on the game and the Patriots' stout run defense.\"I really just want to focus on practicing, getting ready for the game,\" Walker said during the week leading up to the Super Bowl, per The Athletic. \"After that, we'll see what happens.\"But he also ventured into the \"after that\" part.\"I've been here four years, so you know I've gotten to know a lot of stuff about Seattle, and you know a lot of the city, and I feel like they feel good about me as well,\" he said, per NFL Media. \"If it was my choice, though, I'd definitely stay.\"Then the Super Bowl came, and Walker flourished: 161 yards from scrimmage en route to becoming the first Super Bowl MVP running back in the 21st century.\nIt was part of a stellar postseason for Walker. With Zach Charbonnet sidelined by a torn ACL, Walker racked up 417 yards from scrimmage across three games. His 139 scrimmage yards per game were the second-most by a Super Bowl-winning running back this century, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 143.5 mark from last season. Walker also scored four touchdowns in the postseason after totaling just five in the regular season.Walker showed off his immense talents: tackle avoidance, patience, explosiveness, strength and creativity. He was a big-play threat as both a runner and receiver, and he handled 22-plus touches in all three games after his regular-season high was 20. During the regular season, Walker finished seventh in explosive rush rate (min. 100 carries) and second to Bijan Robinson in tackle-avoidance rate.\nA career year in a contract year is never a bad thing. There are plenty of winners from the Seahawks' championship run, but Walker -- given his production, age (25) and free agency status -- might be the biggest. Here's where he could end up next.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. SeahawksWalker said he'd \"definitely stay\" if Seattle wants him back, and coach Mike Macdonald added, \"Of course, we want Ken back.\"It takes more than words to make it happen, but Seattle should be the clear favorite for Walker's services. According to CBS Sports research, only three Super Bowl MVPs have played for a different team the following year: Dexter Jackson (2003), Desmond Howard (1997) and Larry Brown (1996). It's been a long time.Add in Charbonnet's recovery from a late-season knee injury, and Seattle has a clear need at the position. Keeping a Super Bowl hero just entering his prime makes sense.\n\n        \n            \n                Prophecies, pressure and a Lombardi Trophy: Inside the Seahawks' Super Bowl run\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. JaguarsThe Jaguars have an impending free agent running back coming off a breakout as well in Travis Etienne Jr. Should he not return to Jacksonville, Walker could emerge as a suitable replacement. The Jaguars jumped to 13-4 this season, their first under Liam Coen, who loves using multiple backs. He did so in Jacksonville in 2025 and previously in Tampa Bay.Walker would add serious explosiveness to the attack. He ranked seventh in explosive rush rate among 52 players with at least 100 carries this season; Etienne ranked 41st. Rookie Bhayshul Tuten didn't have enough carries to qualify, but if he had, he would have ranked 49th.Walker doesn't have to be a terrific pass catcher or blocker. Tuten can handle the former, and fellow 2025 rookie LeQuint Allen can handle the latter. It could be a strong match between a creative play caller and a talented running back.\nThere are connections, too: Chad Morton was the Seahawks' running backs coach when Seattle selected Walker and now holds the same role in Jacksonville. Shane Waldron was Seattle's offensive coordinator at the time as well and is now the Jaguars' pass game coordinator.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. JetsThe Jets also fall into the category of lead running back potentially going elsewhere. Breece Hall is a free agent. Selected five picks before Walker in the 2022 NFL Draft, Hall has been less explosive but significantly more consistent down to down.The Jets' offense was dismal in 2025, but with a new offensive coordinator in Frank Reich, a new quarterback almost certainly coming to town, a solid young offensive line and some of the deepest pockets in free agency, New York could be a fit.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. PanthersAfter emerging as one of the best free-agent signings midway through last season, Rico Dowdle saw his usage dwindle late in the year and said the role reduction would impact his free agency decision. If Dowdle leaves, the Panthers would be left with Chuba Hubbard, who posted a league-worst 0.7% explosive rushing rate last year. Hubbard is a much better player than the number suggests -- he had a 9.6% explosive rush rate in 2024 -- but the offense badly needs juice.Last year, Carolina ranked 28th in explosive play rate. Bryce Young isn't the type of player to rip off big gains through the air consistently, and if Hubbard's down 2025 is a sign of things to come, Carolina needs another playmaker. The Panthers graded as the NFL's fourth-best run-blocking unit, per Pro Football Focus, and placing Walker in that environment could produce exciting results.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. ChiefsIt's hard not to include the Chiefs on any list involving running backs. For the second straight season, Kansas City's backs posted the least explosive rushing rate in the NFL. A lot of good run blocking is going to waste. Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are both free agents, and Patrick Mahomes is coming off a torn ACL. The Chiefs need more explosiveness. Though they must move money around this offseason, they'd be wise to at least throw their hat in the ring.\nOther potential suitorsThe Vikings bear mentioning. Minnesota has Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason, but Jones is 31 and coming off the lowest yards per carry (4.2) of his career. A runner of Walker's caliber would help J.J. McCarthy and Kevin O'Connell. Minnesota, like Kansas City, is in a tough financial spot.Perhaps the Texans are a sleeper team. Houston's running backs ranked 27th in explosive rush rate in 2025, and Joe Mixon's football future is uncertain due to a \"freak\" medical condition. Woody Marks had a nice rookie year, but adding Walker would provide much-needed playmaking.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1400 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300).Other Pebble Beach contenders include Tommy Fleetwood (+2200) and Justin Rose, Si Woo Kim and Xander Schauffele all at +2500. The players who went to a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- are both close behind at +3000. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Kim (+2700). Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting four longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders, including one huge +5000 sleeper. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks' 29-13 win over the New England Patriots emphatically answered the question of which team was the NFL's best in 2025. Seattle was the NFC's top team during the regular season, and Sunday night's complete domination of the Patriots made it clear that no team was more deserving of hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy. A machine on both sides of the ball, Seattle allowed the fewest points in the NFL during the regular season and scored the third-most. Despite having the league's toughest schedule, the Seahawks posted the best points differential (+246) by a Super Bowl champion since the 1999 Rams. While nine of their wins were double-digit outcomes, Seattle was capable of winning close games, too. In fact, the Seahawks' most critical win during the regular season was their come-from-behind overtime win over the Rams in Week 16 that saw them overcome a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit. Seattle was No. 1 this season, but where do they rank among the other Super Bowl champions since 2000? Let's find out. \n26. 2001 PatriotsOverall record: 14-5 Super Bowl: Def. Rams 20-17The 2001 Patriots go down in history as New England's first Super Bowl champion and one that authored one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history. The Patriots were not a dominant team, but they had an opportunistic, hard-hitting defense and a young, clutch quarterback in Tom Brady, who engineered the game-winning drive that finished off the heavily favored Rams. They also had a dynamic playmaker in Troy Brown, who in addition to being nearly a 1,200-yard receiver was the NFL's best punt returner that season. The 2001 Patriots scored just three offensive touchdowns in the playoffs, one in each postseason win, which is one of the main reasons why they are ranked here. Instead of playing for overtime, Brady and the Patriots played for the win at the end of Super Bowl XXXVI. The Patriots won it all despite scoring just three offensive touchdowns during the entire postseason.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            25. 2000 Ravens Overall record: 16-4Super Bowl: Def. Giants 34-7Led by future Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis, Baltimore had a historically dominant defense, a punishing running game (led by then-rookie and future 2,000-yard rusher Jamal Lewis) and a dynamic returner in Jermaine Lewis. The Ravens were great in some elements, but they lacked an elite passing attack that contributed to the unit undergoing a five-game drought without a touchdown during the season. \nBaltimore's defense was awesome, but it didn't face the toughest of competition that season, especially from a quarterback standpoint (Troy Aikman was the only future Hall of Fame quarterback the team faced that season, and he and the Cowboys were on a steep decline at that point). That's one of the reasons why the 2000 Ravens are not ranked higher. In addition to having a legendary defense, the 2000 Ravens had an elite return ace in Jermaine Lewis.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            24. 2021 RamsOverall record: 16-5 Super Bowl: Def. Bengals 23-20 The Rams won each of their final three games by three points, including their victory over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. Los Angeles' Super Bowl win was spearheaded by three-time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald, quarterback Matthew Stafford and wideout Cooper Kupp, who capped off his brilliant season with an MVP performance in the Super Bowl. Along with big games from Kupp and Donald, the Rams' Super Bowl win included a controversial holding call against Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson that helped set up Kupp's game-winning score. The Rams' lack of dominance hurt them when compared to other recent champions. \nIncluding the playoffs, Kupp tallied 2,425 receiving yards in 2021, an NFL record. He caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns in Super Bowl LVI.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            23. 2011 Giants Overall record: 13-7Super Bowl: Def. Patriots 21-17 For a second time in four years, the Giants upset the favored Patriots in the Super Bowl. New York's upset was impressive, but it came against a weaker Patriots team this time around. Their Super Bowl win may not have been as impressive, but the Giants' run through the NFC playoffs certainly was. New York shocked the 15-1 Packers in the divisional round before beating a 49ers team that represented the NFC in the following year's Super Bowl. Quarterback Eli Manning was even better this postseason than he was in the 2007 playoffs. In four games, Manning completed 65% of his passes with nine touchdowns and just one pick. He averaged 305 passing yards per playoff game. Against the Patriots, Manning went 30 of 40 for 296 yards and a touchdown. His 46-yard dime to Mario Manningham set up the game-winning score. \nEli Manning had a postseason for the ages in 2011.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            22. 2018 PatriotsOverall record: 14-5Super Bowl: Def. Rams 13-3The sixth and final Patriots Super Bowl-winning team seemed more mortal than the franchise's previous five championship squads, especially after they dropped consecutive late-season games to Miami and Pittsburgh. But the Patriots showed they were still the Patriots in the playoffs, whipping the Chargers in the divisional round before edging the Chiefs in overtime in a classic AFC Championship game. In the Super Bowl, the Patriots held the Rams to the lowest point tally in Super Bowl history (along with the Dolphins, who also scored just three points back in Super Bowl VI). Tom Brady made several big plays down the stretch, while Julian Edelman was the game's MVP with 10 grabs for 141 yards. Rob Gronkowski's leaping catch set up the game-clinching score that put an exclamation point on the Patriots' dynasty.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            21. 2015 BroncosOverall record: 15-4Super Bowl: Def. Panthers 24-10 Denver slumped late in the regular season before rallying off wins over the Steelers, Broncos and Panthers in the playoffs. The Broncos' postseason charge was led by their defense, specifically Super Bowl MVP Von Miller. Denver got just enough plays from its offense and quarterback Peyton Manning, who retired following the Broncos' Super Bowl win. \nSpeaking of Manning, his second-to-last NFL game was Denver's 20-18 win over the Patriots in one of the most thrilling AFC title games of all time. The Broncos were the only AFC team during this time period that defeated the Patriots in the playoffs, which is one of the reasons why they cracked the top 20. Manning, the NFL's only five-time league MVP, embraced Cam Newton -- that year's league MVP -- after the Broncos upset the Panthers in what would be the final game of Manning's Hall of Fame career.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            20. 2007 Giants Overall record: 14-6Super Bowl: Def. Patriots 17-14It was hard to figure out where to put this team. The Giants are responsible for one of the greatest upsets in the history of pro spots, having defeated the previously 18-0 Patriots. New York's playoff run also included an epic win in Lambeau Field in what ended up being Brett Favre's final game with the Packers. New York wasn't that great in the regular season, though, going 10-6 and having the 14th-ranked scoring offense and 17th-ranked scoring defense. But the Giants' strengths came to the forefront in the playoffs, especially their ferocious pass rush, Eli Manning's clutch gene and Plaxico Burress' ability to make big plays. \nThe second-greatest upset in Super Bowl history included arguably the craziest play in Super Bowl history.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            19. 2022 Chiefs Overall record: 17-3Super Bowl: Def. Eagles 38-35 Patrick Mahomes' 2018 and '19 seasons were stellar, but his 2022 season might be his best season to date. Mahomes won his second MVP that year after leading the NFL with 5,250 yards and 41 touchdowns.Mahomes had to play at that level for the Chiefs to win, as Kansas City's defense allowed the most touchdown passes in the NFL that year and was second-to-last in the league in red zone efficiency. Kansas City's defense did just enough to contain the Bengals' high-scoring offense in the AFC Championship game, taking advantage of Cincinnati's battered offensive line. The defense had no answer for Jalen Hurts in the Super Bowl, but Mahomes and Co. made enough plays to secure the Chiefs' second title in four years. Mahomes' arm and his legs helped the Chiefs overcome a 10-point halftime deficit in Super Bowl LVII.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            18. 2005 SteelersOverall record: 15-5Super Bowl: Def. Seahawks 21-10 Pittsburgh became the first sixth seed to win the Super Bowl after defeating the Seahawks. The Steelers boasted a tough defense and an offense that thrived off of trick plays. Pittsburgh's offense also featured then-second-year quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who played well during the Steelers' historic playoff run that included a big upset over Peyton Manning's Colts in the divisional round. Roethlisberger actually had the game-saving tackle near the end of Pittsburgh's 21-18 win over the Colts. \nThe Steelers had a solid 1-2 running back punch in Willie Parker and Jerome Bettis. Parker recorded the longest run (75 yards) in Super Bowl history, while Bettis submitted his final 100-yard rushing performance in Pittsburgh's win over the Bears that jump-started their championship run. Pittsburgh's offense also featured Hines Ward, who won Super Bowl MVP honors. Appropriately nicknamed \"Fast Willie,\" Parker's record-setting run was the byproduct of his blazing speed and a crushing block from Pittsburgh guard Alan Faneca.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            17. 2003 Patriots Overall record: 17-2 Super Bowl: Def. Panthers 32-29After missing the playoffs in 2002, many thought that the Patriots' 2001 title may have been a fluke after the '03 team started 2-2. Those thoughts quickly went to the wayside, though, after the Patriots reeled off 21 straight wins (first six in 2004) that included 15 straight to close out the 2003 season. The Patriots defeated the Panthers in a thrilling Super Bowl. This team could beat you any which way. \nThe highest-scoring fourth quarter in Super Bowl history included then-Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel's first of two career Super Bowl touchdown catches.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            16. 2002 Buccaneers Overall record: 15-4Super Bowl: Def. Raiders 48-21 The Buccaneers were led by a legendary defense that featured future Hall of Famers Warren Sapp, Derrick Brooks, John Lynch and Ronde Barber. Like the 2000 Ravens, the 2002 Buccaneers had a historically great defense but an offense that was solid but unspectacular. The Bucs, though, had a little more firepower than the Ravens, especially at receiver with Keyshawn Johnson and Keenan McCardell, who both finished their career with well over 10,000 career receiving yards. Tampa Bay dismantled its longtime rival, the Eagles, in the NFC title game. In the Super Bowl, the Buccaneers defense recorded a Super Bowl-record five picks that included three returned for scores. Jon Gruden was the final piece of Tampa Bay's championship puzzle.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            15. 2023 Chiefs Overall record: 15-6Super Bowl: Def. 49ers 25-22 (OT) Kansas City started 9-6 before ripping off six straight wins. Unlike their previous two titles, the Chiefs had to go on the road in the playoffs. They defeated Josh Allen and the Bills in the divisional round before holding league MVP Lamar Jackson and the rest of the Ravens offense to just 10 points in the AFC title game. \nUnlike the previous season, the Chiefs defense was the engine that fueled Kansas City's championship run. In the Super Bowl, the unit forced the 49ers to settle for field goals on each of their final two drives, which gave Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a chance to respond on both occasions. Facing a talented 49ers team, the Chiefs prevailed in overtime after Mahomes made several big plays with his legs, including an 8-yard run on fourth down and a 19-yard scamper on third down. The Chiefs became the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions, and despite their inferior record, Kansas City's repeat squad was better than the '22 team. Mahomes added to his legacy by becoming the first QB to throw a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime in a Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            14. 2012 RavensOverall record: 14-6Super Bowl: Def. 49ers 34-31 Baltimore started 9-2 before losing four of its final five games to close out the regular season. The Ravens got a jolt, though, when Ray Lewis announced before the start of the playoffs that he was going to retire at season's end. The Ravens responded with four consecutive wins in the playoffs that included a stunning upset win over Peyton Manning's Broncos in the divisional round. Quarterback Joe Flacco threw three touchdowns in the Super Bowl and was named the game's MVP. Baltimore had to hang on for a three-point win after the 49ers staged a late rally. The Ravens got an interception in that game from future Hall of Fame safety Ed Reed, who like Lewis was playing in his final game with Baltimore. Flacco and the rest of the 2012 Ravens were elite.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            13. 2014 Patriots Overall record: 15-4 Super Bowl: Def. Seahawks 28-24 Many declared the Patriots' dynasty over after a Week 4 loss in Kansas City that dropped New England to 2-2. The Patriots responded with seven straight wins while reasserting their dominance over the rest of the AFC. New England had a top-five scoring offense and a top-10 scoring defense during the regular season. In the Super Bowl, New England dethroned the defending-champion Seahawks after overcoming a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit. The game ended with Malcolm Butler making one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history when he picked off Russell Wilson at the goal line with under a minute left. After a 10-year hiatus, Brady and the Patriots were back on top.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            12. 2017 Eagles Overall record: 16-3 Super Bowl: Def. Patriots 41-33 Philadelphia won the Super Bowl with backup quarterback Nick Foles outdueling Tom Brady. Foles was the story, but the 2017 Eagles championship run was a total team effort. Philadelphia had a top-five offense and defense during the regular season. In the playoffs, the Eagles edged the defending NFC champion Falcons in the divisional round before blowing out a talented Vikings team in the NFC title game. In the Super Bowl, the Eagles put 41 points on Bill Belichick's defense, with Foles throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. Foles threw three touchdowns, but his Super Bowl catch is what went down in Super Bowl lore.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            11. 2010 PackersOverall record: 14-6Super Bowl: Def. Steelers 31-25 Aaron Rodgers went on a heater in the playoffs, but many forget how good the Packers defense was that season. The unit was second in the NFL in scoring during the regular season and forced 11 turnovers during Green Bay's four-game playoff run. The Packers forced three key turnovers in the Super Bowl while defeating a Steelers team that had won two Super Bowls in recent years. Rodgers capped off a brilliant postseason with an MVP performance in the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            10. 2025 Seahawks Overall record: 17-3Super Bowl: Def. Patriots 29-13 Seattle's excellence on both sides of the ball, coupled with its dominant performance in the Super Bowl, earned it a spot among the century's top 10 teams. While they may not have the best quarterback, Sam Darnold proved he is capable of leading a team to the promised land. He was armed with a strong offensive line, a talented running back duo in Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet (who was injured during Seattle's playoff run), the league's Offensive Player of the Year in Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and a former Super Bowl MVP in Cooper Kupp. Seattle's \"Dark Side\" defense only reinforces its status as a top 10 team of the 21st century. They became the first unit since the Dolphins' legendary \"No Name\" defense to not allow a single point during the first three quarters of a Super Bowl. Walker bullied the Patriots' defense en route to becoming the first running back this century to win Super Bowl MVP.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            9. 2004 Patriots Overall record: 17-2Super Bowl: Def. Eagles 24-21 This team boasted a top-five offense and defense during the regular season. New England benefitted greatly from the offseason pickup of Corey Dillon, who ran for a franchise-record 1,635 yards during the regular season. The Patriots defense was a turnover machine; the unit recorded 11 turnovers in the playoffs that included four in the Super Bowl. After winning their final 15 games of the 2003 season, the '04 Patriots won their first six games to set an NFL record for the most consecutive wins. New England's 21-game winning streak ended in Pittsburgh in Week 7, though the Patriots would get their revenge by beating the Steelers (who had gone 15-1 in the regular season) in the AFC Championship game. Tom Brady, despite dealing with the flu, frigid temperatures and Pittsburgh's top-ranked defense, threw two touchdowns while completing nearly 67% of his passes in New England's 41-27 win. The 2004 Patriots had a new weapon in Corey Dillon, who ran for 1,635 yards during the regular sesaon.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            8. 2008 SteelersOverall record: 15-4 Super Bowl: Def. Cardinals 27-23 Ben Roethlisberger avenged his rocky Super Bowl debut three years earlier by throwing the game-winning touchdown pass against the Cardinals. Big Ben's exploits came after Pittsburgh's historically good defense gave up two touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Prior to that, the Steelers defense recorded one of the biggest plays in Super Bowl history on James Harrison's 100-yard pick six. The 2008 Steelers lacked an elite offense, but they had a future Hall of Fame quarterback and a defense that was first in the NFL in scoring, passing yards allowed, red zone and third-down efficiency. The unit was led by future Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu and Harrison, that year's Defensive Player of the Year. Along with having a future Hall of Fame QB, the 2008 Steelers had the Defensive Player of the Year in James Harrison and a future DPOY winner in Hall of Fame safety Troy Polamalu.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            7. 2009 Saints Overall record: 16-3Super Bowl: Def. Colts 31-17New Orleans' lone Super Bowl win was secured after it defeated three future Hall of Fame quarterbacks in the playoffs. The Saints possessed a future Hall of Fame quarterback of their own in Drew Brees, who completed over 82% of his throws in the Saints' Super Bowl win over the Colts. The Saints defense was just 20th in the NFL in points allowed during the season, but made up for that by forcing turnovers, including Tracy Porter's game-clinching pick six in the Super Bowl. Drew Brees out-dueled Peyton Manning on pro football's biggest stage.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            6. 2006 Colts Overall record: 15-4Super Bowl: Def. Bears 29-17The '06 Colts had one of the game's all-time great quarterbacks in Peyton Manning, an elite receiving duo in Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, and a defense that came alive in the playoffs, holding their first two postseason foes to eight and six points, respectively. The unit, led by Hall of Fame pass rusher Dwight Freeney and 2007 Defensive Player of the Year Bob Sanders, forced five turnovers in the Super Bowl that included a game-clinching pick six. This Colts' most memorable moment was their come-from-behind, 38-34 AFC title game win over the Patriots, who had defeated the Colts in the 2003 and '04 playoffs. Peyton Manning was the leader of one of the best offenses in NFL history.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            5. 2013 SeahawksOverall record: 16-3Super Bowl: Def. Broncos 43-8Similar to the Eagles' recent Super Bowl win, not many expected the Seahawks to blow the doors off the Broncos and their record-setting offense. But that's what happened, as Seattle's \"Legion of Boom\" defense actually outscored Peyton Manning and the rest of Denver's offense that night. Seattle's top-ranked defense was supported by the NFL's eighth-ranked scoring offense, led by Russell Wilson and running back Marshawn Lynch. Malcolm Smith and Seattle's defense outscored Denver's record-setting offense in one of the most unexpected Super Bowl outcomes ever.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            4. 2020 Buccaneers Overall record: 15-5Super Bowl: Def. Chiefs 31-9Tom Brady's first season in Tampa was looking like a bust after the team's 7-5 start. But after their Week 13 bye, Brady and Co. ripped off eight straight wins that included three postseason wins against future Hall of Fame quarterbacks. Brady was his typical dominant self in the Super Bowl, while his defense did not allow a touchdown while applying constant pressure on Patrick Mahomes. This was an exceptionally talented team that should garner consideration as an all-time great squad, especially in the salary cap/free agency era. Brady's seventh Super Bowl win was his first as a member of a wild card team. Brady further made history by becoming the first starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl at his home stadium.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            3. 2016 Patriots Overall record: 17-2Super Bowl: Def. Falcons 34-28 (OT)This team went 3-1 with Tom Brady serving a suspension to start the season. When Brady came back, the Patriots were nearly unstoppable, going 14-1 that included the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. The Patriots trailed 28-3 before staging a frantic rally that included massive plays on both sides of the ball. Making the Patriots' success more impressive is the fact that they didn't have Rob Gronkowski for the stretch run after he suffered a season-ending injury in Week 11. New England's unrivaled depth at the skill positions that season allowed them to overcome such a big loss. It's also one of the reasons why they took the bronze medal spot on this list. Brady's fifth title cemented his legacy as the greatest QB of all-time.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            2. 2019 Chiefs Overall record: 15-4 Super Bowl: Def. 49ers 31-20 Kansas City's first championship team of the century was its best one. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill were at the top of their respective games. The Chiefs defense was seventh in the NFL in points allowed, fifth in interceptions recorded and eighth in sacks. In the postseason, the Chiefs became the first team to win three straight playoff games after trailing by double digits, including their divisional round win over the Texans that saw them overcome a 24-0 deficit. The Chiefs' ability to overcome sizable deficits is one of the main reasons why they came in at No. 2. Mahomes' first Super Bowl win solidified his status as the NFL's next great quarterback.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            1. 2024 EaglesOverall record: 18-3Super Bowl: Def. Chiefs 40-22 It's hard to match the 2024 Eagles resume. Their 18 wins are tied for the most in NFL history and most by any Super Bowl champion this century. The Eagles capped off their historic season with a decisive win over a team that was on the precipice of history. No other Super Bowl-winning team this century had a top-10 quarterback in Jalen Hurts, two top-20 receivers in A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith, a 2,000-yard rusher in Saquon Barkley, a big, powerful offensive line and a second-ranked scoring defense that wreaked havoc on quarterbacks without having to blitz. That's why they're No. 1. Kansas City focused on containing Barkley and taking their chances with Hurts. This was the end result.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \n            ",

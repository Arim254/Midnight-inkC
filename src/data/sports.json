    "body": "\nThe final 'Monday Night Football' game of the 2025 NFL regular season will take place in Week 17 as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. Drake London (knee) is questionable for Atlanta, while Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for LA. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After opening at -8, the latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5, down a point from the opening line. L.A. is at -365 on the money line (risk $365 to win $100). Before making any Rams vs. Falcons     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense and is 5-1 over his last six 'MNF' starts, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua is in \"stable\" condition after suffering minor injuries in a car crash in Nigeria on Monday that killed two other passengers, according to multiple reports. Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu posted to social media that he spoke with Joshua and Joshua's mother to offer his condolences on the fatal crash that claimed the lives of two of Joshua's associates. \"I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami in the recent accident,\" Tunubu posted. \"I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care.\"The incident occurred around 11 a.m. local time near Sagamu, according to local officials. Circumstances of the accident are under investigation. \n\"The vehicle conveying Anthony Joshua, a Lexus SUV, was involved in the accident under circumstances that are currently being investigated,\" local police said in a statement. \"He was seated in the rear of the vehicle, sustained minor injuries and receiving medical attention.  Tragically, two other passengers in the vehicle lost their lives at the scene.\"Preliminary investigations indicated the SUV carrying Joshua was \"traveling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor, lost control during an overtaking maneuver and crashed into a stationary truck,\" according to the Federal Road Safety Corps. Gbenga Omotoso, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, posted a photo of the accident on social media that showed Joshua standing outside the crash site and said ambulances had been called. The police chief of the local precinct told the Associated Press that Joshua was taken to a local hospital to be \"treated for his injuries.\"\nJoshua had returned to Nigeria, the homeland of his parents, after breaking the jaw of Jake Paul in his knockout victory of the YouTuber-turned-boxer just over a week ago. Paul posted a statement on social media up on learning of Joshua's involvement in the crash stating, \"Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"Joshua was targeting a quick return to the ring following his victory over Paul, with promoter Eddie Hearn pointing to a possible bout with kickboxer Rico Verhoeven in late February or early March while they awaited a showdown with fellow former British heavyweight champion Tyson Fury later in 2026. That timeline for a return to the ring is now in question and will depend on the injuries he sustained and how long it will take for him to fully heal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the festivities are basically done, it's time to drown our sorrows in some fantasy basketball. This week, we have a jam-packed schedule, with 20 teams playing four times, and the remaining 10 teams suiting up on three occasions. With no two-game teams, picking and choosing your roster is going to be an arduous task.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DEN, GSW, IND, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, PHO, POR, SAC, SAS, WASThree Games: BOS, DAL, DET, HOU, LAC, LAL, MEM, PHI, TOR, UTATwo Games: N/AHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the eleventh week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Collin Sexton, CHAOpponents: MIL, GSW, @MIL, @CHISexton's success this season has typically come when other players are out. Based on that fact alone, this week might be a good opportunity to move him into your starting lineup. Kon Knueppel is currently sidelined with an ankle injury, something that could end up costing him multiple games. Although Sexton's overall fantasy value is largely reliant on points and 3s, he does have the ability to rack up decent assist numbers when afforded meaningful playing time. Given that he may have been dropped in a lot of leagues, quietly slotting him into your lineup for the next seven days, while somewhat risky, could end up being a smart play.Consider sitting: Jaylen Wells, MEMOpponents: PHI, @LAL, @LALDespite continuing to start, Wells' production over the past two weeks has been highly disappointing. In seven games during that time, he has averaged just 12.3 points, two steals, and 1.4 3-pointers. While there is no indication his role is going to change any time soon, the volume simply hasn't been there of late. As a player outside the top 150 in standard leagues, Wells is definitely a bench candidate this week, especially with so many other teams playing four games.Consider sitting: Ryan Nembhard, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnother player who seemingly has a starting role locked down, Nembhard has cooled off significantly after what was an impressive run of early games. In seven games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been well outside the top 250 in standard leagues, averaging 7.9 points and 6.1 assists in 25.3 minutes per contest. He remains a viable asset, but only for those in need of assists. However, with only three games in the next seven days, there is a decent chance you can supplement his production with someone suiting up four times.\nForwardsConsider starting: Peyton Watson, DENOpponents: @MIA, @TOR, @CLE, @BKNWhile Watson has been somewhat of an unexpected surprise this season, it does appear as though his window of value could be coming to an end in the near future. Denver is currently without three regular starters, meaning Watson's role is safe, for now. Both Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon could return at some point this week, albeit in a limited role. This means we might be able to squeeze one more week of value from Watson, a player who has averaged 12 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 3-pointers in four games over the past week. Consider starting: Jaylon Tyson, CLEOpponents: @SAS, PHO, DEN, DETDespite recently moving back to the bench, Tyson has been able to continue putting up solid production, averaging 19 points, nine rebounds, 1.7 3-pointers, and 1.3 combined steals and blocks over his past three games. Even though the Cavaliers are starting to get healthy, Tyson should remain a key piece in the rotation, even off the bench. Cleveland is looking to turn around what has been a slow start to the season, with Tyson likely to play a meaningful role. While there is a small amount of risk given the small sample size, managers should feel relatively comfortable rolling him out for a four-game week.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: @LAL, MIA, @CLEThompson's role continues to be a source of frustration for managers, with head coach JB Bickerstaff not afraid to mix things up on a nightly basis. Whether we agree with his decision-making or not, the fact is that Bickerstaff appears to have some trust issues when it comes to Thompson, limiting his overall upside. He is by no means a clear-cut bench candidate, especially for those simply looking for defensive contributions. However, in six appearances over the past two weeks, Thompson has averaged just 12.3 points, six rebounds, and 1.3 steals, including a woeful 51.9 percent from the line.\nCentersConsider starting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: @LAC, BOS, @PHO, MILWith Domantas Sabonis still weeks away from returning from a knee injury, Raynaud's value continues to go up by the day. While he clearly has some things to work on, his touch around the basket is undeniable. In five games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been a borderline top 60 player, averaging 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 0.8 blocks, shooting 52.9 percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the line. His minutes have been a little underwhelming, having logged no more than 27 minutes in each of the past two games. With that said, he has very little competition at the moment, making him a safe addition to any weekly lineup.Consider sitting: Daniel Gafford, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnthony Davis is sidelined yet again, this time with a groin injury, meaning Gafford should be able to serve as the primary center, at least for the short term. On paper, this appears to be a straightforward decision for managers, especially given Gafford's proven ability to put up numbers in limited minutes. However, Gafford has been dealing with injuries of his own, specifically an ankle injury that has already cost him multiple games. He does appear to be healthy right now, perhaps putting managers' minds at ease for the time being. If you simply need rebounds and blocks, Gafford is worth considering, especially if we get some clarity regarding Davis' absence.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The head-turning news of Baylor adding 21-year-old big man James Nnaji, a 2023 NBA Draft pick, has reverberated around college athletics. It's not just that Baylor is bringing on someone who was drafted 30 months ago, it's also that he's eligible immediately and could make his collegiate debut this Saturday when Baylor faces TCU in its Big 12 opener. While a number of programs have plumbed into the G League and international pipelines to add players in recent weeks/months, Baylor paved a new pathway when it went to the NCAA and asked it to clear the 7-footer with more than four years of EuroLeague experience. Never until now had someone who was selected in the NBA Draft been approved to play college basketball.As far as I can tell, no one had ever even tried. With good reason. The notion of rostering a professional athlete runs counter to the very essence of what the NCAA purported to stand for since its inception almost 120 years ago. But those pillars have crumbled to rubble at this point, and as we turn to 2026, the NCAA has but only a few rules left that might withstand any viable legal challenges. Still, even if Nnaji's case is allowable, that doesn't mean it's accepted or even feels proper. I reached out to nearly 10 coaches on Monday to get a grasp on how they felt about it. Most had no problem with Baylor coach Scott Drew doing what he felt he needed to do because none of it is impermissible and because other schools (BYU, Oklahoma, Washington, Dayton, Santa Clara, Louisville), have done the same as of late. \n\n        \n            \n                How Baylor landed ex-NBA pick James Nnaji and what coaches are saying about the controversial acquisition\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMost of the coaches I reached out to Monday morning got back to me relatively quickly, but the most notable of them all didn't respond until Monday night. That person just so happens to be the man who's arguably the face of college basketball.I texted Dan Hurley and asked for his thoughts on the situation at Baylor and the state of college hoops as it sees its rostering rules updated practically by the week. The UConn coach left me a nearly three-minute long voice memo, and instead of chopping up all the quotes and dispersing them throughout the story, I want to present what he said in full. Hurley was introspective, direct, largely unedited and entirely earnest about what he believes college basketball needs right now.\nBased on conversations I've had in recent days and weeks, these thoughts also reflect the feelings and intentions of a lot of his fellow coaches.Here's Hurley to CBS Sports:\"I would just say with the players, obviously with all the G League (guys), I just had no idea that that was even an option. I thought it was actually a joke when I saw it. I just assumed that when you stay in the draft or you get drafted that you would forgo your college eligibility. I was not aware of the loopholes in it. My biggest thing I would say is, listen, player empowerment's great. Players have to do what they can to make sure that they're doing what's in their best interest. They're taking advantage of those opportunities now with NIL and the portal. The coaches are obviously always gonna do what's in their best interest if they can grab a player from somewhere. It's gone on forever. Coaches have cheated in recruiting for years. They've paid players. I mean, the coaches are gonna find ways to make their team the best they can be.But I would say my biggest thing is: who's looking out for the shield, the college basketball (shield)? Who's protecting college basketball, one of the most special things we have in sports. College basketball, March Madness, the second biggest annual sporting event every year. We need a commissioner. We need rules, we need guidelines.The frustrating part is we all are willing to adapt and play this new game in this new era of, I guess college sports, or whether it's G League -- I don't know what we're in exactly right now -- but it's a frustrating game to play when you don't know the rules and rules are being made up as you go and there's no communication and there's no leadership. So, I think college basketball needs a commissioner. A (Roger) Goodell. A David Stern. Somebody that's gonna make decisions and start making moves that are in the best interest of college basketball, not just having coaches and players do what's in the best interest of them.\"Hurley understandably lands on the receiving end of a lot of criticism and commentary for his sideline behavior at times, or for what he'll sometimes say on a microphone. But in my experience, I find his passion and devotion to college basketball as earnest and large as any coach in the game.If you're a college basketball fan reading this, someone who just loves the game to its core, know that Dan Hurley is wired just like you. He not only loves it because he's a coach, he loves it because he grew up on it. He is a college basketball junkie.This is a guy who could have left UConn after back-to-back titles, when he was on a throne at the mountaintop of the sport, to take the Lakers job.He could have left NIL and the portal and the mangled mess of policies and non-policies that have plagued college basketball and the NCAA more and more and more in recent years. It would have been very easy to do and no one could have critiqued him for doing it. But he came back.\nHe stayed at UConn. He chose college basketball.Hurley stayed for a lot of reasons, of course. High on that list of reasons is his belief that college basketball is a great American sport. There is a spirit to the game that is unmatched. Hurley believes media companies — and even many of the coaches themselves — have failed at properly marketing the game in the past five, 10, 15 years. He wants more for it. He wants it to be better. Believes it can and should be. The sport is already amazing, but it could be so much bigger if it was handled and promoted the way college football and the NFL are.Hurley's pitch for a commissioner isn't new, and it might not be practical in practice, but when a coach of his stature speaks out, everyone who claims to care about the health of the game should listen. Read his statement again and understand that he's just asking for real guidance and real leadership. College basketball and college football need collective bargaining as soon as possible. Reality is, that's not happening for a very long time. Even still, we shouldn't let the hope of that longterm goal stunt progress. There are pragmatic ways to redefine the rulebook of college basketball in this precarious next era for the sport. When a former NBA pick can make the choice to play college basketball, that's not the fault of the player or the coach. That's the fault of the system and all the people at the NCAA who've failed it along the way — for decades. And while Nnaji's commitment to Baylor doesn't threaten college basketball's existence, it is the latest event to give the foundation of the sport its largest crack yet.\nA lot of these changes, a lot of those cracks, have pushed some of the biggest legends out of the game on an accelerated timeline in the past five years. Now another one is sounding the alarms, and if real change doesn't happen in 2026 and 2027, Hurley and others like him in college basketball (and college football) could find their way out of the NCAA business faster than anyone who loves college sports wants to admit.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Matthew Stafford and Bijan Robinson both made history during Monday night's game between the Rams and Falcons.Stafford passed former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for sixth on the NFL's career passing list. Robinson broke 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey's NFL record for the most yards from scrimmage before turning 24 years old. Robinson, who entered Monday night's game needing 68 yards to surpass McCaffrey, set the record on a 93-yard touchdown run that gave the Falcons a 21-0 halftime lead. \nThe milestone cemented Robinson as one of the elite young offensive players in league history, while Stafford's climb up the passing list underscored his longevity and late-career resurgence. Stafford entered the game with 63,988 career passing yards, while Roethlisberger finished his 18-year career with 64,088 yards and two Super Bowl titles.\nNFL career passing leaders PlayerYards1.Tom Brady89,2142.Drew Brees80,3583.Peyton Manning**71,9404.Brett Favre**71,8385.Aaron Rodgers65,9806.Matthew Stafford64,089+7.Ben Roethlisberger64,0888.Philip Rivers63,9849.Matt Ryan 62,79210.Dan Marino**61,361** -- Pro Football Hall of Famers Roethlisberger, who retired after the 2021 season, will be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the first time in 2027. Stafford's success this season has undoubtedly increased his odds of being inducted at some point down the road.\nAt 37, Stafford is enjoying arguably his finest season to date. He entered Monday night's game with a league-high 40 touchdown passes against just five interceptions. His 4,179 yards through 15 games is his highest single-season total since 2021, when he led the Rams to the franchise's first Super Bowl title as a Los Angeles-based team.Stafford's success has made him one of the leading candidates for league MVP along with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\"I know we feel really fortunate to have him in command and running the show,\" Rams coach Sean McVay recently said of Stafford. \"And his competitiveness, his enjoyment for those moments, his ability to be at his best when his best is required, his ability to elevate his teammates and his overall ownership of what we're trying to get done with the intent, whether that be run or pass game or protection-oriented.\"He's a total 'G,' and he's been 'G.' I think it's just getting more recognized now, but this isn't new to us.\"LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Rams battle the Falcons on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nRobinson, who was just named to his second straight Pro Bowl, has emerged as one of the NFL's best and most versatile running backs. He eclipsed 2,000 all-purpose yards in just 15 games while averaging 135.1 total yards per game.While his favorite running back was LaDainian Tomlinson (a TCU alum), Robinson takes great pride in continuing the tradition of accomplished NFL running backs that came out of Texas -- a list of backs that includes Hall of Famer Earl Campbell, fellow former Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams and former Chiefs All-Pro Jamaal Charles. Robinson said those players have helped inspire him in more ways than one.\"It's a blessing, man,\" he told CBS Sports earlier this year. \"Those guys have set up the success of the running back at Texas. So for me to follow it and continue to push it in the NFL, it's been really cool. Getting to talk to them and being around them and letting them be my big brothers and give me advice while I'm on the field.\"I want the guys behind me to do the same thing. I just continue to try to preach goodness into them. And it's pretty special that my whole running back room is in the NFL. It's a blessing to see all those guys continue to keep playing in this league.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Even though the Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) were eliminated from postseason contention when they took the field on Christmas Day, it was somewhat understandable as to why they would play 32-year-old, four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Dak Prescott.Dallas was running the first leg of three standalone NFL games on a holiday in which most of the country was sitting at home. The Cowboys were also playing on a short week on Thursday, which wouldn't provide many opportunities to get backup Joe Milton ready to roll after playing just 24 offensive snaps this season.However, first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer plans to start Prescott, who suffered a season-ending hamstring injury midway through 2024, in Week 18 against the 3-13 New York Giants. Why? He would like for the Cowboys to finish 8-8-1 and avoid having a losing record. \"Yeah, plan on finishing strong and having Dak play, again get a chance to go 5-1 hopefully in the division, finish 8-8-1 and that's the plan as we're looking at now,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \nIt's worth Schottenheimer reconsidering since Dallas surrendered a season-high six sacks in a 30-23 win against the Washington Commanders in Week 17 while playing Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith out of position at left tackle with Tyler Guyton (ankle) on injured reserve. Undrafted guard T.J. Bass has slid into the starting lineup at left guard with Smith at left tackle. Smith's four quarterback pressures allowed were tied for his third-most in a game in his four-year career, per TruMedia, while Bass' one pressure was tied for the fourth-most in a game in his three-year career. \"I didn't think we did a good enough job protecting Dak last game. It wasn't just those two guys. I thought we ran the ball really, really well. I thought the communication between those guys was really, really good. But I do think that our fundamentals got a little sloppy in a couple of areas,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'll talk about Tyler for a second. Just to nonchalantly move out to left tackle in this league to me is just crazy. But he does it, and he does it with a smile. He just goes out there and competes. T.J. Bass, he's played so much meaningful football for us, really over the last couple of years. I think he's a very, very talented young player, his star is on the rise. I really like what T.J. does for us.\"Even if Prescott starts, Schottenheimer didn't rule out also rotating in his strong-armed, second-year backup in Milton, someone whose arm talent the coach is \"mesmerized\" by. \n\"We'll look at that. The biggest thing for me is to put the game plan together and hopefully have another great week of practice and focus on getting our prep,\" Schottenheimer said. \"You know how much respect I have for this team, this defense we're getting ready to play, an elite front seven. But yeah, we'll see how the week goes. But right now the plan is to play Dak.\"In his first season, Schottenheimer is aiming to establish a culture where every game is viewed by his players as a \"championship opportunity\" even if that isn't the case like it has been for Dallas since Week 16. In the world the Cowboys live in, Week 18 means something. That's why the current plan is to start Prescott, injury risk be damned. \"I think they all mean something that's what I would say, I think they all do mean something. I think we're all being evaluated on the whole season here,\" Schottenheimer said. \"We're proud of the fact we've played well against the NFC East opponents and get a chance to play another one this weekend but yeah, I feel good about it. ... I am a guy that is all about process. I'm going to be the same guy every day and every week. This week is no different. These guys put a lot of time and energy preparing for 17 games. That's how much we signed up for. We are going to compete to win all 17 and hopefully we can get No. 8 this weekend.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Clemson has parted ways with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Garrett Riley, according to on3sports. Riley, the younger brother of USC coach Lincoln Riley, spent the past three years at Clemson. During Riley's time at Clemson, the school ranked 52nd, 18th and 71st in the nation in scoring, respectively. This season, the Tigers endured a disappointing 7-6 season that culminated with a 22-10 loss to Penn State in the Pinstripe Bowl. This past season, the Tigers averaged 27.2 points per game a year after averaging 34.7 points per contest. They were held under their season average eight times that included four straight games to start the season. During their loss to Penn State, the Tigers gained just 236 total yards, recorded just 16 first downs and were held to 43 yards on 25 carries. The 2025 season marked just the second time that the Tigers failed to win at least nine games since 2009, which was Dabo Sweeney's first full season as Clemson's coach. This year marked the program's worst season since 2010. \n\"We've got great people,\" Swinney said following Clemson's loss to Penn State. \"I love all the people on my staff, but you evaluate everything, that's just a part of our business, and it's a part of the end of the season, as you step back, and I don't make emotional decisions.\"Riley, 36, played quarterback under legendary coach Mike Leach at Texas Tech before beginning his coaching career in 2011 at Texas' Roosevelt High School. He then spent one season coaching at the Division III ranks before getting a graduate assistant position at East Carolina. \nJust prior to coming to Clemson, Riley enjoyed a successful, albeit brief tenure at TCU as the school's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. While at TCU, he won the Broyles Award, which recognizes the best assistant coach in college football. \n            ",

The playoff picture got much more clear after Sunday's games, but there's still some positioning and division titles on the line.Atlanta has won two in a row with Kirk Cousins under center, improving to 6-9 in the process. The Falcons are playing out the string of their season for draft positioning, but they have a chance to throw a wrench into the Rams' plans by coming away with another win here.Los Angeles is coming off a wild, come-from-ahead loss to the division rival Seahawks last week, having undermined its own chances to land the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams piled up 581 yards of offense and didn't turn the ball over, but their defense let up down the stretch despite having forced three turnovers early on.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the Rams bounce back from their loss a week ago, or will the Falcons make it three straight victories? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Falcons vs. RamsDate: Monday, Dec. 29 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -7.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Rams battle the Falcons on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key StorylinesL.A.'s playoff hopes. The Rams can no longer win the NFC West thanks to the Seahawks' and 49ers' wins on Sunday. The winner of the Seattle-San Francisco game next week is now going to be the top seed in the conference. That means L.A. is playing to maintain its position and climb as high as the No. 5 seed in the NFC and retain the right to go on the road and play against the NFC South champion, rather than having to go play against the Chicago Bears or Philadelphia Eagles in the first round. If the Rams win this week and next, they'll be the 5-seed regardless of what happens elsewhere.Matthew Stafford's MVP chase. Despite Drake Maye's five-touchdown game against the Jets on Sunday, Stafford remains the heavy favorite to win the Most Valuable Player trophy. According to DraftKings, Stafford is a -225 favorite, giving him an implied 69.2% probability to win. But that can obviously change very quickly if he doesn't put up a representative performance against the Falcons on Monday night. Stafford still leads the league in touchdown passes with 40 and has thrown only five interceptions while passing for over 4,100 yards, but it'll be interesting to see how the voters feel about handing the award to a player whose team might get a wild card slot rather than winning its own division -- especially if he doesn't finish the season with a bang. He has an opportunity to do the latter here, though.Kirk Cousins trying to extend his career. Cousins' first few appearances of this season did not inspire much confidence that he could land another job if and when the Falcons decide to cut ties with him due to his monster cap hit for next season. But he's done better over the past couple of weeks (512 of 79 for 570 yards, five touchdowns and an interception) and if he keeps it going against the Rams and Saints this week and next, maybe he could play himself into being a bridge quarterback option for somebody next offseason.Prediction\nAtlanta has won back-to-back games after dropping seven of eight ... but those games came against the Buccaneers and Cardinals. The Rams, to put it plainly, are not the Bucs and Cardinals. Even without Davante Adams, I expect them to be able to move the ball with relative ease against a Falcons defense that has regressed badly since the beginning of the season. The Rams rank 10th in the NFL in yards allowed per carry and should be able to contain Bijan Robinson from going completely ballistic, and if they can get pressure on Kirk Cousins, I just don't see a way that Atlanta can keep up. \nPrediction: Rams 26, Falcons 17\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "description": "\n        Andy Reid has no plans of retiring, even after the Kansas City Chiefs' first season missing the playoffs since 2014. Speaking Monday, Reid no",
    "body": "\n        Andy Reid has no plans of retiring, even after the Kansas City Chiefs' first season missing the playoffs since 2014. Speaking Monday, Reid not only confirmed he plans to return but expressed his optimism for the upcoming NFL Draft.When asked if there was \"any scenario\" in which he wouldn't be the Chiefs' coach, Reid said no.\"I think I'm coming back, right?\" Reid said with a wry smile. \"If they'll have me back (chuckles), I'll come back. You never know in this business, so that's a tough one, but I plan on it, yeah.\"Reid, who will turn 68 in March, is wrapping up his 27th consecutive season as a head coach -- the first 14 of which were with the Philadelphia Eagles, the last 13 with the Chiefs. At 6-10, the Chiefs have clinched not only their worst record under Reid, but their first losing season under him, too.\nIt's been a trying season for Kansas City, one that has included Patrick Mahomes tearing his ACL in Week 15, the same week the team got eliminated from playoff contention. The Chiefs are an NFL-worst 1-8 in one-possession games, and they've suffered several injuries around Mahomes as well.Given his age, Reid has answered retirement questions for the past several seasons. After winning the Super Bowl two seasons ago, Reid said he hadn't thought about retiring, and he said he'd be back for 2025 even before last year's Super Bowl loss. Reid is under contract through 2029 after signing an extension in 2024.This season hasn't gone to plan, though, and there are major questions this offseason, too, questions that may be answered -- at least in part -- by the draft. The Chiefs are currently projected to pick ninth.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order: Raiders land No. 1 pick after loss to Giants; Browns fall out of top 5 after upset win\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"With [General Manager] Brett [Veach] and his crew doing it, that part's exciting to see and what takes place,\" Reid said. \"Something to look forward to. You're right, it's not where you want to be, but it is where we are, and we've got good people doing the picking headed by Brett.\"Here are the main issues Reid will face going into 2026:Patrick Mahomes' healthThough every player and every injury is different, Mahomes, 30, should be ready to go for the 2026 season opener, according to CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo.\"The average ACL rehab is approximately 6-8 months,\" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ in the immediate aftermath of the injury. \"He will miss OTAs, which come around March. But he'd be actually almost jogging by OTAs. So I have zero concerns short-term. He will have surgery within the next 48 hours. That's the best window to do that. And he will have no long-term concerns.\"\nEven amid a down year for his team, Mahomes had a strong 2025, ranking eighth in expected points added per play, even though he also had a top-10 drop rate and an up-and-down offensive line working against him. He did have a career-low 4.4% touchdown rate, but he made up for that with a career-high five touchdown runs.\n        \n            \n                Chiefs face uncertain future after Patrick Mahomes' ACL tear: What's next for Kansas City's offense\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill Travis Kelce retire?Kelce admitted the Chiefs' Week 17 game against the Denver Broncos was an emotional one, though he owed that fact to the game being on Christmas. But if Kelce retires, it also might have been his final home game.\"Honestly, I've just been focused on trying to win football games, man,\" Kelce said about the possibility of retirement. \"I'll make that decision with my family, friends and the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\nWhether or not Kelce returns or retires, his contract is up; he signed a two-year, $34.25 million contract in 2024. Kelce had said that part of his fire to return in 2025 was to avenge last season's Super Bowl loss, but that possibility is no longer in the cards.Kelce is not the game-changing weapon he once was, but he has remained an integral part of the Chiefs' offense. His 73 catches and 839 receiving yards are most on the team, and his five touchdown catches are tied for most. He broke the Chiefs' career touchdown record earlier this season.Chiefs salary cap situation, free agents, needsKansas City's long list of needs became apparent throughout the year. One problem, though, is their salary cap situation, as former NFL agent Joel Corry outlined. Kansas City will need to restructure Mahomes' contract and will likely do the same with Chris Jones'.\nSeveral key players, including Kelce, running backs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco, linebacker Leo Chenal, cornerback Jaylen Watson and safety Brian Cook, are slated to be free agents, too.Kansas City would love to upgrade its running back situation; it continued to be one of the least explosive rushing attacks in the NFL, even though underlying metrics suggest the offensive line blocked well. The team will also likely look for more pass-rushing help, pass-catching reinforcements -- especially if Kelce departs -- offensive line depth and defensive backs, depending on who is retained.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        On Christmas Eve, Baylor's basketball program announced a figuratively (and, uh, literally) big holiday surprise: 7-foot center James Nnaji, ",
    "body": "\n        On Christmas Eve, Baylor's basketball program announced a figuratively (and, uh, literally) big holiday surprise: 7-foot center James Nnaji, the No. 31 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who has played the last four seasons in the EuroLeague, has signed with the school and is eligible to play for the Bears immediately.The midseason addition of a player with immediate eligibility is unusual, though not unique, to college basketball. However, the midseason clearance of a men's player who was previously drafted by an NBA team has no precedent. And it raises plenty of questions, such as: How did this happen? Will situations like this happen with increasing frequency in the future? And through which loophole did the Bears sneak this deal?All valid questions -- and ones that coaches and college personnel themselves are asking. CBS Sports polled college coaches anonymously on the topic to gauge reaction across the sport. Their answers -- and the answers to these questions -- are below.College coaches and general managers reactReactions ranging from pragmatism to envy and anxiety echoed across the landscape over the weekend. One Big East coach told CBS Sports he has \"no problem\" with what Baylor did because it is doing what it can to improve its roster. Another coach in the Big Ten said what Baylor did was simply within the rules.\n\"They were creative enough to find a situation that fit into a narrow interpretation like all of us try to,\" said the Big Ten coach.Added a high major head coach, \"I don't fault Baylor for doing it. If the NCAA clears a kid, then it clears a kid. For us, if you ask me, do I think that a player should be able to be added after being drafted? No. It's not the process we're all into. A kid puts his name into the draft and gets drafted, his college life should be over.\"Still, others seem less enthused about the deal -- namely, about what the precedent portends for the future in the sport.\nSaid one Big 12 coach: \"[It's] up to Baylor to decide if exploiting a rule is within the culture of their program. Just because something is currently permissible doesn't make it best for the game.\"That coach seemed to echo what Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said over the weekend about the situation.\"I mean, if that's what we're going to do, shame on the NCAA,\" Izzo said. \"Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess.\"\nIzzo said he has a call in to Bears coach Scott Drew and wants to talk with him about the situation.A major conference general manager acknowledged to CBS Sports that Baylor made a move to try and better its roster, which is the ultimate goal. Baylor just went to a place others hadn't yet gone. The interpretation of whether it was morally right or wrong, they seem to argue, is less relevant than whether moves such as this will be net-positives.\"Motherf****** will go anywhere to find someone that can help them win a basketball game right now,\" said the GM. \"I don't think it's something we will do because these guys are pros. How will they handle how a college coach coaches? That's been my thought process.\n\"Pros don't worry about winning like you expect to win in college,\" the GM added. \"You've got to really dig into the character traits and then pressure down these traits into these grown men coming back who haven't played college basketball. It's a different game than the NBA and a different game than the G League. This s*** is about winning; the NBA is about getting paid.\"Overall, there seems to be a mix of both interest in how the situation at Baylor plays out and a desire among some in the college ranks from the NCAA to, at the very least, clarify the rulebook -- if not close the loophole entirely. \"A drafted player should forfeit eligibility,\" the Big Ten coach told CBS Sports. \"And this also calls into question the draft withdrawal date and if it means anything.\"\nThe Big 12 coach agreed: \"The [loophole] should be closed so that pros cannot return to college.\"The college GM downplayed the significance of the signing and pointed to the tiny player pool from which these transactions may come as reason to believe this won't likely become a pipeline for college programs to pluck from down the road. \"I don't [think it will have a big impact on roster construction,\" the GM told CBS Sports. \"I don't think the player pool is going to be large enough. [And] I think the NCAA or the NBA is going to clip this real quick. Whoever is going to do it, better do it now, because this won't be around too much longer. \n\"I'm interested to see how it plays out with how good he really is, how much he impacts and how much they win,\" the GM added. \"Because they're going to be under scrutiny all year for it.\"Nnaji's instant eligibility at Baylor at the midway point of the college basketball season opens another strange and unexpected can of worms in the ever-evolving world of college athletics. \"It's like when NIL started, if you had money, I wasn't mad at you. Certain teams had money right out of the gate and were ahead of the game in NIL. But everyone has a chance to do it,\" a high-major head coach told CBS Sports. \"If the NCAA said it's a rule, you don't have to like it; you can just lean into it. I don't like the rule that if you get drafted, there's a loophole, but I don't fault Baylor for doing it.\"\nHow did this get cleared?When Baylor learned transfer big man Juslin Bodo Bodo was likely to be out for the year because of a summer injury, Baylor general manager Jason Smith reached out to several contacts to see if any good midyear additions might make sense for the team as a replacement option, a source told CBS Sports. Nnaji, whose representatives signaled he was interested in coming stateside, came up as the best option. So Smith worked in tandem with Nnaji's reps and the NCAA through the process to ensure he could be cleared at the midseason mark. (Nnaji's situation changed in recent months after mutually parting with Barcelona this summer, opening up the possibility of landing elsewhere.) The NCAA cleared Nnaji to play college basketball because he is an international player still within his five-year window of what would be his high school graduation, given that he is still only 21 years old. That clearance comes despite being drafted to the NBA by the Detroit Pistons in 2023. His rights were traded to the Hornets on draft night and later to the New York Knicks in 2024 as part of the deal to acquire Karl-Anthony Towns.\nHow much college eligibility does Nnaji have remaining?The NCAA's official rule on eligibility and its five-year clock allows for players to complete four years of athletic competition from their first full-time college enrollment. That means Nnaji's clearance affords him four years of eligibility. Under NCAA rules, Nnaji's qualification for eligibility is under the category of being an incoming freshman and having no previous full-time college attendance. Those qualifications come regardless of the time of year of initial enrollment. Interestingly, several other former professional players joining the college ranks -- Thierry Darlan (Santa Clara) and London Johnson (Louisville) were given two years of eligibility by the NCAA. Darlan's clock began this year, and Johnson's will begin next year. How House vs. NCAA helped Baylor (and others)Schools that opted into the House injunction, electing to share revenue with athletes, are also required to have an available roster spot in order to sign a player midseason. That legislation also expanded the number of scholarships available per men's basketball team from 13 to 15. So even with no attrition at Baylor, it has additional space carved out to make just a move like the one it is making by adding Nnaji.\nNnaji's backgroundIn 2020, Nnaji moved from Hungary, where he'd lived for several years, to Barcelona to join FC Barcelona's basketball team. That led to an escalating interest in his skill set internationally as he developed and made the A Team in 2021. He also had stints playing on loan with Girona in the Spanish Liga ACB and with Merkezefdeni, a Basketball Super League team in Turkey.Nnaji was considered a potential first-round prospect in the 2023 NBA Draft but slipped to the No. 31 overall pick on draft night -- the first selection of the second round -- after the Hornets made a draft-night trade up the board to acquire him. Despite being selected high, Nnaji never played in the NBA or G League, only in the NBA Summer League before retreating back overseas.A precedent set, and similar casesNnaji's signing on Christmas Eve ruffled feathers and, in one case, even drummed up commotion on the player front after On3 reported -- and subsequently retracted its report -- that former undrafted guard and current Chicago Bull, Trentyn Flowers, was drawing interest from 12 college teams. CBS Sports' Matt Norlander contacted numerous schools reported to be interested in courting Flowers, and six refuted the report.\nFlowers' situation is similar to Nnaji's in that he did not play college basketball -- he initially committed to Louisville before opting for a pro career -- but dissimilar in that Flowers has played in eight NBA games the last two seasons. Despite that background, Flowers is still believed to be drawing interest from college teams, though the list does not include a dozen at the moment. Other similar situations have played out in recent years involving former professional athletes, including the aforementioned Johnson, who has played professionally since 2022 and committed to Louisville earlier this year, and Darlan, a former G League guard now playing with Santa Clara. Johnson will have two years of eligibility beginning in 2026-27 after playing three years in the G League, and Darlan has two years of eligibility.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 USC faces off against TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Tuesday night. The Trojans can capture their first 10-win season since 2022 and second since 2017. USC elevated itself into the playoff conversation during an encouraging fourth season under Lincoln Riley. TCU also returned to Big 12 contention for most of the season, but slipped in November to finish a disappointing 8-4 campaign. The Horned Frogs were crushed 44-13 by BYU to end their chances, but can clinch consecutive nine-win seasons with an Alamo Bowl victory. USC and TCU have only played five times in history, and not since the 1998 Sun Bowl. The Frogs hold a 3-2 advantage, including a 28-19 win in that game in El Paso. However, USC coach Lincoln Riley has plenty of experience against the Frogs, posting a perfect 6-0 record against the Frogs while head coach at Oklahoma.   USC vs. TCU: Need to know for Alamo BowlMaiava's breakout: USC quarterback Jayden Maiava was electric during his first year as the starting quarterback. The junior led the nation in QBR and posted 3,431 yards passing, 150 yards rushing and 29 total touchdowns. Maiava announced that he will return for his senior season, and has an opportunity to end his junior campaign right with a promising young receiver corps. Key opt-outs: After the season, TCU quarterback Josh Hoover opted to enter the transfer portal. Senior backup Ken Seals will make his first start for the Frogs. All-American receiver Eric McAllister will play. Several key players opted out for USC to prepare for the NFL, including Biletnikoff winner Makai Lemon, tight end Lake McRee and safety Kamari Ramsey. \nStar receiver: With USC's Makai Lemon opted out, all eyes will be on TCU receiver Eric McAllister. The All-American transferred from Boise State and emerged as one of the best in the nation. McAllister caught 64 passes for 1,121 yards and 10 touchdowns. He decided to participate in his final college football game instead of opting out to prepare for the draft, which will give Ken Seals a key target.   Where to watch USC vs. TCU live  Date: Tuesday, Dec. 30 | Time: 9 p.m. ET  Location: Alamodome -- San Antonio, Texas  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  USC vs. TCU prediction, picks  \nIn many cases, motivation level and opt-outs play a significant role in the results of key bowl games. The Horned Frogs believe in backup quarterback Ken Seals, who will certainly hope for greatness in his first start at TCU. However, Jayden Maiava and a still-stacked USC receiving corps will be too much as the Trojans pick up a win to enter a pivotal offseason. Pick: USC -6.5\n\n                    \n    \n

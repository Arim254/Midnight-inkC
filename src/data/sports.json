    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1300 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300).Other Pebble Beach contenders include Viktor Hovland (+2500), Tommy Fleetwood (+2500) and Justin Rose (+2500). The players who went a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- are both close behind at +3000. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Si Woo Kim (+2700) this week. Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting four longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders, including one huge +5000 sleeper. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The consensus from the Olympic skiing community is clear: Don't blame Lindsey Vonn for pushing the limits in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games and competing in the women's downhill on a torn ACL. And don't think that her devastating crash in Sunday's final was a result of that preexisting injury.Vonn, 41, saw her Olympic comeback end in brutal fashion when she broke her left leg in a vicious crash mere seconds into her run. She was airlifted to a hospital and underwent surgery to stabilize the fracture. Leaders of international skiing bodies and some of Vonn's fellow competitors set the record straight that Sunday's crash was entirely unrelated to her torn ACL.\"Totally incorrect,\" Vonn's teammate Keely Cashman said, via the Associated Press. \"People that don't know ski racing don't really understand what happened yesterday. She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70 miles an hour, and so that twists your body around. That has nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to with her knee. I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot people don't [know] what's going on.\"International Ski and Snowboard Federation president Johan Eliasch called Vonn \"incredibly unlucky\" and said the incident was a \"one in 1,000\" situation.\nThe downhill is alpine skiing's fastest and most dangerous event. A myriad of things could go wrong on any given run, often with dramatic consequences. A fully intact ACL would have done nothing to prevent Vonn from tumbling down the mountain after clipping the gate on that fateful jump.Vonn's dramatic exit from the downhill final precipitated a wave of hindsight-aided reactions from fans and pundits. The American skiing legend should have played it safe and backed out of the competition the moment she tore her ACL, some argued. But those most experienced in the sport emphasized that Vonn was able to train at a high caliber despite the injury, and they noted that she consulted with qualified trainers and coaches before making the decision to race.\"This decision was really hers and her team to take,\" International Olympic Committee sports director Pierre Ducrey said. \"She made the decision and unfortunately it led to the injury, but I think it's really the way that the decision gets made for every athlete that participates to the downhill.\"\nThat Vonn elected to compete in such a dangerous and demanding event at less than full strength may have led some to question her sanity, others commended the three-time Olympic medalist for her courage and commitment to the sport. The latter argument only solidifies her legacy as an all-time great.\n            ",

No. 1 Arizona puts its unbeaten record on the line at No. 11 Kansas, with the Wildcats listed as 2.5-point road favorites. However, one of SportsLine's experts thinks the Wildcats suffer their first loss of the season in that game. Another expert has an NBA player prop pick for Bulls vs. Nets, while SportsLine's proven computer model has a strong pick for Lakers vs. Thunder in his Monday NBA best bets. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code CBSSPORTS here:Check out our bet365 bonus code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

Bet it at bet365 here:Guerschon Yabusele Over 8.5 total points (-119)\"After not playing much for the Knicks, Guerschon Yabusele has logged at least 26 minutes in both games since being traded to the Bulls. He scored 15 points over 33 minutes against the Raptors, then posted 12 points across 26 minutes versus the Nuggets on Saturday,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"Jalen Smith (calf) is questionable for Monday, and even if he plays, he should be on a minutes restriction again. Yabusele could approach 30 minutes against a Nets team that has the fifth-worst defensive rating in the league, so I like this over.\" Back Yabusele at bet365 here:\nKansas (+136) vs. Arizona\"Arizona is one of two unbeatens left but, yep, I think goes down,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Only the fifth time in the past 30 years that Kansas is a home dog. I don't want to give away all my fun stats here but let's just say Bill Self NEVER loses on Big Monday.\" Back Kansas at bet365 here:Lakers (+7) vs. ThunderThe Thunder have lost back-to-back games without star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdomen), and he is going to be sidelined again on Monday night. Los Angeles is without a star of its own in Luka Doncic (hamstring), but Austin Reaves scored 16 points in his third game back from a calf injury on Saturday. The Lakers picked up a 105-99 win over the Warriors in that game, as Rui Hachimura was inserted back into the starting lineup and scored 18 points. SportsLine's model thinks the Lakers can win this game outright, and they are covering this spread in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Monday.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NASCAR season officially got underway on Feb. 4, with Ryan Preece taking home the checkered flag in the Cook Out Clash. On Sunday, Feb. 15, is arguably the biggest race of the year in the Daytona 500, where William Byron will try and win for the third year in a row. With so many races set for the rest of 2026, expert auto racing handicappers Phil Bobbitt and Steve Greco have put together a 2026 NASCAR betting preview for the entire season, breaking down their best bets and predictions for the remainder of the year. Here is Phill Bobbitt and Steve Greco's NASCAR betting preview:Every NASCAR season starts the same way: hope, optimism, and a wildly irresponsible level of confidence in our own ability to predict chaos.This one starts a little differently.I spent the offseason doing what any serious motorsports analyst would do, finishing The Walking Dead. Then Dead City. The Ones Who Live. Fear the Walking Dead. Somewhere between walkers, spinoff and existential dread, we mounted an 80-inch television on the wall just in time for racing season.Needless to say, SpeedwayBrandi was not thrilled. She is, however, slowly coming around to the idea.Listen, it was Black Friday. It had to be done. It just felt right. I also had to buy her a new couch as an apology to smooth things over, which is how you know this was both an impulse purchase and a long-term investment. Relationships are about compromise. NASCAR is about screen size.So now you know where every penny of last season's writer salary went, which means it's time to get back to work. I'm not saying she has me handcuffed to a typewriter in the basement, but if you're reading this, send help.All jokes aside, the 2026 season has us very excited. And here's why: Because math finally has a seat at the table again. We'll get into that more below.And as Don Draper once said, \"Fear stimulates my imagination.\" Good. Because this season should scare bookmakers.This is our favorite column of the year. Historically, it's also our most profitable. It's the one that we circle before the engines ever fire. Our edges are clearer now than they've been in a long time.So yeah, let's do this thing.Bet on NASCAR at DraftKings and get $300 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:NASCAR offseason changesWhat an offseason NASCAR has had -- and not the kind where we argue about driver ratings and spotter quotes until Daytona sneaks up on us. This one reshaped the sport's future.There was the 23XI lawsuit, where it looks suspiciously like Denny Hamlin and Michael Jordan strong-armed NASCAR. The head brass of the sport blinked while the race teams didn't. We were reminded once again that Michael Jordan does not enter negotiations unless he plans on winning them.There were driver changes, too. Justin Haley left Spire to pilot a tub for Dodge's start-up program in the Craftsman Truck Series. Daniel Suárez slides into Haley's vacant No. 7 seat. This season also marks the arrival of Connor Zilisch, one of the most highly-touted prospects in recent memory. We talked about him for so long that he started feeling fictional. He is very real, and Trackhouse, along with market makers, have high expectations.Chevrolet also enters 2026 with a redesigned body. There may be early growing pains, but we are bullish, especially at superspeedways where Chevy desperately needs improvement.Still, all of it takes a back seat to the format changes.NASCAR didn't just tweak the rules or reshuffle the deck chairs during the break. It reached into the format drawer, pulled everything out, and said, \"Let's do something bold.\" Or old.Whatever the case, the Chase is back, and it looks improved from the nostalgic version. It's certainly different from the madness-for-madness-sake elimination style we've had for the last 10 years. This looks like a much smarter way to crown the champion. Wins matter more. Consistency matters more. And pressure -- real pressure -- is back.Twenty-six races still make up the regular season, but winning will no longer guarantee a playoff spot. The top 16 drivers advance on points alone. Each win is now worth 55 points instead of 40. Stage points, however, remain unchanged.There won't be manufactured drama on a large scale -- week to week is a different story (Hah!). It is, however, pressure without panic. We now have a system designed to reward teams that understand when to push and when to bank points.As Betty Draper put it, \"You're painting a masterpiece. Make sure to hide the brushstrokes.\"That's the entire philosophy. NASCAR wants the urgency to feel organic, not contrived. For teams, it will be a test of discipline. For us bettors, it is an opportunity -- because we hope to adapt faster than market-makers.Get bonus bets when you sign up with BetMGM:NASCAR futures betsPatience pays.Yes, the NASCAR season is long. Thirty-six weeks is quite a commitment, and locking up a portion of a bankroll for that long is not for everyone. At SpeedwaySteve2 HQ, we do not discriminate. Favorites. Mid-range plays. Longshots. You name it. If there's value, color us interested. Price matters, but the process matters more.Now let's talk about the two drivers staring down the rest of the field.Straight Forecast: Kyle Larson (1) / William Byron (2): (+1600, Caesars)Dual Forecast: Kyle Larson / William Byron, (+750, Caesars)We won't bury the lead.Kyle Larson is our No. 1 driver entering the 2026 season, and it's not particularly close. He sits 1.5 positions clear of the field in our model, which is the difference between the Grand Canyon and a pothole.In second? William Byron.Larson's 2025 season looks underwhelming if you only scan the win column -- three victories. That's a perfectly fine season for anyone who isn't considered by some to be the best racing driver on the planet. It undersells what actually happened for the Cup Series' defending champion.From a speed perspective, Larson was a menace.Fastest green-flag speed in seven races (most in the series)15 top-five finishes (tied-most)Third-best average running position (13.1)Fourth-best average finish (13.2)And then there's the track-type dominance.On 1.5-mile tracks, which still make up the bulk of the schedule, Larson was a cheat code:Best average finish (9.3)Best average running position (8.2)Most laps led per race (61.9)Most fastest laps per race (26.8)Absolute dominance.He's not a one-trick pony kind of guy either. Larson ranks sixth in our matrix on short-flat tracks and third on superspeedways. While the road-course results didn't fully pop, he still has enough pace to be annoying to SVG and relevant in win conversations while also turning right.Yes, he's aggressive -- sometimes recklessly so. That's always been the knock on Larson. But with wins now worth 55 points instead of 40, the math suddenly favors leaning into that aggression instead of dialing it back.If Larson converts even a little more of that raw pace into wins, this season has runaway potential. But what if it's not Larson?Then, it's definitely Byron. He doesn't get talked about like a weekly sledgehammer, but the numbers are loud when we look behind the curtain.In 2025, Byron posted:11.0 average running position (best)73.4% of laps run inside the top-15 (best)36.9 laps led per race (best)From a pure efficiency standpoint, he was elite.Byron's issue has never been raw speed. It's always been a lack of late-season execution, particularly once the playoff cutline turns every decision into a hostage negotiation. Now, that problem has quietly disappeared.With the new format eliminating automatic win berths while shifting the emphasis back to total points, Byron's steady, methodical approach becomes a feature instead of a flaw. There's less incentive to force the issue and more reward for stacking strong finishes.Sometimes the fix is an evolving environment, and this new Chase environment sets up beautifully for both drivers.Bet on Kyle Larson or William Byron at Caesars Sportsbook and get a first bet match up to $250 in bonus bets:Championship team winnerPick: Hendrick Motorsports, (+120, Caesars)This prop feels unfair, which is usually a good sign.We are buying more shares of Kyle Larson and William Byron while adding a side of Chase Elliott and Alex Bowman. That gives us four of the top nine drivers in our model. We're getting depth, flexibility and insurance.Elliott remains one of NASCAR's most reliable points accumulators. While he won't dominate every week, he'll usually be lurking at the sharp end of the stick. In 2025, he posted the second-best average finish (12.6) and remained competitive across every track type.Alex Bowman? Yes, he's still employed by Hendrick Motorsports even though he is everyone's favorite hot-seat debate topic. Bowman is quietly ninth in our rankings and once again undervalued by the public.So while we're here:Win Total: Alex Bowman Over 0.5 wins (-120, Caesars)Bowman will be in the mix to win a handful of times. We won't miss it, and don't want you to either.Top Chevy / Top Toyota: Kyle Larson / Christopher Bell, (+550, Caesars)Christopher Bell is a problem.He ranks fourth overall in our model and sits comfortably atop the Toyota camp. Denny Hamlin is the next Toyota in our ranking, and there's a noticeable gap. We're projecting some regression for Hamlin following last year's championship heartbreak, an offseason shoulder injury and as he navigates personal tragedy.Bell's 2025 profile was exactly what you want in this format:Best average finish (11.3)Second-best average running position (12.3)Best green-flag speed in two eventsTop eight green-flag speed in 19 racesThe pit crew will need to cooperate, but Bell's race craft alone puts him in a different tier than the rest of the Toyota field.Get bonus bets at bet365 when you sign up and bet $5 or more:Outright Winner: Chris Buescher (+5000, BetRivers)Here is the super long-range dart you've been waiting for. Buescher ranks 10th in our model but is being priced much further down the board than our fair valuation. He is a very consistent driver who can nab a few wins in any given campaign, especially for an RFK team that continues to improve.This is the longest season in sports. It rewards discipline and punishes ego. The best bets are usually the ones you are comfortable holding when nobody else is.Let's go get paid.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NFL season officially over, sports bettors will take a closer look at the hardwood, and the current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Monday features a 10-game NBA slate, including the Los Angeles Lakers hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder at 10 p.m. ET. Both teams will be without their leading scorers, with Thunder guard and reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (foot) out and Lakers superstar guard Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but NBA legend LeBron James isn't on the injury report, and the Lakers are coming off a 103-97 win over the Warriors on Saturday without Doncic. Despite SGA being out, the Lakers are still underdogs, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees value in that. The model is backing the Lakers as 6.5-point underdogs as one of its Monday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The model is also backing the Miami Heat to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Utah Jazz, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a college basketball bet on Xavier vs. No. 22 St. John's at 6:30 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)Combining the three picks into an Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +605 (risk $100 to win $605). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nSt. John's (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-110)\"Usually, we'd hesitate to go with a team after such a rousing win at St John's did against Big East leader UConn on Friday. Not tonight, however, as we suspect there is little chance the Red Storm (nine wins in a row) suddenly goes flat against Papa Rick Pitino's son Richard and his Xavier, which already took a good shot at the Johnnies in Cincinnati two weeks ago and put a scare into Papa in an 88-83 St John's escape,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers, however, have absorbed a couple of heavy losses since and been outclassed multiple times on the Big East trail, and dealing with the Storm's excellent balance, near 85 ppg offense, and productive frontliners Zuby Ejifor and Bryce Hopkins looms difficult.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)The Heat are coming off a 132-101 victory over the Wizards on Saturday, and similar to Washington, Utah isn't exactly playing the most inspiring basketball in a 16-37 season. The Jazz are 2-12 over their last 14 games, with eight of those losses coming by double digits. Meanwhile, five of the Heat's last six wins have come by double digits. Although the Heat are just 6-5 over their last 11 games, it's hard to picture them losing straight up to the Jazz, and given the way their wins have gone recently, the model likes their chances of a win by a wider margin. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and eight rebounds on Saturday, as one of seven Heat players to finish with at least 10 points. The model projects the Heat to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Heat to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)The Thunder have struggled without SGA, while the Lakers have continued to win without Luka Doncic over the start of their current absences. The Thunder are 1-2 with SGA sidelined with his current foot injury, while the Lakers rallied from trailing when Doncic exited on Thursday with a hamstring injury to defeat the 76ers. Then, the Lakers defeated the Warriors on Saturday. Austin Reaves had 35 points on Thursday, and he's averaging 26.1 points per game this season. LeBron James continues to showcase his greatness, including posting 20 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Saturday with Doncic out. James has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games. The Lakers host OKC on Monday, and they are 14-8 in Los Angeles this season. The model projects the Lakers to compete with the NBA-leading Thunder, who are missing SGA, with the Lakers covering in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        Happy baseball season! OK, it isn't really baseball season just yet, but a lot of people can pretend that's the case as pitchers and catchers start reporting to camp. That means there's reason for all 30 fan bases to be excited. The morning in MLB news started with a trade that sent Caleb Durbin to the Red Sox and Kyle Harrison to the Brewers as part of a six-player trade. For more, let's get to it. Pirates add more offenseThe Pirates finished dead last in the majors in runs scored last season and have attacked the offense this offseason. They already added second baseman Brandon Lowe via trade and outfielder Ryan O'Hearn in free agency. On Monday, they agreed to a pact with free-agent designated hitter Marcell Ozuna, per the New York Post.Ozuna was one of the best sluggers in the majors in 2023-24, but took a step back last season, hitting .232/.355/.400 (113 OPS+) with 21 homers and 68 RBI in 592 plate appearances. He's now 35 years old, but the Pirates are hoping he'll return to form in 2026.\nWhite Sox bringing back FeddeThe best stretch of right-handed starter Erick Fedde's career was with the White Sox and the two sides have come together again. They've agreed on a one-year deal, according to the New York Post.Fedde, 32, was 3-10 with a 5.49 ERA in 141 innings for the Brewers and Cardinals last season, but Fedde and the Sox are looking to recreate the first portion of the 2024 season. In 21 starts with the White Sox before being traded that year, Fedde was 7-4 with a 3.11 ERA (132 ERA+), 1.14 WHIP and 108 strikeouts in 121 ⅔ innings. Fedde figures to be a part of the White Sox's rotation to start the season along with Shane Smith, Davis Martin, Sean Burke and Anthony Kay.\nAstros continue to discuss dealing ParedesNow that Jose Altuve moved back to second base and Carlos Correa is back at third, the Astros have an extra infielder. As such, third baseman Isaac Paredes' name continues to surface in trade rumors. The latest is that the Astros had \"serious discussions\" about a three-team trade that would have sent Paredes to the Red Sox with Brendan Donovan headed to Houston. Donovan has already been deal to the Mariners and the Red Sox acquired Durbin, but this rumor remains interesting just for the notion that Paredes is available. The report notes that Astros first baseman Christian Walker is also being shopped. Rays grab Nick MartinezThe Rays have signed right-hander Nick Martinez, reports the New York Post. The veteran has been used as a swingman since returning from Japan four seasons ago. Last year for the Reds, he made 26 starts and appeared in relief 14 times. He finished the season 11-14 with a 4.45 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 165 ⅔ innings. He had a 2.61 ERA in relief and a 4.72 ERA as a starter. Still, it looks like he'll be a starter for the Rays. The only three sure spots in the rotation right now are Drew Rasmussen, Ryan Pepiot and Shane McClanahan. \nMarlins add pitching depthThe Marlins have agreed to terms with free-agent starting pitcher Chris Paddack, per the New York Post.Paddack, 30, was 5-12 with a 5.35 ERA in 158 innings last season for the Twins and Tigers. He'll have a shot to grab some starts at the back-end of the Marlins' rotation. As things stand, Sandy Alcantara, Eury Pérez, Max Meyer, Braxton Garrett and Janson Junk look like the top five.Yankees, A's make tradeThe Athletics have sent infielder Max Schuemann to the Yankees in a trade that also sends minor-league pitcher Luis Burgos to the A's. Schuemann, 28, hit .197/.295/.273 with 0.2 WAR last season in 101 big-league games. He's played mostly shortstop at the MLB level, but has also seen time at third, second and even in the outfield.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The two big winners of Super Bowl 60 were the Seattle Seahawks, who captured their second Lombardi Trophy as a franchise with a 29-13 win over the New England Patriots, and Bad Bunny, who delivered a terrific performance at halftime. Bad Bunny's performance raised the bar for halftime show production, that featured guest stars like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, as well as an actual wedding as part of the show. The halftime show has been revitalized in recent years after it got taken over by Jay-Z's Roc Nation and Apple Music, and Bad Bunny's much talked about performance will only increase the excitement for next year's Super Bowl halftime show in Los Angeles. Given the location, many expect an L.A. flair, as was the case the last time SoFi Stadium hosted the Super Bowl, when Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar all performed as part of a halftime show medley. Location isn't always factored, as the NFL is always looking for the biggest possible acts regardless of their connection to the host site, but being in L.A. shouldn't make it too difficult to find interested acts for Super Bowl 61 in 2027. The NFL tends to go for established acts rather than rising stars, in part because it's easier to put together a 15-minute medley of hits from a deeper discography. That might preclude some of pop's biggest names currently from consideration, like Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and Tate McRae, who have huge followings with a younger audience, but may not yet reach across generations. It's also worth noting that the last three Super Bowl headliners have been men, so it wouldn't be surprising if they look to change things up with a woman headlining in 2027. \nWith that in mind, we wanted to highlight a handful of potential acts that could grace the stage at SoFi Stadium next February and try to continue pushing the boundaries of what a Super Bowl performance looks like. Taylor SwiftThere is no bigger star in the world of music, and Roger Goodell has stated that the NFL would gladly welcome Swift to the Super Bowl stage if she ever wants to perform. Swift's engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has brought her much closer to the NFL in recent years, making it feel like a Super Bowl performance is simply a matter of when, not if, it happens. Swift took some well-earned time off after her lengthy run with The Eras Tour, but if she has plans for another tour on the horizon, she could certainly use a halftime show performance to remind the world that she's one of the top performers on the big stage. Miley CyrusCyrus has been a name connected to the halftime show for a few years now, and 2027 might be the right time for her to grace the Super Bowl stage. Cyrus hits the mark as an artist with hits spanning multiple genres and has a deep catalog of songs she could bring out to put together a strong halftime show. The question is availability and interest, but Cyrus is expected to return to the stage soon for the 20th anniversary of Hannah Montana, which might have her interested in digging back through her past hits for a career-spanning show. If nothing else, opening with \"Party in the USA\" feels like a layup for a Super Bowl in Los Angeles.  \nHarry StylesStyles in the midst of a 2026 world tour and we know that the NFL's focus right now is on expanding their foothold internationally with a record nine games outside the United States in 2026. While Styles would target a different demographic than Bad Bunny, he could help continue the NFL's quest to broaden their horizons and attract a global audience. Like Bad Bunny, Styles has plenty of stateside support to be a major draw in the domestic market as well. Justin BieberL.A. is now home to Bieber, and he seems to be warming up to getting back on stage after performing at this year's Grammys and booking a headliner spot for Coachella. If he were interested in launching an all-out tour again, there's no better place to drum up excitement than with a Super Bowl halftime show. Like Cyrus, Bieber has a deep catalog of hits going back to his youth and crosses into a few different genres. Cardi BCardi B is near the top of offshore odds for the next Super Bowl halftime performer, only trailing Cyrus, which is a bit of a surprise. This is in part because, like Swift, Cardi B has been a frequent presence at NFL games recently as she dated Patriots star receiver Stefon Diggs, causing some to wonder if she could be interested in a halftime show spot. However, the two unfollowed each other after the Super Bowl sparking rumors of a potential split, which could complicate matters. She'll wrap up a tour in 2026, and should have a show ready to go if the NFL is interested. \nAriana GrandeGrande took a bit of time away from the concert stage to star in the two Wicked movies, but she is an interesting potential name for Super Bowl LXI. Grande's turn to the big screen only raised her profile globally, and we know the NFL values that crossover appeal. On top of that, she will have a full stage show ready to go after her summer world tour in 2026 that could serve as the foundation of a Super Bowl performance. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With Super Bowl LX officially in the books following Seattle's win over New England, the NFL has already started looking ahead to Super Bowl LXI by unveiling the logo for next year's game.The league almost always unveils the new logo on the Monday after the Super Bowl, and this year was no exception. The NFL holds a handoff press conference where the current Super Bowl host passes the baton to the next host. In this case, the Bay Area Host Committee handed things off to a host committee from Los Angeles, where Super Bowl LXI will be played. During the press conference, the NFL showed off the Super Bowl LXI logo, which is full of bright colors.\nThe game will be played at SoFi Stadium on Feb. 14. And yes, you read that right. For the first time in NFL history, we're getting a Valentine's Day Super Bowl. However, it doesn't look like the NFL cares about that. I would have tried to hide a heart or something Valentine's-related in the logo, but the league decided not to go that route.This will mark the second time the Rams' home stadium has hosted a Super Bowl, and if it goes anything like the first time, there could be a party in Los Angeles next year. SoFi's first hosting experience came in Super Bowl LVI, when the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals. \nOverall, this will be the ninth Super Bowl that Los Angeles has hosted, with the first eight games held at three different venues. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the home of USC, hosted two Super Bowls, including the first one ever played. The Rose Bowl hosted five Super Bowls, but it hasn't hosted one since the 1992 season. SoFi hosted its first Super Bowl in 2021 and is now set to host another. L.A. ranks third on the all-time hosting list behind New Orleans and Miami, which have both hosted the game 11 times.With the new logo revealed, this is the part where we're going to break down the colors so we can figure out who's going to play in the game because, as you can see below, the colors always reveal the teams.\nAlmost every Super Bowl logo was devoid of color from Super Bowl XLV through Super Bowl LV, but for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles, the league decided to add color again -- and that's when the conspiracy theories started.\nThe Super Bowl logo conspiracy theory gained even more traction two years ago after Aaron Rodgers noted it just before Super Bowl LVIII.So let's break down the colors for next year's game: Just like the logo from the last Los Angeles Super Bowl, we have orange, yellow and red, so maybe that means we're getting a Bengals-Rams rematch. The Broncos and Bears both have some orange in their uniforms, so it could be them. As for the red, teams like the Chiefs (of course), 49ers and Patriots should be feeling good about their chances of making the big game.And as I mentioned, there's some yellow. Besides the Rams, that could mean the Packers, Steelers or maybe even the Chargers.\nOf course, let's not forget about the color of the water in the logo. There appear to be multiple shades of blue along with some teal. That could mean the Jaguars or Dolphins, but it could also mean we're getting a Seahawks repeat. The Lions, Colts and Giants should also be feeling confident due to the blue.\n        \n            \n                Way-too-early Super Bowl LXI favorites, offseason storylines and five teams to watch\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou know what? I'm starting to think the NFL is just messing with us. They put as many colors as possible in the logo just so we would all go down this rabbit hole. I just named 16 teams. That's half the NFL.Anyway, Super Bowl LXI will kick off on Feb. 14, 2027, and will air on ABC/ESPN, marking the first time since 2006 that the Disney-owned networks have aired the Super Bowl.\nThe Seahawks (+950), Rams (+950), Bills (+1100) and Eagles (+1300) are currently the top favorites to reach the big game next year, per DraftKings Sportsbook.

    "body": "\n        North Dakota State will enter the Mountain West as a football-only member beginning July 1, 2026, the conference announced Monday. The FCS program will pay the NCAA $5 million to transition to FBS and is expected to pay an entry fee over $10 million to the Mountain West, sources tell CBS Sports.Progress on bringing the FCS powerhouse to the Mountain West had been made in recent days, CBS Sports previously reported.\"We are thrilled to welcome North Dakota State University's football program to the Mountain West,\" said MWC commissioner Gloria Nevarez in a statement. \"The Bison bring a championship mindset and a bold vision for growth that aligns with the unwavering commitment to the excellence of the Mountain West.\"The move marks one of the most significant FCS-to-FBS transitions in recent history. North Dakota State has won 10 national championships since 2011, including its most recent title in 2024. They are 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents, with five wins over power conference programs.\nThe program had publicly signaled its desire to move to the FBS level in recent months under athletic director Matt Larsen and outgoing university president David Cook, who is set to become president at Iowa State University on March 1. Cook's final day at North Dakota State was Sunday, a notable final act for the school president.\"This is a historic day for NDSU Athletics,\" Larsen said in a statement. \"Our football program has earned this opportunity through the sustained success and leadership of our student-athletes and coaches past and present. Joining the Mountain West is an exciting new opportunity for our team to compete at the highest level, for our fans to see FBS opponents coming to Fargo, and for Bison football to reach a wider national audience through expanded television coverage.\"The addition of North Dakota State comes during a pivotal stretch for the Mountain West. The conference announced new media rights agreements last week with CBS Sports, FOX Sports and Kiswe through the 2031-32 season, and added The CW under a five-year deal running through 2030-31.\nThe league is also preparing for the departures of Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State, all of which will join the re-formed Pac-12 next fall. The Mountain West has backfilled those openings with UTEP, UC Davis, and Northern Illinois. Hawaii was added as a football-only member in 2012 but joins in all sports beginning in 2026. Northern Illinois will join as a football-only member in 2026, while UC Davis' football program will remain in the FCS as a member of the Big Sky Conference.The Mountain West will continue to play an eight-game conference schedule in football next season, a source said. Matchups for the 2026 season were announced in December, though dates have not yet been finalized. Projected schedules that include North Dakota State are now being modeled and would require minor adjustments.As North Dakota State finalizes its move to the Mountain West, the program will be required to complete a two-year transition period at the FBS level, rendering it ineligible for the College Football Playoff and bowl games in 2026 and 2027. The school could still accept a bowl bid if there are not enough bowl-eligible teams to fill available slots.\nThere are currently 136 FBS programs. Delaware and Missouri State completed their first full FBS seasons in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Falcons edge rusher James Pearce Jr. was arrested Saturday in South Florida on charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (two counts), aggravated stalking and fleeing and eluding police, police reports show.Pearce, 23, fled the scene of a domestic dispute involving his ex-girlfriend, Los Angeles Sparks star Rickea Jackson, according to Doral police chief Edwin Lopez. The Falcons standout allegedly crashed his vehicle into Jackson's and struck a police officer with the vehicle while evading arrest. The incident occurred shortly after Pearce and Jackson ended their relationship, the latter said to police. Pearce repeatedly contacted Jackson up to Saturday's incident despite her blocking his phone number and requesting that he leave her alone.Authorities booked Pearce into Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County. He posted a $20,500 bond and was released Sunday night with a pre-trial conditional stay-away order pertaining to Jackson.Jackson told police that Pearce followed her vehicle in a white Lamborghini SUV, according to the criminal complaint. When she stopped at a red light, Pearce exited his SUV and attempted to open Jackson's driver's side door. Jackson drove off and toward the Doral Police Department, and Pearce continued to follow her, at one point colliding with the rear end of her vehicle. Pearce then cut Jackson off at an intersection near the police station and collided with her vehicle head-on when she attempted to get away.When police arrived on the scene, an officer pulled a gun on Pearce and ordered him to get on the ground. Pearce, who was standing outside his SUV, re-entered the vehicle and closed the door. The officer opened the door, but Pearce closed it, locked it and fled the scene. While driving away, Pearce struck an officer in the left knee with his SUV.\nPolice said that Pearce later crashed at Northwest 103rd Avenue and 66th Street. He exited the SUV, fled the scene on foot and resisted arrest when police caught up to him and placed him in handcuffs.\"We look forward to working with the State Attorney's Office in fully investigating this case and uncovering the truth,\" Pearce's legal representation said in a statement to ESPN. \"Mr. Pearce maintains his innocence and urges the public to understand that while allegations have the power to shape a narrative, that it is hardly the full, complete story. We look forward to vigorously defending our Client and remain confident that he will continue contributing positively to both his team and the community he serves so well.\"Pearce, whom  the Falcons selected with the No. 26 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, recorded 10.5 sacks last season, which ranked No. 1 among all rookies in his class. He finished the 2025 season with 26 total tackles (17 solo), 10 tackles for loss and a forced fumble. The Falcons traded back up in the first round of the draft with the Los Angeles Rams last spring to select the former Tennessee product.\n\"We are aware of an incident involving James Pearce Jr. in Miami,\" the Falcons said in a statement. We are in the process of gathering more information and will not have any further comment on an open legal matter at this time.\"\n            ",

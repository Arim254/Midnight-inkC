The 16-man field includes both day-to-day superstars from Raw and SmackDown, popular NXT wrestlers like Je'Von Evans, and classic rivals like The Miz.\nTwo surprise entrants from Cena's past also competed in the tournament. Zack Ryder returned for a one-off match on SmackDown, and Dolph Ziggler received a warm ovation for his match on Raw.Rusev and Sheamus, each with a longstanding history of fighting Cena, were the first to advance to the quarterfinals. Jey Uso overcame The Miz, while LA Knight spoiled Ryder's WWE return to advance. A returning GUNTHER and Solo Sikoa have also progressed.\nTake a look below at the tournament schedule, results, and upcoming match dates.

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 12 commences with the Buffalo Bills visiting the Houston Texans on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. Those involved in NFL DFS contests will gravitate towards making a Josh Allen and James Cook NFL DFS stack with the Bills being top-heavy, while under-the-radar options include Khalil Shakir and Ty Johnson. As for Houston, its top daily Fantasy football pick is Nico Collins, who has thrived no matter who has thrown him passes, but the Texans' running back pairing shouldn't be overlooked.Veteran Nick Chubb may not be what he once was, but he can still move the chains and is a nice complement to Woody Marks. The rookie back is a good bet for double-digit touches every week, and he also won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much, thus allowing you to still include higher-priced players in TNF DFS lineups. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Bills vs. Texans on 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to Texans vs. Bills vs on 'Thursday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Bills vs. TexansPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for 'Thursday Night Football' is Bills quarterback Josh Allen. The reigning MVP nearly single-handedly won many NFL DFS contests for whomever rostered him last week with 317 yards and three touchdowns through the air, plus 40 yards and three scores on the ground. Allen has multiple total touchdowns in all but one game this season and leads all quarterbacks in Fantasy points for the fourth time in his career. While Houston has an elite defense, it is susceptible on the ground to quarterbacks as each of the last three it faced had at least 33 rushing yards, despite each being less mobile than Allen. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Texans tight end Dalton Schultz. He's come on strong as of late with Davis Mills under center, and that could still be the case on TNF with C.J. Stroud (concussion) working his way back. Schultz has at least six catches and 51 yards in each of the last three weeks, with one total touchdown. He's averaging 60.5 receiving yards over his last six games and is on pace to have career highs in both catches and yards this season. Buffalo hasn't faced many top-tier TEs this season, but Travis Kelce -- who has fewer targets and catches than Schultz in 2025 -- had 66 yards and 2-point score versus the Bills in Week 9. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Texans vs. BillsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Revenge may not be one of the top factors you consider when constructing your Fantasy football strategy, but perhaps it should be for your Week 12 Fantasy football picks. Several players will see former employers, such as Christian McCaffrey versus Carolina, Aaron Jones versus Green Bay and Baker Mayfield versus the Rams. While McCaffrey is a must-start for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups, the others may get a bit of a boost in the eyes of some managers. That's especially considering the injuries to players like Aaron Rodgers, Michael Penix Jr. and Josh Jacobs that could have ramifications.There's also Ja'Marr Chase's suspension and a Drake London injury that's affecting the Week 12 Fantasy football WR rankings. Add in that there's twice as many teams on a bye this week than last, and there's lots to keep track of when sorting out what Fantasy football advice to follow. Before making your Week 12 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 12 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 12 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 12 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 12: The model is fading Cowboys QB Dak Prescott, who is the QB8 entering Week 12 and is coming off a four-touchdown game. Prescott beat up on the lowly Raiders this past Monday, but he won't get nearly as easy a matchup this week versus Philadelphia. Only one team has allowed fewer passing touchdowns than the Eagles this year, as Philly has kept six straight starting QBs to one passing touchdown or fewer. Prescott had his worst game of the year versus Philly in Week 1, with his fewest touchdowns (zero) and fewest passing yards (188). With that taken into account, the Cowboys quarterback sits outside the top 15 in quarterback rankings and is one to fade for Week 12 Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Jaguars wideout Parker Washington, who sits outside the top 40 receivers in both standard and PPR leagues. Washington has become nearly an every-down player for the Jags with recent injuries to Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. The third-year wideout's had at least 62 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in three of his last four games. The Jags face Arizona on Sunday, and the Cards have allowed six different wideouts to have at least 54 yards or a touchdown over the last three weeks. The model has Washington as a top 20 wideout in the Week 12 Fantasy football rankings, even slotting him ahead of Justin Jefferson.

The pageantry and atmosphere of the game between the two largest service academies are unmatched, which are more incentives for the two meet at the end of the season in a standalone spot. As is the case for some time, when the two teams meet this year on December 13 in Baltimore they will wear special uniforms for the occasion. The Army-Navy game is an opportunity for the two service academies to pay tribute the history of their branch of the armed forces, and the uniforms have become a big part of that. Both teams unveiled their uniforms for the 2025 Army-Navy game, and both will pay tribute to 250 years of service in this year's game. Army was founded as the Continental Army in 1775 ahead of the Revolutionary War and will pay homage to those roots, as well as those who have died in service of their country.\nThe marble coloring of the uniform is a tribute to the headstones for soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, while a thin purple outline around the numbers honors those who received the Purple Heart. The helmets feature the U.S. Army seal and the Espontoon, representing the Army's role as the \"tip of the spear.\" On the uniforms themselves, players will wear The Great Seal on their shoulders and have nameplates using the Constitution font. \nNavy's uniforms will also look back to their founding, with helmets honoring the USS Constitution and the six ships that founded the U.S. Navy. \nThe copper color of the helmets represents the copper sheeting the USS Constitution was covered in to protect its wooden hull. The helmets also feature a sketch of the USS Constitution on one side with the original USN mark on the other.The font choice for Navy on the uniform is pulled from the typography used in the \"Act to Provide Naval Armament\" document, which authorized the creation of the first naval fleet. The six ropes on the sleeves and collar represent the six original ships in that fleet, and the pants and helmet feature those same ropes, with 126 knots to commemorate the 126th playing of Army-Navy. \nThis year's Army-Navy game will be a battle between quality teams, as Army is 5-4 on the season and Navy is 8-2 and sits atop the American Conference standings with two games to go before the Black Knights.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        During the late stages of the Steelers' 27-20 Week 9 win over the Colts, CBS Sports analyst JJ Watt addressed one of the NFL's current biggest in-game issues. Indianapolis had just scored to trim its deficit to 27-17. But with just 4:30 to play and one timeout remaining, the Colts had to declare that they were attempting an onside kick -- something that the franchise had not done in nine years.To no surprise, the Colts' onside kick was easily recovered by the Steelers, who ultimately coasted to victory.Prior to the Colts' onside kick attempt, Watt said what seemingly everyone who watched that game was thinking.\"We know that the likelihood [of recovering an onside kick] has gone significantly down,\" said Watt, the future Hall of Fame defensive end, who was calling the game for CBS. \"I am personally an advocate of the fourth-and-20 [alternative].\n\"I just think that there needs to be some way to get that percentage up a little bit more. Not crazy, but just back to the level where it's not a foregone conclusion that you're out the game.\"Watt was alluding to the fourth-and-15 proposal that may finally be gaining some momentum from the NFL, given this season's low success rate of onside kicks.At this point, the odds of recovering an onside kick is about as good as winning the lottery. Prior to the Colts' attempt against Pittsburgh, teams had converted on just 2 of 26 onside kick attempts this season for a paltry 7.7% success rate.\nThe NFL clearly needs to resolve this issue for the 2026 season. Fortunately for the league, there is an easy solution -- one that was championed by Watt during the Colts-Steelers game and already has the support of multiple current players and future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees.Asked about Watt's proposal to implement an onside kick alternative that would allow a team to try to convert a fourth-and-20 in order to retain possession after a score, Brees was not only in favor of it -- he presented his own version of what it could look like.\"How about we compromise and go with like a fourth-and-17 or something,\" said Brees, who was reminded of the fact that the UFL currently has a fourth-and-12 option.\n\"Twelve is too short. Fifteen might even be too short because most routes -- like a deep in, a deep out -- are like 15, 16 yards. It's just in that range.\"If you made it fourth-and-17, it's like, 'Ah, OK.' You've got to come up with something a little more creative. That's my vote. I'm going to vote fourth-and-17 replaces the onside kick, or you have a choice -- you can do either.\". \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In his proposal, the offense would attempt the fourth-and-17 play from its own 30-yard-line.\n\"Then, even if you get a chunk and you don't quite get the first down, you're just giving the ball to the other team right around the 40 or 45, like you would have had you kicked it onside,\" Brees said. \"I think it's roughly the same.\"Multiple current players are already on board with the onside kick alternative, including Colts quarterback Daniel Jones.\"I think as a quarterback, you want the fourth-and-whatever for the game, right?\" Jones said. \"You want to have the opportunity to make the play and and stay on the field.\n\"Onside kicks are tough. I mean, I've never kicked an onside kick. But I think, going by the numbers, recovering an onside kick is a tough thing to do. So, I'd like a chance at that fourth down.\"It's not a surprise that an offensive player would want another opportunity with the ball late in the game. What was surprising was the reaction of Saints linebacker Demario Davis when he was asked about the possibility of having to go back on the field to prevent the opposing team from retaining possession.\"I wouldn't be opposed to that,\" Davis said. \"I mean, it would play essentially like an onside kick with a greater chance of success and would add more excitement to the game.\"\nWhile this change would give offenses another chance with the ball, Davis pointed out that it would also give defensive players another opportunity to shine.\"I think defensive players will get excited,\" he said, \"because that's one more chance for an interception, it's one more chance for a sack.\"Like Watt, Davis feels that the change would help make the end of games more compelling. That, he said, is the main reason why he is a proponent of the league making his former teammate's idea a reality.\n\"I think it makes for a more exciting game,\" said Davis, who is wearing special cleats this weekend highlighting his academy's partnership with Stand Together. \"I'm pro NFL.\"I'm a defensive player, but at the end of the day, I'll pass on myself for a more exciting game and one more offensive play, especially in crucial minutes.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In eight of the past 10 years, at least three quarterbacks have been taken in the first round of the NFL Draft. Although the names may be different than summer rankings, the possibility exists of that threshold being reached yet again in April. All eyes are on the January declaration date as several names on the list below have remaining eligibility and the offers being bandied about in the transfer portal will be enticing. CBSSports.com is previewing some of the narratives that will be discussed in regards to these prospects in a matter of months. To be clear, these are not the top-10 quarterback prospects eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft. Instead, it is some of the top names as well as other notables. Drew Allar, Penn StateProjection: Day 3Age at draft: 22 years old (Mar., 8, 2004)High school ranking: .9852 247Sports Composite, No. 4 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 0 years (No redshirt)Allar (6-foot-5, 235) suffered a season-ending ankle injury after Penn State's season had begun to sour. Allar physically looks the part of an NFL quarterback and has the arm strength to make any throw on the field. However, he never looked comfortable in the pocket this season; often unnecessarily throwing off-platform. His downfield attempts were some of his best plays of the season, but those moments were few and far between. Allar is not going to be confused for a mobile quarterback, but there is enough talent as a passer for him to be drafted a bit earlier than this season's play may suggest, because one coach will come into the process and convince others that he is the one to fix his issues. \n\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 4.0: QB class shrinks, leaving desperate teams short on options\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCarson Beck, Miami (Fla.)Projection: Day 3Age at draft: 23 years old (Nov. 19, 2002)High school ranking: .9095 247Sports Composite, No. 9 pro-style quarterbackEligibility remaining: 0 years (2020 COVID, 2021 redshirt)Beck's ball placement and decision-making is just not where it needs to be for an NFL team to feel comfortable with him starting, which puts him outside of the top-100 overall. He does have good size and was at his best two years ago when he was more aggressively pushing the ball downfield. As a high school recruit, he was also a distinguished baseball player having been named an honorable mention for the 2018 and 2019 Perfect Game Preseason Underclassmen All-American teams. \nCade Klubnik, ClemsonProjection: Late Day 2/Early Day 3Age at draft: 22 years old (Oct. 10, 2003)High school ranking: .9951 247Sports Composite, No. 1 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 0 years (No redshirt)Klubnik (6-foot-2, 210) is not an explosive runner nor does he have a cannon affixed to his arm. He does, however, have a strong command of the offense. The Texas native throws with great accuracy and is able to work through his progressions. There is a level of competency that Klubnik brings to the field that will allow him to either or play a long time as a backup in the NFL. He came into the year with a personal Day 3 grade and has actually inspired confidence through consistency. The ceiling may just not be as high as it is for others in his class.Arch Manning, TexasProjection: Late Day 2/Early Day 3Age at draft: 21 years old (April 27, 2004)High school ranking: .9995 247Sports Composite, No. 1 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 2 years (2023 redshirt)\nIt has been well-documented that Manning (6-foot-4, 219) is the son of Cooper, nephew of Eli and Peyton and grandson of Archie. Professional football pulses through the family's bloodlines. For that reason, it was trendy to have an opinion on his professional outlook before he had developed a large sample size of playing experience. Manning's progression this season has been what it is for most young quarterbacks; rocky at the start with growth throughout the season. He has good size and mobility for the position. The Louisiana native throws with touch and anticipation to all three levels. All of the reasons to be excited about Manning still exist, but the decision-making must improve. It is likely that Manning goes back to school, which would probably be the correct decision at this point in time. \nJohn Mateer, OklahomaProjection: Late Day 2/Early Day 3Age at draft: 21 years old (April 28, 2004)High school ranking: .8267 247Sports Composite, No. 119 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 1 year (2022 redshirt)Mateer (6-foot-1, 224) followed his Washington State offensive coordinator to Norman as part of the transfer portal window. One concern regarding Mateer going back to last season was his proclivity to turn every play into backyard football and make plays outside of the offensive structure. He has shown growth in that regard this season. He has good arm strength and is often willing to test that into tight windows. Against Texas alone, he threw three interceptions and probably got away with a few other throws where he simply did not see the linebacker. Mateer is not afraid to target any segment of the field and is capable of throwing with touch. The Texas native is not a first-round pick right now and the next run on the position can be difficult to project. There has been more of a middle tier quarterback prospects recently with Jaxson Dart, Will Levis and Tyler Shough among those going in that Nos. 25-50 range. \nFernando Mendoza, IndianaProjection: Top-10 overallAge at draft: 22 years old (Oct. 1, 2003)High school ranking: .7933 247Sports Composite, No. 140 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 1 year (2022 redshirt)Mendoza (6-foot-5, 225) has been a personal favorite since the spring. He was my top-rated quarterback prospect in May because of his poise in the pocket and ability to execute a pro-style offense. Indiana head coach Curt Cignetti has only aided in his development. He has prototypical size and maneuvers well throughout the pocket. If pressure begins collapsing in on him, he has a good feel for when to escape and take the yardage given to him on the ground. The ball goes exactly where he intends and is a threat to target all three levels of the field. The California transfer is a founding member of They Can Too, which is a global organization dedicated to helping and spreading awareness for youth in need. His brother, Alberto, is the backup quarterback for the Hoosiers, so it looks like Indiana is running up the score with their starting quarterback once games are in hand. \nDante Moore, OregonProjection: Mid-to-Late Day 1Age at draft: 20 years old (May 24, 2005)High school ranking: .9980 247Sports Composite, No. 3 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 1 year (No redshirt)This season has been the first exposure for many to Moore (6-foot-3, 206), but the former 5-star recruit did start as a true freshman for UCLA prior to transferring. He spent last season under the tutelage of offensive coordinator Will Stein and quarterback Dillon Gabriel before being inserted into the starting lineup. As competition has improved this season, a lot more has been learned about Moore's competency under pressure. He is not afraid to throw the ball away, but does unnecessarily fade away from some throws. The Michigan native throws with touch, particularly in the short to intermediate. Moore has a quiet confidence in the pocket and good throwing motion. \nHe would probably benefit from returning to Eugene for another season, but it is not cut and dry. If he receives draft feedback that he is going to be drafted in the first round, then it is tough to pass up that kind of money. If a player has confidence in himself, then may as well start the clock on a possible contract extension, because second contract money blows NIL opportunities out of the water. The 2027 draft class could potentially have more depth and talent at quarterback.  Garrett Nussmeier, LSUProjection: Late Day 2/Early Day 3Age at draft: 24 years old (Feb. 7, 2002)High school ranking: .9624 247Sports Composite, No. 14 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 0 years (2021 redshirt)Nussmeier (6-foot-1, 205) is the son of Saints offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier, who had been picked in the fourth round of the 1994 NFL Draft and spent six seasons in the league. \nHe paid his dues waiting in the shadows to replace eventual No. 2 overall selection Jayden Daniels. Nussmeier had been known for his accuracy and professional approach to operating the Tigers' offense. He was both efficient and effective last season for the nationally ranked program. His decision-making has wavered this season and the consistency that had defined his draft profile eroded. The Texas native has been limited by an abdominal injury and perhaps that has impacted his play this season. Nussmeier is more of a survivalist as a runner rather than a quarterback who will consistently get chunk yardage on the ground. LaNorris Sellers, South CarolinaProjection: Late Day 1/Early Day 2Age at draft: 20 years old (June 23, 2005)High school ranking: .9127 247Sports Composite, No. 18 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 2 years (2023 redshirt)If Sellers (6-foot-3, 240) enters the 2026 NFL Draft, he will not legally be allowed to drink alcohol in celebration of being picked. It is entirely possible that he returns for another year of college football and works on becoming a more consistent passer. His younger brother is a freshman wide receiver for the Gamecocks, so that is a unique opportunity. \nWith his size, mobility and arm strength, there is no denying the talent he brings to the table, but the decision-making is not yet where it needs to be on a down-to-down basis. He could continue his development in the NFL, similar to Josh Allen, but there are plenty of examples to the contrary as well. Ty Simpson, Alabama Projection: Top-10 overallAge at draft: 22 years old (Dec. 21, 2002)High school ranking: .9883 247Sports Composite, No. 3 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 1 year (2022 redshirt)Simpson (6-foot-2, 208) had opportunities to leave in the transfer portal but elected to remain with the program he chose out of high school. The son of long-time UT Martin head coach Jason Simpson is an incredibly accurate passer without sacrificing the team's desire to push the ball downfield. Those who have spent time around him praise his poise and professionalism. He lacks ideal height, but has proven his capability to execute from the pocket. One talking point with Simpson is going to be his lack of experience. Assuming the Crimson Tide progress to the College Football Playoffs, Simpson will have at least 14 collegiate starts. The list of quarterbacks taken in the first round with fewer than 20 collegiate starts over the past 10 years is unflattering: Trey Lance (17), Mac Jones (17), Kyler Murray (17), Dwayne Haskins (14), Anthony Richardson (13) and Mitchell Trubisky (13). The average number of starts taken by a quarterback in the first round is 32.4.Brendan Sorsby, CincinnatiProjection: Late Day 1/Early Day 2Age at draft: 22 years old (Jan. 20, 2004)High school ranking: .8596 247Sports Composite, No. 66 quarterbackEligibility remaining: 1 year (2022 redshirt)There is an Indiana quarterback on this list, which is interesting because Sorsby (6-foot-3, 235) transferred out of Bloomington. He is a big body that is capable of making throws off-platform and is accurate on the move. Sorsby throws with touch to all three levels of the field and is not afraid to drive it between the hashes. The Texas native throws with touch and anticipation. His five batted passes on the season came against two teams, Utah and Nebraska, according to TruMedia. The offensive structure is not going to call for several designed runs, but he is a strider that can get chunk yardage when available. The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        Are you overstimulated by all the hoops yet? The basketball is overwhelming, first impressions are rolling and the ebbs and flows of the season are here.Let's dive into some of the latest trends, observations and stat nuggets from around the college basketball ecosystem.Numbers behind Jaden Bradley's late-game heroicsWatching Jaden Bradley click his heels and saunter onto the floor in late-game scenarios should send a shiver down your spine if you're on that opposing sideline. The Arizona senior guard pitched nearly a perfect game down the stretch to help the Wildcats rally to knock off No. 15 UCLA 69-65 on Friday. Bradley scored nine points in the final 4:32 and has cemented himself as one of the premier clutch-time scorers, so far. Clutch-time comes in the final five minutes when the score is within five points. \nThat's where Bradley has transformed into a stone-cold killer. He's scored 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting with zero turnovers per CBB Analytics in nine clutch minutes to steer Arizona to two enormous victories over UCLA and Florida that will age like fine wine ahead of Selection Sunday. Bradley has already scored more clutch buckets (seven) in two games than all of last year (six). \nAlex Karaban's silent masterpieceSilas Demary Jr.'s excellent showing and AJ Dybantsa's enormous second half in his Boston homecoming were the two main storylines after No. 3 UConn outlasted No. 7 BYU 86-84.\nIn typical Alex Karaban fashion, it overshadowed maybe the best game of Karaban's career. The UConn senior delivered 21 points on just 11 shots. He drained all four of his 3-pointers and didn't turn it over once in 39 minutes. He finished with a sparkling 181 offensive rating, the fourth-highest single-game performance of his 115-game career in Storrs. Oh, and he was excellent defensively. Covering up gaps. Getting his hands in the passing lines. Contesting everything. UConn asked Karaban to switch onto both Dybantsa and jitterbug point guard Rob Wright, and he was up to the challenge almost every time. BYU shot just 3-for-12 from the field when Karaban was the closest defender.Karaban's decision to return to this roster has helped him return to a role that suits him almost flawlessly. Karaban isn't ever going to be the fulcrum of an offense, and that's OK. But a point guard like Demary, shooters like Solo Ball (and eventually Braylon Mullins) and a big man like Tarris Reed help Karaban drift into the shadows. That's where he's just utterly lethal.It's a big reason why these Huskies look every bit the part of a national championship frontrunner. \nArmed with new recipe, Saint Louis looks like A-10's bestSaint Louis is off to one heck of a start in Year 2 under Josh Schertz. The undefeated Billikens led Grand Canyon by as much as 27 points in the second half of Saturday's 78-64 romp. Grand Canyon used an 11-0 run in the final three minutes to put some lipstick on the pig, but the damage was already done. Schertz is known for his offense, but SLU's defense held Grand Canyon to just 12 2-point field goals. It was the best mark of Schertz's 38-game stretch in The Lou. Saturday felt like a proof-of-concept moment for a roster that was almost totally renovated around goggled star big man Robbie Avila.The Billikens are legit nine-deep. Seven of the nine rotation players are 6-foot-5 or taller, and that doesn't include Dion Brown, a 6-3 Boston College transfer who plays like he's all of 6-8. Brown ripped down 15 rebounds, including five offensive boards, in the Grand Canyon domination.\nThe buffed-up positional size is one reason why this interior defense could be much better. Quinnipiac transfer Paul Otieno had three blocks, but SLU's wing defenders like Brown, Amari McCottry, Quentin Jones, Ishan Sharma and Kellen Thames were physical, pesky and highly disruptive. Avila makes Saint Louis go, but McCottry's development is so noticeable. He hasn't proven to knock down 3s, so Grand Canyon tried to cross-match its big men onto McCottry.They paid for that move.McCottry's slippery, sudden drives gave Grand Canyon fits. He finished with 20 points, five rebounds and four assists, flashing better decision-making across the board. He could've easily finished with six dimes, and McCottry is well on his way to establishing himself as one of the most-improved players in the A-10.\nMcCottry's emergence, lots of real depth and a stiffer interior defense has the arrow for Saint Louis pointing up. You will hear from them in the A-10 race.Oh, and it's obvious why no high-majors chose to schedule the Billikens this year.Stars adding layers to their gamesJT Toppin only had nine games with multiple assists last year. That's flipped a bit this year. The Texas Tech All-American has racked up multiple dimes in all three games. His assist rate has spiked from 10.1 to 18.9. Toppin is already an absolute handful, but the extra splash of playmaking is unlocking new levers for a Texas Tech offense that is awesome. Texas Tech heads to the Bahamas for Thursday's tilt against Wake Forest at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network (Channel finder or via CBS Sports App).Purdue star point guard Braden Smith has clearly made a concerted effort to put extra pressure on opposing defenses as a driver. Smith averaged 2.2 drives per game last year, per Synergy. This year, Smith is up to 3.8 drives per game. I think that's going to stick this year, especially as freshman point guard Omer Mayer earns more trust to run things and let Smith operate off the ball a little more. Smith is already a maestro, but the extra drives are for real. Purdue takes on Memphis on Thursday in the Bahamas at 6 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network (Channel finder or via CBS Sports App).Florida's Thomas Haugh is balling these days and looks like the best player on the team. The junior forward is averaging 19.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.0 dimes through four games. He's taking more 3-pointers, and Florida is trusting him to initiate more pick-and-rolls. Haugh has notched five possessions as the handler in ball screens this year. That's equal to the number of pick-and-roll possessions Haugh had all of last year. He's a pro.Darrion Williams mostly operated off the ball in transition last year for Texas Tech, filling the wings and finding creases to attack. This year, the new NC State star is looking for his own in transition way more. Williams has worked hard to improve his footwork and pace in the open floor. Williams looks even more comfortable walking into transition 3s, giving NC State an extra avenue for easy buckets against unset defenses. He killed VCU for 12 transition points in NC State's 85-79 win over Monday. He never scored more than six transition points in a single game for Texas Tech a season ago.Stats to monitorBaylor is still unblemished, but it got out-rebounded by both Washington (42-33) and Tarleton State (34-21). That is … concerning. Next week's Players Era date with St. John's c could be a bloodbath on the glass if the Bears aren't careful.Michigan State is generating just 6.7 open 3s per game. That ranks 17th in the Big Ten, and the Spartans are only shooting 20% on those unguarded looks.Conversely, Florida is generating 11.0 open 3s per game, but the Gators are shooting just 23% on 'em. That screams positive regression for an offense that is putting up serious numbers without any jumpers going in yet.There's plenty of trepidation to play good mid-majors. That isn't the case for Randy Bennett. The Gaels have obliterated St. Thomas, Chattanooga, Ohio and North Texas. Saint Mary's h has jumped from No. 55 to No. 24 on KenPom, showing that there's more than one way to skin a cat from a scheduling perspective. On the floor, sophomore Mikey Lewis is absolutely balling. Lewis and Paulius Murauskas have quickly become one of the top duos in the sport.The West Coast Conference is 11-7 against top-150 teams so far this season. The Big East is just 4-11. Santa Clara embarrassed Xavier, 87-68, in a head-to-head showing.\n            ",

On Tuesday night, they'll do it again, for a 15th time, this time inside New York's Madison Square Garden.Here are the matchups:* 6:30 p.m. ET: Kentucky vs. Michigan State* 9:00 p.m. ET: Duke vs. KansasAll four teams are in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Purdue remains No. 1 for the 10th consecutive day. Duke is No. 8. Kentucky is No. 17. Michigan State is No. 18. Kansas is No. 22.It should be a great night at MSG.Unfortunately, though, it won't be as great as it could've been because five-star freshman Darryn Peterson, a candidate to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, will not play thanks to a hamstring injury that's kept him out of Kansas' past two games. In KU's first two contests, the 6-foot-6 guard averaged 21.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists in 25.0 minutes on the court.\"We're not obviously gonna have him, you know, at least for the immediate future,\" KU coach Bill Self said this weekend. \"I just don't know how long that'll be.\"\nThat's a bummer, for sure. But at least one of the other elite freshmen will be on display. His name is Cameron Boozer, and he's averaging 22.5 points,10.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1,8 blocks and 1.8 steals in 28.8 minutes per game for the undefeated Blue Devils. In high school, Boozer was a two-time Gatorade National Player of the Year. The only other men to win that award twice are LeBron James, Greg Oden and Brandon Knight.

    "body": "\n        Through the earliest stages of Major League Baseball's winter, one thing has become clear: teams aren't too concerned about free-agent reliever Devin Williams' down year. Rather, Williams has been one of the names that has most frequently populated the rumor mill, with several playoff teams (including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox) being linked to him publicly.Williams, 31, spent last year with the Yankees after coming over in an offseason trade with the Brewers. Math doesn't work this way, but just to illustrate a point about how uncharacteristic his season was: his 4.79 ERA was greater than the sum of his ERA in his three previous seasons (4.71).\nThat Williams is nevertheless an in-demand talent speaks to teams' evaluation of his current game and his track record. It also speaks to the disconnect between his surface-level stats and his advanced data, something that CBS Sports noted when ranking him as one of the top 20 free agents available:\"High-Lev Dev\" is a strong rebound candidate based on, if nothing else, the incongruity between his ERA and his underlying data. There were 21 pitchers who made 30 or more appearances in 2025 without any starts and who possessed a strikeout rate above 30% and a walk rate below 10%. Williams' 4.79 ERA was the worst of the group, which as a whole put up a 2.76 mark -- to the extent that the next worst ERA was just over 4.00. Williams somehow managed that while sporting the fourth-best hard-hit percentage of the bunch, behind names like Josh Hader and Abner Uribe. Things happen in this game sometimes, particularly with individual relief seasons. There's no compelling reason to think Williams has lost his touch just yet.So much of player evaluation these days is based on probabilistic analysis and precedent, on identifying the key traits and measures that predict future success. ERA may be one of the most commonly used measures, but it's known to be a largely unreliable gauge -- especially in, say, 50-inning samples.Besides, there are only two conclusions to draw from the above paragraph: either Williams is still a high-quality reliever who deserved a better season than his baseball card will show, or he's flawed in a massive, yet statistically imperceptible way -- one that never showed up prior to 2025.You can guess which outcome seems more likely. \nIn turn, you can understand why Williams is a popular target. He, almost without fail, passes all those tests. Even at his worst, he threw strikes and reliably missed bats and barrels. Certainly it's worth examining his failures and exploring why there was such a large gap between his expected and actual results, but the odds are overwhelmingly in his favor of returning to glory.Reliever (2023-25)GERASO%BB%Hard hit%Edwin Díaz1162.4838.4%8.6%35.6%Devin Williams1502.4737.2%11.1%33%Luke Weaver1554.1024.6%7.4%40.6%Robert Suarez1612.6624.9%6.6%40.9%Ryan Helsley1562.8929.2%9.8%38.7%Of course, there's also the financial aspect to consider. Everyone loves a bargain, and while there's enough interest in Williams' services that it's hard to foresee him coming at a steep discount -- such is the relationship between supply and demand -- the idea of landing him for a few million less than would've otherwise been possible is enticing. That's doubly true when you compare him on a multi-year basis to some of the other top relievers available.\nWilliams' free agency, then, will be a good test of the limitations of ERA when it comes to projecting future performance.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The circus that followed Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin's flirtation with the vacancies at Florida and LSU added a new layer Tuesday after he slammed the idea of an \"ultimatum\" given to him by Rebels leadership. The Athletic reported that Ole Miss gave Kiffin a deadline to make a decision on his future by Nov. 28, the date of the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State.\"That's absolutely not true, anything like that at all ... I don't know where that came from,\" Kiffin said on The Pat McAfee Show in what appeared to be a pre-recorded clip. \"I love it here. We're having blast. It just couldn't be better. You pray for things. Our fans prayed for this type of thing, now we're in the middle of it, so enjoy it.\"Kiffin said he had a 6 a.m. yoga session Tuesday, and athletic director Keith Carter joined him. That was the extent of the conversation with McAfee involving the pair's working relationship, notable given Carter's recent acknowledgement the school was working on an extension for Kiffin.CBS Sports reported over the weekend that those in Oxford were previously confident that Kiffin would sign a long-term extension and return next season. Those hopes weakened a bit recently, despite the idea of Ole Miss in the playoff potentially strengthening the Rebels' chances at retaining him.\nMembers of Kiffin's family received a private tour of Baton Rouge, Louisiana Monday after LSU sent a private plane for the excursion, per The Advocate. In addition to the Baton Rouge trip, a Kiffin family member visited Gainesville, Florida, sources confirmed to John Talty and Richard Johnson of CBS Sports.Neither Florida's interest in Kiffin nor reports of LSU being in pursuit were mentioned by McAfee or his crew. Instead, the focus of the remainder of the interview shifted toward Ole Miss' stance in the College Football Playoff conversation.\"There's too many variables,\" Kiffin said. \"Everybody's like, 'You gotta get to the top 12 teams' ... well, now we're finding out depending on how other things go, you've really got to get to the top 10 teams to get in the playoff. Two of the teams might not even be in the top 12 with the current flawed system. You better make sure you're in the top 10 or you may get left out.\"\nKiffin's in the middle of his fourth 10-win season in six years with the Rebels. He is one victory over Mississippi State away from locking in a playoff berth and a first-round home game.\"I have an extremely high expectation of how we should perform as a program and I've had that as long as we got there,\" Kiffin said. \"My expectation is way up there. When outside expectations happen, or for instance, now our fanbase getting used to these 10-win seasons every year, I'm good with it. They're now coming to the expectation I've had all along here. \"We're now aligned in our expectations in what we want our program to be. I love that the fans now have what some people would say is unrealistic expectations for Ole Miss, because now they're just matching how I feel.\"\n            ",

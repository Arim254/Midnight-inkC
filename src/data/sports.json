New York won three of four last season during what was unquestionably a down year for Pittsburgh. However, they'll look to regroup to give Sydney Crosby another run at the Stanley Cup at age 38.

Scott Wedgewood is 4-0 with a 1.00 GAA and .966 save percentage vs. LA over the last three years. Darcy Keumper is 1-2 with a 3.51 GAA and .871 save percentage vs. Colorado over that same time frame.

The offensive fireworks have continued in the playoffs, as Games 1 & 2 combined for at least 11 total runs.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>After watching <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-browning/\">Jake Browning</a> throw three interceptions against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a> on Sunday, it appears that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> coach Zac Taylor might be ready to at least consider the idea of making a quarterback change. </p><p>Following the Lions' 37-24 win over the Bengals on Sunday, Taylor was asked if the team would be moving forward with Browning as the starting quarterback and the Bengals coach didn't exactly give his QB a vote of confidence. </p><p>\"After a game like that we're going to look at all personnel to make sure we're doing the right thing,\" Taylor said. \"I won't shy away from that because it's a very fair question after the amount of turnovers we had. To say Jake can't win games for us, I believe Jake can win games for us. I do. We'll just continue to look at everything we can personnel-wise.\"</p><p>Browning won games for the Bengals two years ago, but this year, he's gone 0-3 as the starter, and it's been an ugly 0-3. As a matter of fact, over the past three weeks, you could make the argument that the Bengals have been worst team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. Yes, the 0-5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> exist, but even the Jets haven't been as bad as the Bengals. Since Browning took over as the starting quarterback in Week 3, the Bengals have been outscored 113-37. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-5-grades-scores-results-highlights-broncos-eagles-ravens-texans/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 5 grades: Jaguars earn 'A-' for upset win over Chiefs; Ravens get a big 'F' for ugly loss to Texans</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL Week 5 grades: Jaguars earn 'A-' for upset win over Chiefs; Ravens get a big 'F' for ugly loss to Texans\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/705a8ac4-4fe5-4fa3-befc-61279d35a38a/thumbnail/270x152/ca2b7e78ec374d4b8753159a4695d880/trevor-lawrence.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Taylor got asked again on Monday if Browning would be the starting QB going forward, and once again, he wouldn't commit to anything. </p><p>\"We'll see where it goes,\" Taylor said. \"Like all personnel decisions, we got to evaluate it.\"</p><p>The Bengals are heading on the road in Week 6 for a game in Green Bay. </p><p>If the Bengals want to have any chance to save their season, now seems like the time to make a move at QB and let's talk about why. </p>\n<h2>They are somehow very much still alive in the AFC North</h2><p>Yes, the Bengals are in the midst of one of the ugliest three-game stretches in franchise history, but despite that, they're still very much alive in the AFC North. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> somehow have more problems than the Bengals, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> are the Browns and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> haven't been exactly overpowering their opponents during their 3-1 start. </p><p>Here's a look at the current AFC North standings: <br /><strong>1. </strong>Steelers (3-1)<br /><strong>2. </strong>Bengals (2-3)<br /><strong>3. </strong>Ravens (1-4)<br /><strong>4. </strong>Browns (1-4)</p><p>The Bengals actually play the Steelers in Week 7 and if they were to win that game, that would put them right back in the thick of the AFC North race. Taylor is very well aware of the state of the AFC North, and we know that, because he brought it up unprompted following the Lions' game. </p>\n<p>\"I'm not oblivious to what goes on in the AFC and our division,\" Taylor said. \"There's going to be plenty of opportunity there if we can stick through this storm and stick together and find a way to put us in some better positions on offense together and score some points.\"</p><p>If Taylor wants to see his team score some points, Browning probably isn't the guy to do it. </p><p>During their current three-game losing streak, the Bengals have been outscored 69-9 in the first half of those games, which means the games have been over before most fans at the stadium have finished their first hot dog. </p>\n<p>If Taylor sends Browning to the bench now, it sends a message to fans that he's doing everything he can to win games. The front office could also send a message by making a trade. So if Browning gets benched, who would take his place? </p><h2>The QB options</h2><p>The Bengals have only made <a href=\"https://x.com/TomPelissero/status/1853805220557475960\" target=\"_blank\">two midseason trades over the past 52 years</a> that involved them acquiring a player, so they'd have to be desperate, which is exactly where they should be after Sunday's loss. There are several possible trade targets out there and I covered a few of them last week (You can <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/trade-targets-bengals-should-consider-at-quarterback-to-save-season/\" target=\"_blank\">check out the story here</a></span>), but here's the short list: </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a></li><li>Giants QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1998197/jameis-winston/\">Jameis Winston</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272574/kirk-cousins/\">Kirk Cousins</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1760229/jimmy-garoppolo/\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a> QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1125961/andy-dalton/\">Andy Dalton</a></li></ul><p>There's a reason that all five of these guys are backup quarterbacks right now, so they'd all come with their flaws, but each of them would certainly be an upgrade over Browning. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1664819/derek-carr/\">Derek Carr</a> is also out there, but he's <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/derek-carr-im-still-training-wont-say-id-never-come-back\" target=\"_blank\">dealing with a shoulder injury</a> and it's unclear if he's healthy enough to play at this point. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273654/ryan-tannehill/\">Ryan Tannehill</a> could also be an option. The former first-round pick <a href=\"https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/1903214983120630182\" target=\"_blank\">briefly talked</a> with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> this offseason about possibly signing with Minnesota, but he didn't sign. The only real advantage with Tannehill is that he's a free agent, so the Bengals wouldn't have to make a trade. </p>\n<p>The Bengals play at Green Bay in Week 6 and it's unlikely a new QB could come in and be ready for that game, so a new QB would have to target Cincinnati's Week 7 game against the Steelers. And once again, a win there would put the Bengals right back in the thick of the AFC North race. </p><h2>Quarterbacks on the roster</h2><p>One reason Taylor has likely has been hesitant to bench Browning is because the Bengals don't have a lot of great options on the roster. The backup QB on Sunday was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181392/brett-rypien/\">Brett Rypien</a>, who hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since the 2023 season. The Bengals also have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868998/sean-clifford/\">Sean Clifford</a>, who has thrown exactly one pass in his NFL career since being drafted by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in 2023. The Bengals also had Mike White for the past few weeks, but he's no longer an option, because he was released on Tuesday. </p><p>So there you have it, the Bengals have two backup quarterbacks behind Browning on their roster who combined to throw zero passes during the 2024 season. </p>\n<p>The other problem here is that Clifford and Rypien haven't had a lot of time to learn Zac Taylor's offense. Rypien didn't sign with the team until late August and Clifford wasn't <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-burrow-injury-bengals-to-sign-veteran-qbs-mike-white-sean-clifford-to-the-practice-squad-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">added</a></span> until after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-burrow-injury-update-bengals-qb-undergoes-surgery-on-toe-expected-to-miss-at-least-three-months/\" target=\"_blank\">injured in mid-September</a></span>. If the Bengals do make a quarterback change heading into this week's game against Green Bay -- and that's not a guarantee -- the job would almost certainly be going to one of those two guys since it would be pretty much impossible to get a new guy in and up to speed before Sunday's kickoff. </p><p>As for Browning, he went 4-3 as a starter after Burrow went down with an injury in 2023, so the Bengals were understandably comfortable with him as the backup this year, but now, it's time to make a move. </p><p>The Bengals spent big money to keep their roster together this season with new contracts for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>, and if they don't do something now, that money is going to go down the drain. No front office hates to see money go down the drain more than the Bengals, so maybe that will convince them to make a move. </p>\n<p>If they can find a QB to keep them in the playoff race, the light at the end of the tunnel would be the possible return of Burrow in late December, but it's a light that's going to extinguish soon if the Bengals keep losing, because Burrow likely won't play another down this season if this team isn't in playoff contention at the end of the year. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Not sure anyone other than Curt Cignetti could've honestly said they expected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a> vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> to be a marquee matchup when the Big Ten expanded prior to last season. But here we are. The game of the week in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> airs on CBS (streaming on Paramount+) Saturday afternoon from Autzen Stadium, where two undefeated teams collide with College Football Playoff and Big Ten title race implications on the line.</p><p>Neither program has a national title to claim, but history would suggest Oregon is far and away the stronger, more consistent power. Still, the Hoosiers are a different outfit under Cignetti -- disciplined, efficient and capable of hanging in the advanced metrics with anyone.</p><p>Here's a closer look at how Indiana and Oregon compare across some of college football's most telling categories this season:</p><h3>How does Indiana stack up against Oregon?</h3><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>Indiana</p></td><td><p>Oregon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Off. Success Rate</p></td><td><p>58.4% (2nd)</p></td><td><p>53.5% (14th)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Def. Success Rate</p></td><td><p>67.0% (3rd)</p></td><td><p>62.3% (12th)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Off. Explosive Play %</p></td><td><p>15.1% (t-17th)</p></td><td><p>16.1% (7th)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Def. Explosive Play %</p></td><td><p>9.9% (t-33rd)</p></td><td><p>5.3% (1st)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Off. EPA/Play</p></td><td><p>0.22 (t-15th)</p></td><td><p>0.25 (t-7th)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Def. EPA/Play</p></td><td><p>0.23 (t-4th)</p></td><td><p>0.25 (3rd)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Against FBS opponents only</p><p>For those keeping score, that's a 4-2 advantage for the Ducks. But the Hoosiers clearly deserve some respect.</p><p>According to CBS Sports research, Saturday's showdown is the first Big Ten matchup between teams entering 5–0 or better with a +30 points-per-game differential or higher since the <em>totally unforgettable</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NWEST/northwestern-wildcats/\">Northwestern</a>–Chicago clash of 1904.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-rankings-projection-miami-ohio-state-continue-to-separate-from-pack/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football Playoff Rankings projection: Miami, Ohio State continue to separate from pack</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Crawford                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football Playoff Rankings projection: Miami, Ohio State continue to separate from pack\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/74f72d8d-2f46-4afa-8fa7-0c8d6e76d103/thumbnail/270x152/899b127fcbe5bd6adade362536e1a65d/julian-sayin.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Cignetti has done an unbelievable job developing transfers and maximizing the roster, turning Indiana into a legitimate force despite a massive talent gap -- at least from a recruiting rankings perspective. Oregon ranks fifth nationally in the <a href=\"https://247sports.com/season/2025-football/collegeteamtalentcomposite/\" target=\"_blank\">247Sports Team Talent Composite</a>, stocked with blue-chip recruits and elite depth. Indiana, meanwhile, sits 72nd -- ahead of only two other Power Four programs -- which makes the Hoosiers' rise under Cignetti all the more remarkable.</p><p>Quarterback play should take center stage, and few matchups in the country feature two passers operating at this level. Indiana's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> and Oregon's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> have combined for 30 touchdown passes against just two interceptions this season -- a staggering level of efficiency in the modern Big Ten. </p><p>Mendoza has logged three games with at least four touchdown passes and no picks, the most in the FBS, while Moore has four outings with three or more scores and zero turnovers, also the most nationally. Together, they join 2011 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a>'s Russell Wilson as the only Big Ten quarterbacks since 2000 to start 5-0 with a completion rate above 70%, at least 225 passing yards per game and one or fewer interceptions.</p><p>The stakes couldn't be much higher for an early-October game. Saturday isn't just about staying unbeaten -- it could shape the entire Big Ten title race. Neither Indiana nor Oregon faces another currently ranked opponent the rest of the way (Indiana does visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> in November, but the Nittany Lions look far less imposing after back-to-back stumbles). In other words, this might be the last real test before December.</p><p>With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> once again looking like a national title contender, the Hoosiers-Ducks showdown could end up deciding one of the spots in Indianapolis. Of course, history isn't exactly on Indiana's side. The Hoosiers are 0-46 all-time on the road against AP top-5 teams -- the most losses in college football without a win. Their last road win over a top-10 opponent came back in 1987 (at No. 9 Ohio State).</p><h2>Penn State's missing link? ... Tyler Warren</h2><p>It wasn't going to matter who Penn State brought in at receiver to help <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a>. Nothing was going to replace the impact tight end Tyler Warren had on this offense last season. Transfers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26720252/kyron-hudson/\">Kyron Hudson</a> (USC), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168420/trebor-pena/\">Trebor Pena</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CUSE/syracuse-orange/\">Syracuse</a>) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26703014/devonte-ross/\">Devonte Ross</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TROY/troy-trojans/\">Troy</a>) have combined for 588 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns on 54 touches through five games.</p><p>In that same span last year, Warren had 323 scrimmage yards and four touchdowns on 27 touches -- and even threw a touchdown pass to his stat line as well. Allar doesn't have his security blanket anymore, and that's undoubtedly part of the reason his production has dipped this fall.</p><p>Meanwhile Warren leads all <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> tight ends with 307 receiving yards as a rookie with the Indianapolis Colts.</p><h2>Mike Locksley's October curse on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a></h2><p>Maryland entered this past Saturday's game against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> at 4-0, looking every bit the team that had dominated early in the season. But a 20-0 lead slipped away in the final 19 minutes, resulting in a 24-20 loss, dropping Mike Locksley's October record to 7-14 during his seven-year tenure. </p><p>That trend has made October a particularly spooky month for Maryland.</p><p>Under Locksley, Maryland is 21-5 (.808) in August and September, a win percentage that ranks tied for 12th-best in the FBS and fifth among current Big Ten teams. In October, however, the Terrapins are just 7-14 (.333), a mark that ranks 104th among current FBS teams with only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RUT/rutgers-scarlet-knights/\">Rutgers</a> performing worse over the same span.</p><p>Locksley's mid-season struggles extend into the later months as well, with Maryland going 5-18 (.217) in November and December regular-season games -- a win rate that's tied for ninth-worst in the FBS and last among Big Ten programs.</p><p>The pattern is unmistakable: Maryland thrives early but once October arrives, momentum vanishes.</p><h3>Locksley's record by month at Maryland (2019-present)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Month</p></td><td><p>Record</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>August</p></td><td><p>3-0 (1.000)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>September</p></td><td><p>18-5 (.783)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October</p></td><td><p>7-14 (.333)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November</p></td><td><p>5-17 (.227)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>December*</p></td><td><p>0-1 (.000)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>* Regular season games only</em></p><p>The obvious reason is the jump in competition. In August and September, Maryland feasted on non-Power Four opponents, going 13-1, but struggled more against Power Four teams, going 8-4 (4-4 in the Big Ten) during that stretch.</p><h2>Love to see it moment of the week</h2>\n<p>Every now and then, college football serves up a moment so touching it feels scripted for a movie. CBS Sports analyst Rick Neuheisel could barely contain himself as he watched his son, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> interim offensive coordinator Jerry Neuheisel, orchestrate a stunning upset of No. 7 Penn State at the Rose Bowl on Saturday.</p><p>With the Bruins winless and massive underdogs, Jerry's play-calling clicked perfectly, while quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/\">Nico Iamaleava</a> put on a career day, accounting for five touchdowns.</p><h2>Some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> thoughts from Fighting Fornelli himself</h2>\n<h2>Going with my gut</h2><p><em>Every week Tom picks the Big Ten games against the spread based on nothing but his gut reaction to the number.

Arizona's 22-21 loss to the previously winless <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> is among the worst losses I've ever seen.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964372/emari-demercado/\">Emari Demercado</a> is the poster boy of the collapse after he <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-cardinals-emari-demercado-drops-ball-before-end-zone-on-wide-open-touchdown/\" target=\"_blank\">dropped the ball before going into the end zone</a></span> for what would have been a 72-yard touchdown to pad a 21-6 lead in the fourth quarter. It's the second straight week a player has dropped the ball inches short, and if you've read this column before, you know how I feel about this: It's unacceptable, it's inexcusable, and it should never happen. Jonathan Gannon went off on Demercado during the game (and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cardinals-jonathan-gannon-says-he-apologized-to-emari-demercado-for-outburst-following-backbreaking-fumble/\" target=\"_blank\">apologized</a></span>).</p><p>Unacceptable and inexcusable also describe the Cardinals' loss as a whole. As Gannon said, it wasn't just one play, even if that one play was really, really bad. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/anatomy-of-cardinals-epic-collapse-how-titans-got-first-win-of-2025-season-despite-massive-hole-in-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\">Here's what else the Cardinals did</a></span> in the fourth quarter alone:</p><ul><li>The center bounced a snap off <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murrays/\">Kyler Murray's</a> facemask.

This looks straight out of a middle school game.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3127681/dadrion-taylor-demerson/\">Dadrion Taylor-Demerson</a> picked off Cameron Ward ... only to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/titans-turn-cardinals-interception-into-tennessee-touchdown-in-one-of-the-most-wildest-plays-of-the-year/\" target=\"_blank\">fumble the return</a></span> and have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1860834/tyler-lockett/\">Tyler Lockett</a> scoop the ball up in the end zone for a touchdown.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Ward finished the comeback, leading an 11-play, 71-yard drive that finished with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116871/joey-slyes/\">Joey Slye's</a> walk-off field goal. Ward threw for 193 yards in the fourth quarter alone, the most by a Tennessee quarterback in a quarter since 2019. He had just 72 passing yards -- and Tennessee's offense looked hopeless -- through the first three quarters.</li></ul><p>I couldn't even place the Cardinals in the \"didn't like\" section, because \"didn't like\" doesn't even begin to cover it. They just can't get out of their own way. Arizona went 4-13 in Gannon's first year before jumping to 8-9 last year. It invested a ton in its defense this offseason. And yet here the Cardinals are again, 2-3 and looking like the worst team in the NFC West. The jump isn't happening.</p>\n<p>For a neutral fan, though, that game was super fun, and plenty more games fit that bill. Let's dive right in.</p><h2>Five things we liked in Week 5</h2><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nix/\">Bo Nix</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2218461/courtland-sutton/\">Courtland Sutton</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> offense come to life</h3><p>Bo Nix's first four weeks were not great, especially after a promising rookie year. He ranked in the bottom dozen among qualified quarterbacks in yards per attempt (6.3) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (7-4). He had missed on a lot of deep passes. He had been just OK, and when the Broncos trailed 17-3 through three quarters in Philadelphia, he had been worse than that.</p><p>Then he came to life: 9-for-10 for 127 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He went 4-for-4 for 76 yards targeting Courtland Sutton, including this huge third-and-15 conversion.</p>\n<p>Sutton was awesome Sunday and has been awesome all season; <a href=\"https://x.com/NextGenStats/status/1974942273113837652\" target=\"_blank\">NFL Next Gen Stats</a> says he caught six of eight targets for 81 yards when defended by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163404/quinyon-mitchell/\">Quinyon Mitchell</a>, and Mitchell had never allowed more than two catches or 49 yards to a receiver in a game before.</p>\n<p>But I thought this was an underappreciated Nix moment, too:</p><p>Already behind the sticks on second and 14, Nix gets a free rusher in his face, does a quick shoulder shimmy and gets the ball to Sutton. One of the biggest knocks on Nix entering the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> and even entering this year surrounded what he does when he doesn't have quick, easy answers or clean pockets.

Everyone clamors for more throwbacks. But the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> actually nail them. (And how about the throwback logos on the CBS score bug, too?)</p><p>Anyway, Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield delivered masterpieces in one of the most entertaining games of the year, a 38-35 Tampa Bay triumph. The two combined for 720 yards passing and six passing touchdowns, including ...</p>\n<p>Darnold was 9-for-13 for 123 yards, two touchdowns and one interception when pressured. Mayfield was 4-for-4 for 60 yards and a touchdown, resulting in a perfect passer rating. These guys were absolutely balling, and it was an incredibly entertaining back-and-forth affair. We like those.</p>\n<h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161957/bryce-young/\">Bryce Young</a> hangs in there</h3><p>Bryce Young was firmly on my \"didn't like\" list early Sunday afternoon, when he had an inexplicable fumble and a bad interception on his first two drives. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a> were down 17-0 after losing 42-13 a week before.</p><p>Then Young rallied. It started with an exceptional fourth-and-5 conversion in which he escaped the pocket, shook off a defender and found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28877124/tetairoa-mcmillan/\">Tetairoa McMillan</a> for a first down on what looked like a doomed play.</p>\n<p>This play might have legitimately saved the game. Then he made several plays to win it, including a terrific, anticipatory throw to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26717166/jimmy-horn-jr/\">Jimmy Horn Jr</a>.</p>\n<p>There are major, major limitations to Young's game. But he's smart. He's accurate. He's slippery. He can improvise. We saw it on those two plays in particular, and good on him for staying in things after such an awful start.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> uses his legs</h3><p>When Trevor Lawrence stumbled to the ground when an offensive lineman stepped on his foot, it looked like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> would blow another game in the most Jaguars way possible.</p><p>And then he got up and scored one of the wildest touchdowns you'll ever see.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's a sign of something bigger. Jacksonville is 4-1 for the first time since 2007. Regardless, seeing Lawrence use his legs -- not just here, but throughout the night -- is really encouraging. He ran 10 times for 54 yards and two touchdowns Monday night, tying his career high for carries and recording his second-most rushing yards in a game.</p>\n<p>Lawrence has a 22% scramble rate this season, on track to be the highest of his career. Let's not forget this is a guy who ran for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Mm9natCWE\" target=\"_blank\">67-yard touchdown</a> against Ohio State in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff. He is an excellent athlete. His rushing adds another layer to Jacksonville's offense and can help keep things afloat when his accuracy as a passer is inconsistent.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> get physical</h3><p>After getting shredded by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> in Week 4, the Commanders defense wasn't off to a much better start against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>. Los Angeles went touchdown-field goal on its first two drives and was moving again when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965898/quan-martin/\">Quan Martin</a> made a big hit on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162609/quentin-johnston/\">Quentin Johnston</a> to force a fumble.</p><p>From that moment forward, Washington outscored Los Angeles 27-0, and that sort of physicality on both sides of the ball was key. Over the Commanders' final six offensive drives, they ran 23 times for 140 yards with a 65% rushing success rate. The league average this year is about 46%. On the defensive side, Washington finished with five sacks for the game, and, after that slow start, allowed just 56 rushing yards on 15 carries by Los Angeles running backs. Fittingly, Washington put the game away with a run-heavy 13-play, 99-yard drive.</p>\n<p>\"We want that to look like that all the time,\" coach Dan Quinn said Monday. \"And sometimes, like yesterday, I took that play of Quan, he was the one that set it off yesterday. But there is an attitude and a speed that we want to play with. Doesn't mean we're always going to play it perfectly or play it just right but there's an intensity about how we play at when we're at our best.\"</p><h2>Five things we didn't like in Week 5</h2><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>' short-yardage struggles continue</h3><p>The Rams made a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-vs-49ers-live-updates-score-analysis-highlights-as-san-francisco-surprisingly-controls-first-half/live/\" target=\"_blank\">bevy of errors</a> in their loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>, but the one that had Sean McVay <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-sean-mcvay-felt-sick-over-failed-fourth-down-play-call-in-rams-overtime-loss-to-49ers/\" target=\"_blank\">\"sick to his stomach\"</a></span> was his final play call of the night:</p>\n<p>Maybe he was upset because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> had been shredding the 49ers all night. Or maybe he was sick to his stomach because the Rams are really struggling in short-yardage situations.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles has run 26 plays on third or fourth down with 2 or fewer yards to go. Their 50% first-down rate is tied for 28th in the league.</p><p>This didn't just cost the Rams in Week 5. In their Week 3 collapse against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>, the Rams converted just two of nine plays in those situations.</p><h3>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a>' constant miscues</h3><p>If there's a sequence that sums up the Jets' season so far, it came at the end of the first half of their loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>.</p>\n<p>With 29 seconds, Dallas was up 17-3 and essentially just trying to get to halftime with a basic handoff to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a>. Instead, Williams took the ball 66 yards, broke three tackles -- including two by Jets who ran into one another -- to the 1-yard line.</p>\n<p>Then, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867159/jake-ferguson/\">Jake Ferguson</a> got wide, wide open for his second touchdown of the half.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> went 9-for-11 for 95 yards and four touchdowns on play action. This might be the easiest 26-yard tight end screen touchdown in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history.</p>\n<p>Where is the defense?!</p><p>I anticipated that Aaron Glenn would bring discipline to this team, even if the roster wasn't fully there yet. And discipline isn't just penalties (which the Jets are also awful at). It's eye discipline on play action. Assignment discipline. Tackling discipline. The Jets don't have any of it.</p><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> look like JV vs. varsity</h3><p>We've dedicated plenty of words to the Ravens' struggles. I <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/were-just-not-a-good-enough-football-team-yet-can-ravens-issues-on-both-sides-of-the-ball-be-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about them</a></span> last week, and Cody Benjamin <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/what-happened-to-the-ravens-dissecting-baltimores-disastrous-start-plus-remaining-reasons-for-hope-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">did the honors</a></span> this week.</p><p>What I was stunned by most in a 44-10 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> was just how<em> easy</em> everything looked for a Houston offense that hadn't done anything easily through four weeks. Houston had a 67% passing success rate. For reference, it was their best in a single game since 2019, and they hadn't been above even 50% in a single game this season. Houston also ran for a season-high 167 yards on 5.1 yards per carry.</p><p>Baltimore is down a ton of players. Three defenders played every defensive snap. All three were rookies: first-round safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28876050/malaki-starks/\">Malaki Starks</a>, fourth-round linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162246/teddye-buchanan/\">Teddye Buchanan</a> and undrafted free agent safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3164569/reuben-lowery-iii/\">Reuben Lowery III</a>. Undrafted rookie cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26725981/keyon-martin/\">Keyon Martin</a> played 70% of the snaps. The Ravens are really scraping the bottom of the barrel, and it looked that way in every aspect.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, excuses don't matter.</p><p>\"We have to get our shit together,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1752529/kyle-van-noy/\">Kyle Van Noy</a> said. \"Just being brutally honest.

But it's true. In Week 4 against the Buccaneers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> did not complete a pass in the second half. In Week 5 against the Broncos, Saquon Barkley saw exactly one carry in the second half as Philadelphia's offense completely collapsed.</p><p>It's hard to know what this offense is, exactly. There are stars on the outside in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866975/devonta-smith/\">DeVonta Smith</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a>, but they're reportedly unhappy with their roles on the offense. Barkley, the game's ultimate closer, getting one second-half rush in a game the Eagles led 17-3 late is downright odd. Not everyone can be happy all the time. Right now, it seems like nobody is.</p><p>The Eagles rank 30th in passing yards and 24th in yards per attempt. But they also rank 29th in yards per carry. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo has his work cut out for him; there's too much talent for the offense to look like this.</p><h3>Tough week for star quarterbacks</h3><p>According to CBS Sports researcher Doug Clawson, this is the first time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a> and Hurts all lost in the same week as NFL starters.</p>\n            </div>",

The Nittany Lions are now on the outside looking in at the AP rankings following their 42-37 loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, enough AP voters still had the Nittany Lions on their ballots that they showed up third in the \"others receiving votes\" category. But that's a minor sin compared to the atrocity committed by the Coaches Poll voters, who put Penn State at No. 22.</p><p>In what universe does Penn State deserve to be No. 22? We'll tell you: it's the Bottom 25.</p><p>Thankfully, we are here to put the Nittany Lions in their place following a stunningly hapless performance against the lowly Bruins. Through five games, Penn State's three victories are against the following teams:</p>\n<ul><li>A 2-3 Florida International team that just lost 51-10 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCONN/connecticut-huskies/\">UConn</a></li><li>A 1-4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEVADA/nevada-wolf-pack/\">Nevada</a> team that hasn't defeated an FBS opponent</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NOVA/villanova-wildcats/\">Villanova</a>, which is an FCS team</li></ul><p>Penn State wasn't even impressive in those three victories against woefully overmatched foes. In retrospect, those glorified scrimmages were filled with warning signs that the Nittany Lions were fraudulent. Add in a loss to the worst team in the Big Ten and it gets even harder to justify having Penn State anywhere on your ballot.</p><p>Unless, of course, that ballot is a Bottom 25 ballot.</p><p><em>This year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>After a long and dreary offseason, the start of the 2025-26 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nhl/\">NHL</a> season is upon us and there is a laundry list of fascinating storylines going into opening night.</p><p>In the Western Conference, there are plenty of questions from top to bottom, although the biggest of the bunch just got wrapped up on Monday as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2178633/connor-mcdavid/\">Connor McDavid</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/EDM/edmonton-oilers/\">Edmonton Oilers</a> have agreed to a two-year contract extension that will pay him $12.5 million per year. The 28-year-old center and the face of the sport is coming off a second consecutive Stanley Cup Final loss to the Florida Panthers. At the other end of the standings, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/29167155/connor-bedard/\">Connor Bedard</a> needs to prove that his rough sophomore season was a fluke as he tries to re-assert himself as the league's top young star.</p><p>Additionally, the newly rebranded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/UTA/utah-mammoth/\">Utah Mammoth</a> have all the tools to shake up the West, and the race for the third and final guaranteed playoff spot in the Pacific Division should be pretty heated.</p><p>Let's take a deeper look at the biggest stories to follow in the Western Conference throughout the 2025-26 campaign.</p>\n<h2>Central Division</h2><h3>Stars, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/COL/colorado-avalanche/\">Avalanche</a> on a collision course once again</h3><p>In each of the last two seasons, the Stars and Avalanche have been among the best teams in the Western Conference, and they've met in the postseason. The Stars won both rounds, and last year's win was especially dramatic with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2178852/mikko-rantanen/\">Mikko Rantanen</a> sticking the dagger into his former team with a hat trick in Game 7. The good news for the Avs? There's a good chance that Round 3 is coming up in April or May. That's because Colorado and Dallas remain two of the top five or ten teams in the league.</p><p>Led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2076027/nathan-mackinnon/\">Nathan MacKinnon</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2845129/cale-makar/\">Cale Makar</a>, the Avalanche are looking to advance past the second round for the first time since they won the Cup in 2022. The Stars, boasting one of the best and deepest forward groups in the league, need to get over the conference final hump after losing in that round for three consecutive seasons</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nhls-top-75-players-ranked-how-connor-mcdavid-sidney-crosby-compare-to-their-peers-entering-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NHL's top 75 players, ranked: How Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby compare to their peers entering 2025-26</p>\n                <p>\n                    Austin Nivison                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NHL's top 75 players, ranked: How Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby compare to their peers entering 2025-26\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/81c9cf83-dbf2-4cf5-ab64-1131a09207ef/thumbnail/270x152/b425afa975643346b97eb1fb535246ab/gettyimages-2192534735-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h3>Can the Mammoth break through?</h3><p>If you're looking for an up-and-coming team to follow in the Western Conference, that would be the Utah Mammoth (+2200 to win the West at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>). Not only do they have a slick new brand, but they also have a ton of exciting young talent. Utah missed the postseason by just seven points, and the team looks poised for a big leap in 2025-26. The Mammoth acquired impact winger J.J. Peterka from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/BUF/buffalo-sabres/\">Buffalo Sabres</a> in the offseason, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/28895737/logan-cooley/\">Logan Cooley</a> is on the cusp of superstardom after notching 65 points as a 20-year-old last season. Whether Utah has the depth -- both up front and on defense -- remains to be seen, but this squad will be a blast to watch all season.</p>\n<h3>Bedard in need of a bounce back</h3><p>Connor Bedard was the clear No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, considered by some to be the best prospect since Connor McDavid. As a rookie, he looked the part with 22 goals and 61 points on a truly dreadful <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/CHI/chicago-blackhawks/\">Chicago Blackhawks</a> team. That created a lot of excitement about what he could do in his second season -- but that progress never really manifested. Bedard put up just 67 points, and he got crushed at five-on-five. A good portion of that was due to the dearth of talent around Bedard, but elite players are able to overcome their circumstances. Bedard clearly wasn't there last season. Can he show some progress and get closer to being that guy in 2025-26?</p><h2>Pacific Division</h2><h3>Is McDavid on board with the Oilers' long-term plans?</h3><p>Yes, McDavid signed a deal that would extend the game's top star for two years, but he will now become a free agent in the summer of 2028 as opposed to next year. Because of that it would appear that the team must sell its captain on a vision for the future. On one hand, and in all fairness to the Oilers, not many teams can point to back-to-back Stanley Cup Final appearances. On the other hand, the same issues have plagued the team for several issues now, hurting McDavid's chances of capturing his first Cup.</p><p>The Oilers' goaltending situation has been -- and remains -- a mess. They've not been aggressive enough in finding anything more than a stopgap there. The other problem has been a lack of depth scoring. This last postseason was especially bad with McDavid and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2147141/leon-draisaitl/\">Leon Draisaitl</a> doing too much of the heavy lifting.

So long to the pressure cooker and frosty weather in Toronto, hello to the dry heat and non-traditional hockey media market in Las Vegas. After signing an eight-year, $96 million contract with the Golden Knights, Marner will be tasked with helping the team win its second Stanley Cup. A perennial threat to hit 100 points who can play in all situations, Marner is poised for a monster season as he rides shotgun with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2178632/jack-eichel/\">Jack Eichel</a> in Sin City.</p><h3>Which team takes third place?</h3><p>Because the league rules demand it, three Pacific Division teams have to make the playoffs. Let's take a not-so-bold stance and say the Golden Knights and Oilers are locked into two of those spots. Who gets the third? The favorite is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/LA/los-angeles-kings/\">Los Angeles Kings</a>, which seems like the third-place team by default, but they were trending in the wrong direction before their annual first-round loss at the hands of the Oilers.</p><p>Will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2940939/quinn-hughes/\">Quinn Hughes</a> lead the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/VAN/vancouver-canucks/\">Canucks</a> to a major bounce-back campaign? Can the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/ANA/anaheim-ducks/\">Anaheim Ducks</a>, in Year 1 under Joel Quenneville, finally kick the rebuild into high gear? Is it possible for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/CGY/calgary-flames/\">Flames</a> to repeat their 2024-25 magic and play above their heads for 82 games? The race for that last Pacific Division playoff spot should be pretty wide open.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Perhaps the Jacksonville Jaguars beating the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/gametracker/boxscore/NFL_20251006_KC@JAC/\" target=\"_blank\">31-28</a> isn't the biggest upset in the grand scheme of things, yet it signals the Jaguars have arrived as a player in the AFC. The Jaguars made a statement in what was their biggest game of the season to date, improving to 4-1 and dropping the Chiefs to 2-3.</p><p>Jacksonville has certainly changed the culture under head coach Liam Coen, matching its win total from last year and emerging as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>' biggest challenger in the AFC South. The Jaguars are just the fourth team with a go-ahead touchdown drive starting in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter against the Chiefs with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> at quarterback -- and the first to pull off the feat in four years. </p><p>In a game where the Jaguars proved they are a contender, there was plenty to take away from the Monday thriller. The overreactions are heating up, too, based on how the game ended. Which are overreactions, and which are warranted realities?</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> are a playoff team</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality </p><p>Heading into this Monday night showdown with the Chiefs, it was fair to ask if the Jaguars were ready for prime time. Turns out, this group under Coen is more than ready.</p>\n<p>Jacksonville went pound for pound with Kansas City, exchanging the lead five times in the second half after erasing an early 14-0 deficit. The Jaguars scored 21 unanswered points, then took the Chiefs' best shot from Mahomes to steal a victory. Jacksonville didn't roll over, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> led a seven-play, 60-yard drive in the final minute -- capped with a rushing touchdown in which he fell to start the play -- with 23 seconds remaining.</p><p>The Jaguars are a tenacious team with an opportunistic defense and a quarterback who's starting to regain his confidence. That's a dangerous combination, especially for a team that now has back-to-back wins against good opponents in San Francisco and Kansas City. Jacksonville has the look of a team that will be playing in mid-January.</p><h2>Chiefs need to move on from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2078888/harrison-butker/\">Harrison Butker</a></h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Butker has been awful for the Chiefs this season, having a kicking error in all five games. He cost the Chiefs on Monday night with his inability to get a kick in bounds or into the landing zone.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs had just worn the Jaguars down on a 12-play, 86-yard drive capped by a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/\">Kareem Hunt</a> touchdown to take a 28-24 lead with 1:45 left. They appeared poised to survive a 12-round battle with the Jaguars.</p><p>On the ensuing kickoff, Butker couldn't get the ball into the landing zone, as he kicked it out of bounds at the 5-yard line. Penalty on the Chiefs -- and the Jaguars got the ball at the 40-yard line. All Trevor Lawrence needed was to go 60 yards in 1:45. He scored in just 1:17 in what seemed to be a stress-free drive, thanks to the good field position Butker gifted them.</p><p>This kickoff blunder adds to Butker's struggles. He missed a kick in four straight games prior to Monday night, and perhaps his attention to detail on kickoffs has affected other aspects of his game.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs will ride with Butker through his struggles because of his history with the franchise and his ability to turn things around. That leash is getting shorter by the week, however.</p><h2>Trevor Lawrence is back </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Lawrence arguably had his best game of the season against a Chiefs defense that entered Monday ranked fifth in points allowed per game (19.0), leading the Jaguars offense to 24 points in the win (seven came on a defensive touchdown). He finished 18 of 25 for 221 yards and a touchdown with an interception (95.6 rating) while rushing for 54 yards and two scores.</p><p>To cap the strong performance, Lawrence scored the game-winning touchdown run with 23 seconds left to give the Jaguars the win. He finished 3 of 4 for 48 yards and had two carries for seven yards on the final drive, also benefiting from a pass interference that negated an interception before scoring the winner.</p>\n<p>As the Jaguars keep winning, Lawrence's confidence continues to grow. The passing numbers aren't stellar (60.4% completion rate, 78.2 passer rating), but he's making enough plays to help the Jaguars win.</p><p>Monday's performance was a huge step in the right direction, but Jacksonville needs that level of play from its franchise quarterback consistently week to week. With that defense, Lawrence has a margin for error -- but the Jaguars don't beat the Chiefs without him. That needs to be the case more often.</p><h2>Late-game miscues will cost the Chiefs the AFC West </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Let's discuss what happened on the Chiefs' final series after they took a 28-24 lead with 1:45 left. Butker kicked the ball out of bounds, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176898/jaylen-watson/\">Jaylen Watson</a> missed a pass breakup on Lawrence's 33-yard completion to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3132164/brian-thomas-jr/\">Brian Thomas Jr.</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961936/chamarri-conner/\">Chamarri Conner</a> committed pass interference on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869797/bryan-cook/\">Bryan Cook</a> interception, and the Chiefs couldn't bring down Lawrence after he fell behind the line of scrimmage -- and then scored.</p>\n<p>That series of miscues led to the loss and left Kansas City sitting at 2-3 after five games. The Chiefs had the Jaguars where they wanted them and fell apart late, but that shouldn't end up costing them the division.</p><p>Kansas City is only a game behind Los Angeles and Denver in the AFC West, and the Chiefs play the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> twice and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> once more. The AFC West has come back to the Chiefs, who have crept back into the division race.</p><p>A 2-3 start isn't the worst thing in the world for the Chiefs after an 0-2 start, but the miscues late could loom large come January. Still, the Chiefs will have opportunities to win the division against Denver and Los Angeles -- making the final defensive series more of a footnote than a fatal blow.</p>\n            </div>",

While it wasn't an overly polarizing offseason, there was still plenty of noteworthy movement around the league.

The combination of the injury to Barkov and the challenge of reaching three consecutive Finals could be what keeps Florida from reaching the mountaintop yet again. </p><p>The Hurricanes have retooled their roster by adding star winger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2147336/nikolaj-ehlers/\">Nikolaj Ehlers</a> as well as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2940993/kandre-miller/\">K'Andre Miller</a> on the back end. Florida has proved to be Carolina's kryptonite in the past, but the talent is definitely there to get the job done. Meanwhile, the Golden Knights are my team to beat in the West, especially given that the Oilers lost some forward depth in the offseason. Star forward Mitch Marner playing on a line with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2178632/jack-eichel/\">Jack Eichel</a> should be pure cinema, and Marner could be the missing piece that pushes Vegas over the top. </p><p>The Golden Knights and Hurricanes would be quite an entertaining Stanley Cup Final, but I'd have to side with the team that's gotten the job done before in Vegas.</p><p><strong><em>Nivison</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Western Conference Final:</strong> Colorado Avalanche (+500) over Vegas Golden Knights</li><li><strong>Eastern Conference Final:</strong> New Jersey Devils (+650) over Tampa Bay Lightning</li><li><strong>Stanley Cup Final:</strong> Colorado Avalanche (+1000) over New Jersey Devils</li></ul><p>The Devils have been on the cusp of big things for a few years now, and they finally put it all together in 2025-26. Thanks to a full season of healthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/3125731/jack-hughes/\">Jack Hughes</a>, the Devils hit new heights. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/1770948/jacob-markstrom/\">Jacob Markstrom</a> is brilliant in goal. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/1897675/dougie-hamilton/\">Dougie Hamilton</a> bounces back, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/26802471/luke-hughes/\">Luke Hughes</a> finds another gear on the blue line. All of that helps New Jersey squeak past a loaded Lightning team looking for another Cup in this championship window.</p>\n<p>On the other side, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2076027/nathan-mackinnon/\">Nathan MacKinnon</a> got his first Cup in 2022, but he hasn't come all that close to winning another since then. The Avs haven't made it out of the second round since that championship, but they buck that trend in 2026. In his first full season with Colorado, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2845126/martin-necas/\">Martin Necas</a> thrives and sets new career highs in just about every category.

Now, we've seemingly gotten it. According to <a href=\"http://espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46510104/why-giannis-antetokounmpo-future-milwaukee-far-settled\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIL/milwaukee-bucks/\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> star not only explored the possibility of changing teams for the first time in his career, but actually had a preferred destination in mind: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">New York Knicks</a>.</p><p>The Knicks and Bucks reportedly discussed a deal, but never gained significant traction. Antetokounmpo will now enter the season as a member of the Bucks, but his well-chronicled desire to win a second championship persists. Antetokounmpo has two years left on his contract. He will not be eligible for an extension until next summer, when he will be one year away from free agency. At that point, one way or another, a decision will almost certainly be made. If he wants to force a trade, he will have the leverage to do so. The Bucks now seemingly have at least the beginning of the 2025-26 season, if not the entire year, to convince him not to do so.</p><p>And if he does? It seems as though the Knicks will be atop his wishlist. So let's dissect this news. What does this mean for the Knicks? For Antetokounmpo's future? And for the rest of the teams (and there are surely a lot of them!) that would like to one day acquire the two-time MVP?</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NY/new-york-knicks/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/350.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIL/milwaukee-bucks/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/347.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <h2>What would a Giannis-to-the-Knicks trade look like?</h2><p>The timing here is less than ideal. Last offseason, the Knicks traded six total first-round picks, another first-round swap and two important players (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135560/julius-randle/\">Julius Randle</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203519/donte-divincenzo/\">Donte DiVincenzo</a>) for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152531/karl-anthony-towns/\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2153056/mikal-bridges/\">Mikal Bridges</a>. The move helped propel them to the Eastern Conference finals. It may yet launch them to a championship. It also made it far more difficult to trade for Antetokounmpo.</p>\n<p>Should the Bucks trade their best player, they'd have little incentive to get veteran players back in the trade. They'd be moving into a rebuild, and one in which they do not currently control any of their own first-round picks until 2031. It would therefore be imperative for them to get youth and draft capital back in exchange for Antetokounmpo. </p><p>For the time being, the Knicks don't have much of it to offer. Their only tradable first-round pick right now is essentially fake: a 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/WAS/washington-wizards/\">Wizards</a> first-round pick that is protected 1-8. Do you expect the Wizards to pick ninth or lower? If they don't, the pick turns into two second-round picks. Next summer, though, New York's 2033 first-round pick unlocks from a trade perspective. That pick is far more interesting. Remember, at that point, Antetokounmpo will be 38 and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2203517/jalen-brunson/\">Jalen Brunson</a> will be 36. The Knicks should be bad by then. Swap rights on their 2032 first-round pick will also be available.</p><p>When the Bucks traded for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992810/damian-lillard/\">Damian Lillard</a>, they essentially completed the trade under those parameters. They didn't have many future first-round picks available, but they gave Portland what they could (an unprotected 2029 pick along with swaps in 2030 and 2032) under the logic that those picks, while far off, would eventually become quite valuable. They then supplemented their offer with a high-level player, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685257/jrue-holiday/\">Jrue Holiday</a>. The Knicks could theoretically do the same, offering high-level veterans that the Bucks could either keep or more likely flip elsewhere for more assets.</p>\n<p>That raises a further question: how much are New York's veterans worth on the trade market? The Knicks aren't getting the five first-round picks they dealt for Bridges back. He just signed a hefty four-year extension that will take him through his age-33 season. Karl-Anthony Towns is similarly locked in through his age-32 season, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844732/og-anunoby/\">OG Anunoby</a> is signed through his age-31 campaign. All three are pretty valuable as players, but we live in a cap environment that punishes expensive contracts. Bridges will make over $33 million in the 2026-27 season, and his deal only goes up from there. Anunoby will be above $42 million at that point, and Towns tops $61 million for the 2027-28 season. </p><p>These players are expensive. They also have notable flaws. For Towns, it's defense. For Anunoby, it's durability. For Bridges, it's the meaningful decline he's displayed over the past few years. He's no longer an All-Defense candidate nor has his 3-point shot held up as well as it did in Phoenix. The Knicks would probably have more trouble moving them than Portland did with Holiday, who came with no weaknesses besides his age. And of course, Antetokounmpo is substantially more valuable than Lillard was.</p><p>Even as the Knicks built a Giannis-less contender, they did so in a way that never quite closed the door on an Antetokounmpo deal. When they extended Bridges this offseason, for instance, they did so on July 31. That matters because such extensions come with a six-month trade restriction, and the Bridges restriction expires at the end of January. The trade deadline is Feb. 5, giving the Knicks a window in which they could legally trade him. Of course, if the Knicks were to try to make a trade during the season, they'd be doing so without their 2033 pick at their disposal. They just wanted to leave themselves the option if they needed it.</p>\n<p>So the Knicks have done their best to plan for the possibility of an Antetokounmpo trade without sacrificing their present to do so. Yet bringing a 2033 pick and the Towns-Bridges-Anunoby trio into a bidding war against, say, Houston and San Antonio would be like bringing a butter knife to a gun fight. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SA/san-antonio-spurs/\">Spurs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/HOU/houston-rockets/\">Rockets</a> have mountains of tradable picks and loads of talented young players on cheap rookie deals. If this comes down to who makes the best offer, it probably won't be the Knicks.</p><p>Which brings us to our last two questions of this section. The first, and the one that's going to sting Knicks fans the most, is whether or not New York would put Jalen Brunson on the table in such a trade. This obviously wouldn't happen in the initial negotiations. Aside from the fact that Antetokounmpo presumably wants to play <em>with</em> Brunson and the fact that Brunson is unquestionably the most popular Knick of this century, Brunson's relationship with Knicks management is unusual even by superstar standards. Leon Rose is his godfather. It's entirely possible that he simply decides that any championship equity gained in trading Brunson simply wouldn't be worth it to him or the fanbase.</p><p>Milwaukee would inevitably ask for Brunson. New York would inevitably say no. And that's where the staring contest would truly begin, because while the Knicks may hesitate to put their best player on the table, there are other teams that wouldn't. The real question on this front is whether the Knicks would rather have Brunson or Antetokounmpo, because it's entirely possible that Rose ultimately needs to make that decision.</p>\n<p>But there is another human element we need to consider here. How far is Antetokounmpo willing to go to get to New York, if that indeed remains his preferred destination should he decide to push for a trade? Some stars take a hands off approach to trade requests, desiring simply to move. Others try to stick their thumb on the scale and scare off undesirable suitors. According to Shams Charania's reporting Tuesday, \"those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is.\" He may not want to make it ugly. But if he wants to get to New York, and do so with Brunson as his running mate, he might have to. This raises a further set of questions.</p><h2>Does Giannis have the leverage to get to New York?</h2><p>When a player wants something badly enough, he can <em>usually</em> get it. The easy comparison here is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992786/anthony-davis/\">Anthony Davis</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BOS/boston-celtics/\">Boston Celtics</a> had the most to offer for him, but he made it absolutely clear that he didn't want to play for them. That eventually allowed Davis, with one year remaining on his contract, to get to his team of choice: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. Subtler versions of this story play out from time to time.</p><p>This summer, Antetokounmpo probably didn't have the leverage to do this. At this point, he still has two years left on his contract. Antetokounmpo is so valuable that there inevitably would have been teams willing to trade hauls merely for the chance to have him for two playoff runs and the hope that he would re-sign afterward. Things get much dicier next summer, when he only has one year left on his deal. We've seen teams take risks on expiring contracts before, but there were always explainable circumstances involved.</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/TOR/toronto-raptors/\">Raptors</a> did it for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1715792/kawhi-leonard/\">Kawhi Leonard</a>, but his value was at its lowest point because of injuries. Had Boston or Philadelphia trusted his health more, that's likely where he would have ended up. Similarly, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/OKC/oklahoma-city-thunder/\">Thunder</a> traded for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1755181/paul-george/\">Paul George</a> on an expiring contract when the whole world knew he wanted to be in Los Angeles. But they didn't have to give up a single first-round pick to do so because Indiana happened to love two of their younger players, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067694/victor-oladipo/\">Victor Oladipo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152455/domantas-sabonis/\">Domantas Sabonis</a>. At the time, the response to that trade was that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Pacers</a> didn't get nearly enough back. We now know that Oladipo and Sabonis were far better than we realized at the time. Antetokounmpo is simply more valuable than Leonard or George were. The price to rent him for a year would be higher, and perhaps unjustifiably high for reasons we'll address shortly.</p><p>The one major difference between Antetokounmpo now and Davis in 2019? The team Davis wanted to play for had the cap space to sign him outright when he eventually hit free agency in 2020. That probably isn't a threat the Knicks can make. Their four highest-paid players are all under contract in the summer of 2027, when Antetokounmpo would become a free agent. That will make it harder for Giannis to tell teams that want him not to trade for him because he can't threaten to sign with the Knicks as easily as Davis could the Lakers.</p><p>Fortunately for Antetokounmpo, there is a different boogeyman available to him. The Knicks may not have max cap space in 2027... but the Lakers do. If his goal is to win a second championship, partnering up with Luka Dončić is a sensible path to doing so. If he wants to be in a big market, Los Angeles obviously qualifies. That's his leverage. He may not be able to sign with the Knicks outright in 2027, but he can scare every other team off by telling them they'd only be a pitstop before he jumps to the Lakers. </p>\n<p>The Lakers aren't even the only feasible threat in this world. If this is about New York, specifically, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BKN/brooklyn-nets/\">Nets</a> should have max cap space in 2027. Plenty of teams will, with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/GS/golden-state-warriors/\">Warriors</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Clippers</a> also seemingly eyeing the summer of 2027. That would make it hard for any team to justify trading for Antetokounmpo without assurances that he'd stay. There are simply too many places for him to jump if he isn't happy.</p><p>Does this mean he can get to New York, specifically? The jury's still out. But he could certainly shrink the field considerably. We know the Lakers are willing to trade for players without an extension in place because they just did so with Dončić, for instance, but plenty of other teams would get scared off. He can give New York a considerable advantage, but it ultimately takes two to tango, and if the Bucks aren't interested in what the Knicks have to offer, there's just not a lot Antetokounmpo can do about that.</p><h2>If not New York... where?</h2><p>We're going to have to see how this season plays out before making any definitive statements. As we've covered, in a true bidding war, it's San Antonio or Houston. Unless Oklahoma City wants to get involved, which seems unlikely, those are the two teams with the most to trade. It's possible that either or both of those teams have promising enough seasons to convince Antetokounmpo that he should want to play for them. It's also possible that either or both of those teams are happy enough with what they see out of their own players that they elect not to make a serious pursuit. Remember, Antetokounmpo is about to enter his age-31 season and plays a style that isn't likely to age especially well. The Rockets and Spurs have decade-long runways. They might prefer to keep their powder dry.</p>\n<p>The Lakers are the true looming threat. Their 2027 cap space allows them to play the long game if needed. Starting next summer, they'll have three tradable first-round picks along with multiple available swap rights. They'll have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268681/austin-reaves/\">Austin Reaves</a>, though likely through a sign-and-trade, as another high-end chip to dangle. But most importantly, they have Dončić, and when superstars move, it's very often because they want to play with another superstar. Dončić has been an active recruiter for the Lakers this offseason, notably reaching out to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135563/marcus-smart/\">Marcus Smart</a> and sharing an agent with new center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2891991/deandre-ayton/\">Deandre Ayton</a>. For now, we know only that the Knicks are Antetokounmpo's first choice. If market matters, the Lakers would make sense as his second.</p><p>So would the Nets, who themselves have a mountain of draft assets (ironically coming from the Knicks) to dangle in a possible trade. The holdup there would be Brooklyn's otherwise underwhelming roster. The Nets are a blank slate right now. To convince Antetokounmpo to come play for New York's other team, they'd have to present a realistic vision for how they could build up the roster around him.</p><p>The Warriors and Clippers are in the same boat, though both come with drawbacks. The Clippers are obviously in the middle of an investigation that could drastically decrease their desirability as a destination, and frankly, it's hard to see a good reason to choose this decrepit roster over Dončić if winning in Los Angeles is the goal. The Warriors have a similarly aging roster, but lack Brooklyn's war chest of draft assets to rebuild with. Antetokounmpo would have to be on board with trying to win with Golden State's older players, or signing there in 2027 with someone else of note once their books clear. Antetokounmpo shares an agent (Alex Saratsis) with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844706/bam-adebayo/\">Bam Adebayo</a>, so Miami has always been mentioned as a possible destination, but frankly, their past few seasons have left quite a bit to be desired. They have work to do to prove they deserve a player of his caliber.</p>\n<p>Looming in the background here are the teams that control Milwaukee's draft picks. Antetokounmpo probably isn't interested in playing for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/NO/new-orleans-pelicans/\">Pelicans</a> or Blazers, but those teams hold unusual leverage in these trade talks because they can give the Bucks the ability to tank back. Expect both to try to nudge their way into talks as a third team.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ATL/atlanta-hawks/\">Hawks</a> have a bit of Milwaukee draft control, as they will receive the better of Milwaukee's or New Orleans' first-round pick in 2026, plus the worse of those two selections in 2027 so long as both aren't in the top four. Atlanta is a slightly more realistic sleeper destination considering the youth and talent it has accumulated, plus the potential for a top pick in next year's draft as a deal's centerpiece.</p><p>The truth, though, is that every team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> will be interested to some degree if Antetokounmpo becomes available. The question will be who makes the strongest offer and how aggressively Antetokounmpo is willing to steer negotiations. If he wants the Knicks, there's a good chance he ultimately gets to the Knicks. Stars wield the power in these proceedings. That puts the Bucks in the precarious position of trying to convince him to stay while knowing that if they fail, they'll not only lose him, but could do so for far less than he is actually worth.</p>\n<h2>So where does all of this leave the Bucks?</h2><p>In short, they're fighting an uphill battle. Charania's reporting made it clear that Antetokounmpo is skeptical of Milwaukee's ability to genuinely compete for a championship, which is the goal that will seemingly drive his decision-making moving forward. The Bucks have already engaged in trade talks, if only to a limited extent.</p><p>They are fortunate to be playing in a weak Eastern Conference. With the Celtics and Pacers seemingly out of the mix this season, Milwaukee has a golden opportunity to outperform expectations enough to potentially earn Antetokounmpo's signature on an extension next offseason. But given the rather glaring deficiencies on their roster, they're going to have a hard time doing that. They haven't really replaced Damian Lillard. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142303/cole-anthony/\">Cole Anthony</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3042574/kevin-porter/\">Kevin Porter</a> Jr. are their best scoring guards, and neither can touch even the aging, diminished version of Lillard we saw in Milwaukee. They have no point-of-attack defense, and both Antetokounmpo and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152935/myles-turner/\">Myles Turner</a> have declined as rim-protectors in recent years. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2842826/kyle-kuzma/\">Kyle Kuzma</a> trade was a disaster, at least last season.</p><p>For now, the Bucks have two things going for them: they still have Giannis, and they've been able to surround him with a ton of 3-point shooting. They led the NBA in 3-point percentage last season, and Antetokounmpo posted MVP-caliber numbers when the Bucks moved him to point guard following Lillard's blood clot last season. He'll likely do the same this year. Point-Giannis and shooting is a scary formula. It just isn't enough to seriously compete for a championship.</p><p>That's going to force the Bucks into some pretty scary questions. The Bucks can currently trade a first-round pick in either 2031 or 2032. Such a pick would be immensely valuable whether Antetokounmpo stays or goes. That pick might be the only path Milwaukee has to trading its way into true contention. Giving it up might also dig an even deeper hole for them to eventually dig themselves out of if Antetokounmpo does indeed force his way out. How many more assets are the Bucks willing to commit to keeping the best player in franchise history, especially after eating over $100 million in dead money to turn Lillard into Turner?</p><p>The ball is in their court now. Antetokounmpo may want to be a Knick, but he's a Buck right now, and Milwaukee still has a chance to make sure he remains one. The risk would be substantial. The reward would be the chance to keep a franchise icon from ever changing teams. Tuesday's reporting makes it clear that their hopes of doing so are dimmer than ever. But they haven't faded completely, so the onus is on the Bucks to make sure they never do.</p>\n            </div>",

With nearly a week off before Game 1 and days off both before and after Game 2, the bullpen is in great shape moving to Game 3. </p><p><strong>Cubs:</strong> They still haven't scored more than three runs in any playoff game so far. Even after getting a three-run home run from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/27023012/seiya-suzuki/\">Seiya Suzuki</a> in Game 2 of this series, they went eight scoreless innings after that. The bullpen was well-rested and still saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28837106/daniel-palencia/\">Daniel Palencia</a> cough up a three-run homer in Game 2. The Cubs have even had uncharacteristic errors from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942984/nico-hoerner/\">Nico Hoerner</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184343/dansby-swanson/\">Dansby Swanson</a>. Simply, they need to play so much better in order to have a chance.</p>\n<h2>Game 3 prediction</h2><p>The Brewers are playing at a different level than the Cubs right now and look better at, well, everything. Changing venues won't make a difference. The Brewers break out the brooms with a sweep. <em>-- Matt Snyder</em></p>\n            </div>",

The 44-yard catch helped set up the Jaguars' touchdown that tied the game at 14.</p><p>Hunter finished the night with three catches for 64 yards. And, when looking back on Monday night's game, one could argue that his big catch early in the second half jumpstarted Jacksonville's 31-28 come-from-behind win over the reigning AFC champs that was punctuated by Lawrence's <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL/status/1975398203173577216\" target=\"_blank\">game-winning touchdown run</a> with 23 seconds left. </p>\n<p>Prior to his 44-yard catch, Hunter -- who also plays cornerback -- made a nifty, 12-yard grab that helped set up the Jaguars' first touchdown, a short pass from Lawrence to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168820/parker-washington/\">Parker Washington</a>. </p>\n<p>After trailing 14-0, the Jaguars took their first lead moments after Hunter's big catch that set up Lawrence's game-tying touchdown. Jacksonville's go-ahead score was linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2827535/devin-lloyds/\">Devin Lloyd's</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL/status/1975383731272548625\" target=\"_blank\">99-yard interception return</a> that stands as the longest pick-six in Jaguars' history. </p><p>The No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, Hunter caught just 13 passes during his first four <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/scoreboard/\">NFL games</a>, which prompted questions about his lack of usage in the offense and when it would start to increase. </p>\n<p>Based on Monday night's outcome, it appears that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> coach Liam Coen decided that it was time to fully implement his versatile playmaker. The move helped the Jaguars beat the three-time defending AFC champs while moving to 4-1 on the season. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

The 12-team postseason bracket has been trimmed down to eight teams with four intriguing matchups this round: Cubs vs. Brewers, Yankees vs. Blue Jays, Dodgers vs. Phillies and Tigers vs. Mariners. Both the Dodgers and Brewers took commanding 2-0 series leads on Monday night. L.A. won its second game in a row in Philly, holding off the Phillies despite a ninth-inning rally. The Brewers, meanwhile, slugged a pair of three-run home runs to push the Cubs to the brink of elimination.</p><p>In the American League, the Blue Jays have the Yankees on the ropes after two big wins in Toronto. Meanwhile, the Mariners and Tigers are knotted, 1-1, as the series moves to Detroit. ALDS Game 3s are on Tuesday night.</p><p>The Brewers, Blue Jays, Phillies and Mariners all earned first-round byes this season, but the Cubs, Yankees, Dodgers and Tigers all needed to win Wild Card Series to get here. The Dodgers completed a two-game sweep of the Reds, while the Cubs, Yankees and Tigers all needed three games to advance and knock out the Padres, Red Sox and Guardians, respectively.</p><p>The best-of-five League Division Series could run through Oct. 11 and the 2025 World Series begins on Oct. 24.

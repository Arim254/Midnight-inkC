    "body": "\n        With the four weekday games from last week's holiday slate, your Week 14 NFL predictions should account for the rest advantages that teams have. Games like Bengals vs. Bills (-6), Ravens vs. Steelers (+6), Chiefs vs. Texans (+3.5) and Eagles vs. Chargers (+2.5) all feature teams with multiple days of rest over their opponent. While sportsbooks factored this in when setting the Week 14 NFL odds, having the edge in rest hasn't always been beneficial in regard to NFL spread success. Cincinnati, for example, who played on Thanksgiving Day, is 0-6 ATS over its last six games when it has the rest advantage.Elsewhere, Seahawks vs. Falcons (+6.5) pits one team, in Seattle, that has the league's best spread record (9-3) versus an Atlanta squad that's comfortable in the role of an underdog. The Falcons have been dogs six times this year, only losing ATS once. When there's reason to back both teams with Week 14 NFL bets, digging deep into the trends, stats and analysis can it more apparent which side to choose.

Being at home is important to note for the Jets as that means the Dolphins have to leave sunny South Beach for a December game in the Northeast. Tua Tagovailoa is 0-7 all-time in his career when the temperature is 40 degrees or below, and forecasts are calling for a temperature of 34 degrees come Sunday. Additionally, the Jets are 4-1 ATS over their last five games, while Miami has scored just one touchdown in each of its last two games and has zero passing TDs in three of its last four. The model has New York prevailing versus the spread almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 14 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7.5, 40.5) cover versus the Raiders in nearly 60% of simulations. Denver's nine-game win streak is its longest in 13 years, while the Raiders' six-game losing streak is the third-longest active one in the NFL. Speaking of streaks, the Broncos have won each of the last three meetings, while Vegas has also lost versus the spread in each of its last three games this season. The Raiders fired OC Chip Kelly prior to Sunday's loss to the Chargers, and the Vegas went out and produced just 156 total yards, which is the team's second fewest in any game in eight years. With Las Vegas now facing Denver's elite defense, the Broncos win by double-digits, per the model, which also says the Under hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 14 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 14 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams projected to win by at least a touchdown, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 14 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which seven teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        The two boxers best known for giving lightweight champion Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis his toughest pro tests to date will square off against one another on Saturday as Mexican star Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz and Lamont Roach Jr. meet in a pay-per-view clash in San Antonio.   The interim WBC junior welterweight title bout will serve as the headline bout of a Premier Boxing Champions card (Prime Video PPV, 8 p.m. ET) from the Frost Bank Center. In the co-main event, Stephen Fulton Jr. looks for a title in a third division when he faces WBC junior lightweight champion O'Shaquie Foster.Cruz (28-3-1, 18 KOs), the diminutive slugger from Mexico City, fought Davis on short notice in 2021 and largely built his professional reputation upon the strong performance he gave in a close decision loss. Roach (25-1-2, 10 KOs), an amateur rival of Davis from Maryland who still holds the WBA 130-pound title, fought \"Tank\" on even terms in a March lightweight bout but was forced to settle for a disputed majority draw. Davis (30-0-1, 28 KOs) initially activated his immediate rematch clause with Roach until pulling out and instead signing for a November clash with YouTube star Jake Paul. That fight was canceled after Davis, who has a decorated history of legal issues, was named in a civil lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend accusing him of domestic violence. \nCruz, 27, a former 140-pound titleholder, will be headlining his first PPV card and is expected to have the Texas crowd very much on his side. But the 30-year-old Roach, who will be moving up in weight for the second straight fight, is no stranger to playing spoiler and enters as the betting favorite for a fight in which both headliners have the opportunity to truly announce themselves as independent stars.Where to watch Cruz vs. RoachDate: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Location: Frost Bank Center -- San Antonio, TexasStart time: 8 p.m. ETStreaming: Prime Video PPV | Price: $74.99 \"I could have never imagined five years ago when I was fighting in San Antonio that I'd be here now, but this is the fruits of my hard work,\" Cruz said at Thursday's final press conference. \"I want to keep progressing and evolving and doing big things. I know what my fans expect of me, and I've done everything I could in training camp to deliver.\"I hope [Roach] doesn't run. It's all about the fans and they want to see us go toe-to-toe. I'll be ready to go for as long as he's able to withstand the pressure.\"\nMany in boxing believe Roach was robbed out of a second title in as many divisions against Davis, not just by the divisive scorecards but due to a voluntary knee \"Tank\" took in Round 9 that was incorrectly not ruled a knockdown by referee Steve Willis and would've resulted in a Roach upset win. Yet, Roach never harped one bit on the controversy, even during the immediate post-fight interview, and has kept an even keel about the experience that fuels him entering the Cruz fight. \"It gets to a point where I'm very accepting. I had been through things in life that were similar or worse,\" Roach told CBS Sports on Tuesday, looking back at the Davis fight. \"It's alright. I know that me doing what I have to do, me continuing on the path that I'm on, everything is going to be OK. I can't dwell on the past, it just don't work like that. It's not going to change anything. The only way you get better is to learn and move on. \"I consider that a bump and bruise on my path. It brought a little light and that's all I needed. Now we are advancing and getting bigger and getting better.\"\nRoach said a victory over Cruz could lift him to any number of marquee fights across the 135 and 140-pound divisions. Cruz, meanwhile, believes the winner of Saturday's fight should draw the winner of the Jan. 31 bout between WBO junior welterweight titleholder Teofimo Lopez Jr. and three-division champion Shakur Stevenson. Either way, the stakes are high in a fight that is expected to be contested at a high pace, featuring a mixture of technical boxing and two-way skirmishes. Cruz, whose constant forward pressure gave Davis fits, has a style that all but guarantees an exciting fight but he can also box, when needed. Roach, a natural counterpuncher who will bring a height and reach advantage against Cruz, proved against Davis that he can also stand and trade in the trenches when needed. \n\"I'm just excited to show off my skills. Nothing's changed. We're here to boogie,\" Roach said. \"Everybody knows I like to throw. There's gonna be some moments where the cameras better be ready. He's throwing missiles in there and I'm gonna throw them back. We know what kind of fight Pitbull will bring, but we'll be ready for everything. Anyone who's watched me knows that I can adapt to anything.\"The undercard was expected to feature a middleweight title unification between WBC champion Erislandy Lara and WBA and IBF titleholder Janibek Alimkhanuly. However, Alimkhanuly tested positive for banned substance melondium during fight week and was removed from the bout. In his place steps Johan Gonzalez, a veteran of 40 pro fights who is coming off a split decision win over former junior middleweight titleholder Jarrett Hurd earlier this year. Lara, 42, is on one of the best runs of his career with six straight wins dating back to 2019. His last appearance came in September 2024 when he stopped former champion Danny Garcia in the ninth round.Below is the complete PPV fight card for Saturday night in San Antonio with the latest odds.\nCruz vs. Roach fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookLamont Roach Jr. -235 vs. Isaac Cruz (c) +180, interim WBC junior welterweight titleStephen Fulton -115 vs. O'Shaquie Foster (c) -110, WBC junior lightweight titleErislandy Lara (c) -700 vs. Johan Gonzalez +450, WBC middleweight titleJesus Ramos -1400 vs. Shane Mosley Jr. +700, junior middleweights\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The last time Texas Tech won an outright conference championship was in 1955. The Red Raiders were a member of the Border Conference, because the Southwest Conference refused to offer an invite. One year later, they begrudgingly let them in. The Red Raiders have long been an afterthought in major college football, scratching and clawing for every moment. In the 2000s, it was the revolutionary Air Raid offenses under Mike Leach. Then, the emergence of Patrick Mahomes presented a glimmer of hope. So when the opportunity to go all-in with a stacked transfer class came, Texas Tech sprung into action. They perfectly identified line talent and pitched for many of college football's best players to come to Lubbock. Critics complained that Texas Tech bought their roster. In the locker room? No one cared. \"If we are gonna buy a team, why not be the best?\" linebacker Jacob Rodriguez said. \nOn Saturday in front of a record crowd, it all came to fruition. No. 4 Texas Tech stunned No. 11 BYU 34-7 to capture its first Big 12 championship in program history. The Red Raiders scored 34 unanswered points, including 13 in the fourth quarter to clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Red Raiders' defense was dominant, forcing four turnovers, including two interceptions by linebacker Ben Roberts. Quarterback Behren Morton hit deep shots to Reggie Virgil and Coy Eakin as part of a balanced two-touchdown day and Texas Tech cruised to one of its best efforts of the season. BYU had a strong season, winning four of its last six games by an average of 19.3 points per game. In 10 FBS wins, the Cougars averaged 33.2 points per game. But against Texas Tech, BYU has had nothing. The Cougars combined for just 14 total points in the two matchups. But really, this is just who Texas Tech has been all year. Outside of a road trip with their backup quarterback against Arizona State, the Red Raiders have been untouchable. \n\"I've said it before, I think they're the best team in the country,\" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. \"And I'm confirming it, they're the best team in the country.\" Across the season, Texas Tech has outscored teams by an average of 34.2 points per game. They've hit another level over their past four, holding teams to 23 total points. They end the season ranking No. 1 in the Big 12 in total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. It will go down as one of the greatest seasons in Big 12 history. And fittingly, their big moment against BYU came with many of their homegrown stars leading the way. Eakin started his career as a walk-on, but caught two touchdowns in the stadium where he won a state title at Stephenville High School. Roberts was McGuire's first recruit at Texas Tech. West Texan quarterback Behren Morton waited five years to play on a championship-caliber team. \nThere was no good reason this story should take place in Lubbock, Texas, where championship dreams have gone to die. \"When [Joey McGuire] got hired four years ago, he told me, just trust me,\" Morton said. \"Stick with me. Let's build this culture, let's build the standard for Texas Tech. We all did. Romello [Height] trusted him, Brice Pollock trusted him. There was no selfishness.\" Texas Tech now awaits its place in the College Football Playoff. The win should clinch a first-round bye, and likely set up a second-round game with either No. 6 Ole Miss or No. 7 Texas A&M. If they're lucky, their quarterfinal game could take place in the Cotton Bowl at AT&T Stadium, the same place where they just won. \nBut in an era where conference championships are becoming secondary, no one in Lubbock is taking it for granted. Texas Tech won the Big 12. For the first time in generations, a major conference trophy is coming home to Lubbock. \"I've waited 20 years for this,\" linebacker John Curry said. \"I know a bunch of Red Raiders fans have been waiting forever, for their whole lives. The amount of texts I've gotten is just amazing. It's amazing to be part of the team that finally brings it back to Lubbock.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Best player, best résumé.That's what No. 4 Duke claims ownership of after its latest high-profile victory, a 66-60 win Saturday at No. 7 Michigan State.The Blue Devils may also be the best team ... but we've got a long way to go and a lot of competition at the top of the sport to determine that. As things stand now, Jon Scheyer's 10-0 Blue Devils are most certainly among the three or four best college basketball has to offer, particularly after Purdue's debatable grasp on No. 1 disappeared with its baffling home rout at the hands of No. 10 Iowa State. No. 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherever you want to slot Duke in terms of team prowess, I don't think there's an argument against Duke's case to have the best body of work through the first five weeks of the season. Arizona had that claim in mid-November (I wrote about it here) after winning at shorthanded UConn, and then Michigan held a rightful entitlement to it following its historic three-game romp through the Players Era Championship. (I covered that, too.) Now it's Duke's turn.If I were to build an NCAA Tournament bracket coming out of this weekend, the Blue Devils would be my No. 1 overall seed. (After Friday's CBS Sports Bracketology had the Blue Devils at No. 2 overall behind Michigan.)\nHalf of the Blue Devils' wins have come against power-conference competition. No other school can match that. Duke is 4-0 in Quad 1 games. No other team has a record that good; Michigan is the only 3-0 team in Quad 1 results. Here's a surprise: Saturday marked Duke's first win over a top-10 opponent on the road since February 2019, when Zion Williamson and Co. beat Virginia. (Hey, I was at that one.) Here are the five big Ws, four of which came against ranked competition. Numbers in parentheses are where the teams currently rank at KenPom.com:75-60 over Texas (55) in Charlotte on the opening night of the season78-66 over Kansas (18) in the Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden80-71 over Arkansas (30) in the Thanksgiving Classic at the United Center67-66 over Florida (12) on Tuesday at Cameron Indoor66-60 over Michigan State at Breslin Center on SaturdayNotice how four of Duke's five best wins have come away from home, and with the four most recent wins also transpiring against coaches with national championships to their name: Self, Calipari, Golden, Izzo. And the margin of victory in those five games? A fluffy 8.6 points.\nDuke also just won three consecutive games against ranked teams in the regular season for just the second time in program history. (February of 2016 being the other.)At BartTorvik.com, Duke has leapfrogged Michigan in Wins Above Bubble, a résumé metric that doesn't factor in predictive data and now also has a proxy that the selection committee uses. (Iowa State is now third in résumé strength following its historic takedown of Purdue.)What does it all mean? More than you might think. Duke will inevitably take losses this season, yes, but the fact it's gotten to 10-0 and still hasn't played a well-rounded game is an unnerving thought for the rest of the sport. Go look at the past five weeks worth of results around college hoops. We've seen Michigan at the near-peak of its powers, and I'd say the same case could be made for Gonzaga, Iowa State, Arizona, even Michigan State. But Duke (and I think UConn fits in this as well) is yet to put it all together. \nI'm not sure the team even really knows how to full-on win yet as much as it's adapted to learning how not to lose. After all, six of its top seven minutes-getters are freshmen and sophomores. And it's still this good right away? Hooooo, boy.It would have been entirely understandable for NPOY frontrunner Cameron Boozer and his teammates to simply come up short in the toughest environment they've seen this season. They trailed at the half, Breslin was boppin' and Michigan State looked well on the scent. Didn't happen. To date, it has yet to happen to this team that, despite its super-strong start and influential brand name, wasn't even ranked in the top five in the preseason. \nScheyer has been able to lose five NBA Draft picks and somehow pick up where Duke left off a season ago, when Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Blue Devils made the Final Four as a 35-4 team and ranked No. 1 at year's end at KenPom. If you think just bringing in elite prospects and/or prime transfer portal targets and paying them huge money equates to large-scale winning because you're at a blue blood, go ask Mark Pope how that's working out this season. Duke's proving it can win in a variety of ways, too. On Saturday, it needed to find its ugliest victory yet. Having Boozer on the team solves a lot of problems, but he can't do it alone. In fact, Boozer had the worst half of his young career vs. Sparty when he managed just two points. He picked up a third foul — a completely avoidable third foul, at that — early in the second half. At that point, it seemed like Michigan State was going to keep its undefeated season going. Then Boozer went beast mode again: 16 points and eight rebounds in the second half, finishing with 18 points, 15 boards, five assists and fouling out late in the second half. That fifth assist was the most crucial. When Duke needed a play to secure the win, the option was for Boozer to make it happened. Then he found himself mauled and double-teamed, so he passed to a wide-open Caleb Foster, whose 3 rolled in and clinched the game.\nMSU ran out of options down the stretch. For as brilliant of a distributor as Jeremy Fears Jr. has been this season (he leads the country in assists, now averaging more than 10 per game), he didn't make a field goal on Saturday (0-of-10). Tom Izzo is now a hapless 3-15 all time vs. the Blue Devils, and 1-10 in his last 11 games against top-five opponents. It's the one big bugaboo of his Hall of Fame career.And even with Michigan State playing its style of choice against such a huge team — slow-tempo ball, keeping the game in the 60s — Duke was comfortable in the fight for all 40 minutes. That's in part because, even though Michigan State was holding opponents to 60.4 points heading into Saturday, Duke was a tick better at 59.6. It was a second straight win with a battle into the final minute; Duke held off Florida at home on Tuesday with a big 3-pointer from Isiah Evans with 19.7 seconds remaining. Now Duke is 10-0 for the first time since starting 11-0 in 2017-18. And while Duke probably won't leap to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 — I'd expect Arizona or Michigan to take the top spot — it's going to have the strongest dossier for two weeks, minimum. The next game of note comes at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 22, a meetup with Texas Tech. \nBest team? We'll see. But no other squad has proven more against better competition literally from Game 1 until now than Duke. It's starting to make me wonder if, somehow, this team can actually match the historic dominance of last year's group. That team had games lost on last-second shots and botched plays. That's not happening here, which doubles as the best news for Duke. It's not only off to a terrific start, these Devils looks like they might have the one thing last year's elite team lacked: a closer's mentality.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of college football's great modern rivalries headlines the action on Saturday afternoon as No. 3 Georgia squares off against No. 9 Alabama in the 2025 SEC Championship Game. This will be the fifth time the Bulldogs and Crimson Tide have met in the SEC Championship Game (2012, 2018, 2021, 2023, 2025), and also the third time these two have played since the start of the 2024 season. Heading into the matchup, Alabama is 4-0 against Georgia in SEC Championship Games and 7-1 overall against the Bulldogs since Kirby Smart left Nick Saban's staff to take over as the new head coach in Athens.Kalen DeBoer has already notched two victories against Georgia in his short time as Alabama's coach, winning a 41-34 thriller last season in Tuscaloosa and then backing it up with a hot start in a 24-21 win in Athens back in September. Alabama won a 27-20 nail-biter in the Iron Bowl on Saturday to clinch its spot in the SEC Championship Game, emerging along with Georgia from a four-way tie for first place that also included Ole Miss and Texas A&M. The Bulldogs concluded their conference schedule with an emphatic 35-10 win against Texas back on Nov. 15, then closed the regular season with wins against Charlotte and Georgia Tech. You can bet Georgia vs. Alabama at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Getting this matchup for the third time in five seasons does not lessen the passion at play between two proud programs who still value holding the crown in one of college football's toughest conferences. Let's get into some of the things to know about this top-10 bout and what to expect on Saturday in Atlanta.  \nFollow along Saturday with live updates, highlights and analysis as Alabama and Georgia clash in the 2025 SEC Championship Game. Where to watch Alabama vs. Georgia liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Georgia: Need to knowComeback kings: Georgia trailed in seven of its eight SEC games this season yet finished with a 7-1 record thanks to clutch play and great second-half adjustments. The Bulldogs were down on the road in wins at Tennessee and Auburn, and threw haymakers back and forth with Ole Miss in a 43-35 win in Athens. Even the one SEC loss this season, against Alabama in September, included a second-half shutout by the Georgia defense and multiple possessions where the Bulldogs had a chance to tie or take the lead. The only SEC game where Georgia went wire-to-wire was a 35-14 home win against Kentucky. \nKalen DeBoer shines against the best: Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer is 19-4 in 23 games against AP Top 25 teams as a head coach, including a 6-1 record against top-10 opponents. Since arriving at Alabama, DeBoer is 7-1 against top 25 teams with the lone loss being the 23-21 defeat against Oklahoma on Nov. 8. At one point during his tenures at Fresno State and Washington, DeBoer had a 12-game winning streak against ranked opponents that only came to an end in the national championship game against Michigan. New starters have succeeded at QB: Alabama and Georgia both started 2025 with new full-time starters at quarterback, and since both have arrived here in the SEC Championship Game with top-10 rankings and national title aspirations it's fair to say both campaigns have been a success. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the SEC with 25 touchdowns and just four interceptions, while also ranking third in the conference with 3,056 passing yards on the season. Gunner Stockton has been effective for Georgia as well, though in different ways. Heading into the SEC Championship Game, Stockton ranks second only to Diego Pavia in the SEC for completion percentage (70.2%) and has racked up 28 total touchdowns (20 passing, eight rushing) on the season.  Alabama vs. Georgia prediction, picks  \nAlabama's offensive form has taken a step back since mid-October, with the Crimson Tide failing to score 30 points in their last four games against FBS opponents. That lack of rhythm could make it tougher for the hot start that Kalen DeBoer has been able to defend in both of his wins against Georgia, and thus create a different matchup when Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs ultimately make their adjustment. Pick: Georgia -2.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        No. 11 BYU's already scant College Football Playoff hopes likely disintegrated entirely with Saturday afternoon's 34-7 loss to No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. That result dropped the Cougars, who were on the playoff bubble entering this weekend's title game slate, to a respectable 11-2 on the year. Both of those defeats came against the Red Raiders. BYU failed to look competitive in either result, as the Cougars were outscored 63-14 in their two games against Texas Tech. With plenty of firsthand experience to draw upon, BYU coach Kalani Sitake referred to Texas Tech as the \"best team in the country\" multiple times while addressing reporters after his team got dressed down. Sitake wasn't entirely optimistic about the Cougars' CFP chances moving forward, but he still called for a fair selection process from the committee. \"They're (Texas Tech) the No. 1 team in the country,\" Sitake said. \"I don't know what the other rankings are. This team is really good. So you go play the No. 1 team in the country twice, one in Lubbock and then one at a neutral site which is the same state (Texas). I thought our fans showed up and made a lot of noise. I would love another crack at it... I like who we are and I like what we've been able to do. I think we have a great résumé. But I've got to watch the other games too.\n\"I just know that when they're doing comparisons, hopefully they put it out there and make it fair. At least put us in the graphic. That would be nice.\"        Sitake's last sentence was a not-so-veiled shot at coverage of the College Football Playoff. A graphic was shown comparing teams nine through 12 in the latest CFP Rankings reveal show. No. 11 BYU was excluded, as all the focus went to No. 9 Alabama, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 12 Miami. At least Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire is on BYU's side after his squad likely secured a top-four seed and first-round bye. \n\"Whenever the selection committee starts looking at teams, I truly the Big 12 deserves two teams in the playoffs,\" McGuire said. \"Whenever you look at BYU, they're 11-2 and their two losses are to the No. 4 team in the nation. I have so much respect for Kalani. That's a really good football team and I hope the committee looks at it. Cause there's gonna be two loss teams out there, but there's not going to be an 11-2 loss team. They did a great job throughout the season getting here.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Saturday's roundup just below. Phillies among teams interested in Bellinger\nOutfielder Cody Bellinger's renaissance as a frontline talent is now three years deep, and going into his age-30 campaign in 2026 he can once again expect a healthy market for his services. Speaking of which, Jeff Passan reports that the Phillies are among the teams interested in Bellinger. The incumbent Yankees remain the most likely destination for Bellinger, and the Mets also maintain some level of interest. From the Philly standpoint, their Bellinger interest probably hinges on what becomes of free agent slugger Kyle Schwarber. If Schwarber inks elsewhere this winter, then the Phillies could pivot to Bellinger to fill that lineup hole, assuming he outlasts Schwarber on the free agent market. Red Sox eyeing Bichette as Bregman fallback? \nThe Red Sox's offseason priority now that the rotation has been fortified is bringing back third baseman Alex Bregman. Bregman in 2025 was an essential part of Boston's return to the postseason, but he's now on the market after opting out. If Bregman lands elsewhere, might the Sox turn to Bo Bichette? The Athletic reports that some within the organization see Bichette as a strong \"alternative\" to Bregman and would angle to move him to second base. Bichette has spent his entire career with the Blue Jays, and they remain the favorites to retain his services this offseason. However, they could have some competition from their division rivals in Boston. Mariners, Nationals make tradeThe Mariners have acquired lefty reliever Jose A. Ferrer from the Nationals for catcher Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon, according to the Washington Post.\nFerrer, 25, is a three-pitch lefty (sinker, changeup, slider) who has compiled a 4.36 ERA (95 ERA+) and a 3.46 strikeout-to-walk ratio in nearly 150 big-league appearances. He does have some positive underlying traits that suggest better days await, including top-notch arm strength; a great feel for the strike zone; and an undeniable ability to generate a ton of ground balls. \nFord, 22, is a former top-100 prospect who didn't have a clear pathway to steady playing time behind Cal Raleigh. He hit .283/.408/.460 with 16 home runs and seven stolen bases in Triple-A. He could take over everyday catching duties from Keibert Ruiz, who remains under contract through 2030 despite having suffered through consecutive down seasons. Cubs pursuing GallenThe Cubs are looking to bolster their rotation with veteran right-hander and free agent Zac Gallen, the Athletic reports. Gallen, 30, is coming off a 2025 season in which he didn't live up to his established standards: \nGallen on three occasions has placed in the top 10 of the National League Cy Young vote and because of that impressive larger body of work, he found a multi-year market this winter. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Gallen as the No. 18 available free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \"Gallen salvaged what he could with a good 11-start closing stretch, but an otherwise miserable walk year makes him feel like a strong candidate to accept the qualifying offer (if one is tendered) and try again in 2026. Otherwise? He's a candidate to sign a one-year deal elsewhere and modify his arsenal in an attempt to push back against a trend that has seen his performance slip in each of the past two years.\"For his career, Gallen has pitched to a 119 ERA+ and an FIP of 3.65 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Over that span, he's compiled a WAR of 20.7, and he's topped 30 starts and 180 innings in three of the last four seasons. Gallen spent the last six seasons and change with the Diamondbacks.Castellanos willing to play first baseTrade speculation continues to swirl about veteran Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos. He's in decline at the plate going into his age-34 season, and he's owed $20 million for 2027. In other words, there's no real market for his services. Even so, Castellanos recently said he's willing to learn and play first base in the event of a trade to a team that needs that role filled. That, though, doesn't address his declining offensive abilities. \n            ",

On Saturday, the two sides announced that The Ultimate Fighter and Dana White's Contender Series will both stream on Paramount+ beginning in 2026.In August, it was announced that Paramount had struck a media rights deal to be the streaming home of UFC events with a historic seven-year partnership. The first event of that partnership is UFC 324 on Jan. 24, which is headlined by Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett battling for the interim lightweight championship.Dana White's Contender Series has become a staple of UFC programming, featuring a series of bouts between fighters not currently signed to UFC contracts. Those who impress enough in their opportunities are signed to UFC deals. The show has become the primary pipeline for talent to end up plying their trade in the Octagon.Several fighters have made good on the opportunity provided by their involvement in the show, including Jamahal Hill, Sean O'Malley and Jack Della Maddalena, who have all held UFC gold.\nThe Ultimate Fighter is commonly viewed as the show that saved the UFC. The reality series debuted in 2005, and the first season culminated in an iconic fight between Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin to crown the season's winner. That fight was a massive success and resulted in increased popularity for UFC and an expansion of the promotion's television presence.In the 20 years since the show's premiere, The Ultimate Fighter has produced more than 10 UFC champions and many high-level fighters.\nParamount+ will become the exclusive home for all episodes of both series in the U.S., Latin America and Australia.\n            \n    ",

He's shown off a solid kickboxing game, a lethal squeeze on his chokeholds and great durability and determination. Duncan fights with a hard-nosed style and refuses to be denied even when the fight isn't going his way. McKinney is an explosive finisher who is always dangerous. In his 17-7 pro career, McKinney's fights have gone past the first round just twice. He has never fought to a decision and has been finished in all of his losses. McKinney's flying knees and rear-naked chokes could put Duncan in danger, but I believe Duncan's mentality and physicality will give him the edge. If Duncan lands a heavy counterpunch in traffic, McKinney might not stand back up.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2 picksVithlani has strong picks for Dvalishvili vs. Yan and other bouts on the UFC 323 card.

But there is still plenty at stake, including possibly the Heisman Trophy race, as college football's two best teams finally face off this season.  You can bet Indiana vs. Ohio State at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Ohio State, last year's national champion, comes to Indy with the nation's most-efficient passer (Julian Sayin), the best pair of receivers in the country (Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate) and a ferocious defense led by linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs. The Buckeyes have rarely been tested this season, but have looked every bit of the nation's top team so far.  \nIndiana, last year's surprise team, proved this season it was no one-season fluke. Cal transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza has been terrific as one of the nation's best QBs. The Hoosiers' defense, orchestrated by defensive coordinator Bryant Haines, ranks top 3 in scoring defense, rushing defense and total defense. This is an even better and more well-rounded Indiana team than the one that went to the College Football Playoff a year ago.  You'll want to stay up late Saturday night in what could be a preview of an eventual national championship matchup.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Indiana liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium -- Indianapolis, Indiana TV: Fox | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\n\n        \n            \n                College football schedule, games 2025: What to watch in Week 15, TV channels, Saturday kickoff times\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n Ohio State vs. Indiana: Need to know Heisman stakes: Headed into the final weekend, Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is tied with Vanderbilt QB Diego Pavia for the best Heisman odds while Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin is just behind at No. 3. With Pavia idle this championship weekend, the winning quarterback of the Big Ten championship will have a terrific opportunity to deliver a \"Heisman moment\" at a crucial time. Sayin and Mendoza both have great cases in what has been a wide-open Heisman race all season.  In Sayin's first year as the Buckeyes starter, he leads the nation in completion percentage (78.9), has thrown for 3,065 yards, 30 touchdowns and only six interceptions. Mendoza has been similarly impressive with 2,758 yards, 32 touchdowns and five interceptions. Watching these two guys go to work against top-flight defenses will be very fun to watch.  Longest winning streaks: The two teams with the longest regular-season winning streaks will meet in Indianapolis. Indiana won its last 13 regular-season games while Ohio State now has 12 consecutive wins after finally getting one over Michigan in its regular-season finale. When you add in postseason games (and the Buckeyes' title run last year), Ohio State has a nation's best 16 consecutive wins while Indiana checks in at No. 2 at 12 games. One other final stat for you: Ohio State, a 4.5-point favorite over the Hoosiers, has an impressive 10-1-1 record against the spread this season.  \nCFP implications: Neither Ohio State nor Indiana has to worry about missing the playoff no matter what happens in Indianapolis. The winner of this game will be locked into the No. 1 overall CFP seed and guaranteed a first-round bye. The bigger question would be whether the loser could fall out of the first-round bye territory of the top four seeds. Some of that will be dependent on what happens in the game, of course, and what the final margin ends up being. Assuming it's a relatively close game, however, the odds are that either Ohio State or Indiana would still be in terrific position to keep a bye. It's extremely unlikely, for instance, that No. 5 Oregon would jump either of these two teams, especially Indiana which has a head-to-head win over the Ducks in Eugene.  Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis as the Buckeyes and Hoosiers square off for the Big Ten Championship.  Ohio State vs. Indiana prediction, picks \nThe nation's two best teams finally meet on the field with a Big Ten Championship at stake. It's strength on strength here as Ohio State and Indiana both have explosive offenses and game-wrecking defenses. Both teams have been cruising and this will easily be each's toughest game so far. Will Heisman frontrunners Julian Sayin and Fernando Mendoza go to town? Or will the nation's top two defenses make this a low-scoring affair with neither able to get comfortable? It wouldn't be a surprise at all to see points being hard to come by early in this game, but ultimately I think it ends up being a bit more high-scoring than either defensive coordinator would prefer. Pick: Over 47.5 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

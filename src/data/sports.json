    "body": "\n        The new year has brought yet another managerial casualty as Xabi Alonso is out as Real Madrid manager after only seven months in charge. This has been an up-and-down season for Los Blancos, marked with a loss to Barcelona in the Supercopa de España over the weekend, so it seems Florentino Perez wanted to make a change sooner rather than later. Considering it took eight minutes between Madrid's statement of Alonso's departure and their statement on Alvaro Arbeloa taking over as manager, it's clear that this is something that was in the works before the Clasico defeat, but that loss was the final nail in the coffin. Where'd it all go wrong for Alonso? He was the hottest coaching prospect in soccer and entered Real Madrid at the top of the managerial world and now departs with Los Blancos on track to make the top eight of the Champions League league phase and within striking distance of Barcelona for the league title, but none of that mattered.Alonso isn't long removed from ending Bayern Munich's reign of dominance in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen during the 2023-24 season, and while he fell just short of an invincible season, losing in the Europa League final, he has shown that his teams can be among the best in the global game. Despite this dismissal, he'll still be one of the names on the managerial market but still, it's hard to understand how it all came unraveled so quickly.June and July: Overcoming early Club World Cup strugglesTaking over, Alonso had the ability to ease into the job in some ways due to Los Blancos taking part in the Club World Cup instead of a standard preseason. While he had to spend time during the tournament without Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellignham, it was a good chance to get an extended look at  players like Arda Guler and Gonzalo Garcia, all of whom were relied upon in the early parts of the season for Madrid. New defenders such as Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnonld were also able to get a look in, and while the tournament ended in disappointment, getting knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain, it seemed like the groundwork was being laid for a turnaround under Alonso. After failing to secure a trophy last campaign, expectations were high for Alonso at Real Madrid, but following increased spending, he seemed set to meet them.September: A Madrid derby that changed everythingComing into the season, it seemed like more of the same, where despite struggling, Madrid were pulling out results despite getting red cards, but it all fell apart at the worst time possible. After a perfect opening six games, Alonso's first loss at Madrid was a 5-2 embarrassment at the hands of Atletico Madrid. It was a match where they were thoroughly dominated, conceding a penalty and allowing 13 shots for a 2.31 xG and Alonso's defense went up in flames away from home. This would end up being a match that foreshadowed struggles that would be to come as in November, Real Madrid started dropping points to teams below them in the table with draws coming at the hands of Girona, Elche, and Rayo Vallecano, while Barcelona marched ahead in the table. During those matches, despite the Madrid attack putting up 20+ shots per game, they weren't finding the back of the net. \nOctober: Clasico changes everything, as Vini Jr. shows frustrationEl Clásico in October marked a turning point. Xabi Alonso's team won 2-1 while having their lowest possession of the season at only 31.7%. Before that point Real Madrid were dominating games, holding close to 60% possession and won 12 games, only losing one while scoring 30 goals and allowing 11 in 12 matches. After that match the script flipped. Real Madrid's possession number has dropped to around 57% and in 12 matches played, they've won six, lost three, and drawn three between LaLiga and Champions League. They've allowed opponents to pass around their defensive third with ease, leading to more shots than Thibaut Courtois can keep out of his net. That Clásico in October was also when Vinicius Junior showed public frustrated at Alonso as he was subbed out of the match and made his feelings known. Alonso's predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti, was known as a player's manager at Real Madrid during his time there, and that was something Alonso would have to deal with while trying to instill his own standards at the club. Except that doesn't work at a club where the most powerful man there is the president, Florentino Perez, not the manager.  Real Madrid's commercial and on field success has been driven by Perez's leadership, and nothing was going to get in the way of that, not even a former player at manager. Perez seemed to take Vini Jr's side after that public spat, which is a moment that, in retrospect, seems like the beginning of the end. \nJanuary: Alonso leaves Real MadridNow fast forward, and with Alosno out, Madrid has now gotten someone in who will presumably run the club the way that Perez sees fit. An upcoming schedule that will see Madrid avoid most of the top teams in the world through March will give Arbeloa time to find his footing, but Alonso will also be one of the hottest names on managerial lists across top clubs in Europe. Going back to a club that allows him to do what he does best in instilling a winning culture is something that should lead to success because Madrid doesn't operate like most clubs in the world. The manager position at the Santago Bernebau is  unique, but as long as Perez is in power, that will continue to be the case and whoever takes the helm will either run things the Madrid way, or end up gone before you blink. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mark Cuban is striking while the iron's hot, donating a piece of his empire to Indiana football in hopes on ensuring another quality season in 2026. The Indiana alumnus envisioned greatness under Curt Cignetti when he previously gave to the program, but nothing like this as the unbeaten and top-ranked Hoosiers enter next Monday night's College Football Playoff National Championship against Miami.Indiana's wealthiest NIL donor, Cuban increased his giving during Cignetti's second season knowing the leader of the program's process has worked. When there's mention of return on investment, this is it.\"They earned it,\" Cuban said on Sideline Stories. \"The first time it was like, OK, let's see what happens … the second time, we know it works. I talked to them about different players and what their strategy was. The previous year, it all made sense and I wanted to be part of it.\"\n        \n            \n                Indiana flirting with all-time great status as Hoosiers plow through Oregon, into CFP National Championship\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Cuban didn't reveal how much money he gave toward Indiana's NIL efforts, he did say it would be enough to buy Kilroy's on Kirkwood, a popular off-campus bar in Bloomington.\n\"Everybody talks about we don't have any five-stars, but where that's important is when they ask me for money, it was like I'm not going to give you money just so you can bid the highest for everybody,\" Cuban said. \"It's like the NBA salary cap. You've got to be able to fit in slots and find the guys who know their roles. That's where [Cignetti]'s been a stud. In basketball, you've got to know your role. Not everybody can be the star. \"Something that Fernando Mendoza said about him being recruited really stood out. He said when he talked about Coach Cig about winning the Heisman, he said quarterbacks don't win Heismans, teams win Heismans. If you don't have the offensive line, the receivers, the system … you're not going to get it done.\"Cuban's 2026 donation is going toward funding a group ranked No. 10 nationally in the transfer portal and includes the additions of quarterback Josh Hoover, receiver Nick Marsh and edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi.\nThe billionaire and minority owner in the Dallas Mavericks is expected to be in attendance for the national championship game after watching the semifinal victory over Oregon from the sideline in Atlanta. Cuban used his personal account and social media reach of more than 8.5 million followers to ask about CFP title game ticket prices -- as if he needs to worry about the base price of a \"get-in\" ticket.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This week provides us with one of the more lopsided schedules all season, even featuring a rare five-game week for the Lakers. Four teams will only go around twice, those being the Pistons, Grizzlies, Bucks, and Magic. That leaves 12 teams with four games and 13 teams with three games.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Five Games: LALFour Games: BKN, CHA, CHI, DAL, DEN, HOU, IND, NOP, POR, SAC, TOR, UTAThree Games: ATL, BOS, CLE, GSW, LAC, MIA, MIN, NYK, OKC, PHI, PHO, SAS, WASTwo Games: DET, MEM, MIL, ORL, Here are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the thirteenth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.GuardsConsider starting: Marcus Smart, LALOpponents: @SAC, ATL, CHA, @POR, TORAlthough Smart's per-game numbers haven't taken the world by storm, he has quietly carved out a consistent starting role over the past few weeks. As we have come to expect from Smart, his overall fantasy value is limited to just a couple of categories, those being steals and assists. In six games over the past two weeks, he has averaged 1.7 steals and 3.7 assists in 31.9 minutes per game. With five games tabled for the next seven days, Smart's streaming appeal could eventuate into a starter-level player. If assists and steals are on the agenda for your team, Smart could hypothetically deliver up to 10 steals and 20 assists.\nConsider starting: TJ McConnell, INDOpponents: BOS, TOR, NOP, @DETMuch like Smart, McConnell's value is tied up in assists and steals. However, he has stepped up on the offensive end in recent times, scoring double digits in four of the past five games, including a 23-point explosion in a win over the Hornets. Unlike Smart, McConnell's role is a little more temperamental, typically playing minutes in the high-teens. His floor is relatively safe at this point, even more so if Andrew Nembhard continues to deal with injuries. Consider getting McConnell into your starting lineup, again, if you are looking for assists and steals.Consider sitting: Miles McBride, NYKOpponents: @SAC, @GSW, PHOMcBride has been able to put together a nice stretch of production over the past two weeks, largely since Josh Hart has been sidelined with an ankle injury. In seven games during that time, McBride has been a top 50 player in standard leagues, averaging 16.6 points, 1.1 steals, and 3.7 3-pointers. However, Hart returned to action Sunday, cutting into McBride's playing time. While he is probably worth holding, at least for another few games, holding him on your bench might be a safer option, especially with only three games coming up.ForwardsConsider starting: Jake LaRavia, LALOpponents: @SAC, ATL, CHA, @POR, TORLaRavia, like Smart, has also been starting for the Lakers, assuming that role for the past six games. In that time, he has averaged 15 points, 5.3 rebounds, two steals, and 2.5 3-pointers, flirting with top-30 value in standard leagues. The return of Rui Hachimura will have some sort of an impact, although it remains to be seen whether LaRavia will remain in the starting lineup. If we're being honest, there is certainly a case to be made for LaRavia being a better option than Hachimura, although that is neither here nor there. With five games coming up, even if LaRavia shifts to the bench, he should be able to do enough across the board to hold value in 12-team leagues.\nConsider sitting: Bobby Portis, MILOpponents: MIN, @SASAfter a brief run of relevance, Portis has seen his overall production scale back in recent times. In three games last week, Portis averaged just 8.5 points and nine rebounds, leaving him outside the top 200 in standard leagues. His playing time continues to fluctuate on a nightly basis, meaning he could play anywhere from 16 to 30 minutes on any given night. His value is reliant on points and rebounds, and honestly, even his points production is serviceable, at best. This one is quite simple. Two games of Portis are not enticing enough to have him in your starting lineup.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: PHO, INDAlthough Thompson has stepped things up on the defensive end of the floor, his role continues to be a source of frustration for managers. Injuries to other players have helped over the past week, with Thompson putting up top 70 value in three games during that period, averaging nine points, six rebounds, 3.3 assists, and four combined steals and blocks. However, relying on the absence of others, especially when the Pistons only have two games, feels like a risky game to play. Unless you are simply looking for steals and blocks, Thompson should be just fine spending another week on your bench.CentersConsider starting: Jalen Smith, CHIOpponents: @HOU, UTA, @BKN, BKNAlthough Smith was far from outstanding in his return from a concussion, the writing is potentially on the wall, in a good way, when it comes to his role. Prior to his absence, Smith had started in three straight games alongside Nikola Vucevic, averaging 11.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and three combined steals and blocks. During his hiatus, the Bulls were dreadful, losing three straight games in convincing fashion. Assuming you can absorb some risk, quietly sliding Smith into your starting lineup this week could be a stroke of genius.\nConsider sitting: Myles Turner, MILOpponents: MIN, @SASTurner continues to be arguably the most disappointing player this season, struggling on both ends of the floor. No matter how you look at his numbers, there is certainly no way to sugar-coat it. In 13 games over the past month, he is barely a top 150 player in standard leagues, averaging 12.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 2.2 3-pointers. He remains a soft hold, simply because of his proven upside. However, moving him to your bench this week is a no-brainer.\n            ",

School athletic director Brandon Martin said the search for Menzies' replacement will \"commence immediately,\" even while Menzies coaches out the rest of this season. Kansas City is 4-14 and a member of the Summit League. Kansas City (which previously went by UMKC)  turned some heads when Billy Donlon was fired in 2021-22 after a 19-12 season. The Roos haven't been as good since.  \nMenzies — who previously had success at New Mexico State, where he took that program to five NCAA Tournaments in the 2010s — is 44-71 with Kansas City. The job is among the tougher ones among all mid-majors in the Midwest. The Roos are 1-3 in the Summit League and are 337th at KenPom.com. It's pacing to be the worst season in school history.It is uncommon for a school to announce a firing this early, but these kinds of decisions often are made privately well before they're announced publicly. Now Kansas City has a head start (at least outwardly) on the dozens of other mid-majors that will inevitably open in February and March.\nThe coaching carousel isn't expected to be as volatile in 2026 as it was in 2025, when there were 56 changes, but there won't be a clearer picture on the landscape until we get to March.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe final 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend contest features the Pittsburgh Steelers (+3, 38.5) hosting the Houston Texans on 'Monday Night Football.' Many will center their NFL DFS strategy around Texans like CJ Stroud and Nico Collins, as well as Steelers such as Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf. However, the running games shouldn't be overlooked with MNF DFS picks. Both teams use multiple backs, so one may find value with the likes of Jaylen Warren and Nick Chubb.Warren's averaging over 100 scrimmage yards over his last three games, while Chubb has a long history of success versus Pittsburgh.

The two-time Pro Bowler has both a high Fantasy floor and a high ceiling. He has at least 57 yards in nine straight games, with four touchdowns and three 100-yard games over this stretch. He ranks eighth in NFL with 74.5 receiving yards per game, and Pittsburgh has been shredded through the air.

    "body": "\n        When Alex Bregman signed with the Red Sox at the start of spring training last season, it was widely viewed as a signal that Boston was serious about contending again. Having Bregman and Rafael Devers in the heart of the order would immediately make the pairing one of the best lineup punches in baseball. Additionally, the club traded for -- and extended -- left-hander Garrett Crochet, giving the Sox one of the best starters in the game. Optimism was on the horizon. Then, tension surfaced. Devers was unhappy with a shift to designated hitter to make room for Bregman, a stronger defender at third base. Ultimately, Devers was shockingly traded in mid-June. What was left of his $300-million contract was now off the books. The Red Sox still made the playoffs, with Bregman -- though he missed some time with injury -- as their leader and anchor. Despite a Wild Card loss to the Yankees, the superior opponent, the future looked bright at Fenway. There was hope that Bregman, who opted out of his three-year $120 million contract, would be back. The seamless fit in Boston was too obvious to ignore.During the day on Saturday, the Red Sox held Fenway Fest, an event meant to mark the countdown to the season. That evening, Bregman delivered a massive blow to the enthusiasm surrounding the club, signing with the Cubs on a five-year, $175 million deal with $70 million deferred. The Sox, meanwhile, came in at five years, $165 million, with deferrals spread over a longer period.\"I thought it was close,\" one league executive said. \"Five years over $160 million had to be close. Turns out it was close and the players took the most money. That's how this works.\" \nStill, this has become an all too familiar reality for the Red Sox and their fan base, failing to finish the job with a coveted free agent. They have made a habit of finishing second, with much of the blame directed at owner John Henry, who over the last half decade has been widely viewed as prioritizing cost savings over winning.This offseason alone, they lost out on the Pete Alonso sweepstakes to the Orioles, who signed the slugger to a five-year, $155 million deal -- a figure the Sox never came close to matching. And while Kyle Schwarber was widely expected to remain in Philadelphia (and did sign a $150 million deal with the Phillies), the Red Sox offered little that would have been enough to pique his interest even if the door had cracked open.\nThe Devers trade, which also served as a salary dump, was expected to make way for Bregman and his voice. An infectious one that helped guide Roman Anthony through his rookie season, and also helped Carlos Narvaez become a fixture on a big-league roster. Now, the Sox must turn the page once again. Not only without Devers, but also without his replacement that was expected to help Boston reclaim its old heights. So, where do the Sox go from here? The Red Sox have kept an eye on Bo Bichette since the end of his Toronto Blue Jays World Series run, but a deal, as it stands, remains unlikely. \nOne source said Bichette's asking price is believed to be in the $300 million range, a figure the Red Sox -- and the league -- view as an overpay. There are also questions about Bichette's long-term defensive fit, with some evaluators projecting him more as a second baseman than a shortstop, where he has struggled throughout his career.Durability is another concern. Bichette has had trouble staying on the field in recent seasons, prompting internal questions about how he will age despite entering his age-28 season.However, as his free agency drags on with spring training approaching, Bichette's number could come down, which might reengage the Red Sox.\nAs currently constructed, the Sox could open the season with Marcelo Mayer at third base and a platoon of Romy Gonzalez and David Hamilton at second. The club understands that won't be enough and is expected to explore creative alternatives.For what it's worth, the Red Sox have prepared for a possible Bregman exodus dating back to the end of last season. The club has been careful not to disrupt its young core and has discussed concepts such as prioritizing an infielder who leans more toward defense, contact and plate discipline.A name like Cubs third baseman Nico Hoerner, who could be on the trade block after the Bregman signing, fits that bill. \nIn fairness, the Red Sox have made some improvements via trade this winter, adding first baseman Willson Contreras and starter Sonny Gray.Yet they are the only team in baseball that hasn't signed a single major-league free agent this winter, making fans, again, question just how serious they are about winning. \"I think we came into the offseason with a few specific things that we wanted to do,\" Breslow said Saturday at Fenway Fest before the Bregman news broke. \"We wanted to add some pop to the lineup. We wanted to add to the starting rotation, at the front of a rotation. We feel like we've done those things, but also recognize that there's still an offseason ahead of us.\" \nThe clock is ticking.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas (No. 4, 18-1) coach Vic Schaefer was frustrated with his team after their undefeated start to the season came to an end Sunday with a 70-65 loss to LSU (No. 6, 16-2), but he was far more upset with the SEC. In a lengthy postgame screed, he accused the conference of having a \"vendetta\" against his program. Schaefer, who was particularly upset about Texas having to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road, said the schedule \"really has a stench to it\" and also criticized his athletic department for not making more of the issue. Here are Schaefer's full comments, which came in response to a question about navigating the SEC:\"Two weeks ago this team that we just played was No. 5 in the country, and it's a bear. They obviously have a vendetta against Texas, because not only have we started in the league, and I get to play South Carolina twice last year, this year I get LSU twice. Of 16 games -- there's 16 games this year -- I have to play South Carolina on the road this year, as well as LSU, I get 'em back-to-back in the same week. Make that make sense. The league is hard enough as it is, but then to bless me and my group with that, it really has a stench to it. The common denominator is LSU and South Carolina both played Georgia before they played me, and South Carolina was at home today. \"I'm disappointed. I said that yesterday, I said it to TV. I'm really disappointed in the league for putting our kids in that position. But we play whoever's in front of us. And the answer to your question is you're right, it's a bear. It's one monster after another. It's what AAA baseball is to the Major Leagues. That's how I look at it. You have hall of fame coaches, you have future WNBA players, so it's hard. But that's what we all sign up for. That's what I signed up for. I obviously came from Mississippi State, so I was pretty used to the league and understood what it was. When you go to Texas you're not only signing up for the SEC, but you got Texas on your chest and everybody wants a piece of you. \"It is what it is, but there's some things that bother me in regards to the schedule. But they don't call me and ask me about it. I just get it. Unless somebody from my university stands up and says, 'Hey, what in the hell is going on here?' Nobody does anything. And that's my frustration. It's been on my radar since [SEC] Spring Meetings, when the schedule came out. I saw it, and I waited for people that I thought should have stood up and said something. Nothing was said. I mean, we got people in the conference office that are just in charge of women's basketball. \"You want to tell me that anybody else in our league gets both these teams back-to-back on the road? Cause they were both preseason No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. Both of them. They're preseason No. 3 -- 1, 2 or 3. But nobody did. I saw it, but I was hoping that somebody would, but it didn't get done, so this is what we've got. Like I told our kids all the time, it's us against the world a lot of times, and we have to embrace that.\"First of all, Schaefer's claim that no other SEC team has to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road this season is incorrect. Missouri will do so in February when they play in Baton Rouge on Feb. 22 and in Columbia on Feb. 26. That's the exact same trip in the exact amount of time. Does the SEC have a \"vendetta\" against Missouri, who also had to play at Kentucky and at Vanderbilt in the span of five days earlier this month? Ole Miss also has to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back this season in the span of four days, and while they do get the Tigers at home on Feb. 19, they then have to travel to Columbia to play the Gamecocks on Feb. 22. That trip is brutal. Just ask Georgia, who had to play LSU at home on Jan. 8 before playing South Carolina on the road on Jan. 11 and lost both games by more than 20 points. Oklahoma, meanwhile, will have LSU and South Carolina back-to-back with both games at home on Jan. 18 and Jan. 22. Including Texas, five out of the 14 other SEC teams (35.7%) have to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back in some way this season, which hardly suggests a conspiracy against the Longhorns. \n        \n            \n                Women's college basketball rankings: UConn is unanimous No. 1, Texas falls to No. 4 after loss to LSU\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBesides, every draw is tough in a conference with nine teams ranked in the Top 25 and five of the top-seven teams: No. 2 South Carolina, No. 4 Texas, No. 5 Vanderbilt, No. 6 LSU, No. 7 Kentucky, No. 13 Oklahoma, No. 16 Ole Miss, No. 20 Tennessee and No. 21 Alabama. Even the unranked teams are competitive. There is not a single team in the SEC with a losing record overall.  Looking only at road back-to-backs, here are some of the other trips teams have to make this season:\nVanderbiltat No. 2 South Carolina (Jan. 25) and at No. 16 Ole Miss (Jan. 29)Tennesseeat No. 13 Oklahoma (Feb. 22) and at No. 6 LSU (Feb. 26)Oklahoma\nat No. 4 Texas (Feb. 1) and at No. 5 Vanderbilt (Feb. 9)As Schaefer correctly pointed out, the SEC is \"a bear\" with \"one monster after another.\" Some teams might have a slightly more forgiving path, but there are no easy roads in the best conference in the country. Schaefer might be upset right now about having to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road, but if his team is on another deep NCAA Tournament run come March, don't be surprised if he credits that gauntlet for helping his team get there. \n            ",

But his first playoff game came to a premature end when he sustained a head injury, and coach Mike Vrabel said that Gonzalez is in concussion protocol ahead of a divisional round matchup against the winner of Monday night's meeting between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.Gonzalez exited the game after hitting his head on the turf while in coverage against Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston. The Patriots initially ruled him questionable to return, but later downgraded him to out after he went into the locker room for evaluation.\"Gonzo continues to play at a high level,\" Vrabel said in Monday's media availability. \"Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don't know. But when you don't return to the game, when they won't let you go back in the game, that would put him in the protocol. So wherever that goes, that goes. But we appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up in different places. … He's handled that all really well, and hopefully we'll get him back.\"\n        \n            \n                Patriots suddenly dominant defense becomes the biggest wild card of the NFL playoffs\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGonzalez told reporters in the locker room after Sunday's win that he was not allowed to speak with the media, but he also said in that interaction that he was \"fine.\" His availability for the next round of the postseason will be among the most impactful storylines to follow on the New England side as he has been one of the NFL's best pass defenders since his arrival in the league in 2023.\n\"I did talk to him,\" Vrabel said in his weekly WEEI radio appearance. \"We'll go through whatever the steps are that would require him to pass through whatever he needs to do. Without having seen him today -- I can't sit here and speculate -- I just know that they wouldn't let him go back into the game.\"While he remains in search of his first interception of the year, Gonzalez is in the midst of a fantastic campaign with 12 pass breakups (including playoffs) and a career-high 69 tackles. He earned his first Pro Bowl selection on the heels of a 2024 season in which he landed on the All-Pro second team.\nInjuries have, unfortunately, cropped up in each of Gonzalez's first three professional seasons. He suffered a torn labrum in Week 4 of his rookie year and missed the final 13 games, sat one game the following year with a concussion and missed the first three contests of the present campaign with a hamstring injury he sustained in training camp.\n            \n    ",

The South Bend Tribune published a story Sunday detailing a police report from New Prairie High School's wrestling coach stemming from an incident that allegedly occurred on Jan. 3, at Mishawaka High School.New Prairie high school wrestling assistant coach, Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of assault in a police report after both were in attendance at the Al Smith Wrestling Invitational. Notre Dame released a statement Sunday saying Freeman had no physical contact with Fleeger.Mishawaka police investigated the accusation and reportedly submitted their report to the prosecutor's office. \n\"Vinny Freeman, head coach Marcus Freeman's son, was verbally accosted during and after his wrestling match by a local wrestling coach,\" the statement reads. \"Marcus and Joanna Freeman intervened and removed Vinny from the station. At no point did coach Freeman physically engage with anyone. We believe the police report, which includes video evidence, fully exonerates coach Freeman and makes clear these accusations are totally unfounded.\"The altercation between Freeman and Fleeger allegedly happened after Vinny Freeman lost a match. The South Bend Tribune reports that police did not reveal the extent of the alleged contact between Freeman and Fleeger, who exchanged words in a hallway.The accusation came on the heels of Freeman vowing to \"run it back\" with Notre Dame in late December amid interest from various NFL franchises. Notre Dame's fifth-year coach agreed to a restructured contract that puts him in the \"top tier\" of compensation among college coaches after turning down interest from two NFL franchises, according to Sports Illustrated reports. \nFreeman signed a lucrative extension ahead of last season's playoff appearance.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Real Madrid have announced a shock managerial change with Xabi Alonso leaving the club on Monday after the Supercopa de Espana defeat against Barcelona in a dramatic match that ended 3-2 for the team coached by Hansi Flick. In a surprising move, the Spanish giants also announced the appointment of Alvaro Arbeloa as the new manager.\"Real Madrid C.F. announces that Alvaro Arbeloa is the new head coach of the first team. Arbeloa has been the coach of Castilla since June 2025 and has developed his entire coaching career within the Real Madrid academy since 2020,\" the club statement immediately followed the one that announced the separation from Xabi Alonso. Things have been difficult for the former Bayer Leverkusen coach in Spain, as he wasn't able to replicate the success he had at Bayer Leverkusen at his new club, where he was also a player from 2009 to 2014. He returned to Spain last summer as the new manager after a successful spell in Germany, where he was able win the Bundesliga title and dethrone Bayern Munch during his 2.5 years in charge. \nAfter 22 wins, four draws and five defeats in all competitions, Xabi Alonso leaves Real Madrid after only six months in charge of the Spanish club. Real Madrid hired him in the summer 2025 to replace club legend Carlo Ancelotti who signed for the Brazilian national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Real Madrid are currently second in the LaLiga standings, four points behind Barcelona and 7th in the Champions League table with four wins and two defeats in six matches. Who is Alvaro Arbeloa? Arbeloa is a well known figure at Real Madrid, as he played in the Spanish team and in the national team as a full back for over a decade. At Real Madrid he played from 2009 to 2016 after starting his career in the academy and had two spells at Deportivo La Coruna and Liverpool before making his last career move to West Ham during the 2016-17 season. Arbeloa, over the years, became the face of the club on and off the pitch, contributing to multiple domestic and European trophies. For Spain, he was part of the so called golden generation, playing 50 matches and winning the 2010 World Cup, and the European Championships in 2008 and 2012. After retiring from professional football in 2017, he moved into coaching and since 2020 has since taken on roles within Real Madrid's youth system, where he was considered a promising candidate for the future. \nXabi Alonso's managerial career Xabi Alonso has emerged as one of the best young managerial talents in Europe over the past three years. After retiring from professional football in 2017, he began his coaching career at Real Sociedad, working with the youth teams and quickly gaining attention for his tactical philosophy, centered on ball possession and the development of young players. In 2022 Alonso took charge of Bayer Leverkusen, where he made an immediate impact. Under his management, the German side played exciting football and achieved historic success, winning their first-ever Bundesliga title in the 2023-2024 season. That same season, they also reached the Europa League final, only losing to Atalanta. Ahead of the summer 2025 season and just before the Club World Cup, he announced his move to Real Madrid, taking over from Carlo Ancelotti and marking the next step in his career before leaving six months later. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 12 LSU Tigers shook off all doubts with a statement 70-65 victory over No. 2 Texas on Sunday. This was the Longhorns' first loss of the season, and also LSU's first win over an AP top two team since 2008.\"I'm sure you've heard, but coach (Kim) Mulkey says she wants us to be tough,\" Mikaylah Williams said in her postgame broadcast interview. \"And I think that's something we've really taken pride in after those first two losses. Being tough, sticking together and playing hard. That's something that we've done and that's something we've been successful at so far.\"The sold-out crowd in Baton Rouge was electric all 40 minutes, but they exploded when Williams practically sealed the deal with a three-pointer that made it a three-possession game with just 1:18 remaining. This was just another example of the impact she had on Sunday. She had a complete performance that included 20 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 5 steals.\nHere is a closer look at how LSU upset Texas:A stifling defense that shut down Rori HarmonThe Tigers got off to a rough start offensively as they went just 7 of 26 from the field, but their defense made sure Texas didn't get hot either. \nLSU held the Longhorns to 25 points in the first two quarters, which is their lowest scoring half this season. Although Texas has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, the team finished Sunday with a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Jordan Lee has been one of the most consistent players for Texas, but she only made three field goals all day. Meanwhile, point guard Rori Harmon had just two points, going 1 of 7 from the field. Harmon sat out the entire fourth quarter after Vic Schaefer decided to go with Bryanna Preston.\nLimiting Madison Booker, especially in the first halfBooker was the spark for a Texas comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, but despite finishing the day with 24 points on 10 of 16 shooting, those stats don't tell the whole story. LSU's defense, with Williams being a key part of it, limited Booker to just four points and three turnovers in the first half. She also had two fouls in those first two quarters and was dangerously close to fouling out as she picked up her fourth early in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the loss, Booker is already thinking about how to lock in and bounce back when the Longhorns take on South Carolina.\"Coach said it, we are not ready for Thursday,\" Booker said postgame. \"We are still going to come no matter what, but we have to get ready. We have to prepare again and we have to try to fix our mistakes.\"Fighting for reboundsLSU no longer has Angel Reese or Aneesah Morrow to take over in the rebounding category. Kim Mulkey has been talking all season about how she wants the whole team to make a conscious effort in this area, and they did just that against Texas. LSU won the battle on the boards 44-35, which means the Tigers' grueling practices have paid off.\n\"We've had practices with a rebound bubble on, so the ball can't go in so you have to rebound,\" Williams said postgame. \"If you didn't get it, there was running involved. \"I'm proud of how we rebounded today.\"\nShowcasing depth, with five players scored in double digitsWilliams was the star of the show on Sunday, but there were multiple Tigers who stepped up during big moments. Four other LSU players joined her in the double-digit club with 10 points each, including Jada Richard, who hit a stunning buzzer-beater at the end of the second quarter following a steal and dime from Williams.\nFlau'jae Johnson was coming off her highest scoring game of the season in the win against Georgia. She only made four field goals against Texas but her impact was still felt throughout the game. When the Longhorns were working on a comeback, Johnson got an and-one with 7:15 remaining to keep injecting energy into her team and the crowd. The 5-foot-10 guard also got the crowd going with a block against 6-foot-6 center Kyla Oldacre later in the fourth quarter.\nMiLaysia Fulwiley is still cleaning up aspects of her games, but her moves also make the game exciting. Another key bench player is ZaKiyah Johnson, who Richard described her as a \"dog\" postgame.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin changed the complexion of its season Saturday by handing No. 2 Michigan its first loss in a stunning 91-88 road upset of the Wolverines. The win sent the Badgers surging 13 spots in the NET, up to No. 40, and breathed life into a previously unimpressive resume.As a result, the Badgers have cracked the field of 68 as a No. 10 seed in the latest CBS Sports Bracketology simulation. Wisconsin is still just 1-5 in Quad 1, but the Badgers are 10-0 in all other games, and their lone Quad 1 victory isn't of the garden variety.Taking down this wagon of a Michigan team is going to carry some serious weight on Selection Sunday. Even after the loss, Michigan is somewhat remarkably still rated No. 1 at KenPom.com and in the NET rankings ahead of four unbeaten high-major teams in both metrics.It's a testament to just how dominant Michigan was during a roughly six-week stretch that included six victories of 18+ points against high-major opposition. After nearly losing at Penn State and then falling at home to Wisconsin, the Wolverines clearly have some things to clean up. \n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Why it could be a while before undefeated Vanderbilt loses its first game\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut for now, our CBS Sports Bracketology model has Michigan sticking as the No. 1 overall seed.Bracketology top seedsThe NCAA Tournament field and seeding as projected by SportsLine's Bracketology simulationSeedMidwestSouthEastWest1 \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    2NebraskaUConnPurdueDuke3BYUIllinoisGonzagaHouston4VirginiaFloridaTexas TechMichigan State5AlabamaLouisvilleNorth CarolinaClemson6St. John'sUtah StateKansasArkansas7SMUTennesseeSaint LouisUCF8IowaMiamiVillanovaSeton Hall9GeorgiaUSCNC StateStanford10WisconsinNew MexicoTexas A&MKentucky11TCU/Virginia TechAuburnAkronMcNeese12TulsaMissouri/Oklahoma StateHigh PointMurray State13HofstraYaleLibertyUtah Valley14Wright StateEast Tennessee StateSt. ThomasHawaii15TroyAustin PeayMaristPortland State16Tennessee-MartinGrambling/HowardLong Island/VermontNavyOn the bubbleLast four inTCUVirginia TechMissouriOklahoma State   First four out   NC StateTexasOklahomaLSUBracketology takeawaysKentucky's resume takes a hitWhile Kentucky played some of its best basketball of the season on Saturday by rallying from an early 12-point deficit to throttle Mississippi State 92-68, its resume actually took a hit over the weekend. UK's Dec. 13 home win over Indiana slipped from a Quad 1 win to a Quad 2 win after the Hoosiers fell from No. 30 in the NET to No. 35 following their loss to Nebraska on Saturday. Similarly, Missouri dropped from No. 69 in the NET to No. 77 following its loss against a previously struggling Ole Miss team. As a result, the Wildcats' Jan. 7 home loss to Mizzou is considered a Quad 3 loss for the time being.\nAt 10-6 (1-2 SEC), Kentucky is a No. 10 seed heading into Wednesday's game at LSU. The Tigers are among the \"First Four Out,\" which makes it a massive game for both teams. With a road game at Tennessee up next, UK can ill-afford a loss against a banged-up LSU squad.Surging Saint LouisSaint Louis has the same head coach (Josh Schertz) and same star player (Robbie Avila) as the Indiana State team that was cruelly left on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble in 2024. This time around, the duo are building an even stronger resume. The Billikens are a projected No. 7 seed after improving to 15-1 (3-0 A-10) with an 84-72 win at La Salle on Saturday. SLU's only loss is a one-point neutral-site loss in November against a Stanford team that is also in the CBS Sports Bracketology field.The road ahead is littered with the same landmines that exist for every mid-,ajor team forced to navigate two months of low-end conference fare while trying to hold together a postseason resume. But the Billikens already took care of what may be their toughest Atlantic 10 challenge by knocking off VCU on the road last week for a Quad 1 win. It would only be fitting if Schertz and Avila got across the finish line this time and reached the Big Dance. \nTexas' Pope is preachingTexas' 92-88 win at Alabama came in just behind Wisconsin's win at Michigan for the weekend's most significant upset in a high-major game. The Longhorns desperately needed a victory of that caliber to jumpstart Year 1 of the Sean Miller era. When Jordan Pope gets going, watch out. In Texas' two Quad 1 wins (NC State and Alabama), the senior guard has made 13 of 26 attempts from 3-point range. He hit seven in a 102-97 win over the Wolfpack on Nov. 26 and six against the Crimson Tide, finishing both games with 28 points. All of a sudden, the Longhorns (10-6, 1-2 SEC) have crept into First Four Out territory as they enter a Wednesday home showdown with Vanderbilt. Beating Bama vaulted this team 23 spots in the NET. Stacking a win over the Commodores next to it would be mighty impressive for a team that's been on a rocky ride for the season's past two months. Texas still rates abysmally in KenPom's defensive efficiency metric, coming in at 119th nationally, which is last in the SEC. But with a little corrective action there, Miller's squad could make some noise.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama is staring down a pivotal offseason entering the third year of coach Kalen DeBoer's tenure. Based solely on the standard set during Alabama's reign of dominance under Nick Saban, DeBoer has underdelivered thus far. The Crimson Tide missed out on the College Football Playoff in his first season and finished the year with a 9-4 record, Alabama's worst showing since Saban's first season in Tuscaloosa almost 20 years ago. Alabama did make the playoff in 2025, becoming the first non-conference champion with three losses to ever do so in the process, but they were quickly bounced by Indiana in a 38-3 Rose Bowl mauling. Alabama was outscored 100-44 in its three postseason games. That includes a 34-24 triumph against Oklahoma in the first round of the playoff. \n        \n            \n                What's next for Alabama after embarrassing Rose Bowl loss? Worst postseason effort warrants sweeping change\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo, though most programs nationally would give anything for what Alabama has accomplished under DeBoer, the embattled coach needed to provide some reason for optimism once the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2. It hasn't taken long for those hopes to unravel. \nAlabama did put a good foot forward by landing former NC State star Hollywood Smothers, the No. 2 running back in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings, three days after the one-time portal window commenced. Smothers would have added a much-needed jolt of energy to a historically bad Alabama rushing effort. Jam Miller, the Crimson Tide's leading rusher in 2025, finished the year with just 504 yards. He was the only Alabama running back to surpass 300 yards on the season. Alabama's backs combined for eight runs of 20-plus yards. Smothers had nine on his own while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. Smothers also adds an extra dimension to the offense as a high-level pass-catching back. \nBut Smothers never agreed to a contract with the Crimson Tide and, not long after he revealed his commitment publicly, he was on campus at Texas for a visit. Less than a week after Smothers initially committed to Alabama, he instead elected to sign with the Longhorns. On the same day, Alabama lost wide receiver target Cam Coleman, the top pass-catching option in the portal and a former thorn in Alabama's side at Auburn, to Texas. Those misses are of the highest profile, but they're just two of many transfer portal flops that have Alabama staring down a new reality: its brand isn't enough to carry it anymore. Transfer portal players, frankly, do not care how many national titles Alabama won with Saban calling the shots. They don't care that Alabama won the SEC all but four times from 2009 to 2023. Saban isn't there anymore and, even if he was, he'd need more than just his sterling reputation to sell the Tide. \nAll that matters now is the almighty dollar. There might be a handful of players that stick it out because of their love for a program -- quarterback Ty Simpson is a good example -- but a majority of stars want to be paid. If you're not the biggest spender, you're not going to land them. Alabama plays in a conference of big spenders, which makes it a face in the crowd. Signs point to Alabama lagging behind in the name, image and likeness realm, especially in comparison to programs of its ilk. CBS Sports recently listed the Crimson Tide among the \"Good, but maybe not as elite as you think\" category in terms of NIL spending among playoff teams. \nJust good isn't good enough in the SEC. The inability to land, or hold on to, top-flight talent like Coleman and Smothers bears that out. As does Alabama's increasing failure to retain its own impact players. There's a significant talent exodus departing Tuscaloosa. Here's a look at some of the most notable Alabama players that have entered the transfer portal and where they rank, according to 247Sports: DL James Smith (No. 7 overall, No. 1 defensive lineman) WR Isaiah Horton (No. 9 overall, No. 2 wide receiver; committed to Texas A&M) EDGE Keon Keeley (No. 51 overall, No. 7 edge rusher; committed to Notre Dame) EDGE Qua Russaw (No. 55 overall, No. 8 edge rusher) OL Wilkin Formby (No. 65 overall, No. 5 offensive tackle; committed to Texas A&M) EDGE Noah Carter (No. 71 overall, No. 11 edge rusher; committed to Georgia Tech) That's not even counting the players that Alabama is losing to the NFL, like leading wide receiver Germie Bernard and stalwart linebacker Deontae Lawson. NFL declarations are a sign of a program's health, at least. \nAlabama has lost a total of 20 transfers. As of Jan. 12, its incoming transfer class sits at six prospects. USC defensive lineman Devan Thompkins is the only one of those that ranks above a three star. The Crimson Tide did invest significant resources into signing an elite crop of high school recruits. Their 2026 class ranks second in the 247Sports Team Composite Rankings. Alabama inked nine top-100 players, including three five stars. But freshmen rarely have an immediate impact and, as the playoff has shown, most successful teams in the modern era of college football rely heavily on an injection of talent from the portal. \nIndiana, for instance, is the favorite to win the national title. Fourteen of its 22 offensive and defensive starters came to the Hoosiers via the portal. Efforts in the transfer portal can make or break a coach's tenure. Alabama can't rest on its own name and brand recognition anymore. If the Crimson Tide want to break back into college football's upper crust, it will have to increase its investment in that realm. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears' 31-27 victory over the Green Bay Packers was the best game of Wild Card Weekend. Not only did the Bears outscore the Packers 25-6 in the fourth quarter to advance to the divisional round, but Chicago got to pull off the largest playoff comeback in franchise history in front of its home fans against a hated rival. First-year Bears coach Ben Johnson has embraced the rivalry with the Packers ever since Chicago hired him away from the Detroit Lions last January. In his introductory press conference, Johnson even said, \"I kind of enjoyed beating (Packers coach) Matt LaFleur twice a year.\" It appears that may have been the moment some bad blood was born between the two coaches. Johnson and LaFleur's handshake following the game on Saturday night went viral, as the Bears coach refused to dedicate more than one second of his time to speaking with his rival. \nIn his Monday press conference, Johnson was asked why this Packers rivalry was important to him, or if there was some personal beef with LaFleur. \n\"This is a rivalry,\" Johnson responded, \"And the city of Chicago, Green Bay -- it needs to be a rivalry.\" Johnson was also seen in the locker room screaming, \"F--- the Packers!\" after the emotional victory. He was asked about that comment, and how Bears owner George McCaskey may have viewed it.\"Like I said before, there's a rivalry that exists between these two teams,\" Johnson said. \"Something that I fully recognize and I'm a part of and ... yeah. I just don't like that team. So George and I have talked, and we're on the same page.\"\nHistory of Johnson-LaFleur handshakesThe handshake that Johnson and LaFleur had on Saturday night was actually their third of the season. Their first meeting came in Week 14, when the Packers defeated the Bears, 28-21. This postgame embrace came off a bit icy as well. \nTwo weeks later, the Packers blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter on the way to a 22-16 overtime loss to the Bears in Chicago. This was actually the most \"normal\" interaction the two coaches may have had! \nWith the Packers reportedly looking to extend LaFleur this offseason, it looks like we will see more of their handshakes in the future. It doesn't appear there's anything serious about the budding Johnson vs. LaFleur rivalry, other than the fact that they coach two teams that hate each other. We've seen far more dramatic handshakes in the NFL, like when Lions coach Jim Schwartz chased down Jim Harbaugh in 2011.\nThe Bears should be excited that their young coach is fully embracing the Packers rivalry. Johnson's first season is going historically well. Not only did his Bears win the NFC North with an 11-6 record, but the 18-point comeback victory on Saturday was the largest by a first-year coach since George Wilson came back from 20 points down in 1957. No Bears rookie coach had ever won a playoff game before this weekend.Up next for the Bears are Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday in the divisional round.\n            ",

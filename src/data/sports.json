    "body": "\n        NFC squads looking to crawl their way back into the postseason picture will meet in Week 9 of 'Monday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Arizona Cardinals. Dallas (3-4-1) is undefeated at home but enters off a 44-24 defeat at Denver last Sunday. Arizona (2-5) has the NFL's longest losing streak at five games and fell to Green Bay, 27-23, in Week 7 before having a bye last week. Jacoby Brissett will remain the starting quarterback for Arizona in place of the still recovering Kyler Murray (foot), according to coach Jonathan Gannon. Though he won't start, Murray is questionable to be active as a backup. Defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (calf) and cornerback Will Johnson (groin) are also questionable for Arizona. Dallas center Cooper Beebe (ankle) has been activated off of injured reserve and is expected to play. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Dallas is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cardinals vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 53.5.

The Cards have won both three straight overall against the Cowboys as well as each of their last three trips to Dallas. Arizona's spread record has mirrored its outright record in these eight contests as the Cardinals have covered in seven of the eight. Despite a five-game losing streak this season, Arizona has covered in back-to-back contests, while Dallas is coming off both a straight-up and spread defeat.The Cardinals can take advantage of Dallas' porous defense on Monday as the Cowboys rank second-worst in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense. Dallas is dead last in third-down defense, which plays into Arizona's strength as the latter ranks fifth in third-down offense. Plus, having Brissett under center isn't much of a downgrade for the team as the journeyman has back-to-back games with two touchdown passes against a pair of one-loss teams in Green Bay and Indianapolis, so he should find success versus the Cowboys. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Cowboys can coverFew teams can match the offensive firepower of Dallas, which leads the NFL in passing offense, ranks second in points scored and is also second in total yards gained. Dak Prescott leads the league in QBR while running back, Javonte Williams, ranks among the top four in both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. George Pickens is third in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while No. 1 wideout, CeeDee Lamb, has 184 yards and a score in his two games since returning from injury.While Arizona coming off a bye would seemingly help its chances of winning, it may not help its chances of covering. The Cardinals have lost each of their last three games versus the spread after a bye, and they are 2-5 ATS with a rest advantage since 2022. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a knack for rising to the occasion when an opponent has an advantageous schedule. Dallas is 6-2 ATS when at a rest disadvantage since the start of the 2022 season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Cowboys vs. Cardinals picksFor Cardinals vs. Cowboys   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 56 combined points.

Arizona also lost its leading scorer from last season to the NBA. These two teams are challenging each other on opening night on a neutral floor, and defense can come together quicker than offense for some units filled with new faces, and that's what the model projects for Monday from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Dallas entered the week with the second-best scoring offense at 30.8 points per game. That alone is great news for an Over bet, but it doesn't end there. On the opposite side of the ball, the Cowboys have the second-worst scoring defense at 31.3 ppg allowed, which has resulted in the Over hitting in five straight Dallas games. The Cardinals are starting Jacoby Brissett at quarterback with Kyler Murray (foot) still out, and Arizona's offense has been more efficient without Murray. The Cardinals are averaging 25 ppg in Brissett's two starts, compared to 20.6 ppg with Murray.

Houston has won by an average of 24.3 ppg over this winning streak, so a 12.5-point margin certainly isn't too daunting. The Rockets are averaging 134.7 points with at least 128 points in each game during this run, with Kevin Durant leading the charge at 27.2 ppg. Alperen Sengun is averaging 22.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 7.6 assists per game this season, while Jabari Smith Jr. and Amen Thompson are adding 15 ppg each.

Jones, a long-time executive in their finance department, allegedly embezzled $3.8 million in team funds through fraudulent purchases he got authorized on the franchise's business credit cards. In his position, Jones had control over the team's American Express account and issued himself multiple corporate cards. Federal prosecutors allege he used those cards to purchase trips, cars, concert tickets, gifts and more. Jones allegedly paid for numerous trips to destinations like the Bahamas, Thailand, Switzerland and more, and also bought a Porsche with team funds. Jones allegedly altered documents and bills to make them seem like they were for legitimate organizational purposes and then sent them to the team's accounting department for approval. The Athletic cites an example of Jones getting a $229,968.76 bill paid for by the team for what he claimed was the franchise's stay at the Wynn in Las Vegas during their run to the semifinals of the NBA Cup. However, that amount was to pay for personal spending, according to federal prosecutors, and Jones altered an email from American Express to show the charges were from the Wynn. \nJones is no longer employed by the Hawks. \n            \n    ",

On Monday night, the NHL announced that the Dallas Stars will host a 2027 Stadium Series matchup at AT&T Stadium on Feb. 20, 2027.The Stars' opponent for the game will be determined at a later date, but puck drop has already been set for 8 p.m. ET. In the official announcement, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Cowboys owner has been advocating for an outdoor game since AT&T Stadium debuted in 2009.\n\"The National Hockey League is thrilled to bring the spectacle of an NHL Stadium Series game to Arlington and one of the world's most spectacular sports settings, AT&T Stadium,\" Bettman said in a statement. \"Ever since its opening in 2009, Jerry Jones has been advocating for an outdoor game at this amazing venue. And we are delighted to partner with the Cowboys and Stars -- two franchises dedicated to the fans of North Texas -- and to create another unique fan experience for a market that has long been a hockey success story and welcomed us so enthusiastically when the 2020 NHL Winter Classic was played at the Cotton Bowl.\"\nIn his statement, Jones said that hosting an outdoor NHL game is yet another crowning achievement for the Cowboys' home venue.\"Hosting the NHL Stadium Series with the Dallas Stars is another great example of the vision we've always had for what AT&T Stadium could be beyond football,\" Jones said. \"The game will be another proud moment for us and being able to provide a world class fan and team experience in partnership with two outstanding organizations, the NHL and the Stars, will be very special.\"\nWhile this will be the first time AT&T Stadium hosts a hockey game, it will not be the first time the Stars have hosted an outdoor game. For the 2020 NHL Winter Classic, the Stars played the Nashville Predators at the Cotton Bowl and pulled out a 4-2 win. That game drew a crowd of 85,630 fans, which is the third-largest single-game attendance in NHL history.\n            \n    ",

Jones, who was in his first year with Tennessee, also has 26 total tackles and a fumble recovery this season.\n\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is Baltimore's second trade this season. At the beginning of October, the Ravens acquired safety Alohi Gilman from the Chargers in exchange for pass rusher Odafe Oweh. Acquiring Gilman has allowed the Ravens to play three safeties at a time -- Gilman, Kyle Hamilton and Malaki Starks -- and fueled major defensive improvement. In three games with Gilman, the Ravens are allowing 13 points per game. In the five games prior to the trade, they had allowed 35.4 points per game.Still, the pass rush was a major issue. The Ravens' 11 sacks this season are tied for second-fewest in the NFL, and their 27.3% pressure rate is the third-lowest. Nnamdi Madubuike -- who has not played since Week 2 and is out for the season with a neck injury -- and Tavius Robinson, who has not played since Week 6 due to a broken foot, are still tied for the team lead with two sacks.\nLamar Jackson's return and the defense's improvement have helped Baltimore win two straight after a 1-5 start. The 1-8 Titans, meanwhile, are seen as a likely sellers at the deadline, and Jones is the first move in that regard.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Asante Samuel Jr. has been cleared for football activities after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April. The former Chargers cornerback has already been in touch with several teams and is planning to make free-agency visits as soon as this week, per ESPN.A 2021 second-round pick, Samuel played in just four games last season after experiencing what he described as a stinger in both shoulders. Dr. David Okonkwo, a neurosurgeon for the Steelers, performed Samuel's surgery.Samuel, 26, had two interceptions in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. In the 2022 AFC wild-card round, Samuel had three interceptions and six pass breakups during Los Angeles' loss to the Jaguars.Samuel's comeback attempt coincides with Tuesday's trade deadline. Given his status as a free agent, Samuel will likely attract attention from teams who could use help at cornerback but would prefer not to give up capital in order to get one.\nWhere will Samuel end up? Here's a rundown of some of his possible landing spots.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSteelers Pittsburgh could use some reinforcements at cornerback given its injuries in the secondary this season. The Steelers' need at cornerback was recently elevated with Jalen Ramsey moving to free safety to replace DeShon Elliott, who recently went on injured reserve. In this scenario, Samuel would work alongside Joey Porter Jr. (who had an interception in Pittsburgh's Week 9 win over the Colts), emerging backup Brandin Echols and former Pro Bowler Darius Slay, who has struggled during his first season with the Steelers. \nBengals Cincinnati is a given considering how bad its defense has been this season. The Bengals' secondary has been especially bad this season; Cincinnati has allowed the most passing yards and touchdown passes through nine games. A big reason for the Bengals' secondary woes has been Cam Taylor-Britt's demotion under first-year defensive coordinator Al Golden. 49ers While they're off to a surprising 6-3 start, San Francisco could use some reinforcements in the secondary if it is going to make a legitimate run at a Super Bowl. The 49ers are currently 20th in the NFL in pass defense, 17th in touchdown passes allowed and 30th in interceptions. San Francisco will need to improve in these areas if it is going to upstage Seattle (and its high-octane passing attack) in the NFC West. Eagles On paper, the defending champs would be an ideal spot for Samuel. In this scenario, he would likely be asked to provide depth to an already established unit. Samuel could especially come in handy on third down, as the Eagles' defense is just 26th in the league in that area. \nRavens Winners of two straight games, the Ravens are still hoping to grab one of the AFC's seven playoff spots two months from now. Adding some depth to their defense may go a long way in helping John Harbaugh's team accomplish that goal. Baltimore's defense has made strides in recent weeks, but is still one of the NFL's worst units against the pass. Cowboys Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones hasn't been shy about his willingness to make moves before the trade deadline. Given the Cowboys' issues on defense (and specifically in the secondary) this season, it would make sense for them to at least look into signing Samuel. Dallas' defensive challenges this season include cornerback Trevon Diggs being placed on injured reserve in October. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We now have a decent idea of what the rotations are going to look like across most teams. Excluding unforeseen injuries, the playing time for fantasy-relevant players is somewhat predictable, meaning our sit/start decisions are now based on what we know, rather than what we think we know.Week 3 delivers an abundance of action, with 17 teams tabled for four appearances and 12 teams taking the court three times, leaving the Hornets as the only team with two games.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players during the home stretch.Four Games: BKN, BOS, DAL, DEN, DET, GSW, HOU, IND, LAC, MEM, MIA, MIL, MIN, OKC, PHI, SAC, WAS\nThree Games: ATL, CHI, CLE, LAL, NOP, NYK, ORL, PHO, POR, SAS, TOR, UTATwo Games: CHAHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the second week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format. GuardsConsider starting: Quentin Grimes, PHIOpponents: @CHI, @CLE, TOR, DETDespite coming off the bench, Grimes has been a key piece for the 76ers thus far, logging at least 30 minutes in but one of his appearances. Through six games, he is averaging 18.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 0.8 steals and 3.2 three-pointers in 31.9 minutes per game. The eventual return of Paul George and Jaren McCain will, in theory, impact Grimes' opportunities. However, given he has proven himself time and time again, it would make sense for him to continue playing a sizeable role. For the upcoming week, he is a no-brainer when it comes to deciding whether to start him or not.Consider sitting: Kon Knueppel, CHAOpponents: @NOP, @MIAFresh off a career-high 24-point performance in a win over Utah, Knueppel continues to develop into a semi-reliable scoring option. Keeping in mind this performance came without LaMelo Ball or Brandon Miller, expectations should probably be tempered slightly, especially with only two games over the next seven days. Across his first seven games, Knueppel is averaging 14.0 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.1 three-pointers in 30.1 minutes per game. While his role appears relatively secure, the fact that his overall value is largely reliant on scoring makes him a viable bench candidate this week.\nConsider sitting: Jordan Poole, NOPOpponents: CHA, @DAL, @SASThings in New Orleans have not gone as planned for Poole. That might be the understatement of the season. Over the first six games, Poole is averaging 18.3 points, 3.0 assists and 3.2 three-pointers in 30.9 minutes per game. On the surface, these numbers appear serviceable. However, he was relegated to the bench after just three games, with rookie Jeremiah Fears moving into the starting lineup. Since the relegation, Poole has scored fewer than 12 points in two of the three games. His minutes have been trending in the wrong direction, and chances are that he is frustrated with the current situation. With so much volatility, moving him to the bench might save you some frustration of your own.ForwardsConsider starting: Jaime Jaquez, MIAOpponents: @LAC, @DEN, CHA, PORWhile Nikola Jovic was a bit of a talking point coming into the season, it's been Jaquez who has let his play do all the talking. Despite continuing to come off the bench, Jaquez has been arguably the most consistent player in Miami thus far, averaging 18.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 0.8 steals, shooting 63.8 percent from the field. Outside of a poor performance against the Spurs, Jaquez has scored the ball well, tallying a team-high 31 points during Sunday's loss to the Lakers. There is certainly a chance his production falls off at some point, making him a slightly risky starter. However, Miami needs all the scoring it can get, so let's give Jaquez a look this week.Consider starting: Josh Minott, BOSOpponents: UTA, WAS, @ORL, @ORLMinott's numbers certainly don't jump off the page, that much is clear. Through six games, he is averaging 8.3 points per game, adding 6.8 rebounds, 1.0 three-pointers and 2.0 combined steals and blocks in just 21.8 minutes. Overall production aside, the bigger talking point is the fact that after starting the year off the bench, he has since moved into the starting lineup, holding down that role for the past four games. He has scored double digits in three of those four games, averaging 9.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.3 three-pointers. While the production is likely to be up and down, assuming he can stick in the starting lineup, there is enough upside to warrant starting him in fantasy leagues this week.\nConsider sitting: Rui Hachimura, LALOpponents: @POR, SAS, @ATLIt's been another modest start for Hachimura, putting up averages of 15.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.9 three-pointers across the first seven games. Anyone scoring at least 15 points per game is going to have some fantasy value, given the points category is arguably the trickiest to fill. However, much of Hachimura's production has come without LeBron James and Luka Doncic. While James is yet to return, Doncic was back on the court during Sunday's win over the Heat. Hachimura is renowned for having a very empty fantasy game, which could be even more prevalent now that Doncic is present. Hachimura is definitely someone to not only consider benching, but could also be a flat-out drop.CentersConsider starting: Isaiah Jackson, INDOpponents: MIL, BKN, @DEN, @GSWFrustration is a very good way of summarizing the season thus far for Jackson. Despite starting in five of the six games, Jackson's numbers have been underwhelming. If we're being honest, that's putting it nicely. Over the first six games, he has averaged just 5.7 points and 5.0 rebounds in 15.8 minutes per contest. However, perhaps his luck is about to change. He has played 27 and 21 minutes in each of the past two games. His 21-minute performance during Saturday's win over the Warriors included two fouls in the first three minutes. So, was he in line for a handful of extra playing time? This one obviously comes with a lot of risk, but given the Pacers' center depth is arguably the worst in the league, Jackson could be about to trend up, so let's try and get ahead of it.Consider sitting: Ryan Kalkbrenner, CHAOpponents: @NOP, @MIAWhile it's been a slow start for Jackson, the same can't be said about Kalkbrenner. There was some conjecture as to who would be the starting center in Charlotte coming into the season, with both Moussa Diabate and Mason Plumlee in the discussion. To the delight of many, Kalkbrenner was handed the starting role, and he has made the most of his opportunity. Through seven games, he is averaging 9.0 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 2.1 blocks, shooting an incredible 81.1 percent from the field. The defense has been better than expected, while the offense tends to come and go. With his overall game continuing to develop, shifting him to your bench for a two-game week, while somewhat frustrating, could end up being the right decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders lost much more than just their sixth game of the season on Sunday night against the Seattle Seahawks, as star quarterback Jayden Daniels dislocated his left elbow with less than eight minutes remaining in the 38-14 defeat. Many were quick to criticize coach Dan Quinn for leaving his best player in the game with the contest already out of hand. Now, it looks like Daniels is going to miss several more contests as Washington's season continues to spiral. On Monday, Quinn took responsibility for leaving Daniels in the game too long, and risking his franchise quarterback's health.\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels injury update: Commanders star QB awaiting MRI for dislocated left elbow vs. Seahawks\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I know many of you have been asking about the thought process of Jayden being in the game in that situation. I get that,\" Quinn said. \"I've been thinking about it honestly nonstop too, and for me the answer is, man, I missed it.\"Quinn explained his thought process to reporters. On Daniels' final drive there was 12:30 remaining in the fourth quarter with his Commanders trailing 38-7. Quinn said that possession would be the last for certain players, such as Daniels and wide receiver Deebo Samuel. Quinn knew that the offensive play-calling would be relatively vanilla, and not call for Daniels to make plays with his legs -- but that's exactly where Quinn said he messed up. This is the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, who is special as a scrambler. \nOn a second-and-goal with 7:39 remaining in the game, Daniels scrambled to his right but was taken down behind the line of scrimmage by Drake Thomas. The second-year signal-caller attempted to use his non-throwing hand to balance as he went down, and that's when his elbow popped. Quinn said that Daniels did not suffer any fractures to his arm, just the dislocation. Later in the week, he will have more information regarding if his quarterback could return at some point this season. Sunday night was costly for Washington from an injury standpoint, as the Commanders also lost wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey to a broken collarbone, and cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.\nWith Daniels out, Marcus Mariota reenters the starting lineup. The veteran journeyman has started three games for Washington this season, winning one, and has thrown four touchdowns compared to three interceptions in those contests. Up next for the Commanders are the 5-3 Detroit Lions on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- Could the Dallas Cowboys (3-4-1) pull off a trade or two ahead of Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline, just after facing the Arizona Cardinals (2-5) on Monday Night Football to conclude Week 9?According to owner and general manager Jerry Jones, the answer is yes. He said Monday morning that multiple deals are in the works -- less than three months after Dallas traded Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers for two first-round picks and Kenny Clark just before the 2025 season kicked off.\"Immediately, it will have him on the field, and it will address some of the things that have been our shortcomings,\" Jones said on SiriusXM, via The Athletic.If the Cowboys strike another deal, any new addition will have a week to acclimate during the team's Week 10 bye. It's clear any move would be aimed at the defense. Dallas is averaging the NFL's second-most points (30.8 per game) but allowing the second-most (31.3). The Cowboys are just the fourth team in league history to score 30-plus points per game and allow 30-plus through eight games. None of the previous three won a playoff game. In fact, no team has ever made the postseason while giving up 30 or more points per game.\nThat's probably why Jones is angling to make another move. Here's a look at six possible defensive trade candidates for Dallas, including the following three targets reported by NFL insider Jordan Schultz: Cincinnati Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson, Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson and Miami Dolphins edge rusher Bradley Chubb.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bengals' season is likely doomed with quarterback Joe Burrow (turf toe) sidelined and the team off to a 3-6 start. Cincinnati has balked at giving the NFL's 2024 leader in sacks, Trey Hendrickson, a multi-year extension the past two offseasons. Now would be the time to sell before he can hit free agency again. Dallas' defense has fallen off a cliff without Parsons, and trading for Hendrickson, who turns 31 on Dec. 5, and his expiring contract should be in Jones' mid-round-pick comfort range for doing most of his trade deadline deals.\nLogan Wilson is just two years into a four-year, $36 million contract extension, but his playing time has declined the past few weeks with the struggling Bengals going with a youth movement at the position with rookies Barrett Carter and Demetrius Knight Jr. Wilson is under contract the next two seasons with cap hits just under $10 million, and he would be a noticeable upgrade over Kenneth Murray and Jack Sanborn in Dallas. \nThe fire sale is on in South Beach after the Dolphins fired general manager Chris Grier. Off to a 2-7 start, Miami traded former first-round edge rusher Jaelan Phillips to the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday morning. Perhaps 29-year-old two-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Bradley Chubb is next to go in the Dolphins' apparent rebuild. Chubb missed the 2024 season with a torn ACL, but his 4.0 sacks lead Miami this season and rank tied for 27th in the NFL. The Cowboys would probably ask Miami to eat some of Chubb's contract because he is currently scheduled to have cap hits of just over $31 million in 2026 and 2027.\nDallas used to be the best at pressuring opposing quarterbacks with a team quarterback pressure rate of 40.2% from 2021 to 2024 when Parsons was on the roster. It's now hovering around league average in that department at 38.1%, which ranks 14th in the league.If Jones is determined to make a move, the Cowboys should go get 29-year-old edge rusher Arden Key to bolster their pass rush, given that Key has 1.5 sacks while playing for Tennessee -- a team that already fired its head coach -- this season. Dallas' 15 sacks are the eighth-fewest in the NFL. It needs more juice at the edge-rusher position opposite second-round rookie Donovan Ezeiruaku, who has come on of late.\nDespite being 36, two-time Pro Bowl linebacker Demario Davis can still be a plus starter in 2025. He would be an upgrade over Jack Sanborn, whom the Cowboys placed on injured reserve Monday. \nPro Football Focus grades Davis among the NFL's 10 best inside linebackers this season -- his overall defensive grade (78.4) ranks ninth, and his run-defense grade (89.2) ranks sixth. His 61 tackles on designed rushing plays are the most in the NFL, per TruMedia. That would help a Cowboys defense that ranks 30th (146.0 rushing yards allowed per game).\nCowboys Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs (knee/concussion) is on injured reserve, as is third-round rookie Shavon Revel (knee). Dallas' pass defense ranks 30th (258.6 yards allowed per game), and it could use help.If the Saints plan to let soon-to-be 27-year-old cornerback Alontae Taylor walk in free agency after a 1-8 start under new coach Kellen Moore, they may as well get a pick for him. Moore's familiarity with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones could help facilitate a deal, especially for a Dallas team seeking a low-cost addition.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 11 of the college football season will be the first time teams at the top know exactly where they stand with the College Football Playoff committee. We'll get the first committee rankings on Tuesday night, and that'll set the tone for what should be a very fun weekend of games, headlined by six matchups involving top 10 teams that have something to prove. The most unique element of the College Football Playoff is the need for style points, as not all wins are created equal. And for teams that have already played their toughest competition, they have to keep the gas pedal down to keep the committee impressed. Then there are the conference championship game implications, with plenty still to be sorted out in the Big Ten, SEC, ACC and Big 12. Chaos reigns in the ACC, especially after Georgia Tech's loss last week, while the Big 12 once again has a million scenarios in play, as is a seemingly annual occurrence. The SEC has two undefeated teams in conference play in Texas A&M and Alabama, but both still have some big games to navigate on their schedule, including this week. The Big Ten title race is much simpler, as Ohio State and Indiana have cleared an apparent path to a showdown in Indianapolis, but they still need to take care of business to ensure that No. 1 vs. No. 2 battle happens. All of that sets the table for an exciting Week 11, and here are our predictions for the six biggest games on the schedule for Saturday. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Notre Dame crashes top 10 in college football rankings, resurgent Texas climbs\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 8 BYU at No. 9 Texas Tech\nThe only top-10 battle in the country will take place in Lubbock where undefeated BYU takes on its biggest test of the season against Texas Tech. This game figures to be decided in the trenches, where both teams have had the advantage on most opponents all season. BYU has leaned on teams with one of the nation's best rushing attacks, as it averages 5.4 yards per carry and 216 rushings yards per game. LJ Martin and Bear Bachmeier present a difficult problem for opposing defenses attacking downhill and challenge opponents' physicality and desire to hit for all 60 minutes, but they've yet to face a defense quite like Texas Tech. The Red Raiders lead the nation in rush defense, allowing just 74 yards per game and 2.4 yards per carry. Not having Skyler Gill-Howard in the middle anymore has weakened them a touch, and we saw last week Kansas State had the most success of any opponent all season (126 yards and two TDs on 4.2 yard per carry) with an offense that features a running QB. Still, they will make life difficult for BYU up front and whichever of the BYU offensive line and the Texas Tech defensive line win more consistently will likely determine this football game. \nTexas Tech's performance against K-State impressed me. I thought that could be an upset spot and while it took some time for the offense to get going, they opened things up late and the defense got big stops when they needed them to put the game on ice. I think this game might look a lot like that one, with BYU finding some success on the ground but struggling to hit the kinds of explosives in the run game. Over 60 minutes, I think the Red Raiders pull clear and move back on top of the Big 12 standings. PICK: Texas Tech 34-27 over BYUNo. 2 Indiana at Penn State\nPenn State comes home after giving everything it had in Columbus and it simply not being enough, and will be greeted by an Indiana team that's handing out beatdowns to the rest of the Big Ten like candy on Halloween. Credit to Terry Smith for getting the boys to battle as hard as they did against Ohio State and keeping it close for a half, but I'm concerned this Penn State squad might not have a whole lot in the tank for this game. The Hoosiers have won their last three games by an average of 40 points, as there are no signs that Curt Cignetti's group is satisfied with just getting through the weak points of their schedule. It is clear the message in that locker room is that the mentality each week has to be the same, especially after they almost got caught sleepwalking in Iowa City the week before going to Oregon. That message has been received, and there is no letup on either side of the ball for 60 minutes -- whether it's starters or backups in the game. \nNothing I saw from Penn State last week indicates there's a sleeping giant about to get woken up in Happy Valley, and I expect this game to look a lot like most every Indiana game we've seen this season. It might be close after a quarter, but by the time the final whistle blows, Beaver Stadium will be mostly emptied out except for the folks in red that made the trip from Bloomington. PICK: Indiana 38-13 over Penn StateNo. 5 Georgia at Mississippi State\nThe all-Bulldog battle in Starkville will be an interesting test for a Georgia team that has not looked dominant much at all this season. Georgia eked out a win over rival Florida last week and now faces a much-improved Mississippi State team on the road. Mississippi State finally picked up its first SEC win in two years in a thriller in Arkansas last week after coming up painfully short of upset wins over Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Now they'll get one more shot at taking down one of the SEC's big dogs (pun intended), and Georgia better be ready from the jump or it could find itself down quickly. \nSlow starts have been the M.O. for the Dawgs under Kirby Smart for some time, as they've had a propensity to play with their food early and then try to hit the gas in the second half after making adjustments. This season it's taken a little longer to get it in gear than they'd like when they do try to flip that switch, and the result has been some extremely stressful games.  So far, Alabama is the only team to punish them for it, but Tennessee, Auburn, Ole Miss and Florida have all had early leads on Georgia only to watch the Dawgs nose in front by the final whistle. It would not surprise me at all if the cowbells are ringing like crazy early in Davis Wade Stadium as Mississippi State jumps out in front, but everything about how this season's gone for both teams says in the fourth quarter Georgia is going to find a way to escape with a win. PICK: Georgia 37-31 over Mississippi StateNo. 6 Oregon at Iowa\nOregon's offense has not been as dynamic in Big Ten play as we've come to expect, and the Ducks will get quite the test on the road this week when they travel to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes. \nAs is always the case with Iowa teams under Kirk Ferentz, this year's Hawkeyes try to lean on defense and solid special teams. They're fourth in the country in points per game allowed (13.1), and for an Oregon offense that has had some struggles with consistently moving the ball, they're going to have to have one of their best performances of the season to avoid an upset loss on the road. This is an Iowa defense that held Indiana to its lowest scoring output of the season (20 points) and they are among the best in the country at limiting explosives. The Hawkeyes have allowed the second-fewest plays of 10+ yards (56) in the nation, tied with Ohio State and Oregon. With big plays at a premium in this game, it'll come down to sustaining drives and, perhaps, which defense can create a critical turnover or two. It's hard to know how much to take away from Oregon's 28-7 win against Wisconsin in terrible weather, but going on the road to Iowa City in November is no easy task. There's a reason this line is a short 5.5 and it certainly feels like the Ducks are going to have to prove their bonafides in their new conference by winning an old-school Big Ten kind of game where points are hard to come by. PICK: Oregon 20-16 over Iowa\nWatch Oregon vs. Iowa live Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports App and Paramount+ Premium.No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 19 Missouri\nBeau Pribula's injury put a bit of a damper on the excitement for this game, but Matt Zollers played pretty well after being thrust into action against Vanderbilt, and Eli Drinkwitz had a bye week to get him up to speed and adjust the offense to his strengths. That latter point will present the biggest challenge to Texas A&M, as they'll be flying a bit blind into this one. Based on what we saw in Nashville, Zollers won't be near the rushing threat Pribula was, but the Tigers might open things up more in the passing game. The Aggies won't have much in the way of tape to figure out exactly what Mizzou will want to do in key situations with Zollers under center, and they'll have to be nimble with their game plan and ready to make necessary adjustments if the Tigers look a bit different than what they prepared for. \nOn offense, the Aggies have been lighting opponents up all season, scoring 31+ in all but one game. Despite losing Le'Veon Moss against Florida, the rushing attack hasn't skipped a beat and Marcel Reed has been spectacular as both a passer and runner this season. They will present the biggest test for this Mizzou defense yet, as the Tigers have been excellent on defense this season but have also benefitted a bit from playing some teams that are happy to grind it out in a slugfest. The Aggies will want to push the tempo and if Mizzou opens up the passing game a bit more with Zollers, I could see this game being more of a shootout. I won't be surprised if there's some early success from the Mizzou offense coming off the bye with a new QB, but I do expect Texas A&M to be able to keep pace and eventually pull ahead to remain unbeaten. PICK: Texas A&M 34-27 over MissouriLSU at No. 4 Alabama\nHow much did LSU's players dislike Brian Kelly? That's what I'm excited to find out this week. The Tigers have looked flat on offense all year and the vibes in Baton Rouge finally got rotten enough that Kelly was ousted despite his massive buyout. Now the Tigers turn things over to Frank Wilson in the interim and his first task is to go into Tuscaloosa and face a Crimson Tide team that is undefeated in SEC play and fresh off a bye week. \nAside from the opening loss to Florida State that looks weirder and weirder each week, the Alabama offense has been able to score on everyone, and if the LSU defense can't get back to the form they showed early in the year, they'll be in trouble. I'm curious to know how much of that was a team that just didn't believe in what their coach was preaching and how much of it is just a team that maybe got figured out.They will need the offense to show something they haven't been able to all season, because Alabama is going to put 24+ points on the board, even if the Tigers play well on the defensive side of the ball. Garrett Nussmeier has taken a beating this year, and the LSU line is going to need to find a way to control the line of scrimmage to give them a chance. We haven't seen that this year, but a coaching change can sometimes light a fire and bring the best out of a group. If this game were in Baton Rouge, you could talk me into the Tide being on upset alert. They have been far more gettable on the road this year, with three one-score wins and the FSU loss. At home? It's been a very different story. Alabama's been a buzzsaw at Bryant-Denny, winning all four games by at least two touchdowns -- including visits from Vanderbilt and Tennessee. I think this will be tight at the half, but Ty Simpson and company will just be too much for LSU's offense to keep up with for four quarters. PICK: Alabama 33-24 over LSU\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Contemporary Era Hall of Fame ballot this year was revealed on Monday and it has some huge names. Before we dive in, there's an important reminder that everyone needs to keep in mind: The Era Committee Hall of Fame ballot is totally different than the BBWAA ballot. Last year, the Classic Era Hall of Fame ballot elected Dave Parker and Dick Allen while the BBWAA ballot sent CC Sabathia, Billy Wagner and Ichiro Suzuki into the Hall of Fame, for a five-man class in total. The Era Committee ballots include players who fell off the BBWAA ballot for one reason or another in addition to non-players like pioneers (Buck O'Neil), umpires (Hank O'Day), managers (Jim Leyland), front office executives (John Schuerholtz) and even commissioners (Bud Selig). The players who fell off the ballot and deserve further consideration sometimes make it, such as the two mentioned above, Fred McGriff, Gil Hodges, Jim Kaat, Minnie Miñoso and Tony Oliva in recent years.Let's break down each of the eight candidates and offer up a prediction at the end. \n        \n            \n                Baseball Hall of Fame unveils Contemporary Era ballot, including Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Don Mattingly\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBarry BondsWe don't need to bother with a stat breakdown. Bonds' stats say he's one of the greatest players in MLB history and there's an argument that he's the greatest. The connection to BALCO in the Mitchell Report is what kept Bonds out via the BBWAA vote and he also received zero votes out of 16 in on the 2023 Contemporary Era ballot. I'm not sure what would be different three years later, but you never know, it could be a favorable panel. \nRoger ClemensCopy and paste what I said about Bonds, sub in \"pitchers\" for \"players\" above and move him ever-so-slightly down, as he doesn't have a great argument for the greatest statistical pitcher ever, but he isn't too far off. These two are forever tied together, to the point that they were on the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot the exact same 10 years. That means, the hunch is they'll either both get in or neither on this ballot.Carlos DelgadoDelgado unfortunately came on the BBWAA ballot at the wrong time. He was on the 2015 ballot with 13 players who are now in the Hall of Fame in addition to Bonds, Clemens, Curt Schilling, Jeff Kent, Gary Sheffield, Sammy Sosa and, well, yeah. It was just ridiculously crowded and, remember, voters are capped at 10 spots on their ballot. Delgado got 21 votes, which was only 3.8% of the electorate and got him booted from the ballot (the threshold to remain on the ballot is 5%). He deserves a longer look, so here it is. In parts of 17 seasons, Delgado was a menace with the bat in his hands. He hit .280/.383/.546 (138 OPS+) with 2,038, 483 doubles, 473 home runs, 1,512 RBI, 1,241 runs and 44.4 WAR. Baseball fans and media alike have long loved good round numbers and Delgado fell 27 home runs shy of what could have been an automatic ticket to Cooperstown with 500 homers. Still, 473 ranks 34th all-time. He was overshadowed through the PED era, though we never heard a whiff of any steroid connection with him. He's 55th in career RBI, too. \nDelgado topped 30 home runs 11 times, topped 100 RBI nine times and went over 100 runs five times. He went over 30 homers and 100 RBI in the same season nine times, tying him for the 12th-most ever. The only players above him are all-time great power hitters.Delgado was a bat-only guy, and as a result, the JAWS/WAR system isn't great for the Hall of Fame case. He's 38th in JAWS among first basemen, well below the average Hall of Fame score (he's at 39.4 with the average Hall of Fame first baseman being 53.5). To illustrate where he falls, he's a bit below Mark Teixeira and barely ahead of Adrian Gonzalez. Jeff KentOne of the greatest power-hitting second basemen of all-time, Kent hung around on the BBWAA ballot the full 10 years, maxing out at 46.5% of the vote. He won an MVP, made five All-Star teams and won four Silver Sluggers. He finished his career a .290/.356/.500 (123 OPS+) hitter with 2,461 hits, 560 doubles, 377 home runs, 1,518 RBI, 1,320 runs and 55.4 WAR. Though he was never able to win a ring, he hit .276/.340/.500 with nine homers and 23 RBI in 49 playoff games. \nKent was not known as a great defender and that's what hurt his case in terms of the WAR. Still, he wouldn't be a terrible addition on this front. He's 22nd in JAWS among second basemen all time, ahead of Hall of Famers Bobby Doerr, Nellie Fox, Tony Lazzeri and Johnny Evers, among others. He's a touch behind Jose Altuve, Dustin Pedroia and Ian Kinsler and sits below the average current  Hall of Fame second baseman, so he shouldn't be a shoo-in either. Lou Whitaker and Bobby Grich, for example, are the ones currently sticking out like a sore thumb in terms of quality selections at second base, but they will be on a different Era Committee ballot, hopefully. Do the home runs impress you? Kent is the all-time leader in homers among second basemen. He's third in RBI behind all-time greats and Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby and Nap Lajoie. Don MattinglyA mid-career back injury has kept Mattingly out of the Hall of Fame to this point. Through his first eight seasons, ending with his age-28 year, Mattingly was a .323/.368/.521 (144 OPS+) hitter. He'd already racked up 33.3 WAR, 1,300 hits, 164 home runs, 717 RBI and 615 runs. He won an MVP, and also finished second, fifth and seventh in voting. The rest of his career, he only had a 105 OPS+ while averaging 128 games and 1.5 WAR per season. \nWe're left with a guy who hit .307/.358/.471 (126 OPS+) at a corner infield position. He finished with 2,153 hits, 442 doubles, 222 home runs, 1,099 RBI, 1,007 runs and 42.4 WAR. In addition to the MVP, he was a six-time All-Star, won nine Gold Gloves and three Silver Sluggers.Among the most statistically similar players to Mattingly through age 28: Freddie Freeman, Jim Rice, Jeff Bagwell and Rafael Palmeiro. In looking at entire careers, the top three most similar players, statistically to Mattingly are Cecil Cooper, Wally Joyner and Hal McRae. He never got more than 28.2% on the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot, but the 2023 Contemporary Era Committee threw Mattingly eight of the 16 votes. He's got a shot here, even if his statistical case falls short due to his lack of longevity. \nDale MurphySimilar to Mattingly, Murphy's prime was glorious, but he didn't compile a bunch and had rough late years. Unlike with Mattingly, it didn't appear to be directly due to an injury ruining his career. Murphy won two MVPs, five Gold Gloves, four Silver Sluggers and made seven All-Star teams. He led the league in homers twice, RBI twice, runs once, slugging twice and walks once. He finished a .265/.346/.469 (121 OPS+) hitter with 2,111 hits, 350 doubles, 398 home runs, 1,266 RBI, 1,197 runs and 161 stolen bases. With the JAWS system, Murphy sits firmly in \"Hall of the Very Good\" territory. He's 27th among center fielders, behind Johnny Damon and Fred Lynn and just ahead of Andrew McCutchen, Bernie Williams and Brett Butler. The top three statistical comparisons are Andruw Jones, Joe Carter and McCutchen, though it should be noted Hall of Famer Duke Snider sits fourth. \nMurphy never got more than 23.2% of the vote on the BBWAA ballot, but on the 2023 Contemporary Era ballot, he got six of the 16 votes. Gary SheffieldSheffield has admitted he used \"the cream\" from BALCO, which was a steroid. He said he didn't know it was a steroid. This is probably the main reason he never got in via the BBWAA ballot. Defensive shortcomings and some off-the-field issues, especially from his Brewers years, also came up.With the bat in his hands, though, Sheffield was a true artist, starting with baseball's most famous, and scariest, bat waggle. He finished his career hitting .292/.393/.514 (140 OPS+) with 2,689 hits, 467 doubles, 509 home runs, 1,676 RBI, 1,636 runs and 60.5 WAR. His counting stats are the best among hitters here if we ignore Bonds. Sheffield is 70th in career hits, 35th in total bases, 27th in home runs, 30th in RBI, 39th in runs, 30th in times on base and 21st in walks. He walked 304 times more than he struck out in his career, an outlier among power hitters of his generation. \nA late surge got Sheffield to 63.9% of the vote in his last time on the BBWAA ballot, but I'm dubious about his chances with the Era Committee in light of the PED baggage. Until we see movement on Bonds, I'm just not seeing a lane for Sheffield. Fernando ValenzuelaValenzuela died just before the 2024 World Series and it put a renewed emphasis on his importance in Dodgers history and, frankly, MLB history. I did a dive last December on how death can sometimes, seemingly indirectly, give a little push for Hall of Fame candidates and said I thought it would help get Dick Allen in. It did. In that same piece, I mentioned that I wouldn't be surprised to see Valenzuela on this ballot and that came true as well. I also had this to say: Knowing what we know now about arm injuries, I also can't help but wonder if we should grant Valenzuela a little leeway in Hall of Fame discussions, given his early workload. From his age-20-26 seasons, he averaged 255 innings and 14 complete games per season. Through his age-25 season, he had a 2.94 career ERA. From age 26 through the rest of his career, he had a 4.23 ERA. Shoulder injuries surfaced in 1987, when he was 26. Through 1986, Valenzuela was a six-time All-Star with a Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and a World Series ring. He finished in the top five of Cy Young voting four times. He'd never make an All-Star team or get a Cy Young vote again. In all, though, his career numbers compare somewhat decently with Jack Morris, who made the Hall of Fame via the Modern Baseball Era Committee in 2018. And, again, I think Fernandomania and his impact on Dodgers fans can and should absolutely be part of the discussion. It's a Hall of Fame, not a Hall of only the most elite players who never faltered in their careers. I think the path is clear right now. PredictionThere's a yet-to-be-announced panel of 16 people who will meet in a room and discuss the players before casting votes during the winter meetings. Any of the above players would need at least 12 votes to get into the Hall of Fame. Without knowing the panel, it is incredibly difficult to make predictions. I'll eliminate Bonds, Clemens and Sheffield from the get go. I think it's going to be decades -- if ever -- before the PED-connected players get through a panel. I do think Mattingly, Murphy, Delgado, Kent and Valenzuela will get strong looks from the committee.I'll say Valenzuela, Mattingly and Murphy get in and those are ordered by my level of confidence in them making it. I'm near certain on Valenzuela and I have a good feeling for Mattingly. I wouldn't be surprised if they go crazy and find a way to get Kent and/or Delgado in too. If you don't think that's possible, look no further than the 2022 Hall of Fame class. The Early Baseball and Golden Era Committees (yes, there were two that year, but still ... ) inducted six guys. The class will be anywhere from one to five guys. Valenzuela is getting in while Sheffield, Bonds and Clemens are not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        That's a wrap on the 2025 NWSL regular season after a wild Decision Day. The playoff bracket is finally set, and the postseason brings out a new energy for teams in the mix. Players battled for final spots and to generate as much momentum as possible for the new journey ahead, which means it's time for Attacking Third's team of the week. After weekly fixtures across the 2025 NWSL campaign, Attacking Third analysts select a team of the week, head coach, and honorary captain based on performances across the weekend. If you're keeping track of who has been on our past lineups, make sure to look back at our team selections from week 25.NWSL playoff weekend gears up Friday with Orlando Pride and Seattle Reign. The quarterfinal will conclude on Sunday as first-place Kansas City hosts eighth-place Gotham FC, and No. 3 Portland Thorns FC faces No. 6 San Diego Wave FC.Racing Louisville clinched its first-ever postseason birth with a nail-biting, 1-0, win over Bay FC on Sunday. The final result lifted them up into seventh place, and they'll face No. 2-seeded Washington Spirit on Saturday (Nov. 8, 12:30 p.m. ET on CBS). \nCBS is the home of the NWSL Championship, and teams will compete for a spot in the final on Nov. 22. Fans can watch select NWSL playoff matches across CBS platforms, including CBS, CBS Sports Network, Paramount+, and CBS Sports Golazo Network.Take a look at our best XI:\nGoalkeeper: Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals)In a season of highs and lows for the Utah Royals, Mandy McGlynn has been a bit of calm and consistency for the club this year. While it took the group some time to get going, they were nearly unstoppable in the second half of the season, and a clean sheet against the No. 2 seed will just be more momentum for this squad to build off next year. Defender: Carson Pickett (Orlando Pride)As the Orlando Pride begin their title defense, the 2024 NWSL Champions will need all hands on deck to make a deep playoff run. Veteran fullback Carson Pickett has become a go-to x-factor for the squad off the bench, and she scored a big goal on decision day for the team to keep them at home for the quarterfinals.\nDefender: Arin Wright (Racing Louisville)Defender Arin Wright has stepped up for the group with leadership and experience, and aided the team once again by helping maintain a clean sheet in front of goalkeeper Jordan Bloomer. She led the team in clearances (five) and shots (four). \n\"The beginning of the season, we came out, we found our identity. We knew who we were. And we were bought into it. And every team has their slump throughout the season. We had that slump. We kept getting scored on, in the 90th minute of games, and it was just so defeating, game after game,\" Wright told Attacking Third after Louisville's playoff clinch. \"But I think it just really is a testament to this group and the individuals here and the resilience that they have as players to go through that spell of games and then at the back end of the season, pull through and have the games that we have and finish the way that we did still within that identity that we had on the front end of the season.\"\nDefender: Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC)The 19-year-old center back has taken a huge step in development this year as a crucial piece of Seattle's iconic five-back.  She's found herself on the end of big goals from distance this season, and decision day was no different, with her equalizer off a recycled set piece.\nDefender: Janine Sonis (Racing Louisville FC)When Racing Louisville needed a big adjustment on the backline, a former forward stepped up. Janine Sonis' ability to direct attack from a lower position has paid off, and games for Racing have often flowed through her. She led the team in chances created (eight) and touches (69) on decision day.Midfielder: Manaka Matsukubo (North Carolina Courage)North Carolina Courage came up just short of the 2025 NWSL postseason, but they went out with a bang and plenty of positives to end on. Japan international Manaka Matsukubo went on a complete tear in the second half of the season, scoring seven of her 11 regular-season goals, including this long-distance goalkeeper chip. \nMidfielder: Jessie Fleming (Portland Thorns FC)A massive performance by Canadian international Jessie Fleming for Portland Thorns on Decision Day, with a goal and an assist. They'll need her playmaking skills as they begin the playoffs, especially if she's scoring daggers from distance like this one:\nMidfielder: Claudia Zornoza (Utah Royals)The end of the regular season brought plenty of excitement but also a slew of farewells. Midfielder Claudia Zornoza is retiring after a 17-year career and led the team in recoveries (five) and chances created (three).\nForward: Debinha (Kansas City Current)The 2025 NWSL Shield winners were without Temwa Chawinga on decision day and lost Bia Zaneratto early in the final regular-season game. It didn't matter because the Current have Debinha on the roster. The Brazilian international scored a clinical free kick that froze everyone in the box.\nForward: Jordan Huitema (Seattle Reign FC)It's no secret that the Wave have been in a drought in front of goal, but that's finally changing now that Delphine Cascarino is back in the mix. She's back on the active roster after nursing a knee injury and setting up teammates for crucial goals.\"Jordan Huitema for me, and when she came on and what she did for Seattle, she just changed the picture,\" Attacking Third analyst McCall Zerboni said.\"Her aerial presence, her hold up play, and by the way, she had this one moment where she sprinted off the ball, and I was like, 'girl, when did you get fast?' Like she is actually quite quick, she can move, and so I wish she would stretch the line a little bit more. She's always checking back to give her a hold-up play, but she shows that she can also run in behind, and I feel like if they had done that more tonight, they would have had more chances against Orlando, but anyway, she was a standout, did great.\"\nForward: Ella Hase (Racing Louisville)First-year players stepping up in big-time moments and making even bigger plays are just part of Racing Louisville's story this season. Rookie Ella Hase helped the club achieve playoff history with her game winning goal on decision day.\nCoach: Bev Yanez (Racing Louisville FC)It's no secret that Racing Louisville is stepping into the playoff spotlight as everyone's underdog favorite, and a big part of their journey is head coach Bev Yanez. Whether it's making positional adjustments by converting Janine Sonis or giving the group time to form their identity, Yanez is also making history of her own as the first former NWSL player to turn head coach and appear in NWSL playoffs. Honorary captain: Decision DayYou don't know what you've got till it's gone. After a one-year absence from the schedule, decision day made its return in 2025 and delivered plenty of big moments. Despite only one playoff spot up for grabs, table seeding was still on the line, and players took the opportunity to showcase their talents. Here's to more wild moments together in the future. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the 2025 NFL trade deadline set for Tuesday, Nov. 4, every new deal from here on out will shape the playoff chase or accelerate a rebuild. Movement really began in early October, nearly a month before the deadline, when the Cleveland Browns sent Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals in a rare in-division trade as part of Cincinnati's effort to stabilize their quarterback room, and that was just the start of what figures to be a busy few weeks. Expect fringe contenders like the Steelers and Buccaneers to explore upgrades, while teams stuck near the bottom, such as the Jets and Saints, weigh offers for veterans who could bring back draft capital.To help you track all the NFL trade deals ahead of the deadline, we'll be logging every move in one place with concise analysis highlighting who got better, who got future assets, and what it means for the season ahead. Whether it's a blockbuster involving a former Pro Bowler or a depth move that fills a key injury gap, this page will be your running guide through deadline season.Ravens acquire Dre'Mont Jones from Titans (11/3)   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ravens get: Dre'Mont Jones  Edge rusher depth to fill void left by Odafe OwehThe Ravens' pass rush desperately needed help, as they rank bottom five in the NFL in sacks (11) and pressure rate (27%) this season. While Jones can help fill some of the void left from the Odafe Oweh trade, it's not nearly the swing Baltimore needs to take at this position. Jones has come on strong lately with 4.5 sacks and nine quarterback hits in his last four games, but that's likely the ceiling for a pass rusher who will be playing for his fourth team. He's on a one-year deal and has never had more than 6.5 sacks in a season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Titans get: conditional fifth-round pick Draft capital for rebuilding TitansIt's a bit surprising to see the Titans get a conditional fifth-round pick for Jones when they got the same price for cornerback Roger McCreary when they traded him to the Rams last week. It's a good price for a journeyman pass rusher on a one-year deal, but maybe they should have gotten more for McCreary? Look for the 1-8 Titans to continue collecting draft picks. Could Jeffery Simmons, Arden Key, Tony Pollard or Calvin Ridley be next?\nDolphins trade edge rusher Jaelan Phillips to Philly (11/3)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dolphins get: 2026 third-round pickMiami's selloff beginsAt 2-7 on the season, the Dolphins were pegged as sellers leading up to the deadline. The interesting wrinkle, however, was that the team just parted ways with GM Chris Grier on Friday, which left questions as to how interim GM Champ Kelly would operate. Well, he made his first move, shipping Phillips, a first-round pick in 2021, to Philly. The edge rusher is in the final year of his deal, so Miami picks up a Day 2 draft selection for a player on an expiring contract. That's another asset to help with what feels like a total rebuild. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Eagles get: Jaelan PhillipsPhiladelphia finally addresses edge rusherHowie Roseman has made a couple of trades over the past week, but all the deals prior have addressed the secondary. The Eagles desperately needed a boost off the edge as the team has been getting little to no impact from that position this season, and even needed the likes of Brandon Graham to come out of retirement to help the unit out. While a third-round pick for an expiring contract is a hefty price, Philly is in a position to take such a swing as they are in a Super Bowl window. Meanwhile, as NFL Media reports, the third-rounder heading to Miami is Philadelphia's. The club previously owned two thirds, including one from the Jets. That higher selection (New York's) stays in possession of the Eagles. As for Phillips himself, the former first-rounder has flashed when he's been on the field. He tallied 15.5 sacks over his first two seasons, but injuries have derailed his career since. At just 26 years old, however, Phillips is a strong bet not only for the second half, but possibly beyond.Eagles land Jaire Alexander from Ravens (11/1)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Eagles get: Jaire Alexander, 2027 seventh-round pickEagles continue to add to secondary Philadelphia is buying low on Alexander, who didn't live up to expectations with the Ravens. While he arrives to the Eagles as a notable name, this should be looked at as a depth piece in the secondary as oppose to a set-and-forget starter. Still, it's a wise dice roll for Howie Roseman as Alexander is effective when healthy, and acquiring him for a late Day 3 pick is a worthwhile price to see if they can tap back into his days with the Green Bay Packers. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ravens get: 2026 sixth-round pickBaltimore offloads oft-injured veteranWhen the Ravens first acquired Alexander this offseason, there was the hope that he'd become a linchpin to their secondary but that never materialized. As was the case in his final years in Green Bay, Alexander dealt with injuries during his short Baltimore tenure. He appeared in just two games overall. Initially, that was due to a knee injury, but had since been a healthy scratch, which included the team's Week 9 win over Miami. So, the Ravens rid themselves of a descending player and acquire a Day 3 pick in next years draft in the process.  Eagles acquire Michael Carter II from Jets (10/29)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Eagles get: Michael Carter II, 2027 seventh-round pickPhilly gets much-needed secondary helpPhiladelphia's secondary needed a boost at the deadline. Specifically, outside corner was a big need opposite of Quinyon Mitchell. This week, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio talked about possibly moving Cooper DeJean to the other outside corner spot opposite Mitchell and this deal helps that transition. Carter is a slot corner who was the highest-paid player at the position when he inked his three-year, $30.75 million extension in September of 2024. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jets get: John Metchie III, 2027 sixth-rounderNew York gains future asset, depth at WRThe Jets are sitting at 1-7 on the season and firmly in rebuilding mode for the foreseeable future. By moving on from Carter, New York gets out in front of a looming contract squabble. While Carter was signed through 2027, the corner only has $2.3 million remaining in guarantees. Instead of possibly being faced with a restructure this offseason, they ship him out and move up a round at the 2027 NFL Draft. It also sets up Jarvis Brownlee, Jr., whom they acquired from Tennessee, to see more time in the slot. As for the Metchie piece to the equation, he should be looked at as a depth piece for the rest of 2025, as he is set to be a free agent this offseason. \nSteelers add to secondary with Kyle Dugger (10/28)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Steelers get: Kyle Dugger, seventh-round pickPittsburgh takes dart throw on former standoutAfter two straight weeks of watching Pittsburgh's defense get torched, Mike Tomlin and co. have seen enough. On the same day they signed former Commanders starting safety Darrick Forrest to the practice squad, the Steelers acquired former Patriots starting safety Kyle Dugger in a late-round pick swap.Dugger, 29, collected nine interceptions from 2021-23 and signed a four-year, $58 million extension in the 2024 offseason. However, he played through an ankle injury last season, underwent offseason surgery and was behind the eight ball to start this season under new coach Mike Vrabel. Pittsburgh really needs the secondary help, though, after Jordan Love threw for 360 yards and three touchdowns in Week 8, and Joe Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns in Week 7. Dugger has solid speed and ball production on his resume, and with DeShon Elliott week-to-week with a knee injury suffered against Green Bay, he could see the field sooner rather than later.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Patriots get: Sixth-round pickNew England moves on, moves up in draftWe could write similar things here as we did for the Keion White trade below, which happened just minutes before this one. Dugger wasn't in the plans for coach Mike Vrabel and inside linebackers coach Zak Kuhr, who is calling plays in defensive coordinator Terrell Williams' absence. In fact, like White, Dugger was inactive in Week 8, with Jaylinn Hawkins and Craig Woodson as the team's top safeties.\nPerhaps New England is making moves to add to their current roster after their 6-2 start, or perhaps it is continuing to build for the future. It's never fun or easy to move on from players who were significant investments, but it appears New England has opted for better fits in Vrabel's eyes -- or at least future draft compensation.Trade grades | Full analysis49ers acquire Keion White from Patriots (10/28)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    49ers get: Keion White, seventh-round pickSan Francisco hopes to bolster defensive frontNearly every part of the 49ers' roster has been hit by injuries, and edge defender is no exception. San Francisco lost Nick Bosa (ACL) for the season in Week 3 and ranks 30th in the NFL in pressure rate since. It should be noted that this move comes immediately after the 49ers lost to the Texans 26-15 and failed to sack C.J. Stroud despite his penchant for taking sacks behind a poor offensive line. Bryce Huff, the team's sack leader, also missed the game. Houston also ran for 157 yards in the winWhite, a second-round pick out of Wisconsin in 2023, showed some promise in last year's five-sack campaign, but he had fallen somewhat out of favor in New England this season, playing just 40% of the team's defensive snaps. He has a 4% pressure rate, one of the worst rates of any defensive lineman, but he had a 11.4% rate last year, so the 49ers are hoping a change of scenery will do him good. Plus, at 285 pounds, he should be able to hold up more sturdily against the run.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Patriots get: sixth-round pickNew England can move on thanks to impactful offseason additionsWhite simply didn't end up being a fit for the new regime in New England, and with upgrades around him -- the team signed big-name free agents Milton Williams and Harold Landry III and is getting strong production from smaller signees K'Lavon Chaisson and Khyiris Tonga -- he became expendable. The Patriots' much-improved pass rush and Drake Maye's leap to stardom has helped New England get off to a 6-2 start, and it now can go on the hunt for an addition before the deadline or simply pocket the extra pick for next season as GM Eliot Wolf and coach Mike Vrabel continue to build their roster.Trade grades | Full analysisTitans send Roger McCreary to L.A. (10/27)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rams get: Roger McCreary, conditional sixth-round pickL.A. bolsters defense with veteran cornerLos Angeles is building on its strength. Already, the Rams are one of the top defenses in the NFL and have held opposing quarterbacks to an 84.6 passer rating, which is the sixth-lowest in the NFL. Despite that, the Rams have been dealing with injuries to the unit, with Ahkello Witherspoon on injured reserve. Now, they buy in on a former second-round pick who can play both inside and outside, and that versatility should be a welcome addition for Sean McVay. McCreary is in the final year of his deal, so this is currently looked at as a pure rental for Los Angeles, but it comes at minimal cost. They get a starting-caliber corner while simply moving down one round in the draft as they get a sixth-rounder in return, along with McCreary, while shipping out a fifth. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Titans get: Conditional fifth-round pickTennessee's sell-off beginsThe Titans are actually getting back their own fifth-round pick in this deal, per NFL Media. The Rams had acquired it in the deal involving Ernest Jones IV, but now get that selection back in their draft cupboard. However, it remains to be seen what the conditional aspect of this trade is, so that fifth-rounder could be the floor depending on how McCreary plays. Really, this is a move aimed at bolstering their draft board as the rebuild continues around Cam Ward and whoever they eventually hire as head coach. McCreary was a pending free agent and not in their long-term plans, so attaching a mid-Day 3 pick to an expendable player to move up a round is a prudent move.Trade grades | Full analysisJaguars, Browns swap cornerbacks (10/9)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jags get: Greg Newsome, sixth-round pickLanky corner in final year of rookie dealThis is a win-now move. Jacksonville gets a solid cornerback in Newsome, who has graded out well this year, allowing just a 52% completion rate as the primary defender, on track to be the best of his career. Through five Weeks, he's Pro Football Focus' 33rd-ranked cornerback out of 85 who have played at least 150 defensive snaps; Campbell is 57th.Newsome is in the fifth and final year of his rookie deal, so he's set to be a free agent at the end of this season. There's a significant scheme adjustment here, too, as the Browns play the highest rate of man coverage in the league by far, while Jacksonville is 23rd, but clearly the Jaguars see plenty to like in Newsome. Jacksonville does take on a $19.5-million dead cap hit in 2026, but that's a problem for a few months from now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Tyson Campbell, seventh-round pickSolid starter getting a fresh startThis is a depth improvement for Cleveland. Campbell had a strong 2024 season after signing a four-year, $76.5 million extension, but the new Jaguars regime clearly wanted to move on from him after a slow start to this season. A significant chunk of that deal has already been paid, meaning the Browns will get to look at Campbell for nearly an entire season and evaluate how he fits both now and in the future. Campbell has had some injury issues, but when he's healthy, he's a starting-caliber cornerback, and one who's under team control well into the future.Trade grades | Full analysisHarbaughs do defensive business (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chargers get: Odafe Oweh, seventh-round pickAthletic but inconsistent edge rusherThis is a win-now move for Los Angeles. Oweh broke out last season with 10 sacks in 2024  -- double his previous career high – but the 2021 first-round pick is yet to record a sack this season. His pressure rate this season – 10.3% – is slightly lower than his 11.7% last year, but neither are particularly impressive numbers; he was at 17.2% in 2023.\nPerhaps time had simply run its course for Oweh in Baltimore. He was playing on the fifth-year option  of his rookie deal and will be a free agent this offseason. In Los Angeles, he'll play under innovative defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and hope to provide pressure both before and after Khalil Mack returns from an elbow injury. Through five weeks, Los Angeles ranks 19th in pressure rate.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ravens get: Alohi Gilman, fifth-round pickReliable safety, plus a better draft pickI see this as a dart throw. Things have already gone majorly off the rails for Baltimore (1-4), and trading away a former first-round pick certainly wasn't on the Bingo card one month ago. But Baltimore has better depth and youth on the edge than it does at safety, where ArDarius Washington tore his Achilles during the offseason and Kyle Hamilton has been dealing with a groin injury. That left undrafted rookie Reuben Lowery to play every defensive snap of a 44-10 Week 5 loss to the Texans.Trade grades | Full analysisFlacco gets new job, stays in Ohio (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bengals get: Joe Flacco, sixth-round pickAging pocket passer hoping to raise the floorSometimes, the NFL is about optics, and the Bengals trailing 28-3 at halftime and Jake Browning getting booed off the field after his third interception in an eventual 37-24 loss to the Lions in Week 4 was bad, bad optics. Enter Flacco, whom Cleveland benched after Week 4. Through five weeks, Browning was dead last in expected points added per dropback. Flacco was third-worst.\nThe Bengals are hoping Flacco can provide a similar boost to the one he provided Cleveland in 2023, when it ended up making the playoffs thanks to a late-season surge. The Bengals don't have near the defense the Browns do, and the offensive line is a mess, but for a cheap price, it's a move that makes sense. If Flacco recaptures the magic, great. If he doesn't, this season was probably lost the moment Joe Burrow got hurt anyway. It's a total dart throw. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Fifth-round pickA modest gain in draft positionFlacco was no longer part of the plan in Cleveland, which moves up a round in the draft.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs have arrived, and the action kicks off with a two-game slate on Saturday as Wild Card Weekend begins. The first kick Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5, 46.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with the rubber match between the Bears and Packers (-1.5, 45.5) then following at 8 p.m. ET. The NFL DFS player pool will be highlighted by Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Bryce Young, Josh Jacobs, Jordan Love, Caleb Williams and DJ Moore. How should you build your NFL DFS lineups for Saturday's two-game slate, and which sleepers should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any Saturday NFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Jacobs as an anytime TD scorer (-120) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account.

Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Wild Card Saturday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Wild Card SaturdayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Saturday is Nacua. The third-year player leads the NFL with 129 receptions and is second in receiving yards at 1,715. He had 10 receiving touchdowns and one score on the ground as well. He had a solid 6-72 receiving line against the Panthers earlier this season, but will be on the hunt for bigger numbers in this playoff setting. It was actually Davante Adams who burned Carolina with two scores in that game, but with Adams coming off a hamstring injury, the door could be open for a huge evening for Nacua. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Nacua to go Over 91.5 receiving yards at DraftKings Sportsbook:\nMcClure is also building his Saturday NFL DFS strategy around Bears receiver Luther Burden III. The rookie out of Missouri has become a huge part of Chicago's passing attack down the stretch. He's been targeted at least six times in five of the past six games. That span includes an 8-64 game against the Browns and a massive 8-138-1 game against the 49ers. The Packers have given up the 20th-most Fantasy points to opposing receivers this season, and Burden had four receptions for 67 yards against them on Dec. 7. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Burden to go Over 43.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Wild Card Saturday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Saturday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Akshay Bhatia has turned down a significant offer to join LIV Golf, according to Golf Channel. Bhatia is the latest PGA Tour player that the league, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has attempted to poach as it gears up for its 2026 season set to kick off next month.Bhatia would have been the biggest name to sign with LIV Golf amid an offseason that largely missed the ball. Min Woo Lee, Sungjae Im and Si Woo Kim were all international players LIV Golf unsuccessfully recruited with each taking to social media to confirm they will be playing on the PGA Tour in 2026.\nThe 24-year-old Bhatia has been a full-time PGA Tour member since 2023. During his time with the tour, the wiry left-hander has racked up two victories and finished T3 at last year's Players Championship, just a couple of strokes outside of a playoff. By all accounts, Bhatia is a star in the making. He is expected to compete for spots on future U.S. Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup teams.In addition to being stiff-armed at the recruitment level, LIV Golf lost one of its biggest stars as Brooks Koepka parted ways with the league, announcing in December that he will be focusing on his family in 2026 with many believing a return to the PGA Tour is imminent once a pathway is cleared.\nKoepka won five times on LIV Golf since 2023 and was the first player from the circuit to reign supreme on the major stage when he claimed the 2023 PGA Championship.In the place of Koepka, Talor Gooch has stepped up as captain of Smash GC. Harold Varner III will reportedly join the team as Thomas Detry and Elvis Smylie enter the league. Detry finished inside the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings in 2025 thanks to his win at the WM Phoenix Open, while Smylie is an exciting young talent from Australia who won the Australian PGA Championship at the end of 2024.\nOther LIV Golf newcomers include Victor Perez and Laurie Canter, who earned a PGA Tour card for the 2026 season by finishing inside the top 10 of the Race to Dubai on the DP World Tour. Instead of trying his hand on the PGA Tour, though, the Englishman ultimately decided to return to LIV Golf where he primarily played in 2023.\n            \n    ",

There's no word yet on what the Marlins' return would be, but it's likely a package of prospects. Neither team has yet announced the deal. Cabrera, who turns 28 in April, is coming off a strong 2025 campaign for the Marlins. \nThe numbers above were good for an ERA+ of 125, which he backed up with a career-best FIP of 3.83. As well, Cabrera's 137 ⅔ innings this past season were a career high. For his career, he's put up an ERA+ of 108 and a WAR of 7.1 across parts of five MLB seasons. \nCBS Sports had previously ranked Cabrera as one of the top potential trade candidates of the 2025-26 offseason. That's not only because of his strong top-line results in his most recent campaign, but also because of his arm talent. In 2025, Cabrera ranked in the 87th percentile among major-league pitchers with an average fastball velocity of 96.9 mph. Compare him to starters only and he would've placed even higher. He was also around the 75th percentile among all pitchers in strikeout percentage, chase rate, whiff rate, and groundball percentage. Cabrera boasts a five-pitch repertoire and last season he earned better than a 40% swinging-strike rate on his curve and his slider. As well, Cabrera's high trade value reflects the fact that he's not eligible for free agency until after the 2028 season.Over his career, Cabrera has dealt with a number of arm problems, including stints on the injured list for elbow tendinitis, a shoulder impingement, and just last September an elbow strain. However, the Cubs are no doubt hoping that Cabrera will be able to avoid any major arm maladies on their watch and build off his career-high 26 starts last season. If indeed he is healthy and durable moving forward, then Cabrera promises frontline upside in the Cubs rotation. \nCabrera would join a Cubs rotation that already has lefties Matthew Boyd and Shota Imanaga along with righties Jameson Taillon and Cade Horton, the latter coming off a very promising rookie season. Colin Rea adds depth and lefty Justin Steele will be returning from Tommy John surgery at some point.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\nPerhaps the most compelling matchup of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend -- at least the one generating the most polarizing opinions -- sees the Buffalo Bills visiting the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. ET from EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville. The Bills (12-5), who are the No. 6 seed in the AFC, delivered a solid if uneven season that fell a bit short of most preseason expectations. They had the highest over/under team win total in the NFL future odds at 12.5 and fell one victory shy of clipping that lofty number. They were also the Super Bowl betting favorite with odds of around +600 but enter the postseason as the No. 6 favorite among the 14 playoff teams with odds of +1000 at DraftKings. Conversely, the Jaguars (13-4) turned in a stunning season in their first year under coach Liam Coen, capturing the AFC South title and the imagination of football fans who love to root for the trendy underdog. Jacksonville, the No. 3 seed in the AFC, crushed its over/under win total of 7.5 and enters the postseason as arguably the hottest team in the NFL behind an eight-game winning streak that followed a 1-3 midseason stretch. The Jaguars currently have Super Bowl odds of +1300 at DraftKings. The Bills are 1-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 52 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Buffalo vs. Jacksonville in the NFL Wild Card Round. Here is a look at the Bills vs. Jaguars matchup from a betting perspective: Bills vs. Jaguars oddsOpening spread: Bills -1Opening money line: Bills -115, Jaguars-105Opening total: 51.5 Bills betting profile\nOpening win total: 12.5 wins  W/L record: 12-5ATS record: 8-9 O/U record: 9-8 The Bills' 8-9 ATS record suggests they were at least somewhat overvalued in the betting market, though a couple of trends stand out. For one, they have been historically reliable ATS against inferior opponents but failed to cover the spread in home victories over the Dolphins, Saints and Bengals. However, reigning MVP Josh Allen and friends stepped up at times against quality opponents and notched wins and covers against persistent nemesis Kansas City and notched a remarkable 21-point comeback for a 35-31 victory in their rematch against the New England Patriots. The primary argument for Bills supporters lies in their faith in Allen, who has shown he is capable of carrying the team despite limited offensive weapons and a vulnerable defense. With rival Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs out of the picture for the first time in Allen's career, the path is clear for the Bills to make a long-coveted Super Bowl appearance. Jaguars betting profile\nOpening win total: 7.5 wins  W/L record: 13-4ATS record: 11-5-1 O/U record: 8-9 The Jaguars were expected to take a step forward amid the hiring of Coen, a first-time head coach who gained a reputation as an offensive-minded maven while serving as the offensive coordinator of the Buccaneers. They appeared improved but erratic in the early going, and it seemed a leaky defense could be their undoing after squandering a 20-point lead to the offensively-challenged Texans in a 36=29 loss that dropped them to 5-4. However, they finished the season on a torrid stretch that saw QB Trevor Lawrence, the much-criticized No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, find the most efficient stretch of his career as the Jaguars averaged nearly 34 points during their current winning streak. The offense was aided by a resurgence from Lawrence's former Clemson teammate, RB Travis Etienne, and the midseason acquisition of reliable wideout Jakobi Meyers. Those who favor the Jaguars on Sunday can make the logical argument that this is simply a locomotive that you don't want to get in front of, especially one with home-field advantage against a flawed opponent. Bills-Jaguars prop pickKhalil Shakir Over 4.5 receptions (-120): Shakir remains the closet thing to a WR1 for Allen among a rag-tag group of Buffalo pass catchers. He finished with team highs of 72 catches and 719 yards with four touchdowns. Although his usage sometimes fluctuated, we expect him to be a integral part of a Bills offense that will need to keep pace with Jacksonville. The high total suggests an offense-heavy game script and the quick hitters that Shakir often sees near the line of scrimmage -- tantamount to long handoffs to the speedy wideout -- should be in play as a means for the Bills to consistently get decent yardage on early downs. Moreover, if the Bills find themselves trailing in the second half, Shakir will be relied upon as a downfield option. Ultimately, we feel Shakir's role is largely game-script proof and expect him to clear this number with room to spare. \n            ",

In order to hoist the CFP trophy at season's end, the title winner must win two more games against the toughest competition in the sport and put a bow on their title run with a victory in the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship. That means three consecutive postseason wins in total, or four if the eventual champion played in the first round.Last year's winner, Ohio State, ran the table despite having to play in the first round. Now that the bracket has been reconstructed with a straight-seeding model for 2025, will one of the four teams to receive a first-round bye take advantage of needing one fewer win to reach the mountaintop? No. 1 Indiana is the only such squad remaining after No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Texas Tech each lost in the quarterfinals, and the Hoosiers will be the favorites to win the championship so long as they remain in contention.Indiana must first get past No. 5 Oregon, which already has two CFP wins under its belt and just eliminated Texas Tech in shutout fashion. The Hoosiers handed the Ducks their only loss of the campaign when the Big Ten foes met in the regular season. The rematch is set for Jan. 9 in the Peach Bowl.\nOn the other side of the bracket, No. 6 Ole Miss meets No. 10 Miami on Jan. 8 in the Fiesta Bowl. Neither program had ever reached the CFP prior to this season, but they proved that the selection committee made the right choice in including them for the 2025 version with back-to-back wins to open the tournament. One of the two will play for the national championship.In fact, regardless of what occurs in the semifinals, the winner of the Jan. 19 title game will become a first-time CFP champion. And for Oregon and Indiana, the first national championship in program history regardless of selecting organization is on the table.\nCFP National Championship location, date, timeDate: Monday, Jan. 19 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After an interesting 2025, boxing is looking to make some big leaps in the new year. The early 2026 schedule is already showing promise with some big fights already on the calendar.As with every new year, the CBS Sports boxing experts are looking ahead to make bold predictions on the action to come.From a new pound-for-pound king to an ill-advised rematch of one of the biggest fights ever to the expectation of a year filled with huge fights, we've put together a list of what we expect in the ring in 2026.\n        \n            \n                Best of boxing in 2025: Terence Crawford's historic win over Canelo Alvarez earns Fighter of the Year honors\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's check out what the CBS Sports boxing experts are looking forward to this year.\nShakur Stevenson will become pound-for-pound kingDespite already being a three-division champion (and fighting for a fourth title on Jan. 31), it has taken longer than most initially expected for the 28-year-old southpaw from Newark, New Jersey, to find himself on the verge of not just true stardom but legitimate critical acclaim. But with a series of injuries and self-imposed boring performances behind him, Stevenson has set himself up for an absolutely huge 2026. Last July, Stevenson scored his biggest victory to date by disciplining unbeaten slugger William Zepeda in a fight in which the typically slick and defensive Stevenson did wonders for his reputation by choosing to stand and trade on the inside throughout. And he returns in January against 140-pound lineal champion Teofimo Lopez Jr. in not just his toughest fight to date on paper, but one that would likely lift Stevenson into the top five on a pound-for-pound list with a victory. Considering Stevenson has already said he would be willing to move up to welterweight for the right fight in 2026, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist has the opportunity to truly fulfill his potential from a P4P standpoint. And it doesn't hurt that Terence Crawford recently retired, Oleksandr Usyk is winding down his career and Naoya Inoue is firmly in the second half of his own legendary career. Stevenson's shot at greatness is firmly on the horizon. -- Brian Campbell\nAs the sport shifts, fans are treated to massive fightsThis may feel like a generic prediction, but with boxing in a transitional period as Zuffa Boxing launches and backs an effort to change laws to nullify many of the protections afforded by the Ali Act, many fans have felt as though the immediate result will be fewer huge fights between superstars. We already know Shakur Stevenson and Teofimo Lopez will meet at the end of January. Vergil Ortiz and Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis seem as though they're on a collision course for a massive junior middleweight bout. Naoya Inoue and Junto Nakatani have done everything they need to finally put together a Japanese megafight. Eduardo \"Sugar\" Nunez and Emanuel Navarrete will meet in a junior lightweight unification between the two best fighters in the division in March.\nAll of that is without even getting into how the summer, fall and winter schedules will play out as fighters become available and results play out. Oleksandr Usyk says he has a few fights left before retirement, and while he may be burning one if he follows through with his intention to fight Deontay Wilder, there are still compelling fights to be made against the likes of Agit Kabayel and Fabio Wardley, which can hopefully happen before the end of the year. And there are other intriguing storylines already in place, including David Benavidez looking at moving up to cruiserweight to challenge for Gilberto \"Zurdo\" Ramirez's WBA title in May.At least for the moment, it looks like 2026 could be one of the strongest years for the sport in recent memory. -- Brent BrookhouseFloyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight again, and we'll -- begrudgingly -- watch itWhere there's smoke, there's fire. OK, that's not always true in combat sports, where relevancy and public negotiations often take precedence over the truth. But there are reasons to suspect that MayPac 2 will come to fruition. In October, Pacquiao told Seconds Out that he \"almost\" agreed to a rematch with Mayweather and that their camps were in \"negotiations.\" Pacquiao wanted a professional fight, not an exhibition, with Las Vegas as the likely destination. Pacquiao is an active boxer coming off a shocking draw against WBC champion Mario Barrios, despite the legend's four-year layoff. It makes sense for him to pursue a Mayweather rematch. Mayweather is the X-factor. \nSurfacing rumors suggest \"Money\" Mayweather is broke. Last year, he told TMZ that he's open to fighting professionally after only booking exhibitions after his 2017 retirement. A rematch of the most-watched pay-per-view boxing fight of all time, a fight he won, has the best risk-to-reward ratio. Netflix is a perfect landing pad for the rematch. The streaming giant exclusively seeks out the fights that draw the most eyeballs -- Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford and Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul, for example. This fits the bill. Mayweather vs. Pacquiao 1 was wildly underwhelming. It can't possibly get better 11 years later, but we'll all watch it anyway. -- Shakiel Mahjouri\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Less than one year into his tenure as chief executive officer of the PGA of America, Derek Sprague has informed the association that he will be stepping down from his role. Sprague will return to New York to support his mother and mother-in-law, who both require increased care.Sprague was announced as Seth Waugh's successor in late 2024, becoming the first person to serve the PGA first as a past president and then CEO. Though Sprague informed the board of directors of his decision to step down in December, he will continue advising the board and incoming CEO during the transition process.The PGA expects to name a new CEO in the coming weeks.\"At my daughter's wedding last month in upstate New York, it became clear that my family needs me nearby to assist with the care of my mother and mother‑in‑law,\" Sprague said. \"Focusing on family has become my priority, and the best decision for me is to step away from my role as CEO and return home to be with them.\"Serving as CEO of the PGA of America over the past year has been an incredible honor, and I will always be grateful for the trust placed in me by the Board and thank them for their understanding. I also want to thank our staff for their tireless dedication. Their passion and commitment inspire me, and I know the Association will continue to thrive as it carries forward the proud mission of serving our members and growing the game.\"\nSprague's tenure as CEO was highlighted by issues, including the golf ball rollback and the environment at the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black.One month after taking over, Sprague stood firm that the PGA was against the rollback and would not advocate for change with the R&A and USGA. Though the association was included in meetings, it held firm.\"There's no change in our stance,\" Sprague said at the PGA Championship. \"We're certainly vehemently against the ball rollback. We've had great conversations with the governing bodies since that point. We've had several constructive and collaborative meetings, probably several times, three, four times.\"A few months later, at the 2025 Ryder Cup in New York, the PGA came under fire due for the way European players were treated by fans. While PGA president Don Rea insisted the environment was like that of a youth soccer game, Sprague ultimately sent an apology to Rory McIlroy, who was the center of fans' ire.\n\"I got a lovely email from Derek Sprague apologizing,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport ahead of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. \"Erica worked with Derek at the PGA of America back in the day, so we know Derek and his wife pretty well. He couldn't have been more gracious or apologetic and he wrote us a lovely letter, which we really appreciated.\"\n            ",

The answer to that is a pretty emphatic, \"No.\" Despite some significant injuries, the Lightning are among the league's elite, and they're poised for another run at Lord Stanley.Prior to the season, if you would have told me that Victor Hedman and Ryan McDonagh had combined to play 36 games at the halfway mark of the season, I would've assumed that Tampa was out of the playoff picture. Instead, only three teams have a better record, and only one has more wins.That lone team, the Colorado Avalanche, rolled into Benchmark International Arena on Tuesday night and left with a loss. It was only the Avalanche's fourth regulation loss of the season -- and their 11th overall. The Bolts made a statement: Don't start etching Colorado's name on the Cup just yet.So, how have the Lightning been able to keep rolling? For starters, it helps to have Nikita Kucherov, Jake Guentzel, Brandon Hagel and Brayden Point all playing at a high level. That's a quartet few teams can match. Besides, even if they aren't perfect, Andrei Vasilevskiy is in net to erase any mistakes.\nThe defensive performance has been the real marvel as Hedman and McDonagh have been sidelined. J.J. Moser, part of the return from the Utah Mammoth in the Mikhail Sergachev trade, has morphed into a budding star. On top of that, Darren Raddysh is suddenly an offensive wizard, especially on the power play. Jon Cooper deserves all kinds of credit for getting the absolute most out of a decimated blue line.Tampa had a real case to be No. 1 this week, but even with the win over Colorado, I couldn't do it. The Avalanche have built up too much equity for me to drop them over one head-to-head loss.

He's played fairly well in that role, just keeping his head above water at five-on-five and tallying nine points in his last 13 games. It still feels like the Wild need an upgrade at that spot.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            25-11-8\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Hurricanes\n                                \n                            Nikolaj Ehlers might finally be heating up, for real this time.

I don't know. Was it the night that Darryn Peterson made it clear he must be picked first in the 2026 NBA Draft. It's impossible to be certain.Either way, that sure was something.Final score: Kansas 104, TCU 100 in OT.Peterson, KU's five-star freshman, played for just the sixth time this season, finished with a career-high 32 points in 32 minutes and sank three free throws with 1.7 seconds left in regulation to get Tuesday's game to the extra period. But after making those free throws, Peterson walked to the bench and never reentered the contest because, once again, he was dealing with what Kansas coach Bill Self later described as \"cramping.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Court Report: What being undefeated in January means for success in March; teams most like Indiana football\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"The bottom line is that he started the cramping [at the end of regulation] -- or he felt it coming on,\" Self said. \"So that was his decision to come out. And he wouldn't have come out, obviously, unless he had to. ... But after he made the free throws [to get the game to overtime], he said, 'OK, get me out.'\"As I've said many times on the Eye On College Basketball Podcast, hopefully this is not going to be a thing that hinders Peterson and Kansas all season -- but I'm done with predictions. Needless to say, when Peterson plays, he's amazing. But, truth is, he hasn't played much -- and he's still not right. And until he is, and until he's on the court with his teammates consistently, it's going to be difficult for the Jayhawks to find any sort of rhythm, which is possibly why they were down 15 points with less than five minutes remaining in regulation at home against a TCU team that opened the season with a 78-74 loss to New Orleans.\"He's a special talent -- but we don't know how to play with him yet,\" Self said of Peterson. \"And he doesn't know how to play with the others yet.\"\nKansas is No. 20 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 29th consecutive day.

    "body": "\n        The Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline is fast approaching, which means the rumors are heating up about who could be on the move. The reality of Trae Young leaving Atlanta is very much real after a report detailed that he and the Hawks are working together to find him a new home. Anthony Davis' name is continuously mentioned, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.There's a lot of noise out there, so let's sift through it all and roundup the latest trade rumor buzz from around the league on Wednesday.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Anthony Davis prefers to be traded to a team that will sign him to an extensionDespite having a 14-23 record and a rookie sensation in Cooper Flagg that allows them to enter a full rebuild, the Mavericks are still operating with this two-timeline approach that was championed by former general manager Nico Harrison. Instead of having a fire sale for all their veterans, the Mavericks have been toeing the line, waiting to see if this roster could make a run once Kyrie Irving returns. Anthony Davis has been at the center of trade rumors since Harrison was fired in November. But a recent report from The Athletic says that Dallas doesn't feel like it \"must\" trade him before the deadline.That may be how the Mavericks feel, but The Athletic is also reporting that Davis' camp doesn't think the Mavericks will give him an extension this summer, and he would rather be traded to a team where that next hefty contract is possible. Because of Davis' injury history and current contract (he's owed $54.12 million this season and $121.23 million over the next two years), trading him could be an uphill battle for the Mavericks, but there have been teams who have registered interest at one point or another this season. The Raptors were mentioned earlier in the season, so too were the Hawks, but the Mavericks have no interest in taking on Trae Young in any deal with Atlanta. The Hawks also don't want to part with 2024 No. 1 overall pick Zaccharie Risacher, who the Mavericks covet. \nAnother team who has considered trading for Davis is the Warriors, per The Athletic. But they don't care to part with either Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler, one of which would almost certainly have to be included to make the money work in a deal for Davis. The Milwaukee Bucks have also considered Davis as a trade target, but with a bare cupboard of assets, Dallas may not find what the Bucks could offer desirable.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Hawks not in a hurry to make Young dealIt felt like we were about to have the first major transaction of the 2025-26 season after Marc Stein reported that the Hawks and Wizards have been engaged in a trade that would send Young to D.C. While Stein and Jake Fischer have doubled down to say the two teams are indeed in \"serious discussions,\" the Hawks are also not in a hurry to get a deal done. Fischer reports that the Hawks want to see if there are other teams would be interested in trading for the All-Star guard between now and the Feb. 5 deadline.There haven't been other teams who have registered interest in the undersized, high-usage guard, but that doesn't mean it won't change as we get closer to the first week of February. For now, though, the Wizards remain the lone interested party, and Fischer reports they've been intrigued about the possibility of landing Young since the offseason, when he and the Hawks didn't agree to a contract extension. Young has his flaws, but the Wizards have been in need of a point guard who can organize the offense, and while he demands the ball a ton, the defensive pressure he'll command could do wonders for Washington's young players.\n\n        \n            \n                Trae Young trade rumors: Why a Hawks-Wizards deal would make sense for both sides\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTo onlookers it might seem like a misstep for the Wizards, they're reportedly interested in taking on long-term salary if it comes with draft capital that will also help them build for the future. Young certainly fits that profile, and while he won't lift D.C. out of a never-ending rebuild, he'll provide some entertainment and hopefully development for the young guys on the roster.On Young's end, while he hasn't demanded a trade or formally sent a list to the Hawks about preferred landing spots, he does have interest in going to either the Minnesota Timberwolves or Brooklyn Nets. However, per Fischer, neither of those teams are reciprocating the same level of interest.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Warriors willing to keep Kuminga past trade deadlineThe never-ending saga between the Warriors and Kuminga continues to roll on. Kuminga has once again fallen out of favor in Steve Kerr's rotation, having not played in 12 of Golden State's last 13 games. It seems like things are finally headed for a divorce, as the Warriors' forward becomes trade eligible on Jan. 15. However, there hasn't been much traction on Golden State's end to get a deal done, per ESPN.\nThe Kings remain the main team interested in Kuminga, but Slater is reporting that the Warriors are content on keeping Kuminga past the deadline if nothing they like materializes. The Suns also had interest in the summer, but a package of Royce O'Neale, Nick Richards and some second-round picks didn't move the needle for Golden State.Golden State likely covets a lightly protected first-round pick, and someone who can make an immediate impact alongside Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler. With a 19-18 record which has them at eighth in the West, Golden State needs some more offensive firepower, but it remains to be seen if a team will offer up the kind of return for Kuminga the Warriors want. If not, then Kerr may just have to make things work with Kuminga for the remainder of the season until we have this discussion all over again in the summer.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Thunder could stand pat at trade deadlineThe sky might be falling in Oklahoma City as of late, as they've gone just 6-6 in their last 12 games, including a sobering 124-97 loss to a Hornets team that has won just 13 games this season. But that hasn't been alarming enough for the Thunder to make any major moves at the deadline, as rival teams expect OKC to have a \"quiet\" trade window, per ESPN. That's not surprising, given they've got perhaps the deepest rotation in the league, and while they've stumbled as of late, they're still 4½ games ahead of the Spurs for the No. 1 spot in the West. The Warriors all-time regular season wins record might be out of the picture, but OKC could use this adversity to refocus for the second half of the season to try and repeat as champions in June.\nHowever, if OKC did want to hit the panic button, the Thunder immediately become the most dangerous team on the trade market with a treasure trove of assets both in players and draft capital. They could go out and get literally any player they want, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to a high-end role player. But given how dominate they've been, the Thunder don't need to make any massive changes to a roster that is still difficult to envision anyone beating in a seven-game series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're mere days removed from the regular season coming to a close, and some teams have made quick work of trying to jumpstart themselves for 2026. After campaigns that failed to meet expectations, seven clubs parted ways with their head coach: Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, New York Giants, and Tennessee Titans. Each of those organizations has since been lining up interviews to fill those vacancies. But if you're one of the top candidates -- like the recently let go John Harbaugh, who is viewed as the top coach on the market -- patience may be a virtue. Why? It's not out of the realm of possibility that other, more attractive jobs will open up if certain playoff teams falter over Wild Card Weekend and are eliminated. Of course, there are built-in guardrails that prevent someone like Harbaugh from immediately joining another team. Under the Rooney Rule, teams must conduct at least two in-person interviews with minority and/or female candidates for any head coaching opening, and those candidates must come from outside the organization. The rule is designed to diversify the coaching pipeline and ensure candidates of all backgrounds receive a fair opportunity, though it can extend the timeline of the hiring process across the league. \nA byproduct of that this year could be that coaches get a clearer picture of the jobs available, because there's a case to be made that at least three more openings could come across their desks.Here's a look at a trio of playoff teams whose coaches could find themselves on shaky ground if Wild Card Weekend doesn't fall their way.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsCurrent head coach: Sean McDermottWild card opponent: at Jacksonville JaguarsThere may be no team with more variance in these playoffs than the Buffalo Bills. With the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson non-factors in this postseason, Josh Allen has a golden opportunity to finally get over the hump and reach the Super Bowl. However, Buffalo will have to do so as a wild-card entry, which means going on the road. Sean McDermott is 0-5 on the road in his playoff coaching career.\nWhile Buffalo is a slight road favorite over the Jaguars, many have put the Bills on upset alert. If that comes to fruition, it's fair to wonder what that means for McDermott's status. The veteran head coach enters this game with a 7-7 postseason record, meaning a loss would drop him below .500 for his tenure. Pair that with losing ground to the Patriots in the AFC East, and it could lead decision-makers in Orchard Park to seriously reevaluate whether they have the right staff in place to maximize Allen's prime years.If this job were to open up, it would instantly become the most sought-after position in the NFL. Every coaching candidate would be camping outside Highmark Stadium and smashing their way through tables with Bills Mafia for the opportunity to coach Allen.\n\n        \n            \n                This might be Josh Allen's best chance to win a Super Bowl; it might also might be his hardest\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersCurrent head coach: Mike TomlinWild card opponent: vs. Houston TexansPittsburgh narrowly escaped Week 18 with the AFC North title, which can really be viewed as more the Ravens losing it than anything else after Tyler Loop shanked a 44-yard field goal as time expired. While that gave Mike Tomlin a momentary reprieve, it doesn't necessarily save his job. \nPittsburgh is a three-point home underdog to the Texans this weekend, and if Houston remains one of the hottest teams in the league -- headlined by its lethal defense -- things could get ugly at Acrisure Stadium on Monday night.If Tomlin's club is bounced from the playoffs, the main storyline will be that it's the same old Steelers: good enough to make the postseason, but unable to do much once they get there. Tomlin's last playoff win came during the 2017 season, when Ben Roethlisberger was still his quarterback. Since then, they've missed the playoffs three times and gone one-and-done in the four appearances they did make. If it's more of the same this time around, it will be interesting to see whether Pittsburgh takes a hard look at itself and triggers a full-blown reset.If that's the case, the Steelers would be a wildly attractive job, offering a coach the opportunity to rebuild one of the most storied franchises the NFL has to offer.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay PackersCurrent head coach: Matt LaFleurWild card opponent: at Chicago BearsOne of the more under-the-radar jobs that wouldn't be totally surprising to see open up with a Wild Card Weekend loss is the Packers. Remember, the franchise did not reach an extension with head coach Matt LaFleur last offseason and is staring down a lame-duck year in 2026, so a decision on his future is coming in some capacity.Certainly, LaFleur could remain in his post, but what if Green Bay gets waxed by the Bears in the opening round? That would only further the narrative around LaFleur being unable to get his team deep into the playoffs, as he enters this postseason with a 3-5 record. If that drops to 3-6 -- with the most recent loss coming against one of your main division rivals, who have essentially leapfrogged you in their rebuild -- it could be enough for Green Bay to pivot, particularly with a candidate like John Harbaugh now out there.On top of the Packers being one of the top organizations in the sport, they have a talented young roster with key pieces like Jordan Love and Micah Parsons in place, so it would be among the very best jobs if it were to become available.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Moments after Ole Miss' thrilling Sugar Bowl win over Georgia, the first person Walker Jones found on the field was newly minted Rebels hero Lucas Carneiro.Carneiro had just hit the game-winning 47-yard field goal to send Ole Miss to a national semifinal and one win away from the national championship game. When Carneiro saw Jones, the executive director of the Grove Collective, a big smile broke across his face amidst the exuberant on-field celebration. \"I'll call you tomorrow,\" Carneiro said with a grin. \"You better,\" Jones replied.\"I've never been so happy to get that call the next day,\" Jones told CBS Sports this week.\nKeeping a star kicker has been just one piece of the puzzle for Ole Miss, but in many ways, it has been representative of what the last couple of weeks for the Rebels. It's been a wild run of success, concern over possible tampering and poaching off the field and a concerted effort to do everything possible to keep the momentum. It's hard to find a program that has handled the uniquely challenging circumstances better than Ole Miss. Consider what Ole Miss head coach Pete Golding, athletic director Keith Carter and others have had to deal with in recent weeks. All the drama around whether the coaches following Lane Kiffin to LSU would be allowed to finish the playoff run.  A narrative that it was just a matter of time before Ole Miss' top players fled Oxford to join Kiffin at LSU. All of this while preparing for a Thursday semifinal against Miami and navigating an especially wild and active transfer portal. \nAnd yet, Ole Miss has re-signed quarterback Trinidad Chambliss (pending waiver), running back Kewan Lacy, Carneiro and other key contributors. \"None of these guys left,\" Matt Bowers, a prominent Ole Miss booster who owns 14 car dealerships, told CBS Sports. \"We don't have to guess what that means. You can say whatever you want if you're LSU. You can say, 'Well, they overspent.' OK, tell yourself that. The truth may be harder to accept.\" That's a credit to a talented, sleep-deprived group. Everyone from Golding and his staff to Jones and his team at the Grove Collective -- along with newly added president of football Austin Thomas, assistant general manager Kelvin Bolden and senior associate athletic director for cap management Matt McLaughlin -- has helped keep the train on the tracks.\n\"We're in a really good place,\" Carter told CBS Sports. \"The brand is really strong. Clearly, we're proving that we can win at a high level and make deep runs in the playoffs. So why would these guys want to leave? I think that's what we have to continue to build here in Oxford.\"Invest in GoldingCarter's big bet on Golding to replace Kiffin has already paid major dividends. In many ways, it was both a bold and practical decision to elevate the likable defensive coordinator and entrust a first-time head coach with navigating an unprecedented situation. What Carter and others around the program understood was that Golding had forged real connections with players, boosters and other key figures. He had long been a top recruiter for a reason. If Ole Miss wanted to keep its roster intact for a playoff run, Golding may have been the only choice.\nThe way Golding handled the aftermath of Kiffin's exit has been about as close to ideal as anyone could have hoped. And while this story is not about Lane Kiffin, there is no question he has had an impact, intentional or not, on what is happening in Oxford. Doubling down The manner in which Kiffin left Ole Miss for LSU, and the hurt feelings it stirred among fans, has energized the base. There is a sense of resolve to prove the program can sustain its success in a post-Kiffin world, that the self-appointed \"Portal King\" was not the lone driver of Ole Miss' success in the NIL and transfer portal era. As Jones joked, \"It's amazing what a common enemy will do.\"\"I think they knew this was a rallying point,\" Jones said. \"Our people kind of love us against the world, little Ole Miss can't compete, little Ole Miss was built just by happenstance. They wanted, along with us, to show everybody this is built to last and we're bigger than any one man or any one variable. \n\"We've got a lot of resources in place, commitment in place from our administration to our coaches to our collective, and that has aligned our fanbase. They know what to do.\" The money has come pouring in. Carter said Ole Miss athletics has already set a record for annual giving just six months into the fiscal year. After Ole Miss' home playoff win over Tulane, 30-40 people joined the Vaught Society, which comes with a $25,000 commitment. \"It's been a perfect storm in a really good way,\" Carter said. \"Our fans are more galvanized at this moment than maybe they've ever been.\"\nSaid Bowers, a key financial contributor: \"These people have money, and they're motivated. In the name, image and likeness era, we're one of the most successful programs in the country. That's a fact.\" Everything Ole Miss is doing at this moment works toward sustainability. Beyond retaining top talent, Golding and his staff have been aggressively adding it. The Rebels currently have the nation's No. 6 transfer class, headlined by Florida defensive lineman Micai Boireau, LSU offensive lineman Carius Curne and Auburn defensive back Jay Crawford. If Chambliss' waiver isn't approved, it's a good bet Ole Miss will add an impact transfer quarterback, too. With the new additions, there's a world in which Ole Miss could be even better next season. After all, this was supposed to be the rebuilding year after losing top talent such as Jaxson Dart and Walter Nolen off last year's team. If Chambliss is eligible for another year -- and that is a big if right now -- there may not be a better one-two offensive punch in the country than he and Lacy. \nAt minimum, Ole Miss fans will get to watch the two stars suit up for at least one more game on Thursday in Arizona. A win would add another chapter in what's already been a remarkable and historic season for the Rebels. One more win and Ole Miss is playing for a national championship without the man who started the season as its head coach. Two more wins and Golding and this special group of Rebels will go down as legends. Through all the outside noise and wild circumstances, Ole Miss football has never been in a better place. And everyone associated with the program is putting in the hard work to keep it going.\"They've got a taste of this,\" Carter said, \"and they want to hold onto it.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A rematch of two top Big Ten teams will determine which national championship participant comes out of Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta.  No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon have already faced each other this season, a 30-20 win in Eugene for the undefeated Hoosiers. It was a significant program accomplishment for Curt Cignetti in Year 2 of his miraculous Indiana rebuild, especially after an offseason narrative around the Hoosiers' losses to Ohio State and Notre Dame lingered. Indiana definitively proved in that game -- and every game since -- it was no one-hit wonder.  Now the big question is can Indiana do it again? You can call it an overplayed narrative but it can be difficult to beat a team twice in one season. Georgia just learned that the hard way down in New Orleans against Ole Miss.  Indiana seems to be peaking at the right time, coming into this one off an emphatic 38-3 Rose Bowl win over Alabama. But Oregon is battle-tested, too. The Ducks easily handled their first-round opponent, James Madison, before knocking off Texas Tech, 23-0, in one of the most impressive defensive performances of the season. With Dan Lanning leading the way, this team isn't afraid of anything or anyone.  \n Indiana vs. Oregon: Need to know for Peach Bowl How does Oregon run game hold up?: Oregon was dealt a significant blow Tuesday when running back Jordan Davison was officially ruled out for Friday's Peach Bowl. Davison, who led the Ducks with 15 rushing touchdowns, suffered a broken clavicle in Oregon's quarterfinal win over Texas Tech. Making the situation even more precarious is that Oregon is now down to only three healthy running backs with Jayden Limar and Makhi Hughes hitting the transfer portal. Fortunately for Oregon it still has Noah Whittington, who led the way with rushing attempts, but it'll be interesting to see how Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein adjusts his gameplan without a significant piece like Davison. Whittington's carries high this season was 17 -- against Iowa and Washington -- but that number will almost certainly have to go up against Indiana if Oregon wants to stay balanced.  Preview of top NFL picks: There is some variance across all the NFL mock drafts you can find out on the internet, but Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore are pretty consistently atop the projections. At CBS Sports, for instance, both Mike Renner and Josh Edwards both have Mendoza and Moore projected to go in the first two picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. We are still a long way from April's draft, but if you're a fan of say the Las Vegas Raiders, New York Jets or Arizona Cardinals, you'll want to tune into the Peach Bowl to watch your potential next franchise quarterback. This is the kind of game that can play big in the minds of NFL executives and scouts when it comes time for the draft. Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy winner, has flown up the draft boards with a terrific season in Bloomington. He hasn't officially declared for the draft but with the Hoosiers taking TCU quarterback transfer Josh Hoover, the signs are there. It's a bit more up in the air with Moore who could still return to Eugene despite the possibility of being a top draft pick. One factor, too: Moore is still just 20-years old and this is his first season as the full-time starter after previously starting five games as a freshman at UCLA.  Huge stakes for both programs: Indiana has never been anywhere close to this stratosphere of college football before. A Peach Bowl win over Oregon to send Indiana to its first national championship appearance would be remarkable. There will be books and movies made about Cignetti if he can get two more wins. Oregon has had much more success over the last two decades than Indiana, but still has never won a national championship. Nike co-founder Phil Knight desperately wants to see one. Oregon has played in two national championship games in the 21st century, a 22-19 loss to Auburn in 2011 and a 42-20 loss to Ohio State in 2015. The Ducks have been oh-so-close in the past, and another bite at the apple would be well appreciated in Eugene.  \n Where to watch Indiana vs. Oregon live Date: Friday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Indiana vs. Oregon prediction, picks \nEven with the above caveat about it being hard to beat a team twice, I have to stick with Indiana in this game. It's going to be difficult, and I would expect the margin to be closer than the first time around, but Indiana just does so many things so well. I completely trust Curt Cignetti and his coaching staff, I believe in Fernando Mendoza to deliver in the big moments and, ultimately, I think Indiana's defense will give Oregon quarterback Dante Moore problems again.

    "body": "\n        An all-time season continues.  Wednesday is the 65th day of the 2025-26 campaign and six teams still remain flawless. We almost never reach this deep into a season with that many teams carrying zero losses. In the past two days, the number nearly whittled. On Monday, Nebraska continued a program-best 15-0 start with a gutty 72-69 win at Ohio State. The Cornhuskers rank near the top of Best Stories of 2025-26.On Tuesday night, the drama increased. Michigan got a shocking scare at Penn State, only walking out with a two-point win after a gaffe of a final possession by PSU allowed the Wolverines to remain scarless.  \nMiami (Ohio) did its part as well by beating Western Michigan to get to 16-0 on Tuesday night. Those three are joined by three 14-0 teams (Arizona, Iowa State, Vanderbilt) to give college hoops a six pack of perfection nine weeks into the season.  In some years we don't even have one undefeated team left after New Year's Day. To get six is a generational gift. \nDating back to 1995-96, and not including the crooked COVID 2020-21 year, there have only been six other seasons with at least six undefeated teams at the end of the first week of January. I wondered: Do those seasons with a batch of unbeatens by Jan. 7 correspond to Final Four runs? Here's what happened.2003-04: 10 undefeateds at this pointTen is a wild number, but keep in mind the season didn't start until Nov. 17 back then. UConn won the title but wasn't one of the 10 unbeatens on Jan. 7. None of the four teams in that Final Four (Duke, UConn, Oklahoma State, Georgia Tech) made it this deep without a loss. The most remembered unbeaten team of that year: Saint Joseph's, which took its first loss last on March 11. 2010-11: 7 None from that season's Final Four (champion UConn, runner-up Butler, Kentucky or VCU) made it to January without a loss. The best that did: Ohio State, Duke and Kansas, which finished 1/2/3 at KenPom that season and all earned top seeds. That was the Kemba Walker year with the Huskies and my first season covering college hoops for CBS. Can't believe it's been 15 years.\n2013-14: 6  The most recent example, until this year, of at least six undefeateds by Jan. 7. Like most other seasons, the majority of Final Four teams weren't unbeaten by Jan. 7. The only one of that year's Final Four to hit this point on the calendar without an L: Wisconsin. Eventual champ UConn was 11-3 by this point. Also in that Final Four: Florida (36-3, but two of those losses were before Christmas) and the up-and-down Kentucky team that ended one of the best stories of the 21st century when it beat undefeated Wichita State in a second round thriller.  2007-08: 6  One of the five best seasons of this century, I think. 2025-26 can give it a run for its money, though. So, who from that Final Four was still undefeated by this date in 2008? Three of the four, and that makes sense when you recall that '08 is one of only two NCAA Tournaments to ever put all four No. 1 seeds into the Final Four. Kansas opened up 20-0 en route to its national title. North Carolina didn't lose until Jan. 19, while Memphis made it to Feb. 23 before falling to Tennessee. Even the fourth 1-seed, UCLA, started 16-1 but its first loss came in December. 2005-06: 6  National champ Florida got to Jan. 21 before falling. UCLA, LSU and George Mason — the other three Final Four teams — very much did not. The best unbeaten team into January that year was Duke, which finished second at KenPom but was upset in the Sweet 16 by LSU. That was JJ Redick's final collegiate game.\n2000-01: 6  Twenty-five years ago the season started on Nov. 21. Duke was the national champ, but the Blue Devils lost before January. They defeated Arizona in the title game — and Zona lost four times before the New Year. Maryland also made that Final Four after beginning the season 1-3. The fourth team: Michigan State. Sparty did indeed make it to Jan. 7 as one of the six unbeatens, taking its first loss at 12-1 against Indiana.To have six still perfect by this point is such a bonus because the longer you have these teams existing into a season, the better it is for the sport. Undefeated records draw eyeballs and command attention. This season is hitting all the marks. But go look at the schedules for all six left. The most likely outcome, by far, is that Michigan, Arizona, Iowa State, Vanderbilt, Nebraska and Miami University all lose before the end of January. That probability begs the bigger question: Who, if any of them, is making it April? My 10 most disappointing teams at the midway mark We're halfway home in college basketball's regular season, and while a lot of teams (Nebraska, Vanderbilt, UCF, SMU, Saint Louis, Miami, Villanova and more) just pulled off surprisingly great first-half acts, that means there must be others who've fallen far short of their objectives. \nI assembled a Letdown List, with the group determined relative to each program's preseason expectations. So while there have been some obvious blunders (Maryland a non-factor in Year 1 under Buzz Williams, Pitt continues to play in irrelevance, UCLA was my last cut after losing to Wisconsin Tuesday night), I think these 10 have been the largest disappointments vs. their preseason prognostications. In alphabetical order: \n        \n            \n                The anatomy of Auburn's waved-off buzzer-beater\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAuburn (9-6). After the so-so-so close thriller (a 90-88 home loss to Texas A&M) Tuesday night, the Tigers have to be included. The team blew a 16-point second half lead, after all. Going back to October, Bruce Pearl left with weeks to spare, but Auburn kept its staff and roster intact. They were all respected with the No. 20 AP ranking in Week 1. They haven't looked the part from the jump, though. No one has a better collection of losses (Purdue, Arizona, Houston, Michigan, Georgia and A&M), but six defeats (some of them blowouts) against nine wins is unquestionably disappointing for a team coming off a No. 1 overall seed and just its second Final Four. \nCincinnati (8-7). Wes Miller will need to make the NCAA Tournament to keep his job and it's looking like that's near-impossible at this point. The Bearcats weren't a ranked team to start the season but they were expected to at LEAST fight for bubble inclusion. This is pacing to be Miller's second-worst team in five seasons at UC. The nadir was the home loss to Eastern Michigan. Now this team is toiling uphill in college basketball's best league. Bringing back Jizzle James (after he was kicked out of the program last summer) hasn't helped to this point; Cincinnati is 2-3 with him on the roster. \nCreighton (9-6). The Bluejays were ranked 23rd in the first AP ranking of 2025-26 but quickly showed they weren't worthy of that slot. Six losses through 15 games marks the worst start to a season in 16 years for the Jays. This might be a bottom-three offense under Greg McDermott, but hope's not lost: Most of Creighton's defeats are to quality teams (Gonzaga, Nebraska, Baylor, Iowa State, even Seton Hall on the road is easily Quad 1). Maybe these guys can figure it out and be a second-half swing squad. If so, it has to start Wednesday night at 12-2 Villanova. Georgetown (9-6). Hoyas fans were reasonably patient in Ed Cooley's first two seasons, but might I remind you that last year's 18-16 team started off 12-2. The mudslide from Big East play in 2025 has carried over into this season. The Hoyas rank 108th at KenPom and are even lower in the NET and at Torvik after their putrid 1-of-23 shooting horror show in the second half of Tuesday night's loss to DePaul. No one expected Georgetown to vie for a single-digit seed in 2026, but chasing an NCAA bid was the expectation. After opening the season 5-0 with wins over Maryland and Clemson, G'town has cascaded out of relevance again.  Kentucky (9-5). A teetering case, but I put UK (preseason AP rank: 9) on this list. Even Mark Pope would have to agree after he opted into spending somewhere around $20 million last offseason, only to see a variety of frustrating no-show losses. The most recent of those was an 89-74 submission at Alabama over the weekend. Kentucky's two best wins are at home against Indiana (TBD on how well that one will age) and against St. John's in Atlanta (same). UK's been impacted by injuries — and will continue to be due to Jaland Lowe opting to play with a compromised shoulder — but I still buy Pope's squad as a high-ceiling/low-floor group. \nLoyola Chicago (5-10). A baffling situation in Second City. Drew Valentine's team was expected to be top-four in the Atlantic 10 and maybe even an at-large candidate come March. It nosedived within the first week: from preseason top-100 status all the way down to 313th at KenPom right before Christmas. Doesn't help that this is one of the more well-funded teams in that league, either. Sister Jean's October passing turned out to be a harbinger for a dark winter on the shores of Lake Michigan. Shaka Smart is in the midst of by far the worst season of his 17-year career as a head coach. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Marquette (5-10). MU wasn't ranked in the preseason, but this has to be the most disappointing team of them all. The Golden Eagles took loss No. 10 by Week No. 9 after Shaka Smart shirked the portal (again) in favor of building his team entirely from within. It's turned into the most notorious backfire in college basketball. I am positively stunned it's gotten this bad after Smart went to four straight NCAA tourneys with single-digit seeds in his first four seasons in Milwaukee. The last time Marquette was this poor was 1990-91, when it was in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference and finished 11-18. Memphis (7-7). A season ago, Memphis earned a 5-seed and enjoyed its best season, record-wise, under Penny Hardaway. Now the program is in no man's land. At 7-7 and 77th at KenPom, Memphis would have to win out in the regular season (not happening) to have an at-large case. Instead, the obvious preseason favorite in the American is hurtling toward its worst year in Hardaway's eight seasons on the job. Will the downturn lead to a coaching change? \nOle Miss (8-6). The Rebels weren't ranked heading into November but they did receive votes in the first AP poll and were listed as top-25-good in some predictive metrics at Halloween. Remember, Chris Beard had this team in the Sweet 16 with a 6 next to its name last March. Now it's got three double-digit losses and a pedestrian offense after sifting through the portal to upscale its shot diet. Ole Miss' slide is representative of the SEC's downturn after a record-setting 2024-25. The Rebs get two terrific chances this week to reverse course by hosting Arkansas and Missouri. Oregon (8-7). Ducks landed two spots outside the preseason rankings 10 weeks ago, but that was a different time talking about a different team. This squad has been booted (permanently, almost certainly) from the at-large conversation after winning a No. 5 NCAA seed last year. Dana Altman returned all-league-level guys Nate Bittle and Jackson Shelstad and yet the needle has fallen in the wrong direction. Oregon was blanked in three games at Players Era in November and hasn't been right since. If there is any hope of a turnaround, it's in the next 22 days because the Ducks host four of their next six games.  Braden Smith is still the best point guard in college hoops. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                             Update: Braden Smith likely to be the all-time assists kingIn October, Braden Smith was the near-unanimous and pragmatic pick for preseason national player of the year. The most experienced player eligible and objectively the most accomplished point guard returning for a fourth season with Purdue, Smith had a fair edge on others, particularly the wait-and-see freshmen. In the nine weeks/14 games since, he's been one of the best players in the sport. \nBut he's not the frontrunner for NPOY now, nor is he in the 2- or 3-spot at the midway point of the season. (In order, it goes Cam Boozer, then Yaxel Lendeborg, then AJ Dybantsa.)  Still, I think Smith's a smidge underrepresented in the national conversation and that's surprising considering Purdue is 13-1 and has been ranked between No. 1 and No. 6 the entire season. The fifth-ranked Boilers host Washington on Wednesday night. A win would mean a 14-1 record, matching the best 15-game start in school history. Purdue has held a 14-1 mark eight previous times — including twice with Smith as the starting point guard. (The seasons: 1932-33, 1935-36, 1988-89, 1994-95, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2023-24, 2024-25). To my shock, Gary Parrish didn't even have Smith as a midseason First Team All-American on our Eye on College Basketball show Tuesday on CBS Sports Network. \nSeems it's time for me to remind the general public of how marvelous Smith has been and why he's going to leave Purdue as one of the best point guards ever. 1. Accounting for 2- and 3-pointers made by himself and his teammates, Smith is responsible for more than 35 of Purdue's points per game while playing five fewer minutes per game than last year. His stat line: 12.6 points, 9.6 assists (No. 1 in CBB), 4.1 rebounds, 1.8 steals, 2.9 turnovers and 38.9% 3-point shooting. 2. Smith is the conductor of the nation's No. 1 offense. Even better, Purdue's 129.1 ORtg at KenPom is pacing to be one of the five most efficient offenses in the modern era (so: likely ever). 3. Smith became the Big Ten's all-time leader in assists (893) over the weekend. He had 14 points and 12 dimes in Purdue's cruise-control 89-73 road victory vs. Wisconsin, passing Cassius Winston's previous record (890). 4. The diminutive maestro is leveling up as the season goes along: He's had 10 or more assists in four straight games. Thus, Smith is reliably moving up the all-time assists tally with every game. He's now 18th overall and 183 dishes behind Bobby Hurley's record of 1,076, which has stood for 33 years.  5. It speaks to how superb Smith's facilitation has been in the first half of the season that, here on Jan. 7, he's a solid bet to break Hurley's record. This storyline will really start to pop and be a game-by-game thing by the end of January. If you want to know what Smith has to do to pace himself to 1,077 career dimes, I point you to this terrific customizable tracker/projection website built by cobra. stats. If Smith can be at 9.0 assists for the season and Purdue makes the Sweet 16, he'll catch Bobby.  Who's the Indiana 🏈 equivalent in hoops? The College Football Playoff revs back up Thursday and Friday with two fascinating semifinals. The most compelling angle of the postseason doubles as the most compelling angle across the past year-plus in that sport: Top-seeded Indiana's unthinkable charge to the mountaintop. When Curt Cignetti got the job in November 2023, IU had the worst all-time win percentage of any power-conference program. After a two-year tour of dominance (25-2 heading into Friday's game vs. Oregon), IU has now jumped Wake Forest to have the second-worst win percentage at the Power Four level. Some are calling it the most unlikely college football story ever told, and if the Hoosiers can actually win the whole damn thing later this month, it officially will be just that. It's strange — and fun! — to see that IU logo so heavily associated with basketball instead have a 1 next to it on football telecasts. This also induces a curiosity: What would be the college basketball analog? What school getting the No. 1 overall seed and turning into a juggernaut despite all previous history dictating otherwise would be the best comp to Indiana? One great candidate is currently trying to do it this season: Undefeated Nebraska is off to its best start ever. The Cornhuskers are the only power-conference program without an NCAA Tournament win. They're a fine candidate and a close comparison.  But I'd put them No. 3 on the list.  \nNo. 2? I go with the University of Mississippi. The Rebels have the third-worst all-time winning percentage (.501) of any team in a power conference as of 2026. What's more, they've never won a regular-season conference title, have only made the Sweet 16 twice and never gone further. They've had an AP poll since the late 1940s; only three times in the past near-80 seasons has Ole Miss finished the season ranked.  But it's not IU's best kindred spirit. That school is in the same league as Indiana. No. 1 is indisputable from a historical perspective and the best apples-to-apples with IU football. It's Northwestern. The program didn't even make the NCAA Tournament until 2017 despite being eligible every year since its inception (1939). Northwestern has the fewest NCAA bids of any high-major (three). It has never finished a season ranked. Has never reached the Big Ten title game and never made the Sweet 16. The clincher: Its all-time win percentage is .423, far and away the worst of any power-conference program. Northwestern State has a better winning percentage than Northwestern.  Imagine that school rising to dominate college basketball. It's unimaginable. But so was Indiana. That's why there's nothing better than sports. Its capacity to redefine what's achievable can be life-affirming.  Norlander's news + nuggets • Duke's second half defensive transformation Tuesday night in its double-digit comeback win over No. 20 Louisville was probably the most important 20 minutes yet this season for Jon Scheyer's team. Our David Cobb was on hand and wrote about it; check it out here. • Speaking of Louisville, until Tuesday night's home hosting duties vs. Duke, the Cards had largely avoided any national speculation about the health of Mikel Brown Jr. Until the past couple of days, many outside of Kentucky probably didn't realize Brown last played on Dec. 13. But in hearing Pat Kelsey speak on Monday, it seems/sounds like the latest we'll see Brown back on the floor is next Tuesday for the Cards' big home tilt vs. No. 23 Virginia. • Another team I almost put on my list of disappointments: Kansas State, which did not take advantage of a prime opportunity last weekend when it hosted BYU. The Wildcats lost 83-73 to drop to 9-5, and here's the problem. Their next four opponents are a combined 48-9. • The most overlooked development of the week was the microscopic margin between Arizona at No. 1 and Michigan at No. 2 in this week's AP Top 25. From the story linked above: \"The Wildcats received 32 of 61 first-place votes and had 1,494 points, while the Wolverines scooped up the other 29 first-place votes from the national media panel. The one-point difference kept the first poll of 2026 from becoming the second ever with a tie for No. 1; Oregon State and Virginia shared the top spot on Jan. 26, 1981.\" Now I desperately want a tie atop the AP rankings this year. I never realized it had happened before. • Had Penn State defeated No. 2 Michigan last night, it would have been the Upset of the Season So Far. Instead, a brutal final possession/heave ended it 74-72 in favor of the Wolverines, which won a game by two after averaging 34.5 in its previous 10 conquests. So, Penn State has lost to Michigan and Michigan State by a combined six points. It also lost to 7-8 Pitt by 34 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ • Speaking of blowing it vs. great teams, TCU is 11-4 with winnable games that became losses against Michigan and Kansas. It's also fallen to New Orleans and Notre Dame. Defeated Florida. The Frogs spook me out. • Good story from the Denver Post on donor fatigue emerging around the Colorado football program. There's been some of this in college hoops, but I'm interested to see just how much of it (or lack thereof) is there in April. There's only so many places that can continually raise north of $10 million for multiple sports year over year over year. I know of some coaches who are stressed about some money thinning in the spring. • If you took time away from college hoops reading over the holiday, please take a stroll down memory lane: I ranked the 25 biggest stories of 2025 just before we flipped into 2026. Truly a passion project for me every December. • We'll wrap with some mid-major love. How about Kevin Hovde and the Columbia Lions? A 12-3 group looking like the No. 2 team in the Ivy League (behind Yale). This school last made the NCAAs in 1968! Hovde, who was an assistant on last season's title-winning Florida staff, has guided the second-best overachiever vs. preseason expectations in college hoops. Some good research here from fledgling college hoops scribe Sam Federman. Great stories abound as we settle into January. (But also Maryland: yikes!)\n            ",

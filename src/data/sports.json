Brady Kannon, who is 26-9-2 (+1590) over his last 37 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+3.5) to cover versus New England on Sunday night.\"Patriots' schedule has been a sore spot for their supporters all season but there is no denying, they played hardly any good teams. They were 2-2 vs playoff teams, splitting with the Bills and also splitting with the Panthers and Steelers, the two worst teams in the tournament. Chargers were 3-2 vs playoff teams (not counting Week 18) and had to face Denver, Philly, Steelers, Jaguars, and Texans. LAC also has the better point differential vs common opponents. They have an excellent formula for playoff football: a rushing attack, a pass rush, and an excellent defense. When I crunch my numbers, I come up with LAC as a 1-point favorite. I'll gladly take anything greater than a field goal and they just might win outright.\" Kannon's Wild Card NFL picks can be found here.Bet the Chargers to cover at DraftKings:\nSteelers vs. Texans Monday night picks Something has to give on NFL Wild Card Monday as the Steelers have lost six straight postseason games, while the Texans are 0-6, all-time, in road playoff games. Both of these squads enter their Monday night meeting with nine against-the-spread wins this season as they will meet in a playoff game for the first time ever. R.J. White, who is 37-20-1 (+1455) over his last 58 ATS picks in Steelers games, is backing Pittsburgh (+3) to cover.\"The Steelers are in the playoffs by the skin of their teeth, and the market is treating them as DOA. But I'm not underrating a team that scored 25+ points in nine of its last 12 games, even managing it in the finale without DK Metcalf. He's back, as is T.J. Watt, and when you throw in Mike Tomlin as one of the best coaches in football, the current version of Pittsburgh rates above average for me. The Texans' elite defense gave up 30 points to Riley Leonard and the offense has been inconsistent, getting shut down in Week 16 by the Raiders of all teams. Pittsburgh is live for the win here at home against an indoors team playing in a tough road environment.\" See more Texans vs. Steelers picks here.Pick Pittsburgh to cover at DraftKings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists Morikawa and Matsuyma at +1700, with Spieth at +4000. The favorites are Russell Henley at +1100 and Ben Griffin at +1300. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Russell Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a 19-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

This year's postseason won't have Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs or Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, but there will still be plenty of familiar faces. The Eagles are in the playoffs for the fifth straight season and they'll be looking to become the first NFC team in 31 years to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in. The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n        Pitchers and catchers are slated to report for duty across camps in about a month's time, meaning that Major League Baseball's offseason is coming to a close. There's still plenty of business for teams to conduct, with top free agents like outfielder Kyle Tucker, third baseman Alex Bregman and shortstop Bo Bichette left unsigned at the moment. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Saturday's most notable moves and murmurs in one place for your convenience.Brewers want starter in return for PeraltaIf the Brewers trade ace Freddy Peralta, they want in return a replacement starter they can slot into their rotation in his place, according to The Athletic. Potential suitors like the Mets, Dodgers and Red Sox would seem to have the ability to part with a younger starter of their own in exchange for Peralta. \nPeralta, 29, is entering the final season of his contract. He's compiled a 3.40 ERA (123 ERA+) and a 3.27 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 95 starts since 2023. His consistency, reliability, and affordability (he's owed $8 million) make him an attractive target for teams seeking front-of-the-rotation help.Sans Peralta, the Brewers' rotation would include some combination of Brandon Woodruff, Jacob Misiorowski, Quinn Priester, Chad Patrick, Logan Henderson and/or a pitcher they land in return.\nCardinals add relieverThe Cardinals have signed right-hander Ryne Stanek, per FanSided. Terms were not immediately available, but it stands to reason it's more likely than not a one-year contract. Stanek, after all, is a 34-year-old reliever who 1) posted a 5.30 ERA last season and 2) has signed single-year pacts in each of the past two offseasons.\nDespite last year's bloated ERA, Stanek will enter the new season sporting a career 3.85 ERA (108 ERA+) and a 2.29 strikeout-to-walk ratio in nearly 500 big-league appearances. He throws four pitches: an upper-90s fastball, a splitter, and two breaking balls (including a swing-and-miss slider). Stanek figures to slot into a middle relief role with a chance at being elevated to high-leverage work depending on how he performs and what the Cardinals opt to do with their bullpen over the rest of the offseason.\nRockies acquire outfielderThe Rockies have obtained outfielder Jake McCarthy from the Diamondbacks in exchange for right-hander Josh Grosz, the teams announced on Saturday afternoon.\nMcCarthy, 28, is a career .260/.324/.381 (96 OPS+) hitter in more than 430 big-league games. He had a poor season last year, however, causing him to fall out of favor with the D-backs organization. McCarthy should fetch more opportunities in Colorado, where the Rockies currently have an outfield depth chart that includes Mickey Moniak, Brenton Doyle, Jordan Beck, and Tyler Freeman.Grosz, 23, made 23 appearances split between the Yankees and Rockies organizations. He compiled a 4.67 ERA and a 2.45 strikeout-to-walk ratio. The Rockies obtained him in the trade that sent third baseman Ryan McMahon to New York.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were two. The 2026 college football season has led to this: No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami will meet in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game to decide the best team in the country. In most years, the Hurricanes would be seen as an overwhelming favorite against Indiana. But Miami has gone on an underdog run of its own after making the playoff as the last at-large team. Indiana, meanwhile, has bowled over opposing teams en route to a 15-0 record. The Hoosiers are 2025's hegemon and it appears as if they aren't going away anytime soon. They handled their semifinal game against Oregon with ease, downing the Ducks 56-22. Miami, meanwhile, triumphed over Ole Miss in a 31-27 thriller that ranks as one of the best postseason games of the CFP era. \nThose semifinal games, of course, provided plenty of material to overreact to as the 2025 season nears its conclusion. Indiana is the best team of the CFP era Yes, better than 2019 LSU. The Hoosiers may not have as much elite NFL talent -- though quarterback Fernando Mendoza is a shoe-in to go first overall in the 2026 draft -- and the offense isn't quite as explosive, but they are a more complete team. Indiana's +473 point differential ranks first among schools in the playoff era (hat tip to my CBS Sports colleague Tom Fornelli). The Hoosiers have bludgeoned opposing teams by an average of 31.5 points per contest. Their last three wins against blue bloods Ohio State and Alabama and new blood Oregon have come by a combined score of 107-35. \nCurt Cignetti's squad has won all but one of its games against ranked opponents by at least 10 points. And Indiana is doing this in the Big Ten, one of the nation's premier conferences.  The Hoosiers are also on the precipice of becoming the first college football program to ever go 16-0. Of course, they have the benefit of playing in the expanded playoff years, but an undefeated season in the modern era of college football, when parity is at an all-time high thanks to NIL, seems like an accomplishment that won't be easily repeated. After all, only four NFL teams have ever completed undefeated seasons and it only happened once after the league went to a 16-game schedule. \n\n        \n            \n                Indiana vs. Miami: Early preview, odds, picks as Hoosiers will meet Hurricanes in CFP National Championship\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMiami's discipline issues will doom it against IndianaMiami was, somehow, able to overcome itself in the Fiesta Bowl against Ole Miss. The Hurricanes committed 10 penalties for a total of 74 yards, including a targeting foul that resulted in the ejection of cornerback Xavier Lucas. They dropped four potential interceptions. Those fouls allowed Ole Miss to hang around and even take the lead at certain points. Ultimately, the Rebels made a few crucial mistakes of their own -- and were pitiful on third down -- which allowed the Hurricanes to outlast Ole Miss. That won't do against the well-oiled Indiana machine. The Hoosiers rank third nationally with just 3.57 penalties per game. They're smart, they're disciplined and -- as was seen with D'Angelo Ponds' pick six to open Indiana's semifinal win over Oregon -- they will pounce all over any mistakes the opponent makes. \nUltimately, discipline will make the difference in a battle between two teams that stack up fairly well otherwise. Oregon is in trouble You've certainly heard of a clutch gene if you're a fan of sports. Oregon coach Dan Lanning has the opposite. In their last three playoff games against Power Four opponents, the Ducks have been outscored 97-66. That includes a 23-0 romp against Big 12 champion Texas Tech this season. \nTalent isn't the issue with Oregon. The Phil Knight money certainly helps, but the Ducks have always recruited at a high clip. Coach Dan Lanning has done a good job at the high school level and in the portal. But there's plenty of reason to be concerned about the path that Oregon is walking with Lanning, especially given the recent postseason results. This will be a big offseason for him. The Ducks are set to lose both of their bright young coordinators. Will Stein is headed to coach Kentucky while Tosh Lupoi will lead former Pac-12 foe California. \nIt is a good sign for a program's health when assistants get head coaching jobs, and it's a testament to what Lanning has built at the young age of 39. The next few months will be a huge test of his ability to keep the ship steady. Ole Miss is bigger than Lane KiffinIt was time to stop talking about Kiffin's move to LSU once the playoff began, but the two will always be intrinsically linked given the time that Kiffin had in Oxford and the messy nature in which he departed. While Kiffin deserves his flowers for elevating the standard at Ole Miss, it's clear that the Rebels have outgrown the need for him. His departure didn't do the program any favors or anything like that. Pete Golding has shown, in short order, that he can at least maintain the level of success that Kiffin established -- if not exceed it. Golding, after all, has more playoff wins than Kiffin at this point, and he's only been a head coach for three games. \nKiffin was certainly hoping that he'd be able to drag some of Ole Miss' top stars with him, but his decision instead galvanized the Rebels. Top running back Kewan Lacy, top linebacker Suntarine Perkins and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen, along with a bevy of other key players, have already committed to returning. On top of that, Ole Miss is off to an incredible start in the transfer portal. The Rebels currently sit seventh in 247Sports' Team Transfer Rankings. They're one of just two schools in the top 10 with less than 10 commits thus far and their average prospect grade of 89.22 is first among top-15 transfer classes. Four of Ole Miss' nine transfer additions hold at least a four-star ranking. That includes LSU transfer Carius Curne, the No. 1 offensive tackle in the transfer portal, who spurned Kiffin for the Rebels. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Coming out of a three-turnover outing in Friday night's College Football Playoff semifinal loss to Indiana, Oregon redshirt sophomore quarterback Dante Moore told reporters he is undecided on his 2026 NFL Draft plan with two more years of eligibility remaining. Moore, No. 2 in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings, was terrific for the Ducks this season with 3,565 yards passing, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a completion rate at 71.8%. Moore, if he hasn't already, will hear from the College Advisory Committee on his draft evaluation and where he's expected to land before making an informed decision. The deadline for underclassmen to officially submit paperwork to the NFL is Jan. 14, so a decision from Moore isn't far away.\"I knew that question was coming. Yeah. I want to soak this moment up,\" Moore said Friday. \"That's most important. Just giving hugs and just thank yous to my teammates, but at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet.\"\n        \n            \n                What's next for Oregon? Major changes ahead as Dan Lanning replaces two coordinators and maybe QB Dante Moore\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIndiana quarterback Francisco Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy winner, is widely considered the frontrunner to go No. 1 to the Las Vegas Raiders. The New York Jets have the second selection of the first round. Underclassmen like Mendoza who participate in the CFP National Championship have until Jan. 23 to decide. \nWhile Mendoza is widely expected to go pro (Indiana already has TCU transfer Josh Hoover lined up for next season), Moore's future plans are unclear. If Moore does return to Oregon, he would likely be doing so on a sizable new contract, but that total would pale in comparison to what he would bring in as a first-rounder.\"I'm going to talk to coach [Dan] Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day, I don't want to think about that right now,\" Moore said. \"I just want to think about my teammates and give love to them.\"Coming off another College Football Playoff exit, Lanning and the Ducks have an arduous offseason that awaits given the exit of both longtime coordinators Will Stein (Kentucky) and Tosh Lupoi (California) to head-coaching jobs. Stein and Lupoi were figureheads of a staff that won 38 of 43 games the last three years, but Lanning has already promoted from within for those roles -- Drew Mehringer as OC and Chris Hampton as DC. \nOregon's quarterback plan for 2026Oregon's starting quarterback has been a transfer in each of Lanning's four seasons as head coach, first with Bo Nix (2022-23), then Dillon Gabriel (2024) and now Moore. Gabriel and Moore were both signed during the 2024 portal cycle with a plan in mind that worked out beautifully for the program.Oregon needs to hear a decision from Moore sooner rather than later. Former Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola has been linked to the Ducks along with Arizona State's Sam Leavitt and USC's Husan Longstreet. Leavitt and Raiola are currently two of the highest-rated players available and still taking visits.Miami is another program that is wading in the same waters as the Ducks given Carson Beck's departure to the NFL after next week's national championship game. Oregon quarterback Austin Novosad entered the portal last month after sliding to No. 3 on the depth chart this season behind Moore and Brock Thomas. The Ducks also signed four-star Bryson Beaver in their 2026 recruiting haul and Akili Smith Jr., who redshirted this season, last cycle.\n            ",

The Panthers finished the season with a record of just 8-9, but thanks to their having won the division, they get to host the Rams in this first-round game anyway. Los Angeles looked like it was headed for the No. 1 seed for much of the second half of the season, only to lose a pair of games down the stretch and fall into the No. 5 slot instead. The Rams finished with the second-best record in the conference at 12-5, but because they play in the same division as the No. 1-seeded Seattle Seahawks, they enter the postseason as a wild card team.\n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the Rams advance, or will the Panthers pull off the upset at home?

Before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Panthers vs. Rams liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 10 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: Bank of America Stadium (Charlotte, North Carolina)TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -10, O/U 46.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesRams out for revenge. Back in Week 13, the Rams headed into Carolina with a 9-2 record and sat atop the NFC. They were heavily favored over the Panthers, who were just 6-6 at the time. But things don't always go as you expect. Matthew Stafford turned the ball over three times. Bryce Young completed a pair of huge touchdown passes on fourth downs. And the Panthers upset the Rams 31-28, setting L.A. on a path that would lead it to blow its chance at the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye down the stretch of the season. Now, the Rams have their chance to exact revenge on the Panthers.Panthers run game. In the middle of the season, Rico Dowdle went berserk and the Panthers looked like they had one of the best run games in the NFL. They topped 100 rushing yards in seven straight games, 150 yards in three of them and 200 yards twice. They slowed down for a few games after that, rushing for south of 80 yards in three consecutive games, but then they popped up with 164 yards in their win over the Rams. They're coming off their worst rushing performance of the season (19 yards) in Week 18, so we'll have to see if they can get going on the ground again on Saturday.Puka and Davante. Puka Nacua had \"only\" 6 catches for 72 scoreless yards in the first matchup against Carolina. Davante Adams had 4 catches for 52 yards, but he was on the receiving end of two of L.A.'s touchdowns. The pair of wideouts form one of the most dynamic duos in the NFL. In the first Rams-Panthers game, they didn't have to deal with Panthers cornerback Jaycee Horn, who is one of the best in the league himself. It'll be interesting to see whether Horn shadows one receiver or the other, or if the Panthers just stick with him and Mike Jackson (who also had a nice season) playing certain sides of the field.Bryce Young vs. Rams pass defense. Young didn't have a ton of pass volume in the first game between these two teams. He threw only 20 passes. But when he did throw, it was incredibly beneficial for Carolina. He completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns, without throwing an interception, and he was also sacked only twice while rushing five times for 23 yards. The Rams are excellent up front on defense, but they can be leaky on the back end on occasion, as we saw in that first matchup. The Panthers will likely try to control the game with the rushing attack, but they need Young to hit on timely throws again.Prediction\nThe Rams looked like the best team in the NFL for most of the season. They stumbled down the stretch without Davante Adams, but they should have him back for this game. They'll also have revenge on their minds after they were upset by the Panthers earlier this season. But even that upset took Matthew Stafford turning the ball over three times and Bryce Young playing at a much higher level than he did for most of the season. I don't see those things repeating themselves on Saturday, so I've got to ride with the Rams here. Prediction: Rams 27, Panthers 16 | Pick: Rams -10\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        From the first play from scrimmage, Oregon was overmatched and outplayed in Friday night's College Football Playoff semifinal loss to Indiana in Atlanta. The Ducks turned it over on three of their first six possessions, each of those mistakes leading to touchdowns for the Hoosiers and a further increasing deficit that culminated in a 56-22 defeat. After recording an interception return for a score 11 seconds into the contest, Indiana pounced on a fumble at Oregon's 3-yard line with 9:29 to play in the second quarter. Near the end of the first half, a sack-and-strip of Ducks quarterback Dante Moore resulted in his third giveaway, a fumble at his own 21.The Hoosiers scored on both short fields and by the time the smoke settled at halftime, Oregon trailed 35-7 with comeback hopes feeling insurmountable.\"We take pride in putting the fire out and we've done a pretty good job of that all year,\" Oregon linebacker Bryce Boettcher said. \"Obviously it's hard to play when turnovers happen, but it is a standard that whenever the ball is placed, we don't let them score. And they scored too much tonight, so that's on the defense and credit to Indiana.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Lopsided CFP semifinal loss to Indiana continues troubling rematch trend for Oregon coach Dan Lanning\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore threw for 285 yards and two scores, but it was an ill-timed interception to Indiana's D'Angelo Ponds on Oregon's first snap and two fumbles in the first half that doomed the Ducks. Moore was only sacked 17 times all season, nine of those coming in two losses to Indiana.\"First things first, the quarterback has to protect the football,\" Moore said. \"They have a great defense, great disguise and different looks, but you can't win football games if you're causing turnovers. Something of course I need to work at. It comes with just reps. But overall, I mean, Indiana's defense is great, defensive coordinator, but at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.\"\nMoore's second giveaway was a mental mistake after his arm hit Oregon's running back on a attempted pass to the outside, jarring the ball loose.\"On that play, it was running back was behind me in the pistol and tried to throw the smoke screen off the field,\" Moore said. \"I gotta clear the midline better to make sure that when I am going to throw, I don't hit the running back in his elbow. So the ball hit his elbow, but at the end of the day, it's on me. I gotta take care of the ball and make sure they're out of the way and get the ball to the receivers.\"Oregon coach Dan Lanning harped on adversity after the game following his team's second consecutive disappointing effort in a playoff scenario to end a season. Last fall, the Ducks were unbeaten and ranked No. 1 entering the postseason before losing to eventual champion Ohio State in blowout fashion in the Rose Bowl CFP quarterfinals.\nThis time around, Oregon had beaten James Madison and Texas Tech with precision on both sides of the football before the Ducks' ship capsized against the only opponent they had lost to during the regular season.\"Ultimately, there were moments where we had success offensively, but obviously when you have the takeaways, you start off with the pick six,\" Lanning said. \"You get a little bit in the hole. You probably start to press a little bit. You get away from some of the success you have in the run game at times. There's moments that we had some plays, but that's a damn good team. And you gotta give credit to them, too. It's not just what we didn't do, it's what they did do.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers are no strangers to facing one another in the playoffs. Over the course of Tom Brady and Phillip Rivers' tenures, these organizations squared off three times, with the most recent contest coming back in the 2018 divisional round. Ironically enough, that postseason was the last time either franchise has recorded a playoff win, and both are trying to rectify that on Sunday night in Foxborough. This time around, while it won't be a Brady vs. Rivers clash, we do get quite the quarterback matchup as Drake Maye and Justin Herbert represent two of the brightest young quarterbacks that the league has to offer. In Year 2, Maye has put together an MVP-caliber season that helped propel New England from a 4-13 team over his rookie season to an AFC East-winning 14-3 club in 2025. As for Herbert, he's continued to blossom in his second season under Jim Harbaugh, ranking among the top-10 passing yard leaders in the league. And that quarterback head-to-head is just the tip of the iceberg of what should be a highly competitive playoff contest. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore we dive further into this matchup, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this game. \nWhere to watch Chargers vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough)TV: NBCOdds: Patriots -3.5, O/U 46.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsCan Drake Maye stay hot vs. Chargers defense? \nNew England's second-year quarterback has taken a quantum leap in Year 2, ascending as high as an MVP candidate. Maye became just the 10th quarterback since 1970 to lead the NFL in completion percentage and yards per attempt. He's also now the youngest of that group to do so. One of Maye's key strengths this season has been his proficiency in throwing the deep ball, but that could be put to the test on Sunday as he faces a stout Chargers secondary. Both Maye and the Chargers defense rank top-two in the league in completions, completion percentage, and passing touchdowns on or against passes of 15-plus air yards. Passing 15+ air yards this seasonDrake MayeChargers defenseCompletions7131Completion percentage58%33%Passing touchdown 124If L.A. can keep New England's deep passing attack on the tarmac and force them into more of a dink-and-dunk attack, it'll go a long way towards keeping this game close. Conversely, if Maye can find success with chunk plays through the air, we could be in for a shootout with Herbert on the other side.  Can the Chargers protect Justin Herbert? On the one hand, you have to commend the Chargers for withstanding the losses of both star tackles in Rashawn Slater (torn patellar tendon in August), along with Joe Alt (season-ending ankle injury in Week 9), and still reaching the postseason. However, their ability to protect the quarter has naturally worsened throughout the year. Overall, Los Angeles surrendered a franchise-high 60 sacks this season, the fifth most ever by a playoff team. Specifically, the offense's production after losing Alt took a noticeable dip. With Alt, the team was averaging 25.3 points per game. After he went down, that average dropped to 21.3 points per game. As it relates to Herbert, he averaged 8.3 yards per attempt this season when Alt was blocking for him, and that fell to 6.5 yards per attempt in his absence. New England doesn't have the best pass rush, but they are no slouches either, ranking just outside the top 10 in pressure rate (12th). So L.A.'s ability (or inability) to protect Herbert will be a central storyline. How does New England look vs. playoff competition?As impressive as New England's turnaround has been this season, increasing its win total by +10 (tied for the best year-over-year increase in NFL history), it's worth noting that its road was pretty soft. The Patriots' strength of schedule was the easiest since the 1999 Rams. They were 13-1 against teams with losing records this year and 1-2 against teams with winning records. Can you fault the Patriots for simply playing against teams that the NFL put in front of them? Of course not. However, we can be a bit skeptical of their actual ceiling until they prove to us that they can take down playoff-caliber competition, and that starts on Sunday against the 11-6 Chargers.X factorWhen we talk about some of the NFL's most talented quarterbacks, Justin Herbert comes up more often than not. He's coming off a 2025 regular season where he ranked inside the top 10 in passing yards, rushing yards, and passing touchdowns. Herbert has the second-most passing yards in his first six seasons (24,820) all-time, only looking up to Peyton Manning. As prolific a start as Herbert has enjoyed to begin his career, that success has been exclusive to the regular season. He's 0-2 in his playoff career, and those two losses have been noteworthy. The first was the Chargers blowing a 27-0 lead to the Jaguars during the 2022 playoffs. The second came last year, when he and L.A. were blown out by 20 by the Texans, as he threw four interceptions and posted a career-low 44% completion rate. That naturally raises the question of whether Herbert is the type of quarterback who can succeed in the postseason. If what we've seen in the past is who he'll remain to be, this game will be over in a hurry. If he can perform more as he has in the regular season, the narrative will begin to change, making him a true wild card over this Wild Card Weekend.Chargers vs. Patriots prediction, pickI think we're at a point with Herbert where we need to see it to believe it before deciding to back him in a playoff setting. Due to everything we mentioned above, it seems a little dicey to trust him in this spot, particularly being on the road and having a depleted offensive line. Meanwhile, the Patriots have gotten healthier in the trenches in recent weeks, welcoming back left tackle Will Campbell and defensive tackle Milton Williams in Week 18. Campbell should help keep Maye upright, while Williams will likely contribute to Herbert hitting the turf more than he'd like. Given that this game will be played in Foxborough, we'll say that helps New England get over the hump en route to the divisional round. (Prediction: Patriots 24, Chargers 20 | Pick: Patriots -3.5). \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The road to Super Bowl LX begins this week in the wild-card round. The action starts with a Saturday doubleheader, followed by three games on Sunday before a Monday night finale in Pittsburgh.The Carolina Panthers will look to shock the world by making a playoff run despite finishing with an 8-9 record, Josh Allen may have his best chance to make the Super Bowl with no Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow or Lamar Jackson standing in his way, and Aaron Rodgers has what could be his final chance at NFL glory. We also have two surprising No. 1 seeds with the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks. How important will those first-round byes be this year? Which teams should you pick in Wild Card Weekend, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Jan. 7 over at DraftKings Sportsbook. Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers (Saturday)Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nDajani (Rams -10.5): Massive spread, but the Rams have a couple of things to prove here. Back-to-back losses in Weeks 16-17 landed them with a wild card, which of course means their road to the Super Bowl is a bit tougher. Then, this is a revenge game for the Rams, as they were upset by the Panthers in Carolina in Week 13. L.A. owns the second-best point differential in the NFL (+172), and Matthew Stafford is going to win MVP. He led the NFL in passing touchdowns, passing yards and TD-INT ratio, and has a loaded arsenal that includes Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, Kyren Williams, Blake Corum and all of those tight ends that seemingly find the end zone every week. \nDespite the playoff berth, it's not like the Panthers are riding high. They fell to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the regular-season finale, and needed the Atlanta Falcons to save them. I would love to see the forever-doubted Bryce Young play the role of spoiler and rookie phenom Tetairoa McMillan dice up this Rams secondary, but I don't think it's in the cards this week  …  Prediction: Rams 31, Panthers 20Dubin (Rams -10.5): The Rams looked like the best team in the NFL for most of the season. They stumbled down the stretch without Davante Adams, but they should have him back for this game. They'll also have revenge on their minds here after they were upset by the Panthers earlier this season. But even that upset took Matthew Stafford turning the ball over three times and Bryce Young playing at a much higher level than he did for most of the season. I don't see those things repeating themselves on Saturday, so I've got to ride with the Rams here.  … Prediction: Rams 27, Panthers 16Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears Saturday, 8 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime\nDajani (Bears +1.5): This could be the game of the week, and it may be the toughest game to pick. As of now, the Packers are the first No. 7 seed to be favored in a playoff game since the postseason expanded to 14 teams in 2020. I didn't like seeing Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions rack up 433 total yards on this Bears defense last week. We all know that the Bears led the league in takeaways with 33, but they rank bottom four in yards allowed per game (361.8). On the Packers side, Jordan Love is going to return to the lineup for the first time since suffering his concussion in Week 16. How is he going to look? Love has made three playoff starts in his career. One was incredible (at Dallas Cowboys), one was OK (at San Francisco 49ers), and one was a disaster (at Philadelphia Eagles). I'm going to take the Bears in this matchup because they are at home, and the Packers have lost four straight games …  Prediction: Bears 26, Packers 20\nDubin (Packers -1.5): This line has already flipped several times, which makes sense given that the two teams are so evenly matched. We've already seen them play two times in the last month, with each game being decided by a single score in favor of the home team. What this game likely comes down to is whether you think that the Bears can Establish The Run and control the game on the ground, while at the same time keeping the Packers from creating explosive plays. I think Chicago can run the ball against the Micah Parsons- and Devonte Wyatt-less Packers defense, but I'm not sure they can stop Jordan Love from getting the ball to Christian Watson and the rest of his weapons, or Josh Jacobs from running it downhill. … Prediction: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville JaguarsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nDajani (Jaguars +1.5): Many view this as Josh Allen's best chance to win a Super Bowl, but I'm not sure about that. Buffalo has a very clear Achilles heel in the form of its run defense. The Bills allow 136.2 rushing yards per game, which ranks worst among playoff teams. They also allow 5.1 yards per rush. Only one team has won the Super Bowl allowing five yards per rush, and that was the 2006 Indianapolis Colts. On the flip side, the Bills have the No. 1 rushing offense in the NFL (159.6 rushing yards per game). However, the Jaguars boast the No. 1 rush defense in the league (85.6 rushing yards per game). The Jaguars are arguably the hottest team in the NFL, having won eight straight games. During that span, Liam Coen's team leads the NFL in points per game (33.6), opponent points per game (14.5) and point differential (+153). Quarterback Trevor Lawrence leads the league in total touchdowns (24) during this win streak, and has been a weapon on the ground as well. Give me the Jaguars in an upset at home  …  Prediction: Jaguars 24, Bills 21\nDubin (Bills -1.5): As Dajani said, the Jags are arguably the hottest team in the NFL. Trevor Lawrence is playing the best ball of his career. Liam Coen is an inner circle Coach of the Year candidate. The defense has forced at least one turnover in six straight games and at least two in five of them. And yet... the Bills have Josh Allen, and I cannot bring myself to bet against the best quarterback in the AFC side of the bracket -- even when going on the road. Between Allen and James Cook, I think Buffalo will be able to move the ball here, and in a close game I am always going to ride with the team that has a better quarterback. That's Buffalo.  … Prediction: Bills 26, Jaguars 23San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nDajani (49ers +4.5): Do you want to take the most Jekyll and Hyde team there is in the NFL, or a team with a struggling defense that just lost the inside track to the Super Bowl while putting up a measly three points? Get this: I'm taking both. I'm going to take the Eagles to win this game, but the 49ers to cover 4.5 points. Ignoring what happened last Saturday night for a second, the 49ers have made the NFC Championship game in each of their last seven playoff trips. Do we really believe they are going to be one-and-done this season? Despite all of the injuries on the defensive side of the ball, Kyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh found a way to get this team to 12-5 in the toughest division in the NFL. I think Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey can keep up with this Eagles offense.I also think it's possible Saquon Barkley turns it on in the playoffs again. This year overall was certainly a step back production-wise for him, but Barkley's 127.5 total yards per game in the playoffs rank second in NFL history behind Terrell Davis. Give me the Eagles to win at home, but the 49ers to cover …  Prediction: Eagles 27, 49ers 24\nDubin (49ers +4.5): The Niners were red-hot before getting stonewalled in the final week of the season by the Seahawks. They should get Trent Williams and possibly Ricky Pearsall back for this game, which should help them move the ball against Philly's defense better than they did against Seattle. HOWEVER. San Francisco is still incredibly banged up on both sides of the ball, but particularly on defense. I know the Eagles are perhaps the most untrustworthy offense in the league, but I like them to be able to get something going against this San Francisco unit that has allowed offenses to move the ball with consistency even before losing Tatum Bethune (in addition to Fred Warner, Nick Bosa and more) for the season. I don't feel fully comfortable backing a team that can look so listless, so often, but that's why I'm picking the Eagles to win and not cover.  … Prediction: Eagles 24, 49ers 20Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots Sunday, 8 p.m. ET on NBC\nDajani (Chargers +3.5): I'm a big fan of Mike Vrabel and Drake Maye, but there's no getting around the fact that the Patriots are not battle-tested. New England had the easiest strength of schedule played since the 1999 Rams. Yes, that team ended up winning the Super Bowl, but the Patriots went 1-2 vs. teams that finished the regular season with a winning record, and 13-1 vs. losing teams. This Chargers defense will be the toughest defense the Patriots have faced ALL year. Maye has been one of the best deep-ball throwers all season, but the Chargers secondary ranks top two in completions allowed (31), completion percentage (33%) and passing touchdowns (4) on throws of at least 15 air yards this year. I can't in good faith pick the Chargers to win this game with how banged-up the offensive line is, but I'll take Justin Herbert to keep it close in a game that goes Under the total …  Prediction: Patriots 16, Chargers 13Dubin (Chargers +3.5): The Chargers probably need this game to be low-scoring to come away with the win, given their issues up front on offense. If they can turn it into a knock-down, drag-out fist fight, I like their chances better than if it's a more wide-open game with the offenses going score-for-score. That said, it's not like the Pats aren't still equipped to win if it does turn into a lower-scoring contest. They can run the ball better than can the Chargers and with Milton Williams back, their defense should be better than it was during part of the stretch run of the season. Watching Drake Maye and Justin Herbert go back and forth in this game is going to be incredibly fun, and it feels like a game that is going to be incredibly close. I'm just going with the home team to win.  … Prediction: Patriots 21, Chargers 20\nHouston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (Monday)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nDajani (Steelers +3): In this matchup, we have an NFL legend at home facing an elite defense in what promises to be a low-scoring affair. The Texans are the only team in NFL history to have never won a road playoff game, so why not take the Steelers in Pittsburgh with the points? I did that with the Steelers last week against the Baltimore Ravens and it worked out. Plus, Aaron Rodgers gets DK Metcalf back. He's the only Steeler to cross 500 yards receiving this year! I had fun watching Rodgers against the Ravens last week. He can clearly still spin the football. The future Hall of Famer is 4-0-1 against the spread in his last five wild card games, so I'm going to take him in this spot. What will decide this game is actually the other quarterback, C.J. Stroud. If his passing attack can take advantage of what was the fourth-worst pass defense in the NFL this season, the Texans will cover the spread. I'm not so sure that happens  …  Prediction: Texans 14, Steelers 13Dubin (Texans -3): Look, I've been picking against the Steelers all season and they keep making me look stupid by pulling games out of their collective butts. But I'm still picking against them here. I just can't see them consistently moving the ball against this ferocious Houston defense -- especially if Aaron Rodgers is unwilling to hold onto the ball for long enough to even try pushing it down the field. All the check-downs he likes to throw to the running backs don't work as well against the Texans as they do against other teams because of how they rally to the ball. I'm not sure Houston can move the ball with any degree of consistency on the other side, but I'm going to back the team with the best single unit in the game here. … Prediction: Texans 16, Steelers 10\n            ",

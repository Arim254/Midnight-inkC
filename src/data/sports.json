    "body": "\n        Five times in the last seven seasons, Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes was one of the Super Bowl's starting quarterbacks. To wrap up the 2025 season with Super Bowl LX, the football world gets a breath of fresh air with two first-time Super Bowl starters in Sam Darnold of the Seattle Seahawks and Drake Maye of the New England Patriots.Super Bowl LX will actually be the first Super Bowl ever between two starting quarterbacks and two head coaches -- Mike Macdonald of the Seahawks and Mike Vrabel of the Patriots -- who are all in their first or second season with their respective teams, per CBS Sports Research. However, that doesn't mean firepower is lacking at the position: Maye and Darnold have combined for 33 wins across the 2025 season, including playoffs, the most between two starting quarterbacks entering a Super Bowl matchup all time, according to CBS Sports Research.So which team -- the Patriots or the Seahawks -- has the edge at football's most important position entering its biggest game? Let's break it down with a tale of the tape that ended up being much closer than many would have thought.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRegular seasonMaye, the 2025 NFL MVP runner-up and 2025 second-team All-Pro, produced a regular season for the ages. He became the first quarterback since fellow Patriot Tom Brady in the 2007 16-0 regular season to lead the league with the best record (14-3), best completion percentage (72%) and passing yards per attempt (8.9). He's the sixth quarterback in the last 40 years to accomplish all of that in the same season, and the previous five -- Joe Montana (1989), Steve Young (1992, 1994), Kurt Warner (2001) and Brady (2007) -- all won league MVP honors for those efforts.\nAt age 23, Maye is also the youngest quarterback in NFL history to lead the league in both completion percentage and passing yards per attempt. He also paced the NFL in passer rating (113.5) and expected points added (EPA) per dropback (0.28).Darnold ranked right behind Maye in passing yards per attempt with an 8.5 average, and he finished top 10 in the NFL in the following passing metrics: W-L (14-3), completion percentage (67.7%) and passing yards (4,048). He had a strong regular season overall, but Darnold also maintained some of the chaos factor that led to Seattle being his fifth NFL team, as he led the league with 20 turnovers (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles).Drake Maye vs. Sam DarnoldMayeDarnoldW-L14-3*14-3*Completion percentage72%*67.7%Yards per pass attempt8.9*8.5Pass yards4,3944,048TD-INT31-825-14Passer rating113.5*99.1Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.28*0.09Sacks4727Turnovers1120** Led NFLEdge: Maye PostseasonIn the playoffs, Darnold has found a higher level of play against familiar NFC West foes in the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams. He leads this postseason in yards per pass attempt (8.9), touchdown-to-interception ratio (4-0), passer rating (122.4) and EPA per dropback (0.38). Darnold also went cold turkey on turnovers, committing none in the NFC divisional round or NFC Championship Game.Maye, on the other hand, has taken a major step back in efficiency from his regular-season performance. New England is still winning, but his play hasn't been the driving factor. He leads the postseason with 15 sacks taken -- five in each game. That figure is nine more than the next-closest players -- Justin Herbert, C.J. Stroud and Matthew Stafford -- who each took six.Drake Maye vs. Sam DarnoldMayeDarnoldW-L3-0*2-0Completion percentage55.8%69.8%Yards per pass attempt6.98.9*Pass yards533470TD-INT4-24-0*Passer rating84.0122.4*Expected points added (EPA) per dropback-0.120.38*Sacks15*5Turnovers50** Led NFLEdge: DarnoldAccuracyIt doesn't get more accurate than leading the NFL in completion percentage like Maye did at a 72% clip. Darnold wasn't far behind at 67.7%. Even more impressive, Maye wasn't just throwing into wide-open spaces: his tight-window throw rate of 17.3% ranked as the fourth-highest in the league during the 2025 regular season. Darnold didn't throw into tight windows as frequently, posting a tight-window rate of 13.6%, which ranked 22nd out of 33 qualified quarterbacks.In the postseason, Darnold's accuracy -- like many aspects of his game -- improved. His 69.8% completion percentage ranks as the second-best this postseason behind Josh Allen's 71.6%. Maye's 55.8% completion percentage ranks eighth out of 15 playoff quarterbacks. However, Maye leading the NFL in completion percentage in the regular season while throwing into tight windows with regularity comes with a much larger sample size. He gets the edge here.Edge: Maye Ball securityWhen combining both players' turnover totals this season, Darnold's 20 (all from the regular season) exceed Maye's 16 across the regular season and playoffs.Yes, Maye's five playoff turnovers are tied for the second-most in the league with Caleb Williams and sit just two behind C.J. Stroud's playoff-worst seven. However, Maye still has four fewer turnovers than Darnold despite playing an extra game. Darnold leading the league in giveaways during the regular season is a tough hurdle to overcome.Edge: MayeBig-play magicBoth Super Bowl starting quarterbacks ranked top five this season in completion percentage on throws of 20-plus air yards, so the margin between the two in this area is thin. Darnold led the league in yards per pass attempt (18.5) on throws of 20-plus air yards, due in large part to his connection with 2025 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Jaxon Smith-Njigba. He completed 15 of 26 passes (57.7%) of 20-plus yards to Smith-Njigba while connecting on just over half (51.6%) when targeting all other Seahawks.Maye threw for 1,226 passing yards on throws of 20-plus air yards (including playoffs), the second-most in the NFL behind Stafford (1,519). New England's Week 3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers was the only game, regular season or postseason, in which Maye did not connect on a throw of 20-plus air yards.Passes on throws of 20-plus air yards (NFL ranks)DarnoldMayeCompletion percentage52.5% (2nd)45.9% (5th)Yards per attempt18.5 (1st)14.4 (6th)Pass TD7 (T-7th)9 (T-4th)TD-INT7-2 (10th)9-4 (14th)Passer rating123.4 (2nd)108.1 (7th)Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.90 (2nd)0.84 (4th)Darnold gets the edge here over Maye based on his leg up in efficiency.Edge: DarnoldPlay-action passingBoth Darnold and Maye rank as top-five quarterbacks this season, including the playoffs, in yards per pass attempt, passing touchdowns and passer rating off play action. The separator here is efficiency, something Maye has a leg up in, particularly when it comes to completion percentage, where he's nearly 10% higher, and ball security, with four fewer interceptions.Play-action passing (NFL ranks)DarnoldMayeCompletion percentage68.5% (11th)74.6% (4th)Yards per attempt11.0 (1st)9.8 (3rd)Pass TD15 (2nd)11 (T-4th)TD-INT15-5 (T-17th)11-1 (8th)Passer rating124.7 (4th)128.8 (3rd)Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.30 (4th)0.26 (9th)Edge: MayeRushing impactMaye's 5.9 rushing yards per carry rank second among all players with at least 10 carries this postseason, trailing only Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne (6.7). Darnold has just three carries for nine yards this postseason, something certainly impacted by the oblique injury he dealt with in the divisional round.In the regular season, Maye's 450 rushing yards ranked fourth among quarterbacks, while Darnold's 95 rushing yards ranked 33rd. An easy advantage for Maye here.Edge: MayePocket presenceMaye's 15 sacks are the second-most taken by any player in a single postseason in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), per NFL Next Gen Stats. His 47 regular-season sacks are also the second-most by any quarterback to go on to start the Super Bowl. It's not all on him, as his average time to throw of 3.01 seconds was the sixth-fastest among the 15 quarterbacks to start a playoff game this postseason, but his awareness when the pocket collapses needs to improve.Darnold took 10 fewer sacks this postseason with a slightly faster average time to throw of 2.98 seconds. The Seahawks quarterback, now in his eighth NFL season, holds the edge over Maye in this area, which makes sense given that 2025 was just the Patriots passer's second year as a pro.\nEdge: Darnold\n        \n            \n                Five bold Super Bowl 2026 predictions that sound far-fetched -- until you look into the data\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSuper Bowl experienceMaye is aiming to become the first quarterback since Tom Brady (2001) to win a Super Bowl in the season of his first playoff start. Darnold, now on his fifth NFL team, is angling to become the fourth quarterback to win a Super Bowl on his third team or later, and the first to do so on his fourth team or later.Edge: DrawHead-to-head historyYes, quarterbacks face opposing defenses, but the game is still very much discussed as quarterback vs. quarterback. Eli Manning beat Tom Brady twice in the Super Bowl despite Brady actually facing the New York Giants' ferocious four-man pass rush in those two matchups. Super Bowl LX will mark the first time Darnold and Maye share the field in the same game.Edge: DrawThe final verdictThe tally from our 10 categories, with two recorded as draws, is as follows:Drake Maye (5)Sam Darnold (3)This is a little closer than some would have thought when evaluating these two quarterbacks on the surface. Darnold certainly closed the gap in the postseason against two division opponents, so it will be interesting to see how he fares against a former division foe in the Patriots.However, he hasn't faced New England since the 2021 season, when he started against them as a member of the Carolina Panthers. He has since developed significantly while being coached by Kyle Shanahan with the 49ers, Kevin O'Connell with the Vikings and Klint Kubiak with the Seahawks.The Patriots can certainly take solace in having the MVP runner-up in Maye at the controls of their offense on Sunday, but he'll have his work cut out for him against Seattle's No. 1 scoring defense (17.2 points per game allowed in the regular season).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl Sunday has arrived, and if this year's showdown between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is even half as thrilling as the last time these franchises met on this stage, fans are in for a wild ride. Eleven years after their Super Bowl XLIX classic, the teams meet again tonight with the Lombardi Trophy on the line.The Seahawks, much like their previous Super Bowl runs, have been powered by one of the NFL's best defenses. Seattle allowed the fewest points in the league this season and finished first in both yards per pass attempt allowed and yards per rush attempt allowed. The unit flexed its muscle in a 41-6 divisional-round win over the San Francisco 49ers, surrendering just 3.9 yards per play -- San Francisco's worst mark all season.Seattle's offense delivered its biggest statement in the NFC Championship Game. Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams, with 153 yards and a score going to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kenneth Walker III added 111 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, while Cooper Kupp and Jake Bobo also reached the end zone.Though the unit was inconsistent late in the regular season, it has found its rhythm in the playoffs -- and, crucially, has not committed a turnover. Seattle enters tonight's game with a plus-four turnover differential this postseason.\nTurnovers have also defined New England's playoff run -- but on the other side of the ball. No defense has forced more this postseason than the Patriots, who have wreaked havoc against the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. New England is allowing just 8.7 points per game in the playoffs, the fewest by any team through three games since the 2000 Baltimore Ravens' historic defense.The Patriots' offense, which powered much of the regular-season success, has been quieter in January. New England's 18.0 points per game this postseason is the fewest entering a Super Bowl appearance since the 1979 Rams. Still, Drake Maye has delivered timely plays with both his arm and legs, and the Patriots' firepower presents a major test for Seattle's defense.Here's how to watch tonight's game, followed by keys to the matchup and a prediction.\nFor live updates, highlights and analysis throughout the game, follow our Super Bowl LX live blog.Super Bowl LX: Where to watch Patriots vs. SeahawksDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyTV: NBC | Streaming: PeacockLive updates: CBS Sports AppBetting odds: Seahawks -4.5 | O/U 45.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPatriots-Seahaws Super Bowl big questionsCan the Patriots force Sam Darnold into mistakes? For as good as Darnold has been this season -- and especially this postseason -- he does have a penchant for turnovers. In fact, his 20 turnovers this season were most in the NFL, and his 14 interceptions were third-most. Eight of those 14 turnovers happened when he was pressured, tied with Geno Smith for most in the NFL.Now (mostly) healthy, the Patriots' pass rush has been dominant this postseason with an NFL-best 52% pressure rate. For comparison's sake, the highest pressure rate during the regular season was 45% (by the Minnesota Vikings). \nThe Seahawks have done a good job keeping Darnold clean for the most part, and play-caller Klint Kubiak does a good job of getting him out of the pocket via play-action and giving him easy answers. But Milton Williams, who had a big impact in last year's Super Bowl for the Philadelphia Eagles, K'Lavon Chaisson and other members of the New England front seven will hope to make an impact so talented cornerbacks Christian Gonzalez and Carlton Davis have a chance to make Darnold pay for a poor decision.Can the Patriots' offensive line hold up?The path for the underdogs to come out on top starts with getting to Darnold. The next step is protecting their own quarterback. Maye has taken five sacks in all three of his playoff games so far, and while that's come against three of the NFL's best defenses, it's not as if the Seahawks' unit is any easier. \nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald dials up a variety of different schemes and pressure looks, and he has both a disruptive duo inside (Leonard Williams, Byron Murphy II) and a plethora of edge rushers to generate pressure. When the Seahawks do get pressure, Maye has to be careful with the ball: He has six fumbles (three lost) this postseason, both most of any player.Can Maye hit the deep ball?The Seahawks' excellent cornerbacks play very aggressively, and it almost always works. The results speak for themselves.\nBut if the offensive line holds up, Maye might have the opportunity for a deep ball or two, and he's been as good as anyone in those scenarios: His 35 completions at least 20 yards downfield this regular season were second-most in the NFL behind Matthew Stafford.\n        \n            \n                2026 Super Bowl expert predictions, odds, picks, best bets, where to watch Seahawks vs. Patriots today\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSuper Bowl LX pick, prediction\nExpect some nerves early, especially from the quarterbacks, but as both settle in, this should be a great, close battle between an ascending star and an unlikely one.Maye is looking to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Darnold is looking to become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl after playing for at least five different teams.\nUltimately, the Seahawks' defense gets a few timely stops, and Seattle leaves with its second championship.Pick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20\n            ",

I think Maye will turn it over a few times and the sacks will start to wear on him. This will be a day for the Seattle defense. Darnold will make the plays after the turnovers, but this will be a game about the basics of football -- blocking, tackling and influencing the quarterback.\"Seattle will do that best. Look for the Seahawks to win behind one of those defensive showings by their front that we will remember for a long time. Defense wins championships, they say. But the reality is the fronts of the defense is what does it -- and Seattle will show that once again.\"\nPick: Seattle 27, Patriots 10To read Prisco's full analysis, click here.\nSportsLine's Bruce Marshall's Super Bowl LX pickMarshall is coming into Super Bowl LX on a 59-38-2 roll (+1689) on his last 99 NFL picks, and has now unveiled his best bet for this matchup between the Seahawks and Patriots. We can tell you Marshall is leaning Under the 45.5 point total, but to see who he has winning (and covering) this matchup, you'll need to go to SportsLine.Tyler Sullivan's Super Bowl LX pick\"Seattle's defense is legit and possesses a unique challenge for a Patriots offense that has been in a recent slump. The Seahawks are top 10 in the NFL in pressure rate this season (including playoffs) and are third in total pressures. They do that despite being one of the least frequent blitzing teams in the NFL, meaning they can apply pressure by simply sending four. In turn, that'll allow them to have an extra man in coverage, which will make life difficult for Maye, who has been sacked five times in each of his three playoff games this year. The MVP contender may also not be 100% healthy, as he's been listed with a right shoulder injury.   \"It's hard to imagine Maye and the Patriots' offense suddenly turning the tide in this Super Bowl against a Seattle defense that was the No. 1 scoring defense this season. Moreover, the No. 1 scoring defenses that have squared off against All-Pro quarterbacks (like Maye is) in the Super Bowl are 5-1 in the previous six matchups. Think Seattle wins this in a rather convincing fashion.\"\nPick: Seahawks 30, Patriots 17To read Sullivan's full analysis, click here.SportsLine's Emory Hunt's Super Bowl LX pickArguably, no one has been as dialed in on betting football (at any level) than Emory Hunt. Specifically, Hunt has been superb betting games involving the Seahawks, coming into this Super Bowl on a 28-16 run in such games. With that in mind, you NEED to see which way the SportsLine expert is leaning, especially with his deep knowledge of Seattle. To see what best bets Hunt has lined up for Super Bowl LX, you'll need to log on to SportsLine.John Breech's Super Bowl LX pick\"During the regular season, the Patriots were the second-highest scoring team in the NFL at 28.8 points per game. In the playoffs, that number has dropped to 18 points per game. Before this season, do you know how many teams had made the Super Bowl over the past 45 years while averaging 18 points per game in the playoffs? ZERO.\"If you can't score more than 18 points against Seattle, you're not going to win, it's that simple. There were only two games all year where the Seahawks scored fewer than 18 points and they BOTH came against the 49ers, a divisional opponent that knows them well. The Patriots do not know them well.\"\nPick: Seahawks 34, Patriots 20To read Breech's full analysis, click here.SportsLine's Brady Kannon's Super Bowl LX pickDo you want someone who has been on a heater with his NFL picks? Look no further than SportsLine's Brady Kannon. He comes into this Super Bowl on a 29-15-2 roll (+1208) in his last 46 NFL picks. Now, Kannon has turned his expertise towards Super Bowl LX where he has laid out three selections: an ATS pick, a total pick, and an ML pick. To tail Kannon as he looks to stay hot, check out those wagers on SportsLine.Zach Pereles' Super Bowl LX pick\"Expect some nerves early, especially from the quarterbacks, but as both settle in, this should be a great, close battle between an ascending star and an unlikely one. \"Maye is looking to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Darnold is looking to become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl after playing for at least five different teams. Ultimately, the Seahawks' defense gets a few timely stops, and Seattle leaves with its second championship.\"\nPick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20To read Pereles' full analysis, click here.\nSportsLine's Mike McClure's top DFS plays for Super Bowl LXWant to add a little DFS into your Super Bowl Sunday? If so, you'd be remise if you did not see how SportsLine's Mike McClue is attacking this game. McClue is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. Naturally, he'd be someone you'd want to tail, especially in a game as big as the Super Bowl. Of course, one of McClue's top players to roster is Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but he also has value pick that could prove to be the central pice to a winning formula. To see who McClure is targeting, go check out SportsLine.Jordan Dajani's Super Bowl LX pick\"While I am excited for this game, I think there is a possibility it ends up being a low-scoring affair that isn't particularly close. The main matchup to watch is the Seahawks defense vs. the Patriots offense. Seattle has arguably the best defense in the NFL, while the Patriots' offense has averaged just 18 points per game this postseason -- the fewest by a Super Bowl team since the 1979 Rams. This is the seventh Super Bowl since 1970 between an All-Pro quarterback (Maye) and the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (Seattle). The No. 1 scoring defense is 5-1 in those previous six matchups. Furthermore, Mike Macdonald's defenses are 6-0 vs. first- or second-year quarterbacks, allowing two passing touchdowns compared to nine interceptions in those games. A few of those quarterbacks held in check were Bo Nix, Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels. \"They say defense wins championships, and I think that will be proven on Sunday. In regard to the spread, there have been only SEVEN Super Bowl underdogs to lose outright and cover the spread. So I'll lay the points with Seattle.\" \nPick: Seahawks 20, Patriots 13To read Dajani's full analysis, click here.Jared Dubin's Super Bowl LX pickSeattle's defense is just too good. New England has already struggled offensively through its first three playoff games, failing to produce representative offensive performances against any of the Chargers, Texans or Broncos. Now, the Patriots face what may be their toughest test yet in this Seahawks group. They can pressure and they are sticky on the back end. They typically don't allow the type of big plays around which the Patriots' passing offense was based during the regular season before it backslid in the playoffs. The Pats are going to have to run the ball well and probably dink and dunk their way down the field, and I'm not sure they can do it well enough to put up a ton of points. Strangely, I might trust Seattle's offense more than I do New England's at the moment, given the way Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and even Kenneth Walker III are playing. If the Seahawks can stay in a neutral or better game script and avoid having to go to a pure dropback game for an extended stretch, I like them to come away with the win here.Pick: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16To read Dublin's full analysis, click here.Garrett Podell's Super Bowl LX pickNew England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has been sacked five times each in all three of New England's AFC playoff games. That's not ideal ahead of a matchup against the Seattle Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense (17.2 points per game allowed) in Super Bowl LX. Seattle's defensive tackle duo of 2025 second team All-Pro Leonard Williams and 2024 first-round pick Byron Murphy III has been the NFL's best this season: they have combined for the most quarterback pressures (108), quarterback hits (35) and sacks (14.0) among 300-pound duos. Then, there's Seahawks rookie hybrid safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 18 quarterback pressures led all defensive backs this season. New England may look to counter by running the football with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, but Seattle also led the NFL in yards per carry allowed (3.7) despite playing the lowest rate of base defense in the league at just 6%. Maye won't be able to overcome the danger the Seahawks' defense presents at all three levels on Sunday.\nPick: Seahawks 27, Patriots 13Kyle Stackpole's Super Bowl LX pickI'm not going to pretend the point spread is off and the Patriots have tremendous value as 4.5-point underdogs. If I did, I'd hit the Patriots moneyline at +190 at DraftKings and be sipping margaritas on a remote island by Monday afternoon.That said, as a Patriots hater (not the team itself -- just the fact they're back in the Super Bowl already!), it just feels like Drake Maye, Mike Vrabel and company will figure out a way to pull this game out. Maybe it's Sam Darnold committing three turnovers or Marcus Jones housing a punt, but something will flip this game in New England's favor. The Patriots are on top of the NFL world once again. Pick: Patriots 23, Seahawks 20\nKevin Steimle's Super Bowl LX pickThis should be a simple pick, but I've been struggling with it all week. The Seahawks have the better team and their defense is legit scary, but I just have a gut feeling about the Patriots that I can't shake. Maybe it's my Tar Heel bias, but I feel like Drake Maye is going to break out of his mini slump and make some big plays downfield and also use his legs. Give me the Pats to win outright.\nPick: Patriots 23, Seahawks 20Bryan DeArdo's Super Bowl LX pickWhile they may not be the best team, that hasn't stopped the Patriots from winning it all in the past, and I don't think that will stop them from hoisting the Lombardi Trophy for a record seventh time on Sunday night. As is often the case, great defenses typically outperform prolific offenses in Super Bowls. That should give the Patriots an edge in this game as long as Drake Maye and the rest of New England's offense take care of the ball.Pick: Patriots, 20, Seahawks 17\n            ",

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif, the home of the 49ers, where the Seahawks are 9-4 all-time. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, which snaps a streak of eight straight Super Bowls in which New England is the favorite. The over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Both NFL lines of the spread and O/U have held steady since opening. Before making any Patriots vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the Super Bowl 60 predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Brady Kannon.\nKannon rose to fame in 2011 when he captained a four-person team to win the Hilton NFL SuperContest (now the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest). His team set the record for the highest winning percentage in the contest's history at the time, nailing 72.5% (58-22-5 ATS). Kannon has also crushed his recent NFL picks, going 29-15-2 (+1208) in his last 46 NFL against the spread picks. Now, Kannon has set his sights on Seahawks vs. Patriots and just locked in his picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks.

The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye who is +240 in the Super Bowl MVP odds, is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained. Additionally, the underdog has outright won in three straight Super Bowls and covered in five straight, with each of those the longest streaks in Big Game history. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverSeattle has played turnover-free ball over their last three games, and it is the only undefeated team (10-0) this season when committing 1 or fewer turnovers. Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970. The Seahawks are also the first team in a decade to rank in the top two in both yards per rush allowed (3.7, 1st) and yards per pass allowed (5.5, 2nd). In terms of the spread, Seattle is a league-best 14-5 ATS this season, while the Patriots are 0-7 straight up, and 1-5-1 ATS, in their last seven playoff games as underdogs without Tom Brady. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Seahawks  picksKannon has analyzed Seahawks vs. Patriots from every possible angle.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye, the runner-up to the NFL MVP award, combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Patriots vs. Seahawks spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that is up well over $7,000 on its NFL picks since its inception, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Age is but a number to Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl. The 40-year-old won his second consecutive gold medal in the parallel giant slalom on Sunday, and he made Winter Olympic history in the process.Karl beat silver medalist Sangkyum Kim's time by 0.19 seconds to defend his title in the parallel giant slalom after taking home gold at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Karl's win at the age of 40 years and 115 days made him the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Olympics history.That topped the previous record of 40 years and 12 days, which was set by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen in 2014.\nUpon winning his second consecutive gold medal, Karl did what anyone would do. He ripped off layer after layer of clothing until he was bare-chested in frigid weather, flexed and fell into the snow. Speaking with reporters after the race, Karl said the celebration wasn't as chilly as it appeared.\n\"We have four runs, it was really long, we are sweating full gas -- it's like you're coming out from the sauna,\" Karl said, per the Associated Press. \"I wanted to lay longer in the snow to cool down.\"This gold medal was the fourth Olympic medal of Karl's career. In addition to his two gold medals, Karl won a silver medal in 2010 and a bronze medal in 2014.U.S. notches gold in team figure skating eventHours after Breezy Johnson got the United States on the board with gold in the women's downhill skiing event, Team USA tacked on another gold medal in team figure skating.\nFigure skating phenom Ilia Malinin, 21, sealed the medal with an exhilarating individual performance. With a score of 200.03, Malinin put the United States in first place, but Japan still had a chance to win the even with Shun Sato skating last.\nSato put up an impressive score of 194.86, but it wasn't quite enough to top Malinin and push Japan past the Americans on the podium. For the second consecutive Olympics, the United States has finished first in team figure skating.There will be plenty more opportunities for the U.S. to medal on the ice as the individual events begin on Monday.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFrom Super Bowl props like Jaxon Smith-Njigba first touchdown scorer (+500) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl 60 three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+280) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +390. As for Super Bowl MVP, Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into an all-or-nothing lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+330). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the divisional round and then got a red-zone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC title game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which matches Hunter Henry for the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. Meanwhile, Pats tight end Hunter Henry ranked fourth at his position in Fantasy points in the regular season.They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but who are the daily Fantasy sleeper picks who can create salary cap space to build a winning roster? Every Big Game sees a player come out of nowhere to make both real-life and Fantasy impacts. So, before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game, and just five teams allowed more touchdowns to wideouts than the Pats in the regular season. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

These three are all playing outstanding football, and their teams are all in the top 10 of my Power Rankings. The Bucs are now first, while the Colts are fifth and the Seahawks are eighth.\nCan you believe it? \n        \n            \n                NFL QB 'Transfer Portal' Rankings: Daniel Jones, Sam Darnold and others highlight historic year for QB reboots\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nI won't exactly lump Mayfield in with the other two, in large part because he had success early with the Cleveland Browns before a shoulder injury derailed him there, only to have two more stops before landing in Tampa. Darnold and Jones were considered failed first-round picks by the Jets and Giants before resurrecting their careers -- Darnold last season with the Vikings and Jones this year.Mayfield has 11 touchdown passes, one interception and three game-winning drives. He has done so with a banged-up offense that saw him throwing to his fifth, sixth and seventh receivers in the second half of his team's victory over the 49ers on Sunday.\nThe Seahawks beat the Jaguars this week because of Darnold's big plays. He has 11 touchdowns and three picks while completing 70.8% of his passes.As for Jones, he's completing 71.7% of his passes with eight touchdowns and three picks. He's also run for two scores.This season is off to a crazy start, but four years ago if you said that Mayfield, Jones and Darnold would be in any MVP conversation, they would have called for you to get an immediate drug test. Now look. \nReclamation quarterbacks are real -- at least for now. \n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                7\n            \n                Seahawks\n            \n                10\n            \n                Eagles\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Buccaneers\n                                \n                            Despite all the injuries, they are 5-1 and hold the top seed in the NFC right now.

They've been hit hard by injuries.\n                        \n                            5\n                        \n                            3-1-1\n                        \n                                3\n                            \n                                    Steelers\n                                \n                            At 4-1, they have a nice hold of the AFC North with the other teams struggling. Aaron Rodgers is playing good football with 10 touchdown passes and three picks.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            4-1-0\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Colts\n                                \n                            At 5-1, they are the top seed in the AFC right now. They haven't exactly beaten up on a lot of good opponents, which is why this week's game against the Chargers is a big game.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            5-1-0\n                        \n                                5\n                            \n                                    Lions\n                                \n                            The secondary being crippled by injuries showed up in the loss to the Chiefs. Now they face a tough Tampa Bay offense led by Baker Mayfield.\n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            4-2-0\n                        \n                                6\n                            \n                                    Broncos\n                                \n                            They have won two straight, but the offense needs more from the passing game. Bo Nix has to be better down the field.\n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            4-2-0\n                        \n                                7\n                            \n                                    Seahawks\n                                \n                            The defensive front was dominant in the victory over the Jaguars with seven sacks. Mike Macdonald has himself a nasty unit on defense, and Sam Darnold loves the deep ball.\n                        \n                            7\n                        \n                            4-2-0\n                        \n                                8\n                            \n                                    Rams\n                                \n                            It wasn't pretty against the Ravens, but good teams find a way to win those games.

They limp into their bye with two straight losses.\n                        \n                            7\n                        \n                            4-2-0\n                        \n                                11\n                            \n                                    Chiefs\n                                \n                            That might have been a season-saving victory over the Lions.

They lost linebacker Fred Warner, the heart of their defense, in the loss to Tampa Bay.

Buffalo leads the league in total offense, averaging 395.8 yards per game. Quarterback Josh Allen has been spectacular this season, and he's completing 70.4% of his passes for 1,217 yards, nine touchdowns and just two interceptions. He's also racked up 212 rushing yards on 40 carries and three scores. The model projects the Bills to win in 78% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 68.55%, making this a valuable favorite to include with a pair of underdog picks in the model's Monday DraftKings parlay.Bears (+205) to defeat the CommandersChicago had an additional week to prepare for Washington while coming off a bye, and the model projects that to play to the Bears' advantage on Monday. After a slow start with two losses, largely due to defensive struggles with Chicago allowing 39.5 ppg over its first two contests, the Bears entered the bye week off back-to-back victories as the underdog in both contests. The Bears defeated the Cowboys, 31-14, in Week 3, followed by a 25-24 win over the Raiders. Chicago has the No. 10 scoring offense (25.3 ppg) this season. The model projects the Bears to win in 37% of simulations, however, with the implied odds of +205 signaling a 32.8% chance of victory, the model sees solid value in taking the shot of Chicago upsetting Washington.Brewers (+128) to defeat the DodgersThe Brewers are using the element of surprise to their advantage, not naming a Game 1 starter as of Monday morning, coming off their five-game series victory over the Cubs on Saturday. Milwaukee, which had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, knocked off the Cubs, 3-1, on Saturday to improve to 3-0 at home this postseason. The Brewers went 52-29 at home this season, and they will host the Dodgers on Monday. Regardless of who starts for the Brewers, they have the luxury of one of the top bullpens in baseball, ranking sixth in bullpen ERA (3.63) this season. The Brewers also had the No. 4 scoring offense (4.96 runs per game) this season. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday.Want more NFL picks for Monday Night Football and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

Freddie Freeman launched a solo home run and a second run scored on a bases-loaded walk, which was just enough for the Dodgers to take a 1-0 series lead.The Brewers, the top overall seed in Major League Baseball's postseason, became the fourth and final team to advance to the league championship round on Saturday night. The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin.Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals.

Even splitting the first two road games would help, but the Dodgers are dreaming big -- mostly of back-to-back World Series wins.Brewers: After a bullpen game Monday, the Brewers will return to a traditional start with Freddy Peralta. More importantly, though, manager Pat Murphy has to figure out how to get his hitters going after Blake Snell mowed down the lineup in Game 1. That's no easy task against Yoshinobu Yamamoto, but you can't win if you don't get on base.\nGame 2 predictionBlake Snell was marvelous in Game 1 and even then the Dodgers barely held on for the win. The Brewers are too good to be held down two games in a row. Look for them to even the NLCS at one game apiece behind their ace, Freddy Peralta, in Game 2. -- Mike Axisa\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In one of the biggest early surprises of the 2025 NFL season, the New England Patriots sit atop the AFC East after six weeks. New England is in first place in its division for the first time since 2019, the last time the franchise captured an AFC East crown. The Patriots leapfrogged the five-time defending division champion Bills for the top spot in the division following Buffalo's 24-14 loss to the Falcons on Monday night. While both teams have 4-2 records, New England has the tiebreaker over Buffalo by virtue of its 23-20 win over the Bills in Week 5. While it's new ground for these Patriots, New England owned the AFC East from 2001-19. Over that span, the Patriots won 17 division titles en route to capturing six Super Bowls and nine AFC championships. Since 2019, however, the Patriots have been supplanted by the Bills as the beasts of the East. But while Buffalo has dominated the East, it hasn't parlayed that dominance into a trip to the Super Bowl. The Bills, despite all of their success during the Josh Allen-Sean McDermott era, are still in pursuit of their first Super Bowl berth since 1993, when the franchise lost in the big game for a fourth straight year. \nNew England has been one of the biggest surprise stories during the first half of the 2025 regular season. After a 1-2 start, the Patriots have won three straight games that includes their highly-emotional win at Buffalo. The Patriots followed that performance up with a gritty, 25-19 win over the Saints in New Orleans last Sunday. Based on their remaining schedule, the Patriots should remain in the thick of things as far as competing for a playoff spot as well as the AFC East title. Eight of New England's final 11 games are against teams that currently have a losing record. The Patriots have two upcoming games against the winless Jets and two other games against teams (the Titans this week and the Ravens in Week 16) that currently have one win apiece. The Patriots' success has been the byproduct of an efficient passing attack and a defense that is currently seventh in the NFL in fewest points allowed. In several ways, the Patriots' current formula for success is similar to the one they parlayed into the franchise's first Super Bowl win 24 years ago. \nLike that team, the Patriots have a second-year quarterback at the helm in Drake Maye. Like Tom Brady back then, Maye is making the necessary big plays while largely taking care of the football and not putting his defense in too many bad spots. \nIt's been a full team effort on defense, which again harkens back to how the Patriots won the 2001 Super Bowl. The unit, which has been one of the NFL's best against the run, came up with a season-high three turnovers that proved to be a big difference in their upset win in Buffalo. A direct connection to that 2001 squad is Mike Vrabel, the Patriots' first-year coach who starred at linebacker for New England during their first three Super Bowl wins. While it's still early, Vrabel should be considered as a early front-runner for NFL Coach of the Year, an award he won back in 2021 while coaching the Titans. \nSpeaking of the Titans, Vrabel will make his return to Nashville on Sunday when the Patriots face a Titans team that fired their coach, Brian Callahan, on Monday. \n            ",

We've already seen one eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The college football coaching carousel has already added some big names and big programs, with James Franklin's firing by Penn State this week being the biggest split thus far. They joined UCLA as Big Ten programs to already fire their coach, while Arkansas has done the same in the SEC and might have more company soon. Auburn's Hugh Freeze and Florida's Billy Napier are both firmly on the hot seat after slow starts, and after the Tigers lost in gutting fashion on Saturday night to Georgia with another woeful offensive showing in a game Freeze desperately needed to win, his seat got even hotter. With plenty of other power conference programs making midseason changes, the natural question for Auburn was whether they'd follow suit. Auburn athletic director John Cohen was asked exactly that by AL.com's Peter Rauterkaus on Monday and offered a lukewarm vote of confidence in return. Cohen said it's \"not my expectation at this point\" to make a coaching change, but added that he'll \"never say never\" and offered this gem of a quote comparing Freeze to a car that sometimes doesn't start. \n\"I don't know if I'm going to walk outside and my car is going to start or not, I think it is,\" Cohen said. \"I have an expectation it will. But if my car doesn't start enough, then I will evaluate that and make decisions about my car. But that's not my expectation at this point about our football program.\"That's not exactly a ringing endorsement of Freeze, and Cohen leaves the door open for Auburn to make a change if the Tigers don't come to life in the second half of the season. While Freeze's $15.4 million buyout pales in comparison to the $50+ million Penn State shelled out to get rid of Franklin, it's still a sizable figure that makes it a tough decision, especially with Bryan Harsin's buyout still on the books. That said, if the program doesn't show signs of progress and the offense -- which is supposed to be Freeze's strength -- looks as toothless as it has been to start this season, it's hard to envision him being back in 2026.\nSo, for any Auburn fans hoping for a coaching change, they might just need a few more failures to start for Cohen and the Tigers to make that re-evaluation. \n            \n    ",

He caught just three of eight targets for 13 yards on Sunday vs. the Broncos, as the Jets offense hit a new low. Justin Fields completed 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards as the offense recorded just 82 total yards.

Just three months ago, Wilson was rewarded with a four-year, $130 million extension that includes $90 million guaranteed. \nWith Wilson sidelined, expect Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson, Allen Lazard and Arian Smith to receive an uptick in work. Reynolds led the Jets in receiving Sunday with three catches for 25 yards. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Brian Branch has been suspended by the NFL for one game without pay for his actions following the Lions' loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. The Lions' Pro Bowl defensive back initiated a fight between the two teams immediately following the Chiefs' 30-17 win when he punched Kansas City wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster. Branch, who will miss the Lions' upcoming home game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on \"Monday Night Football,\" stands to lose $76,624 for one one-game suspension. He is planning to appeal said suspension, according to NFL Media. Branch attributed his actions postgame to building frustration with Smith-Schuster during Sunday night's game. \"I did a real childish thing,\" Branch said. \"I'm tired of people doing stuff in between plays and refs don't catch it. They be trying to bully me out there. I shouldn't have did it, it was childish.\"\nLions coach Dan Campbell called Branch's actions \"inexcusable\" during his postgame press conference. He also apologized to Chiefs coach Andy Reid, who said during his postgame presser that Branch had some some \"pretty good damage\" to Smith-Schuster's nose without getting into specifics. \"You guys saw it,\" Reid said. \"The guy came up and hit JuJu for what looked like no reason.\"\n        \n            \n                Lions DB Brian Branch expresses remorse after fight with Chiefs WR Juju Smith-Schuster\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who attempted to shake Branch's hand prior to things going awry, didn't hold back when asked about what happened immediately after the game. \n\"We play the game in between the whistles,\" Mahomes told NBC Sports. \"They can do all the extra curricular stuff in between the whistles. I thought we played a great game today. And we'll keep this momentum moving forward.\" Now in his third season, this is already the 14th time Branch has been fined by the NFL and the fourth time he has been fined this season. Branch's previous fined cost him nearly $130,000 in salary. Assuming his suspension holds up, Branch will not be available for Detroit's playoff rematch against the Buccaneers. Branch's absence is an obvious blow for the Lions, who have the unenviable task of trying to slow down Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield. The early frontrunner for league MVP has thrown 12 touchdowns and just one interception in Tampa Bay's first six games. \n            ",

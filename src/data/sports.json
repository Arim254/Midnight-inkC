    "body": "\n        The 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals conclude on Friday when the top-seeded Indiana Hoosiers take on the fifth-seeded Oregon Ducks. It's a rematch of the Oct. 11 meeting that Indiana won 30-20 at Oregon despite being a 7-point underdog entering that game. The Ducks beat James Madison and Texas Tech to advance to the CFP semifinals. Indiana had a bye and then stomped Alabama 38-3 in the quarterfinals. The winner of this matchup advances to face Miami in the national title game on January 19. Oregon running back Jordon Davison has been ruled out, while running back Noah Whittington is listed as questionable. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5.

Indiana also knocked off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game despite entering that matchup as a 3.5-point underdog. Both sides of the ball are performing at a high level, but the defense has been particularly dominant in the past two games, holding Alabama and Ohio State to a combined 13 points. Quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the Heisman winner and likely top overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, leads a balanced offense that features two 800-yard backs and two 700-yard receivers. The Hoosiers have already knocked off Oregon once by double digits, and that was on the road, so they should be extremely confident entering this one. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Oregon can cover It's tough to beat a great team twice, and that's what Indiana will be attempting to do. This is the sixth rematch of a regular season game in College Football Playoff history, and four of the previous five have been won by the team that lost in the regular season. If Indiana was the most dominant team in the quarterfinals, the Ducks weren't too far behind. Oregon stifled Texas Tech's offense, forcing four turnovers and giving up just 215 total yards of offense. Offensively, the Ducks can boast many of the same qualities that Indiana can, including a likely first-round pick at quarterback in Dante Moore. Tight end Kenyon Sadiq, another possible first-round pick, leads the Ducks with 46 receptions and eight touchdown catches. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Indiana vs. Oregon picksRoberts has analyzied Oregon vs. Indiana and is leaning Over on the total.

However, both teams' defenses actually rank even higher than their offenses in total scoring, with Indiana having the No. 2 scoring defense at 11.1 points per game allowed, and Oregon sixth at 15.3 ppg. Neither team allowed a touchdown in its quarterfinal games despite challenging matchups, with Indiana playing Alabama and Oregon going against Texas A&M. These two teams combined for 50 points in their regular-season matchup, but with this being the second time they meet, plus the increased attention to detail in preparing for a semifinal, the model projects a lower-scoring matchup tonight.

    "body": "\n        The first main event of the Zuffa Boxing era is set. On Friday, UFC CEO Dana White announced that the Jan. 23 event from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas would be headlined by a junior middleweight bout between Callum Walsh and Carlos Ocampo. The card will stream live on Paramount+ and take place the night before UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Walsh (15-0, 11 KO) has been heavily hyped by White for years, with several of Walsh's fights streamed on UFC Fight Pass. With TKO's expansion into the boxing world with the new promotion, Zuffa Boxing, Walsh seemed like a sure thing to have been an anchor for the new promotional body, and his headline spot confirms those suspicions.In September, Walsh spoke to MMA Fighting and claimed the controversial expansion of TKO into boxing was a good thing and that he could never repay what White has done for his career.\"I like Dana,\" Walsh said. \"Me and Dana have a great relationship. Dana has done so much for my career. He's done so much for my life in general. I have no way of even repaying him, only by fighting and winning. The things that Dana has done for me, I'll forever be loyal to Dana, no matter what. I'll always defend Dana. I'll always do my best to talk well about him. Because he is a genuine good guy. He does care about the fighters. He does a lot behind the scenes that people don't see.\"Thus far, Walsh has lived up to the hype, impressively dispatching of a string of lower and mid-tier fighters. He currently sits as the No. 4-ranked junior middleweight by the IBF, as well as No. 5 and No. 13 by the WBC and WBO, respectively.\nIn his most recent outing, Walsh took a unanimous decision over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the undercard of Terence Crawford's win over Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez.In Ocampo (38-3, 26 KO), Walsh faces a man with far more high-level experience, though Ocampo has come up short in his biggest fights.Ocampo's three losses have come against Errol Spence Jr. for the IBF welterweight title in 2018, Sebastian Fundora for the WBC interim junior middleweight title in 2022, and Tim Tszyu for the interim WBO title in 2023. Both Spence and Tszyu stopped Ocampo in the first round.\nSince the loss to Tszyu, Ocampo has rattled off a trio of stoppage wins against club-level fighters.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Mario Cristobal left what many considered a dream job at Oregon to revive a Miami program desperate to return to the national title conversation, questions followed him out of Eugene. Had he walked away from the better job?Cristobal's decision was never purely about football. There was a deep emotional pull toward Miami, where he could coach his alma mater and return home to be closer to his ailing mother.Four years later, Cristobal has delivered on his promise, guiding the Hurricanes to their first national championship game in more than two decades. Awaiting them is No. 1 Indiana, which eliminated Cristobal's former team to reach the title game.The \"CristoBowl\" would have written themselves had Oregon and Miami met for the title, but with the Ducks exiting the College Football Playoff yet again while still chasing their first title-game appearance since 2015, Cristobal's once-controversial decision has proven to be more than an emotional one.Where Mark Richt and Manny Diaz helped restart investment in Miami football, Cristobal has taken the program another step forward, fully embracing the NIL and transfer portal era to return the Hurricanes to the national title stage.\nIf asked this week, the hyper-focused Cristobal would likely bristle at the suggestion that he cares about reaching a title game before Oregon. Still, even if he won't admit it publicly, the run has reinforced that leaving the Ducks was a sound football decision -- not merely one made from the heart.Miami's playoff run has also been about shedding baggage. Quarterback Carson Beck's legacy-defining drive against Ole Miss reshaped the narrative around his ability to deliver in big moments. Cristobal, long labeled an elite recruiter and evaluator with shaky game management, has had his team prepared and poised in late-game situations throughout the postseason.Next Monday night, the Hurricanes face the sport's ultimate test: the top-ranked, undefeated Indiana Hoosiers -- a sentence that still feels surreal, yet true.\nOregon fans won't allow much of a victory lap if Miami meets the same fate as the Ducks against Indiana. But if Cristobal can guide the Hurricanes to a stunning upset over the team that dismantled his former program, the conversation around his standing among the game's elite coaches will have to be rewritten.\n            ",

That's right, it's not even the Super Bowl yet, but we're already getting ready for the next Fantasy campaign.  With that in mind, here is the first look at our early 2026 top 24 overall PPR rankings. We're well aware that a lot could change with free agency and the NFL Draft.  But based on what just happened with the 2025 season, as well as what we think could happen this offseason, here are the top 24 overall rankings for 2026 from members of our CBS Sports staff.  And you can check out our rankings by position for quarterback, running back, wide receiver, and tight end. Jamey EisenbergAdam Aizer1. Bijan Robinson 2. Puka Nacua 3. Ja'Marr Chase 4. Jahmyr Gibbs 5. De'Von Achane 6. Jaxon Smith Njigba 7. CeeDee Lamb 8. Amon-Ra St. Brown 9. Omarion Hampton 10. Christian McCaffrey 11. James Cook 12. Jonathan Taylor 13. Trey McBride 14. Drake London 15. Rashee Rice 16. Josh Jacobs 17. A.J. Brown 18. Chase Brown 19. Malik Nabers 20. Saquon Barkley 21. Josh Allen 22. Justin Jefferson 23. Brock Bowers 24. Nico Collins  What stood out: Dan and Adam are the only ones who ranked Allen in the top 24. We all have Allen as the No. 1 quarterback heading into 2026, but I'm not going to draft a quarterback in the first two rounds. And I don't recommend reaching for a quarterback when three of the top five guys in 2025 in points per game (Matthew Stafford, Brock Purdy, and Drake Maye) all had an Average Draft Position on CBS after No. 93 overall. Now, if you are going to draft a quarterback early, then Allen is your guy. He has scored at least 24.4 Fantasy points per game in six years in a row, including three seasons over that span at 27.9 points or more. But I'm going to let someone else draft Allen if you have to select him in Round 2. Heath Cummings1. Puka Nacua 2. Jaxon Smith-Njigba 3. Ja'Marr Chase 4. Jahmyr Gibbs 5. Bijan Robinson 6. Amon-Ra St. Brown 7. CeeDee Lamb 8. Christian McCaffrey 9. De'Von Achane 10. Jonathan Taylor 11. Drake London 12. Rashee Rice 13. Malik Nabers 14. Trey McBride 15. Nico Collins 16. James Cook 17. Josh Jacobs 18. Ashton Jeanty 19. Chase Brown 20. Chris Olave 21. Brock Bowers 22. Justin Jefferson 23. Garrett Wilson 24. George Pickens What stood out: We all have similar players at the top of our rank lists, but Heath is the only one with three receivers as his top three picks. In 2025, there were seven non-quarterbacks who averaged at least 20 PPR points per game (McCaffrey, Nacua, Robinson, Taylor, Gibbs, Smith-Njigba, and Achane), and only two were receivers. The argument for Heath is that getting one of those top-tier receivers like Nacua, Smith-Njigba, or Chase, who averaged 18.1 PPR points per game in 2025, makes sense since they are rare if what just happened is replicated in 2026. But the reason I value Robinson and Gibbs ahead of the top trio of receivers is that I expect those two running backs to be even better next season -- and potentially dominate the field. \nJacob Gibbs1. Jahmyr Gibbs 2. Christian McCaffrey 3. Ja'Marr Chase 4. Puka Nacua 5. Jaxon Smith-Njigba 6. Bijan Robinson 7. De'Von Achane 8. Malik Nabers 9. Amon-Ra St. Brown 10. Jonathan Taylor 11. CeeDee Lamb 12. Drake London 13. James Cook 14. TreVeyon Henderson 15. Trey McBride 16. Josh Jacobs 17. Brock Bowers 18. Nico Collins 19. Ashton Jeanty 20. Omarion Hampton 21. Cam Skattebo 22. George Pickens 23. Chase Brown 24. Saquon Barkley  What stood out: Jacob only ranked nine receivers in his first two rounds, with 13 running backs and two tight ends rounding out his top 24. By comparison, everyone else has at least 11 wide receivers in their top 24, including me, Heat,h and Dave with 13. Jacob is higher on Skattebo and Barkley than the rest of us, and Skattebo (ankle) will be a riser for me if he's healthy for Week 1 after his rookie season was ended in Week 8 in 2025. Prior to getting hurt, Skattebo was a Fantasy star, and he averaged 15.9 PPR points per game, which led all rookies. For now, the earliest I would draft Barkley is Round 3 after he was a bust in 2025 when he averaged just 14.5 PPR points per game. Dave Richard1. Jahmyr Gibbs 2. Bijan Robinson 3. Puka Nacua 4. Ja'Marr Chase 5. De'Von Achane 6. Jaxon Smith-Njigba 7. Christian McCaffrey 8. James Cook 9. Jonathan Taylor 10. Omarion Hampton 11. CeeDee Lamb 12. Amon-Ra St. Brown 13. Malik Nabers 14. Rashee Rice   15. Trey McBride   16. Drake London 17. Chase Brown 18. Ashton Jeanty 19. Nico Collins 20. Chris Olave 21. Justin Jefferson 22. Garrett Wilson 23. Brock Bowers 24. George Pickens  What stood out: Adam and I are the only ones who ranked A.J. Brown in the top 24, and I'm curious to see if he'll remain in Philadelphia in 2026. He had his worst season with the Eagles since joining the team in 2022 at 14.7 PPR points per game, but that was still good enough for him to be the No. 11 receiver in 2025. He frustrated Fantasy managers at times this past season, but he also scored at least 16 PPR points in four of his final six games and averaged 19.8 PPR points per game over that span, proving he can still be a dominant Fantasy option. He'll only be 29 in 2026, and I still plan to target him in Round 2, barring a dramatic downgrade at quarterback if he leaves Philadelphia this offseason. \nDan Schneier1. Christian McCaffrey 2. Bijan Robinson 3. Puka Nacua 4. Jahmyr Gibbs 5. CeeDee Lamb 6. Jonathan Taylor 7. De'Von Achane 8. Jaxon Smith-Njigba 9. Amon-Ra St. Brown 10. Malik Nabers 11. James Cook 12. Trey McBride 13. Ashton Jeanty 14. Justin Jefferson 15. Nico Collins 16. Chris Olave 17. Brock Bowers 18. Drake London 19. Rashee Rice 20. Derrick Henry 21. Saquon Barkley 22. Josh Jacobs 23. George Pickens 24. Josh Allen   What stood out: I wrote about this in the running back rankings review, and it's worth mentioning here again that Dan has McCaffrey at No. 1 overall. I'm fascinated to see where Fantasy managers will draft McCaffrey, and in our first 2026 mock draft, he went at No. 6 overall. McCaffrey was amazing in 2025 when he finished No. 1 among non-quarterbacks at 23.8 PPR points per game. But he turns 30 in June and just had over 400 total touches in 2025, which are major red flags. I hope Dan is right and that McCaffrey has another standout season in 2026. But, for now, I can't draft him at No. 1 overall.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Miami has embraced its role as the Cardiac Canes this postseason, winning three games in three distinct ways — a late road touchdown to edge Texas A&M in a 10-3 defensive struggle, a physical 24-14 upset of No. 2 Ohio State in the quarterfinals and a dramatic, last-minute comeback to beat No. 6 Ole Miss 31-27 in the semifinals.Awaiting the Hurricanes is an Indiana team that has been historically dominant. The Hoosiers are the first team in CFP history to win two playoff games by 28-plus points -- and both victories came by more than 35. Indiana throttled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl quarterfinals and dismantled No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl semifinals.All that stands between Indiana and a perfect 15-0 season -- and the first national championship in program history -- is a Miami team riding an improbable playoff run. The Hurricanes have already dethroned two top-three seeds and will be unusually comfortable playing the sport's biggest game inside their home stadium.Both teams arrive with electric defenses. Miami's dominant front and aggressive secondary have driven its postseason surge, while Indiana has controlled the line of scrimmage and smothered opposing offenses with relentless pursuit and execution.Offensively, both units face stiff tests but enter with confidence following strong semifinal performances. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza has shredded Alabama and Oregon, aided by an Indiana offensive line that has provided time and a deep receiving corps capable of winning downfield. Miami's offense did just enough in its first two games before opening things up against Ole Miss, as Carson Beck caught fire and freshman standout Malachi Toney continued to show why he's one of the sport's rising stars.\nThe championship will ultimately come down to which team can solve the other's defensive puzzle. Either way, Jan. 19 will crown a fresh champion: Indiana is seeking its first national title, while Miami is chasing its first in 24 years.Below, you can stay updated with the College Football Playoff schedule as we move on to the national championship game. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scores, results\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasOrange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinals Fiesta Bowl: (10) Miami 31, (6) Ole Miss 27 | RecapState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Peach Bowl: (1) Indiana 56, (5) Oregon 22 | RecapMercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

No. 10 Miami will face No. 1 Indiana on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida for college football's ultimate prize. Despite entering the postseason as a double-digit seed, Miami will unofficially become the first team in the CFP era to \"host\" the national championship game.Indiana advanced to the title game after defeating Oregon in the Peach Bowl CFP semifinal. It will be the Hoosiers' first national title game appearance in program history. The Hoosiers had been one of the least successful FBS programs before coach Curt Cignetti arrived and guided the team to back-to-back CFP appearances.The national title game will mark just the third meeting between the programs. Miami and Indiana last played during the 1960s, with the Hoosiers earning a 28-14 win in 1964 before the Hurricanes evened the series with a 14-7 victory in 1966. Both games were played in Miami.\nIndiana entered the CFP without a postseason win since 1991, a drought that ended in dramatic fashion earlier this month with a 38-3 victory over Alabama in the CFP quarterfinals at the Rose Bowl. Miami is one win away from its first national title since 2001. After going 5-7 in Mario Cristobal's first season at his alma mater in 2022, the Hurricanes have surged to 13 wins and counting, reaching the national championship game for the first time since 2002. \nWith the expanded playoff format, Miami's 13 wins are the most in program history. The Hurricanes had previously reached 12 wins four times, including a 12-0 run during their 2001 national championship season.\n            \n    ",

Dusty May's No. 2-ranked Wolverines exited Happy Valley with a blemish-free record, but a helpful reminder that conference play is different.Wisconsin skitters into Ann Arbor on Saturday to try and do what no one has done: push the Wolverines at Crisler. Michigan has played seven games at home this season. Here's how they have gone:43-point win over Oakland.25-point win over Middle Tennessee.41-point win over Rutgers.28-point win over Villanova.52-point win over La Salle.41-point win over McNeese.30-point win over USC.Pure, raw dominance. Where to watch Michigan vs. Wisconsin live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 10 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Crisler Center -- Ann Arbor, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    Michigan vs. Wisconsin: Need to knowWill Wisconsin slow down this Michigan transition attack? Historically, Wisconsin has been terrific at limiting transition buckets under the Bo Ryan-Greg Gard braintrust. That hasn't been the case this year. The Badgers gave up 16 transition points to UCLA, 26 to Marquette and even 17 to Ball State. Now, they get to face arguably the best transition offense in all of college basketball. Michigan has scored 17 or more transition points in 12 of 14 games this year. The push-ahead passes and precise ball movement form a cheat code. If Michigan cracks 17+ transition points again, Wisconsin is in hot water.\nJohn Blackwell against Michigan's switches: Michigan has built a terrific defensive team because it has so many defenders who are up to the challenge of shadowing stars. May has felt comfortable instituting a switch-heavy defense because Yaxel Lendeborg, Morez Johnson, Elliot Cadeau, Roddy Gayle, Nimari Burnett and so many others are so comfortable defending on the perimeter. Blackwell is one of the premier scorers in the Big Ten, but even though the counting stats look sizzling (17.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 assists), he hasn't been humming at the level many expected when John Tonje departed. Blackwell is shooting just 23% (7-for-30) from downtown during four Big Ten games. You know he won't stay in the slump for much longer, and Michigan sure doesn't want to feel the wrath of a Blackwell eruption. The 6-4, 203-pound guard is so big, strong and adept at drawing fouls when he can reject screens and get downhill, so each perimeter defender will have their hands full. The good thing for Michigan is they have a cavalry of different options to throw at Blackwell.It's Winter time: Nolan Winter is not Wisconsin's best player, but he may be the most important. Against top-100 teams, Wisconsin has an abhorrent -49.8 net rating when Winter is not in the game, per hoop-explorer. The offense gets way worse. The defense drops off the stratosphere. The 7-foot, 235-pound junior can be a real weapon in this game with his pick-and-pop prowess and mobility. Michigan's front line is overwhelming, and Wisconsin has little shot to hold serve if Winter can't be a factor.  Michigan vs. Wisconsin prediction, picks\nYou need excellent individual guard play to hang with Michigan because it does such a good job of shrinking the floor and forcing teams to play low-value, isolation basketball. Wisconsin can do that. Nick Boyd and Blackwell are both comfortable one-on-one shot-creators who will need to have major showings to stay in touch on the road. The Badgers have been battered by physical teams like Villanova, Purdue, TCU and BYU, but they punched back earlier this week with an eight-point win over UCLA and showed a bit more vinegar. Michigan has been an all-time dominant team so far, but it could be a touch overvalued in the market right now. You just don't see a ton of 20-point blowouts in Big Ten play over the past few seasons. This league is too well-scouted and tendencies are scrutinized. I think the Badgers can unequivocally hang in this one because their guard play can be dynamic. Pick: Wisconsin +19.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MICH -19.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Wisconsin\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Wisconsin\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\nBefore we get to the Peach Bowl and the second College Football Playoff semifinal, can we acknowledge the Fiesta Bowl and the first semifinal? On Thursday night, the Miami Hurricanes and Ole Miss Rebels staged an instant classic in a back-and-forth, edge-of-your-seat Fiesta Bowl. The Hurricanes prevailed, 31-27, in a game that wasn't decided until the Rebels' Hail Mary attempt harmlessly hit the ground.Miami advances to the CFP National Championship on Jan. 19 and will get to play for the program's first national title since the 2001 season, on its home field, no less, at Hard Rock Stadium.The Hurricanes will face the winner of Friday's Peach Bowl between the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers (14-0), who are the last undefeated team remaining in the FBS, and the No. 5 Oregon Ducks (13-1), also from the Big Ten.The Hoosiers are two wins away from completing arguably the most remarkable turnaround in sports. They had entered the 2025 season as the program with the most losses all-time in college football. Like Indiana, the Ducks are two wins away from the first national championship in program history. But unlike the Hoosiers, Oregon has been a national power for much of the 21st century.  Indiana is a 3.5-point favorite against the Ducks after initially opening as a 4-point favorite.While Indiana vs. Oregon is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes 10 NBA matchups. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Jan. 9. All times Eastern.College Football Playoff semifinal best bets, where to watchPeach Bowl: No. 1 Indiana vs. No. 5 OregonTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Atlanta | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Oregon +3.5 | Expert: Oregon +4.5 (Matt Severance)\nThe Hoosiers and Ducks already have met this season. On Oct. 11, Indiana got out of Eugene, Ore., with a 30-20 victory. In that game, Hoosiers quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and the Indiana offense generated just 326 total yards, which was tied for the team's worst offensive performance this season. But Mendoza led a go-ahead touchdown drive in the fourth quarter, and the Hoosiers intercepted the Ducks' Dante Moore late to secure the win. Severance notes that in four of the five College Football Playoff rematches, the team that lost the earlier matchup came out on top in the rematch. \"It's so hard to beat a really good team twice in one season in this sport,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model says Oregon has a 54.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Ducks +3.5. NBA best bets, where to watchThunder at GrizzliesTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Memphis | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Grizzlies +5.5\nOklahoma City is not OK (at least entering Friday). The reigning NBA champions are just 7-6 in their last 13 games, they needed 46 points and a game-tying jumper from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on Wednesday to force overtime against lowly Utah, and they will be severely shorthanded for tonight's game at Memphis. The Thunder will be without Gilgeous-Alexander (ankle sprain), Chet Holmgren (bilateral shin soreness) and Isaiah Hartenstein (soleus), among others. On Friday, Oklahoma City will try to extend its winning streak over the Memphis Grizzlies to 16 games, but the SportsLine Projection Model says Memphis has a 68.0% to cover and gives a B grade to Grizzlies +5.5.Bucks at LakersTime: 10:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 229.5\nThe battle to be the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference is shaping up to be a wild royal rumble. Just 2½ games separate the current No. 2 team, the Spurs (26-11), and the No. 6 team, the Rockets (22-12). The Los Angeles Lakers (23-12) also figure to be in the mix if they can stay healthy and improve defensively (they rank 21st in the league in defensive rating). For Friday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks, L.A.'s LeBron James, who sat out Wednesday's loss at San Antonio, is questionable with multiple ailments. Milwaukee ranks 18th in the NBA in defensive rating (115.9 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 57.9% chance the teams combine for 230 points or more and assigns a B grade to Over 229.5, but James' status is certainly worth monitoring until tip-off.Looking aheadNFL: Rams at PanthersTime: 4:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Charlotte | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Panthers +445 | Expert: Panthers +10.5 (R.J. White)\nThis season's NFL playoffs kick off on Saturday with a Super Wild Card Weekend matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers. The game is a rematch of one played in Week 13 when the Panthers forced three Matthew Stafford turnovers and got three passing touchdowns from Bryce Young in a 31-28 victory. Los Angeles enters the playoffs with the best offense in the league. The Rams led the league in scoring offense (30.5 points per game), yards per game (394.6) and passing yards per game (268.1) this season. But White notes that road teams that are favored by 10 points or more are 0-2 against-the-spread in NFL playoff history. \"Home 'dogs of at least 3.5 are 6-2 ATS in the playoffs since 2010 as well,\" White says. The SportsLine Projection Model says that Carolina has a 24.0% chance to win and gives a B grade to the Panthers money line (+445).NFL: Packers at BearsTime: 8 p.m. Saturday | Location: Chicago | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Bears +1.5 | Expert: Bears +1.5 (Emory Hunt)\nThe Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers renew the oldest, most storied and most played rivalry in NFL history when they collide in a Super Wild Card Weekend matchup on Saturday at Soldier Field. The game will be the 213th meeting all-time between the rivals but just the third in the playoffs. The teams split their two matchups this season, with each winning on its home field. The Bears own the third-best rushing attack in the league, averaging 144.5 yards per game. \"What makes the Bears a difficult matchup is how they are built to win many different ways offensively,\" Hunt says. \"They can run the ball when they want to and have explosiveness in the pass game at both WR and TE.\" The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 54.0% chance Chicago covers and assigns a B grade to Bears +1.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins have hired Jon-Eric Sullivan as their next general manager, the team announced on Friday evening. Sullivan is a long-time Green Bay Packers executive who started with the team in 2003 and has worked as the vice president of player personnel since 2022.\"What an incredible honor it is to serve as general manager of the Miami Dolphins, an organization of history, tradition and great pride,\" said Sullivan in a statement. \"I want to express my gratitude to Stephen Ross and his family for this exceptional opportunity and the belief they've placed in me to lead this storied franchise forward. I also want to thank the entire Packers organization, especially Brian Gutekunst and the late Ted Thompson, for their leadership and allowing me to be entrenched in a process that has brought more than 30 years of sustained success to Green Bay.\"Now, as we forge ahead, we will build a football team that is resilient, physical and tough. We will compete no matter the circumstances, with the ultimate goal of competing for division championships and Super Bowls. Our team building process will be intentional, disciplined and sound. And we will do it together, with collaboration and hard work. It has always been and always will be a team sport. I can't wait to get started.\"\nSullivan was a scout with the Packers when they won Super Bowl XLV to cap off the 2010 season and has worked closely with Packers GM Brian Gutekunst to build a perennial playoff contender in Green Bay. Sullivan is the son of long-time college and NFL coach Jerry Sullivan, who spent 40 years on various sidelines and worked for the Dolphins as a wide receivers coach in 2004.In Miami, Sullivan replaces Chris Grier, who was fired by the Dolphins in October after serving as the team's GM since 2016, when he was promoted from director of college scouting. During Grier's tenure as general manager, the Dolphins experienced seven losing seasons and reached the postseason only three times. Miami has not won a playoff game since 2000.\n        \n            \n                Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel: Offensive guru out after second straight losing season, benching Tua Tagovailoa\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSullivan's first task in Miami will be hiring a new coach to replace Mike McDaniel, who was fired Thursday after the team's 7-10 finish to the 2025 season, his fourth as coach. The Dolphins started the year 2-7 but rallied by winning five of their final eight. Ultimately, it was not enough to save McDaniel's job as owner Stephen Ross said the team is in need of \"comprehensive change.\"\n\"I could not be more excited to welcome Jon-Eric Sullivan as our next general manager. Jon-Eric brings a clear vision for how to build and run a football team, founded upon his own experience at a winning organization,\" Dolphins wner Stephen Ross said in a statement. \"As we went through our search process, it became undeniable the respect Jon-Eric has across the league as a talent evaluator, leader and man of integrity.\"Miami's season included the benching of former No. 5 overall pick Tua Tagovailoa one year after the Dolphins signed him to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension. Tagovailoa said Monday he would \"be good with\" a new opportunity elsewhere. After hiring a new coach, figuring out what to with Tagovailoa, who has a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026, will surely be one of Sullivan's top priorities. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nothing in the transfer portal is final until the ink is dry -- and sometimes not even then. DJ Lagway's verbal commitment to Baylor looked like a clean win for the Bears on Thursday, but the situation is still worth watching.Lagway, the former Florida quarterback, has continued dialogue with other programs, including Ole Miss, even after verbally committing to Baylor, sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz on Friday afternoon. Lagway informed multiple people of his commitment to the Bears and even began recruiting other players on Baylor's behalf. Still, the continued communication elsewhere adds an unexpected wrinkle to what appeared to be a significant pickup for a Baylor team desperate for momentum.Lagway, the No. 1 quarterback in the 2024 high school recruiting class, committed to Baylor after two seasons at Florida. If he does inevitably enroll, he would be the highest-rated quarterback recruit ever to land in Waco. A Baylor legacy whose father Derek played for the Bears from 1997-2001, Lagway completed 62% of his passes at Florida for 4,179 yards, 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions across 24 games, while also adding 237 rushing yards and a score.\nHe is currently ranked as the No. 4 quarterback and No. 13 overall prospect in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports transfer portal rankings.The appeal of Baylor is obvious. \n        \n            \n                Sam Leavitt to visit Miami: Arizona State QB, No. 1 in transfer portal, among options to replace Carson Beck\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOffensive coordinator Jake Spavital has a strong reputation for developing quarterbacks, and the Bears' wide-open system mirrors what Lagway thrived in at Willis High School, where he set a Texas 6A record with 58 touchdown passes in 2023. For a player who battled injuries and inconsistency during Florida's 2025 season, Baylor offers a chance to reset away from the SEC spotlight.So why Ole Miss?Part of the answer may have emerged earlier Friday, when the NCAA formally denied quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' waiver request, effectively ending his college eligibility. Chambliss had transferred in from Division II Ferris State and was expected to return for the Rebels in 2026 if his waiver was approved. With that door now shut -- pending a potential appeal -- Ole Miss suddenly finds itself with fewer experienced options at quarterback on the heels of a run to the College Football Playoff semifinals.\nThat timing makes Lagway's continued dialogue with the Rebels more notable, even if nothing has changed publicly. Ole Miss is entering a new era under first-year coach Pete Golding, and quarterback clarity is now a pressing issue.For Baylor, the situation exposes just how precarious portal wins can be. After a 5-7 season, Bears coach Dave Aranda heads into 2026 squarely on the Big 12's hottest seat, and Lagway's pledge was seen as a rare jolt of energy for a program that has watched talent walk out the door during this portal window. Until Lagway is officially on campus and taking snaps in green and gold, nothing can be taken for granted. In the modern portal era, a commitment is no longer a finish line -- it's just another checkpoint.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Washington Commanders have promoted quarterbacks coach David Blough to offensive coordinator, sources tell CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Since ending his playing career in 2023, Blough, 30, has quickly risen up the coaching ladder, and he will now be tasked with getting Jayden Daniels and the Washington offense back on track.After going undrafted out of Purdue in 2019, Blough spent a few seasons as a backup quarterback with the Detroit Lions before playing his final full season with the Arizona Cardinals in 2022. Blough signed to the Lions' practice squad in 2023 but did not play in any games.In 2024, Commanders coach Dan Quinn hired Blough to be the assistant quarterbacks coach. Blough remained in that role for much of the last two seasons, until quarterbacks coach Tavita Pritchard was hired to be the next coach at Stanford in November. After that, Blough was promoted to quarterbacks coach for the remainder of the season.The Commanders' 2025 season was derailed by injuries to star players like Daniels and receiver Terry McLaurin, and the offense took a clear step back after reaching the NFC Championship Game the year prior. Washington ranked 22nd in points per game (20.9), 22nd in yards per game (318.8) and 24th in passing yards per game (184.1). In the wake of that disappointment, Quinn fired offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury.\nWith Washington in need of a replacement for Kingsbury, the team simply promoted Blough, who had received interest from other teams around the league. Dating back to his time with the Atlanta Falcons, Quinn has a history with letting talented assistants like Matt LaFleur and Mike McDaniel go to other teams. This time, he keeps Blough, who seems to be a rising star in the coaching world.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the NFL season kicks off when the Pittsburgh Steelers travel to take on the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday Night Football, and the 2025 MLB playoffs roll on with two matchups on Thursday, making it a perfect time to use BetMGM bonus code CBSSPORTS, which offers $150 in bonus bets if your first $10 bet wins or up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first qualifying wager loses. Steelers vs. Bengals begins at 8:15 p.m. ET, while Game 3 of Dodgers vs. Brewers and Game 4 of Blue Jays vs. Mariners are set to unfold. Picks from all three games are among our Thursday MLB and NFL best bets at BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts. Get the newest BetMGM bonus code and take advantage of one of the best sportsbook promos. Get started now:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 42-25 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also entered the league championship round of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. Anybody following its MLB betting and NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Thursday's best bets at BetMGMBengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)Combining these three picks into a Thursday MLB and NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +780 (risk $100 to win $780). Bet it at BetMGM here:Bengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)\"The Steelers are coming off their most impressive win of the season, but you could blame the awful spot for Cleveland, and I'm still not sure what they do better than most teams. The defense looks a lot better now that it's healthier, but it was healthy in Week 1 when it got gashed by a Jets team that is 50-50 to complete a forward pass most weeks,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The 5.1 yards per play on offense is comparable to the Panthers and Raiders. Basically, this doesn't profile as a team that should be laying this many points on the road, especially in a divisional matchup, even against a bad Bengals team.\" Back Cincinnati at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Payroll disparity is showing a bit with Los Angeles winning seven of its first eight postseason games. Now the Dodgers will trot out Tyler Glasnow as their Game 3 starter and Glasnow has thrown 7 2/3 scoreless innings this postseason. However, he does have a 4.55 career ERA against Milwaukee and the Brewers have only been beaten by two runs or more twice during the 2025 MLB Playoffs. Jose Quintana will likely pitch an extended stretch for Milwaukee tonight and he threw three scoreless innings of his own in his only postseason appearance thus far. Road teams have won every game of the NLCS and ALCS so far, and the model sees value here with the Brewers winning in 48% of simulations. Bet the Brewers at BetMGM here:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)The Blue Jays finally got on the board with a 13-4 win in Game 3 on Wednesday, but Seattle still holds a 2-1 advantage in the series. The Mariners should also feel pretty good sending Luis Castillo to the mound, as he has only given up one hit in six innings of work this postseason. Meanwhile, expected Toronto starter Max Scherzer posted a 10.20 ERA in September and is making his first appearance since Sept. 24 tonight. The model says Seattle wins in 59% of simulations. Bet Seattle at BetMGM:Want more NFL picks for Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers has passed an all-time Steelers legend in the NFL record books. Rodgers, Pittsburgh's current quarterback, moved past Ben Roethlisberger for fifth all-time in career passing yards during Thursday night's game against the Bengals. Rodgers, who recently passed former teammate Brett Favre for fourth all-time in career touchdown passes, now trails only Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and Favre in career passing yards. That's a pretty significant accomplishment when you consider that Rodgers spent his first three NFL seasons as Favre's backup in Green Bay. He then missed virtually the entire 2023 season after injuring his Achilles in Week 1. Rodgers is the first quarterback to pass Roethlisberger in passing yards since Roethlisberger's retirement at the end of the 2021 season. He passed Big Ben on a 15-yard completion to Jaylen Warren just before the two-minute warning Thursday night. NFL's all-time career passing leaders PlayerYards1. Tom Brady89,2142.Drew Brees 80,3583.Peyton Manning71,9404.Brett Favre71,8385. Aaron Rodgers 64,2226. Ben Roethlisberger 64,0887. Philip Rivers 63,4408.Matt Ryan 62,7929. Dan Marino61,36110. Matthew Stafford61,312 A six-time Pro Bowler, Roethlisberger is eighth all-time in career passing touchdowns. In 2004, he won Offensive Rookie of the Year while going 12-0 as Pittsburgh's starter during the regular season. The following season, Roethlisberger became the youngest starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl as well as the first to in the Super Bowl as a sixth-seeded team. In 2008, Roethlisberger won his second ring after throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. Two years later, he and the Steelers fell short against Rodgers' Packers in what was ultimately Pittsburgh's last Super Bowl appearance with Roethlisberger under center. While he never won another title, Roethlisberger still had some memorable moments during the second half of his career when he was a much more prolific than he had been during his early years. In 2014, he won his first passing title while becoming the first quarterback to throw six touchdowns in consecutive games. The following season, he led the NFL in average passing yards per game for a second straight year while nearly leading Pittsburgh to an upset win over the eventual champion Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs. In 2017, Roethlisberger became the first quarterback to have three career games with at least 500 passing yards after throwing for 506 yards in a win over the Ravens. A year later, he won his second passing title while joining Brady, Manning, Brees, Stafford, Dan Marino, and Patrick Mahomes as the only quarterbacks in history to that point to throw for over 5,000 yards in a season. Pittsburgh has been trying to find Roethlisberger's longterm replacement since his retirement in January of 2022. While Rodgers may not be Pittsburgh's long-term answer, the 41-year-old is playing at a level the Steelers haven't seen at the quarterback position since Big Ben hung up his cleats. The Steelers are hoping Rodgers can parlay his success into the franchise's first playoff appearance since since Roethlisberger helped Pittsburgh defeat the Chiefs in the 2016 divisional round. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Paul George is not expected to play in the Philadelphia 76ers' season opener Wednesday against the Boston Celtics and still \"has some checkmarks he has to hit\" in his return to play following the left arthroscopic knee surgery he underwent in the offseason, ESPN's Shams Charania reports.The nine-time All Star's return could come in the not-too-distant future -- \"shortly into the regular season,\" per Charania -- and he participated in some five-on-five action in Thursday's practice.\"We are trying to get him through the thresholds of five-on-zero to some smaller-numbered live action yesterday, and then he jumped into a bit of five-on-five live today,\" coach Nick Nurse said Thursday. \"Just trying to keep moving him in the right direction.\"When asked if there's optimism about George's potential availability for the season opener, Nurse seemed skeptical.\"Nah,\" Nurse said. \"Yesterday was his first day live -- I mean small-number live -- and today was a short amount of five-on-five, so we have to just keep waiting.\"\n\n        \n            \n                The Conversation: Is there any hope for Joel Embiid and the Sixers?\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGeorge, 35, had the surgery in mid-July after suffering an injury during a workout. It came just over a year after he agreed to a four-year, $212 million deal with Philadelphia the previous offseason.It was a brutally disappointing 2024-25 for both George and the 76ers. George struggled with several injuries, appeared in just 41 games and averaged just 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists. The 16.2 points per game were his lowest since 2014-15, in which he only appeared in eight games. The 76ers, who were also without Joel Embiid (limited to just 19 games) and Tyrese Maxey (52 games) for significant stretches, shut George down for the season in May.The 76ers, given Embiid and George's ages and injury histories, are one of the most difficult teams to project in 2025-26, even in what appears to be a wide-open Eastern Conference. When healthy, Philadelphia has plenty of star power and a solid supporting cast with Quentin Grimes, Jared McCain, Kelly Oubre Jr. and VJ Edgecombe, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Health, however, has been fleeting, and the team will hope George's likely absence to begin the year isn't a harbinger of injuries to come.\nThe 76ers will close out their preseason schedule against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. While George won't play, Nurse said there's a chance Embiid could suit up in the preseason finale as he ramps up for the regular season. \n            ",

Given all of the injuries Washington has seen at receiver recently, Burks, who spent his entire career with the Tennessee Titans before being waived earlier this month, could be elevated quickly.Commanders star wideout Terry McLaurin has missed the last three games with a quad injury, and did not practice on Thursday after being limited on Wednesday. Deebo Samuel is also dealing with a heel injury that has held him out of practice this week, and Noah Brown was recently placed on injured reserve. \n        \n            \n                Predicting overreactions for NFL Week 7: Trey Hendrickson done with Bengals? Commanders miss playoffs?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSamuel played through the heel injury on Monday night during Washington's 25-24 loss to the Chicago Bears. He caught four passes for just 15 yards. Chris Moore was actually the Commanders' leading receiver in Week 6 with 46 yards and a touchdown on three receptions. Moore, Luke McCaffrey and rookie Jaylin Lane have been called upon to step up in the past few weeks.\nDespite the thin receiver corps, the Commanders, now 3-3 on the year, are 1.5-point road favorites (via FanDuel) against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Burks reportedly visited with Washington this week. The former No. 18 overall pick cleared waivers earlier this month after Tennessee parted ways with him following three unproductive seasons. He has played just 27 career games, and caught 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown. Burks has struggled to stay on the field, having never played more than 11 games in a single season. He tore his ACL in practice late last season, then broke his collarbone in training camp just three months ago. \nThe 25-year-old pass-catcher certainly needed a change of scenery, and could potentially get his career on track in Washington. Burks has legitimate size at 6-foot-2, 225 pounds, and was a versatile playmaker during his days at the University of Arkansas.\n            \n    ",

The former LSU star turned in a truly electric 2024 campaign, leading the NFL in catches (127), receiving yards (1,708), and touchdown receptions (17), earning him the rare receiving \"Triple Crown.\" That season's performance cemented his status as one of the league's elite wideouts and a focal point of the Bengals' offense. In 2025, through six games, Chase has already recorded 42 receptions for 468 yards and four touchdowns, averaging 11.1 yards per catch. While those numbers don't yet match his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most reliable and explosive targets in football. Chase displayed an obvious rapport with new Cincinnati starter Joe Flacco, catching 10 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown in their first game together. See who else to roster here.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, which may include a play $5, get $100 offer:Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Steelers running back Jaylen Warren.

Despite splitting time in the backfield, he consistently provided a spark for the Steelers' offense with his quick burst and reliable hands. In 2025, through four games, Warren has rushed 54 times for 184 yards (3.4 yards per carry) and added 13 catches for 153 yards, averaging 11.8 yards per reception. While his rushing efficiency has dipped slightly, his impact as a pass-catcher continues to stand out.

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers will get his induction into the Steelers vs. Bengals rivalry on 'Thursday Night Football' to kick off NFL Week 7. Several NFL prop picks will center on Rodgers, Jaylen Warren, DK Metcalf and other Steelers considering Cincy ranks in the bottom five in points allowed, yards allowed, rushing defense and passing defense. However, Pittsburgh hasn't been a Steel Curtain on that side of the ball either. It ranks 27th in passing defense, so Joe Flacco, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will also be popular with NFL player props and Thursday Night Football betting. Cincy's Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks last season, is out, so his absence could further boost Pittsburgh offensive players in prop predictions.Rodgers has an NFL prop bar of 219.5 passing yards, after he threw for 235 yards in Week 6 and hit the Over. However, he went under this NFL prop total in three straight games prior to Sunday, and with Cincy possessing the No. 28 run defense, Pittsburgh may lean more on the ground game. With the same prop odds of -112 for the Over and Under, this may be one TNF prop to simply avoid altogether. Before betting any Bengals vs. Steelers props for Thursday Night Football, you need to see the Steelers vs. Bengals prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.You can make NFL prop picks at DraftKings, where you can get $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass. Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Bengals vs. Steelers NFL betting on Thursday Night Football, the Machine Learning Model  has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided Steelers vs. Bengals prop picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Cincinnati vs. Pittsburgh here.Top NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. SteelersAfter analyzing the Steelers vs. Bengals props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Bengals WR Chase goes Over 73.5 receiving yards (-114 at FanDuel). The Steelers have always struggled to contain Chase, who has at least 81 receiving yards in four straight versus Pittsburgh. He's averaged 98 receiving yards over this stretch, and many of those defenses were much better than this year's unit in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are giving up 178.8 receiving yards to opposing wideouts, which is the third-most in the NFL.Chase is also coming off 94-plus receiving yards in each of the last two weeks, and he showed great rapport with Flacco on Sunday, posting a stat line of 10-94-1. It's also important to note that Thursday's game will take place in Cincinnati, where Chase has gone over his receiving yardage prop in each of his last five home games, which includes a Week 13 contest versus the Steelers last season. The AI model projects Chase to have 93.7 receiving yards, giving this NFL prop bet a 4.5-star rating. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. SteelersIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has 13 additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

Tkachuk suffered the injury in the Senators' home-opener against the Nashville Predators on Monday.In the first period of the Sens' home-opener, Tkachuk was cross-checked into the boards by Predators defenseman Roman Josi, who was assessed a minor penalty on the play. Tkachuk returned to the game in a limited capacity, but he was noticeably absent when Ottawa pushed to tie the game late.\nAfter further evaluation, it was determined that Tkachuk needed surgery to repair the thumb. He now faces an extended absence, and the Senators have to stay afloat without one of their best players.The No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft, Tkachuk evolved into one of the best players in the league. From 2021-24, Tkachuk eclipsed the 30-goal mark in three consecutive seasons. Last year, Tkachuk 's offensive numbers dipped, but his five-on-five impacts were quite strong as he led Ottawa back to the playoffs for the first time since 2017.\nWith Tkachuk out for up to two months, the rest of the roster will have to pick up the slack in order to remain in the thick of the playoff race. Star center Tim Stützle will obviously be key to that, but how much can the Sens get out of players like Dylan Cozens and Shane Pinto? Their depth will be tested in a competitive Atlantic Division.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 NFL schedule has several interesting quirks which could add a bit more interest to NFL picks. Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are 7-point favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, the largest on the board, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders. Meanwhile, there are five contests with an NFL spread of under 2.5 points.Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Detroit is -5.5 against the Bucs in the first Monday game. Week 7 NFL picks could account for several factors from recent performance to NFL betting trends to scheduling oddities.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests.Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40.5) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated pick. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears.Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 7 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Through three quarters against the Steelers, Chase has caught 12 passes for 109 yards. That makes Chase just the second receiver in NFL history to have a 100-yard receiving game with three different starting quarterbacks through the first seven games of a team's season. The only other receiver to pull it off was Jimmy Smith, who accomplished the feat with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1997. (His quarterbacks were Rob Johnson, Steve Matthews and Mark Brunell.) As for Chase, he hit the 100-yard mark with Flacco on Thursday night against the Steelers. Before hitting 100 yards, Chase opened up the scoring for the Bengals in the second quarter with a short touchdown catch. \nBesides Flacco, Chase has also had a 100-yard receiving game with both Joe Burrow and Jaken Browning as his starting quarterbacks this season. In Week 2, Burrow was the starter and although he didn't finish the game, Chase went off for 165 yards in a 31-27 win over the Jaguars. In Week 5, Browning was his starter and he finished with 110 yards in a 37-24 loss to the Lions. The Bengals' season started with Burrow at quarterback, but after Burrow suffered a toe injury in Week 2, they were forced to turn to Browning. However, the Browning experiment only lasted three weeks before he was sent to the bench in favor of Flacco, who was brought in to save the season after Cincinnati made a trade with Cleveland. \nIt doesn't matter who's under center for Cincinnati, as long as they can throw a forward pass, Chase will put up big numbers with them. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- For the first time in over a month, Joe Burrow is in attendance to watch his team play. The Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback hasn't been to a game since injuring his toe in Week 2, but he's in the building at Paycor Stadium for the team's huge Thursday night showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Burrow has been sidelined since Sept. 14 when he suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury during the first half of a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The superstar quarterback underwent surgery just five days later and he's been rehabbing ever since. The Bengals had a home game in Week 5 that Burrow could have attended, but he decided to stay home, which might have been for the best, because Ja'Marr Chase didn't want him there. \"Hell no. He needs to get ready,\" Ja'Marr Chase said when asked if Burrow should attend the Week 5 game against the Lions. \"They don't need to see Joe's face. Just get healthy, come around later.\" \n        \n            \n                Steelers vs. Bengals prediction: Can Aaron Rodgers keep rolling as Cincinnati fights to stay alive?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bengals hit the road in Week 6 for a game against the Packers and Burrow obviously didn't go to that, but he was on the field during pregame on Thursday. \nBurrow was in a boot, but he was able to walk on his own, which is definitely an encouraging sign for the Bengals. \nSo when will Burrow return? When Burrow underwent surgery on Sept. 19, he was staring at a timeline of roughly three months and that still seems to be the case. According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, Burrow is targeting a mid-December return and he \"absolutely intends\" to comeback. \"He is on track, has had no setbacks,\" Rapoport said Thursday, \"If this continues in that direction, he should be back on the field in mid-December and has told people close to him that he absolutely intends to be back, just needs the team to stay alive until then.\"That last sentence is the key part here; Burrow is likely only going to return if the Bengals are still in the playoff race and that might explain why he decided to attend the game on Thursday. At 2-4, the Bengals' season is essentially on the line against the Steelers. If they win, they'll be 3-4 and right back in the thick of the AFC North, but if they lose, they'll drop to 2-5, and at that point, it's hard to envision a scenario where they'd still be in playoff contention come December. \nIf he returns in mid-December, that means he'd likely be back on the field in either Week 15 (vs. Ravens) or Week 16 (at Dolphins). For the Bengals to stay in playoff contention, they'd likely need to go 5-2 or 5-3 before getting to mid-December, so Joe Flacco will need to keep the team afloat if the Bengals are hoping to get their other Joe back. \n            ",

The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant. They remain the only team of 30 in MLB to have never played in the World Series.

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Every NFL team's final injury report comes out Friday afternoon after their last full practice of the week, but there's no need to wait until Friday for the Dallas Cowboys last report in the case of All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. He's back for Week 7 against the Washington Commanders after missing the last three games with ankle sprain he suffered back in Week 3 at the Chicago Bears.\"I don't think it'll be long at all,\" Lamb said Thursday when asked how long it will take him to shake the rust off on Sunday. \"I feel like I'm out there moving around, running around, being me. Happy as can be, obviously, and [I] just believe in my ankle. Obviously, I feel like it's it's back to where I needed it to be. Pretty good [feeling].\"The 26-year-old wideout could have returned last week at the Carolina Panthers in Week 6, but that would have required Lamb playing with limitations and on a snap count. This week, he is all systems go. \n\"That's why we took an extra week off. Just to make sure that I had that comfort,\" Lamb said. \"Just to make sure that I had the same explosiveness. Just to make sure I had that same stability. I'm cool.\"  Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer turned 52-years-old on Thursday, and he essentially confirmed Lamb's return with glee before practice even kicked off, posing for a picture with No. 88 and shouting \"he's my present.\"\"Yeah if he's breathing, I'd feel pretty good,\" Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. … \"CeeDee knows how to play football. If he runs around and catches a pass or two, I'm good.\"\nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott confirmed Schottenheimer's declaration that his No. 1 target is ready to roll in Week 7. \"A lot of excitement obviously. Just the last two days at practice, he looks good,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"He's ready to go. Obviously I saw him last week during the rehab and probably could have then. Being careful, but he's ready to go. Looks great. It's going to be fun.\"\nTwo No. 1 receiversDallas' pecking order in the passing game might be a little less pronounced going forward with Lamb rejoining George Pickens as the Cowboys' 1A and 1B. With Lamb sidelined, Pickens rocketed his performance up to an All-Pro level: Pickens' six receiving touchdowns are tied with Detroit Lions All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for the most in the NFL, and his 525 receiving yards rank third. He is also on a five-game streak with a receiving touchdown, tied for the longest active touchdown streak in the NFL with Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Jalen McMillan. \nA significant factor in Pickens' uptick is Dallas' realization that he's more than just the stereotypical, big-bodied outside receiver (6-foot-3-inches tall, 200 pounds) that the Pittsburgh Steelers portrayed Pickens to be in his first three seasons. His route-running heat map, via TruMedia, from his last two seasons in Pittsburgh (2023-2024) glow bright yellow down the sidelines, indicating most of his routes were distributed on vertical deep shots or \"go balls.\" This year with the Cowboys, Pickens' 2025 heat map still possesses some glowing yellow down the sideline, but he now also has some of that in the middle of the field.\"The one thing that George has proven over these last couple weeks is our ability to move him around which makes us more difficult to defend,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Because really CeeDee was the guy we were trying to move around right. and George was kind of one spot. But George has been terrific with us, putting him in different spots, different positions. I think he kind of likes is because it holds his attention and keeps him dialed in. I think it's a great thing. There's one ball, we know that. They're both really good players. So we'll see where the defense makes the ball go.\"Pickens affirmed his head coach's suspicions: he is relishing the expansion of his route tree all over the field in 2025 at the age of 24. \n\"[It's] Super good, moving me around especially when CeeDee was out gave me a better understanding of the playbook as well. When he [Lamb] comes back, [receiver Kavontae] Turp[in] comes back, they can move more of us all around a little bit better than we did before,\" Pickens said on Wednesday. \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Pickens, a 2022 second-round pick who is in the final year of his rookie deal this season, obviously appreciated the opportunity to pad his numbers with Lamb sidelined, but he's fully embracing share the label of WR1 again with Lamb in Week 7. \"Super excited. I don't even think the words can fully explain fully, him and possibly Turp. Super excited,\" Pickens said. \"Way more dangerous, way more explosive too when you got other guys like Cee[Dee] and Turp out there. It's another component of explosiveness that you can't really describe.\" \nSo how will Prescott figure out who gets the football now that Lamb is fully healthy, and Pickens has established himself as fully capable of being a No.1 target all on his own? He won't favor Lamb, who Prescott obviously has the great rapport with having played six seasons together now. It's simply a race to see who can get open first. Prescott's current approach is clearly working because he's thrown 10 touchdowns and no interceptions in the last three games with Lamb missing while rehabbing his sprained ankle.\"It's as much Schotty, the play caller, and the guys' [coaches] in the game plan, [their] responsibility of putting them in those positions where they are read No. 1 or read No. 2,\" Prescott said. \"From there, it's easy for me. Just stay within myself, keep reading the defense the way I've been seeing it, staying within the play, whoever gets open gets it. ... Obviously from the way that they orchestrate it, he'll [Lamb] get his chances.\"Prescott raved about the flexibility and the advantage of having two elite receivers who are both high-end caliber players, and the blessing in disguise that Lamb's injury was for Pickens' development. \n\"I think in the past of when we break the huddle, you don't know where CeeDee is lining up, and I think if CeeDee doesn't get hurt, GP is probably just going to be an outside receiver for the most part going forward. Him having those games, showing his ability, showing what he can do,\" Prescott said. ... \"You're going to have to figure out where they both are. If they both are maybe in the slot, maybe on the same side. Having the ability to have two guys like that and just put them wherever we feel is best each and every play, it's only going to be beneficial to us.\"It's early, but he feels the present day iteration of Lamb along with Pickens is an even more explosive and versatile duo than early-career Lamb and Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper were for him in the early 2020's.\"CeeDee was young, and he was more just in the slot. We weren't asking him to get out there, and he hadn't mastered the position I would say the position quite as he has. These two guys, young guys, ... have figured it out. ... It's electric,\" Prescott said. \"You got two playmakers like that that have the range. They can beat anybody with their speed down the field. Any 50/50 catch over one guy, over two guys. Whatever it is, it just makes it fun. It makes my job a whole lot easier and excited to see them both out there. The best part of it is they're each other's biggest fans. They're each other's biggest supporters. ... So we just got to find a way to spread out 20 balls and four touchdowns [between them].\"\nBack in May at Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's charity softball game, Lamb's college teammate at Oklahoma, Lamb said he and Pickens \"both ones.\" He doubled down on that message on Thursday. \"I was like 'you got two ones.' I don't think everybody believed me until one of us went down, and then you saw [it],\" Lamb said. \"So it's kind of like proved me right and proved everybody else wrong about who he is. His humility, the presence he brings to this team and to his game. He's a dominant receiver, and he's a very exciting player.\"\"I honestly don't mind seeing him run 60 yards, 30 yards and taking a slant to the crib. Any given play man, he's a heck of a player,\" Lamb continued. \"He can catch the ball. His [catch] radius is crazy. The things that he does after the plays. You just got to watch him. He's a character. He's amazing.\"\nThat level of amazing has helped Prescott soar to amazing heights his current 71.6% completion rate would rank as the highest in NFL history by a player who also led the league in pass attempts, according to NFL Pro. Prescott leads the NFL with 229 passing attempts entering Week 7. Much of his top five-caliber production has come with Lamb, center Cooper Beebe (ankle), left tackle Tyler Guyton (concussion), right guard Tyler Booker (ankle) and wide receiver KaVontae Turpin (foot) all missing time over the first six weeks of the season. Despite all that, Dallas enters Week 7 as the NFL's No. 3 scoring offense (29.7 points per game) and No. 1 total offense (387.5 total yards per game).\"That's Dak being Dak man. ... He's an overcomer. He's a conqueror,\" Lamb said. \"With him, he'll have his guys ready to run through a wall. It wasn't just me. He missed out on his o-linemen.  ... A lot of playmakers, and Dak being able to still Dak, that's the best thing about it. But when you get us back, hopefully I can help and so can Turp.\"  Dak Prescott This Season, NFL RanksNFL RankCompletion Percentage71.6%4thPass Attempts2291stCompletions 1641stPass Yards1,6172ndPass TD132ndPasser Rating104.69thSack Rate3.0%3rdCompletions of 25-Plus Yards171stGoing to bat with Jerry JonesCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said on Tuesday that he is weighing the idea of setting aside salary cap space to extend Pickens. Pickens himself said he \"wouldn't mind\" re-signing with Dallas. Both Prescott and Lamb plan to find time to chat with Jones before the start of next offseason to make their feelings clear that they want Pickens to be their teammate for the foreseeable future. \"Yeah, some sort [of way]. Hasn't happened yet. I've been a little busy, but it will,\" Prescott said of talking to Jones on Pickens' behalf. … \"When I run into him in that time of privacy, I'll make sure.\"  \"My answer is pretty obvious. I think I made that clear when I first came here: there is no ego here. I need him to get that [bag],\" Lamb said, affirming he will talk with Jones about Pickens. \"I hope he gets everything that he deserves here and just continue to do what we do.\"\n            ",

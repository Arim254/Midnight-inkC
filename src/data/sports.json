    "body": "\nThe final 'Monday Night Football' game of the 2025 NFL regular season will take place in Week 17 as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. Drake London (knee) is questionable for Atlanta, while Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for LA. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After opening at -8, the latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7.5-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5, down a point from the opening line. Before making any Rams vs. Falcons     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make 'Monday Night Football' DFS picks in the regular season comes in Week 17 as the Rams visit the Falcons at 8:15 p.m. ET. Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite, while the over/under is 48.5. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Bijan Robinson are the first names many will gravitate to when scouring the NFL DFS player pool, but both teams have potential daily Fantasy sleepers. Xavier Smith and Konata Mumpfield have absorbed most of Davante Adams' (doubtful, hamstring) snaps, while Tyler Allgeier is coming off a season-high of 79 rushing yards. None of these underrated options would do too much damage to your NFL DFS salary cap.Additionally, just three teams have allowed more Fantasy points to kickers than the Falcons, which should put Rams kciker Harrison Mevis on your radar. Should you insert him into NFL DFS lineups instead of the likes of Blake Corum or Darnell Mooney? Before making any Rams vs. Falcons DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Bijan Robinson as anytime TD scorer (-130) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Rams vs. FalconsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua, who has an over/under of 106.5 receiving yards. The league leader in receptions (114) is coming off the best game of his career last Thursday when he set or matched career highs in both yards (225) and touchdowns (2). Nacua has at least 167 receiving yards in three straight games, with four scores over that span. He has a great chance of hitting pay dirt versus an Atlanta defense which has seen five of its last six passing TDs allowed end up in the hands of opposing wide receivers. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Nacua to go Over 106.5 receiving yards (-113) at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also rostering Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins. The veteran has accounted for three total touchdowns in back-to-back games. Improved offensive line protection for Atlanta is allowing the team to see the best of Cousins, and he gets to face a suddenly leaky Rams defense. The last four QBs it has faced have averaged 271.5 passing yards and 2.5 passing touchdowns, with the likes of Jacoby Brissett and Bryce Young included in that quartet. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Cousins to go Over 1.5 touchdown passes (+147) at DraftKings:\nHow to set Falcons vs. Rams NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        The Notre Dame-USC rivalry is ending for the foreseeable future after the two sides failed to come to terms on an extension, which Trojans coach Lincoln Riley squarely blames on the Fighting Irish.Riley said during Monday's Alamo Bowl press conference that Notre Dame broke a previous agreement and left USC with no other options.\"Had Notre Dame lived up to their word and played us anytime, anywhere we'd be playing them the next two years,\" Riley said.The Fighting Irish and the Trojans previously have played annually since 1946, with the lone exception being 2020 due the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe Los Angeles Times reported before Christmas that USC was ready to compromise and play the 2026 game in November, but altered its mindset after learning of Notre Dame's signed memorandum of understanding with the College Football Playoff. USC instead demanded next year's game be played during Week Zero, which would be more advantageous than a potential late-season loss to the Fighting Irish in the playoff discussion.Had Notre Dame's MOU been in play this season, the Fighting Irish would have been the selection committee's final at-large pick over Miami, given the \"assurance\" for being ranked inside the top 12.\n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman returning to Notre Dame: Fighting Irish coach vows to 'run it back' amid reported NFL interest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNotre Dame has already announced a home-and-home series with BYU to take place in 2026 and 2027 in place of the matchups with USC, while the Trojans are still searching for a replacement opponent.\nNotre Dame and USC put out a statement after failing to come to terms earlier this month.\"USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans, our teams, and college football, and our institutions will continue working towards bringing back The Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh,\" Notre Dame and USC said in the joint statement. \"The rivalry between our two schools is one of the best in all of sport, and we look forward to meeting again in the future.\" Notre Dame, as an independent, will play one of the nation's most favorable slates in 2026 with USC no longer on the docket. The Fighting Irish only three true road games -- North Carolina, Syracuse and Purdue -- along with neutral-site contests against Wisconsin and Navy.\nThe Midshipmen are the only team among those five that finished bowl-eligible, and Notre Dame has won eight straight in the rivalry series, including six by at least 20 points.BYU and Miami are the only opponents on next season's schedule for Notre Dame that will have finished the 2025 campaign inside the national rankings.Before the season, Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua told Sports Illustrated that he hoped the rivalry would continue to be an annual event. \"I think Southern Cal and Notre Dame should play every year for as long as college football is played,\" he said, \"and SC knows that's how we feel.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the NBA Hater Report: A breakdown of some of the players, teams and trends around the league that are drawing the ire of yours truly. If you're not a fellow pessimist, proceed with caution. A couple weeks ago, North Carolina State coach Will Wade went on an epic postgame rant. The gist was this: Casual players are the death of a basketball team. It reminded me of the two summers I spent at Steve Lavin's basketball camp when I was a kid. Lavin called it \"wearing your cool jacket\" when a guy was going half speed, and he would call that kid out in front of the camp. It happened to me twice. I liked to shoot deep 3-pointers and dribble between my legs without going anywhere. I did not like to play defense. Casual players, cool jackets, it's all the same thing. These are the guys who don't box out, who don't pay attention away from the play, who can generally only be bothered to defend when their man has the ball, and even then the slap-the-floor stance is mostly for show and rarely holds up beyond the first move. \nLeBron James is becoming a casual player and it's killing the Lakers. Now, before we go any farther in sullying the King's good name, let's first make it clear that LeBron is not the Lakers' only, or even most, casual player. That distinction belongs to Luka Doncic, the president of all casuals. Look at Dončić loafing around in the paint on the possession below. He looks like he's having a confused senior moment searching for his keys, spinning aimless circles in the living room as his man, Jabari Smith Jr., stands unoccupied behind the 3-point line. The face-saving contest at the last second is the exact kind of \"look at me, I'm playing defense!\" move upon which the casual-player club was built. It's not just Dončić. Look at Rui Hachimura standing jelly-legged in no-man's land, rubbernecking the action below him (which he is in no position to affect anyway) with his back to his man, Kevin Durant, who happily accepts the invite to cut straight down the red carpet him like a prisoner scurrying past a half-asleep guard. \nHachimura was just following the casual lead of Austin Reaves, who let this happen less than two minutes into L.A.'s Christmas massacre at the hands of the Rockets.These types of plays are the makings of a Lakers defense that is operating as a bottom-five unit. Some of it is out of their hands. I once had a scout tell me that lateral force, meaning the ability to move side to side as a defender with enough explosion to stay in front of today's super athletes, is the most un-teachable skill he looks for in a prospect. A player, for the most part, either has it or he doesn't. Luka, to say the least, doesn't have it. As a whole, the Lakers are an old, slow, athletically compromised team that is going to struggle to defend even at max effort and focus for the full duration of possessions and, ultimately, games. That's what makes LeBron playing at his full defensive speed and with consistent attention to the dirty-work details, on this particular team, so important. \nEven at (almost) 41 years old and in his 23rd NBA season, James remains the Lakers' most forceful athlete (unless you count Jarred Vanderbilt on the defensive end, but he's an offensive liability). Call that an indictment of Rob Pelinka's roster or an endorsement of LeBron's still-standing physicality at this stage of his career, but either way it is what it is. The Lakers are set offensively with Luka and Reaves (when he gets back from this most recent calf strain). If they really want to compete with the big boys, they badly need LeBron to spend more, if not the bulk, of his energy if not covering for guys on the defensive end the way he has spent the rest of his career doing so on the offensive end, then at least carrying his own weight. They cannot afford for their most physical, athletic defender to be just another casual. Unfortunately, that's exactly what LeBron has been this season. Maybe it's age. Maybe he's just not wired to defend and rebound with consistent and committed force when he's no longer getting the same kind of offensive dopamine hits. Maybe Luka is contagious. Nico Harrison certainly thinks so. \nWhatever the case, here's spectator LeBron drying his hands on his jersey as his man, Amen Thompson, crashes from the corner for a long offensive rebound that leads to a second-chance 3-pointer. Here he is again just standing around doing nothing, not in position to help or get back to his man, who happens to be 42% 3-point shooter Royce O'Neal. Here he is getting cooked by Dillon Brooks -- either because he's not willing to stay strong against multiple moves or because he's no longer capable. \nHere he is flapping his chicken wing to feel for Thompson instead of actually putting a body on him and boxing out, and then half-heartedly going up for a rebound with one arm as Thompson shows him what actually pursuing a rebound looks like. Here he is inexplicably leaking out in transition when the Lakers don't even have the ball, leaving Alperen Sengun completely unoccupied to cruise in for a put-back. \nApologists will point to Sunday's win over the Kings in which LeBron looked great and energized on both ends. Maybe JJ Redick's \"uncomfortable\" Saturday practice worked. But I go back to Will Wade's casual player rant, which came after his Wolfpack had beaten Texas Southern by 36 points. Anyone can look good against a bad team, and the Kings are one of the worst teams in the league. \nIf this continues for an extended time (maybe Reaves being out will bring the best out of LeBron), then we can reassess. But for now, we have to look big picture, where the numbers don't lie. Entering Sunday, the Lakers' starting lineup of Luka, LeBron, Reaves, Hachimura and Deandre Ayton was getting blitzed to the tune of minus-16.7 points per 100 possessions with what would rank as the worst defensive rating in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. Swap out LeBron for Marcus Smart and the Lakers jump to plus-14.7 with a 90th percentile defense. All told, the Lakers entered Sunday having lost LeBron's total minutes 59 points, and not a single one of the four lineups with which he has played more than 40 possessions boasted a positive rating. In fact, those lineups were a combined minus-82.2 per 100 possessions, per CTG. These are all still relatively small samples and, to be clear, LeBron is not the sole reason the Lakers are a trash defensive team. But he's certainly a real part of the problem with the Lakers need him, to whatever degree is possible for a 41-year-old guy, to be at least part of a solution.\n            ",

With teams officially returning from winter break, Monday's slate represents the first full schedule of basketball games since Dec. 22 -- when the last Coaches Poll released. Since it's been almost a week -- or, in some cases, more than a week -- since some ranked teams played basketball, there wasn't a whole lot of change in the latest set of rankings. Michigan still held firm as the No. 1 team in the Coaches Poll following its 102-50 win against La Salle on Dec. 21. That was Michigan's eighth straight win of at least an 18-point margin. Since Nov. 19, the Wolverines are beating their opponents by an average of 34.3 points. They return to the court Monday night for one final tune-up against McNeese State before Big Ten play continues in earnest on Jan. 2 with a key home game against USC. Arizona is still hot on Michigan's heels for the No. 1 spot, though. The second-ranked Wildcats boast one of the best résumés in basketball thanks to strong non-conference wins against No. 22 Florida -- the reigning national champions -- as well as No. 4 UConn and No. 15 Alabama. They make their debut in conference play Jan. 3 against Utah. \nThough there weren't any decisive games following its 82-81 loss to Texas Tech, Duke made its return to the top five at No. 5. The Blue Devils leapfrogged Purdue, which dropped to No. 6 in the process.   First-place votes in parenthesisCoaches Poll 1. Michigan (20) 2. Arizona (11)3. Iowa State4. UConn5. Duke6. Purdue7.

The playoff picture got much more clear after Sunday's games, but there's still some positioning and division titles on the line.Atlanta has won two in a row with Kirk Cousins under center, improving to 6-9 in the process. The Falcons are playing out the string of their season for draft positioning, but they have a chance to throw a wrench into the Rams' plans by coming away with another win here.Los Angeles is coming off a wild, come-from-ahead loss to the division rival Seahawks last week, having undermined its own chances to land the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams piled up 581 yards of offense and didn't turn the ball over, but their defense let up down the stretch despite having forced three turnovers early on.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the Rams bounce back from their loss a week ago, or will the Falcons make it three straight victories? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Falcons vs. RamsDate: Monday, Dec. 29 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -7, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesL.A.'s playoff hopes. The Rams can no longer win the NFC West thanks to the Seahawks' and 49ers' wins on Sunday. The winner of the Seattle-San Francisco game next week is now going to be the top seed in the conference. That means L.A. is playing to maintain its position and climb as high as the No. 5 seed in the NFC and retain the right to go on the road and play against the NFC South champion, rather than having to go play against the Chicago Bears or Philadelphia Eagles in the first round. If the Rams win this week and next, they'll be the 5-seed regardless of what happens elsewhere.Matthew Stafford's MVP chase. Despite Drake Maye's five-touchdown game against the Jets on Sunday, Stafford remains the heavy favorite to win the Most Valuable Player trophy. According to DraftKings, Stafford is a -225 favorite, giving him an implied 69.2% probability to win. But that can obviously change very quickly if he doesn't put up a representative performance against the Falcons on Monday night. Stafford still leads the league in touchdown passes with 40 and has thrown only five interceptions while passing for over 4,100 yards, but it'll be interesting to see how the voters feel about handing the award to a player whose team might get a wild card slot rather than winning its own division -- especially if he doesn't finish the season with a bang. He has an opportunity to do the latter here, though.Kirk Cousins trying to extend his career. Cousins' first few appearances of this season did not inspire much confidence that he could land another job if and when the Falcons decide to cut ties with him due to his monster cap hit for next season. But he's done better over the past couple of weeks (512 of 79 for 570 yards, five touchdowns and an interception) and if he keeps it going against the Rams and Saints this week and next, maybe he could play himself into being a bridge quarterback option for somebody next offseason.Prediction\nAtlanta has won back-to-back games after dropping seven of eight ... but those games came against the Buccaneers and Cardinals. The Rams, to put it plainly, are not the Bucs and Cardinals. Even without Davante Adams, I expect them to be able to move the ball with relative ease against a Falcons defense that has regressed badly since the beginning of the season. The Rams rank 10th in the NFL in yards allowed per carry and should be able to contain Bijan Robinson from going completely ballistic, and if they can get pressure on Kirk Cousins, I just don't see a way that Atlanta can keep up. \nPrediction: Rams 26, Falcons 17\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        North Texas quarterback Drew Mestemaker announced Monday that he will enter the transfer portal when it opens on Jan. 2. Mestemaker's decision comes just two days after he led the Mean Green to a 49-47 win against San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl. Mestemaker completed 27 of his 47 pass attempts for 250 yards and three touchdowns. \"This was not an easy choice,\" Mestemaker wrote on social media. \"My time at North Texas has meant more to me than I can ever fully express. North Texas was the only school that believed in me enough to give me an opportunity as a walk-on when others didn't, and for that, this place will always hold a special place in my heart.\"From the moment I arrived, it felt like home, and I've grown tremendously both as a player and as a person.\" \nIt makes sense to think that Mestemaker may follow former coach Eric Morris to Oklahoma State -- especially after he emerged as one of Morris' latest diamond-in-the-rough success stories at quarterback. But the former Mean Green star is expected to garner interest from quarterback-needy teams on the transfer market, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer.Mestemaker, who didn't start as a varsity quarterback and instead played defensive back at Vandegrift High School in Austin, Texas, joined North Texas' roster as an unheralded walk-on in 2024. He spent most of his true freshman season as a backup but earned his first career start in the 2024 First Responder Bowl after former North Texas quarterback Chandler Morris transferred to Virginia. \n        \n            \n                Auburn star WR Cam Coleman to enter transfer portal: 7 potential destinations for No. 1 player in 2026 cycle\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMestemaker wowed in his first postseason appearance, as he tallied 448 total yards and three touchdowns in a narrow loss to Texas State. He also solidified himself as North Texas' quarterback of the future. \nIt didn't take long for Mestemaker to prove that his bowl start wasn't a fluke. In North Texas' 2025 season opener against Lamar, Mestemaker threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns while completing 75% of his passes. He also logged a touchdown on the ground. That was the first of three games this season in which Mestemaker had at least three touchdowns passing and one touchdown rushing. Mestemaker guided the Mean Green to an 11-1 regular season record and their first appearance in the American Conference Championship Game, where he accounted for 294 yards and two touchdowns through the air. Mestemaker's 4,129 yards led the FBS -- in fact, he was the only FBS quarterback with at least 4,000 yards passing on the season -- and his 31 touchdowns passing tied with Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin of Ohio State and Baylor's Sawyer Robertson for second-most in the nation. \nThe 6-foot-4 and 211-pound Mestemaker still has three years of eligibility, which adds to his appeal as a potential multi-year starter with more room to develop. Mestemaker comes from good stock Mestemaker could be the latest former Eric Morris protege to have success in the transfer portal. A former assistant at Texas Tech, where he tutored Patrick Mahomes, Morris was the head coach at Incarnate Word from 2018-21 and the offensive coordinator at Washington State in 2022. At Incarnate Word, he discovered a lightly recruited quarterback prospect named Cam Ward. Ward signed with UIW in 2020 and won the Jerry Rice Award as the most outstanding freshman in the FCS. He followed Morris to Washington State, where he threw for 3,735 yards and 25 touchdowns. \nWhen Morris left to become the coach at North Texas, Ward transferred to Miami. He finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting and was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after leading the FBS with 39 touchdowns passing in his lone season with the Hurricanes. Morris also recruited John Mateer, who is gearing up for a College Football Playoff run with Oklahoma, and Emmett Brown, who threw for 16 touchdowns at San Jose State last season, while he was at Washington State. Morris' first starter at North Texas, Chandler Morris, transferred to Virginia ahead of the 2025 season. Chandler Morris guided the Cavaliers to their first 10-win regular season since 1989 with 2,802 yards and 18 touchdowns passing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman is expected to enter the transfer portal, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported Monday, ending months of speculation surrounding the star playmaker's future with the Tigers. The former 5-star recruit, a 6-foot-3 spectacular catch machine, spent the last two seasons producing like one of the sport's best players on an offense that could never match him. With one more season of college eligibility until he's draft-eligible, Coleman is hitting the open market for a huge payday but, even more importantly, an opportunity to showcase his abilities in a good offense with a proven quarterback. Industry sources had already hinted at the possibility back in November, following the firing of former coach Hugh Freeze. CBS Sports' Chris Hummer reported at the time that it seemed increasingly likely Coleman would explore other options, despite Auburn's efforts to retain him. After Alex Golesh was hired as Auburn's new head coach in late November, he and staff made a significant push to keep Coleman in the fold for the 2026 season, but he has decided to enter the transfer portal when the window opens Friday.Coleman's decision is seen as a reflection not only of his own career trajectory but also of the Tigers' coaching transition and the ongoing uncertainty at quarterback.\nAs the No. 1 wide receiver on Auburn's roster and a proven game-changing talent, Coleman enters the portal with considerable leverage. He immediately jumps to No. 1 player in the transfer portal, and can essentially choose from a wide range of programs that want to add an elite offensive weapon to their roster.Coleman's production at Auburn was solid. Over the past two seasons, he has accumulated 1,306 yards receiving and 13 touchdowns on 93 catches across 25 games. His combination of size, speed and playmaking ability with a 6-foot-3, 197-pound frame makes him one of the most dangerous receivers in college football.A former five-star prospect and the No. 2 wide receiver in the 2024 recruiting class -- ranked No. 5 nationally -- Coleman was Auburn's second-highest rated signee in the modern recruiting era. As a true junior, he retains two years of eligibility, though his profile also makes him a likely candidate for the 2027 NFL Draft. A strong junior season could solidify his standing as a first-round prospect and perhaps the second wideout off the board behind Jeremiah Smith. \nColeman expects to attract attention from several high-profile programs. Oklahoma, Texas, Texas Tech, and USC could all be in the mix for his services. Alabama is a potential landing spot, where he could pair with fellow 2024 class standout Ryan Williams. Ohio State is another intriguing option, potentially teaming him with Jeremiah Smith assuming Carnell Tate departs for the NFL.Texas A&M is another school worth monitoring. Coleman was previously committed to the Aggies before flipping to Auburn and had a strong relationship with Holmon Wiggins, who recruited him while at Alabama and is now set to serve as Texas A&M's offensive coordinator in 2026.Auburn's program is entering a new chapter under Golesh, who was hired from South Florida. The Tigers could also see a reunion with transfer quarterback Byrum Brown, who developed into one of the most productive dual-threat quarterbacks in the country during his four seasons with the Bulls, including the last three under Golesh's system. While that pairing could reshape an Auburn offense desperately searching for stability at quarterback, it appears Coleman will pursue a fresh opportunity elsewhere.\nColeman's decision to enter the portal should be one of the most significant in the 2025-26 cycle. With his combination of elite recruiting pedigree, on-field production and NFL potential, he is poised to be among the most sought-after wide receivers in the transfer market. Programs across the country will be closely watching where the Phenix City, Alabama, native lands, knowing that he could instantly alter a team's offensive ceiling.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The calendar is about to flip to 2026 and there is still so much that has to happen between now and Opening Day. Five of the top six free agents remain unsigned (plus many others) and there are so many trade candidates who could move. Here now are Monday's hot stove rumors and happenings.Mariners willing to move top prospects for Donovan\nThe Mariners are willing to trade some of their best prospects for Cardinals super utility man Brendan Donovan, including switch-pitcher Jurrangelo Cijntje, reports the Seattle Times. Seattle is looking to add a second baseman after losing Jorge Polanco to free agency, and they're aiming high. They've been connected to D-backs star Ketel Marte in addition to Donovan.Cijntje is potentially expendable in part because lefty Kade Anderson, the No. 2 pick in 2025, could make an impact as soon as next season. Seattle has a deep prospect base and Donovan would fit very well because he can also play the outfield, which would leave a path for infielder and top prospect Colt Emerson when the time comes. That could be as soon as Opening Day.Tigers 'lukewarm' on Bregman\nAlthough the Tigers have interest in free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, it is \"lukewarm\" at best, reports the Detroit Free Press. The club hasn't budged much during negotiations. Detroit reportedly offered Bregman a six-year deal in the $170 million range last offseason, but he obviously picked the Red Sox. Bregman and Tigers manager A.J. Hinch know each other well from their Astros days.\nIt has been a fairly quiet offseason for the Tigers, who signed veteran closer Kenley Jansen and journeyman Drew Anderson to short-term deals. They also re-signed setup man Kyle Finnegan. Colt Keith is currently in line to get most of the playing time at third base, though Detroit's roster flexible enough to add Bregman and still get Keith plenty of at-bats at other positions.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Red Sox pursuing infieldersThe Red Sox continue to pursue another bat for the infield even after trading for Willson Contreras, according to the Boston Globe. Among their targets are Cardinals super utility man Brendan Donovan, Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte, Astros third baseman Isaac Paredes, and free agents Bo Bichette and Alex Bregman. Bregman spent 2025 with Boston.The BoSox and Rockies are the only teams to not sign a major-league free agent this offseason, though Boston has made significant trades to get Contreras, Sonny Gray, and Johan Oviedo. They currently have a combination of Romy Gonzalez, Marcelo Mayer, and Nick Sogard in line to play second and third bases, so yeah, there's room for another addition on the infield.\nOrioles bring back Eflin\nThe O's have re-signed veteran right-hander Zach Eflin to a one-year deal with a mutual option, the team announced late Sunday. Eflin gets a $3 million signing bonus with a $5 million salary in 2026, plus a $2 million buyout on a mutual option for 2027, reports FanSided. That adds up to $10 million guaranteed. There's another $4 million in bonuses tied to games started.Back trouble and a lat strain limited Eflin, 31, to 14 mostly ineffective starts in 2025. He was a rock solid mid-rotation starter from 2023-24, however, one with a knack for limiting walks and hard contact. Nabbing him for one year and $10 million guaranteed is a nice roll of the dice for an O's team that could still use another starter, but is much improved this offseason.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Angels, Padres, Pirates in on OkamotoAmong the teams interested in Japanese first baseman Kazuma Okamoto are the Angels, Padres, and Pirates, reports BeisbolFR. Okamoto's 45-day posting window closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4. There is some thought he is more likely to hit right away in the big leagues than Munetaka Murakami, who signed a two-year deal worth $34 million with the White Sox last week.\nWe ranked Okamoto, 29, as the 22nd-best free agent available this offseason. He's spent his entire career with the Yomiuri Giants and hit .322/.411/.581 with 15 home runs in 77 games around an injury to his non-throwing elbow in 2025. Okamoto has played third base most of his career, though he's seen more action at first in recent years, and is expected to stay there long-term.Heaney retires\nVeteran left-hander Andrew Heaney announced his retirement on social media over the weekend. \"I will miss the game greatly, but all of my experiences and the lasting relationships have made me a better person,\" Heaney wrote. Now 34, Heaney went 56-72 with a 4.57 ERA in parts of 12 MLB seasons. He started and won Game 4 of the 2023 World Series with the Rangers and also appeared in one regular-season game with the 2025 World Series champion Dodgers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the festivities are basically done, it's time to drown our sorrows in some fantasy basketball. This week, we have a jam-packed schedule, with 20 teams playing four times, and the remaining 10 teams suiting up on three occasions. With no two-game teams, picking and choosing your roster is going to be an arduous task.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DEN, GSW, IND, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, PHO, POR, SAC, SAS, WASThree Games: BOS, DAL, DET, HOU, LAC, LAL, MEM, PHI, TOR, UTATwo Games: N/AHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the eleventh week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Collin Sexton, CHAOpponents: MIL, GSW, @MIL, @CHISexton's success this season has typically come when other players are out. Based on that fact alone, this week might be a good opportunity to move him into your starting lineup. Kon Knueppel is currently sidelined with an ankle injury, something that could end up costing him multiple games. Although Sexton's overall fantasy value is largely reliant on points and 3s, he does have the ability to rack up decent assist numbers when afforded meaningful playing time. Given that he may have been dropped in a lot of leagues, quietly slotting him into your lineup for the next seven days, while somewhat risky, could end up being a smart play.Consider sitting: Jaylen Wells, MEMOpponents: PHI, @LAL, @LALDespite continuing to start, Wells' production over the past two weeks has been highly disappointing. In seven games during that time, he has averaged just 12.3 points, two steals, and 1.4 3-pointers. While there is no indication his role is going to change any time soon, the volume simply hasn't been there of late. As a player outside the top 150 in standard leagues, Wells is definitely a bench candidate this week, especially with so many other teams playing four games.Consider sitting: Ryan Nembhard, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnother player who seemingly has a starting role locked down, Nembhard has cooled off significantly after what was an impressive run of early games. In seven games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been well outside the top 250 in standard leagues, averaging 7.9 points and 6.1 assists in 25.3 minutes per contest. He remains a viable asset, but only for those in need of assists. However, with only three games in the next seven days, there is a decent chance you can supplement his production with someone suiting up four times.\nForwardsConsider starting: Peyton Watson, DENOpponents: @MIA, @TOR, @CLE, @BKNWhile Watson has been somewhat of an unexpected surprise this season, it does appear as though his window of value could be coming to an end in the near future. Denver is currently without three regular starters, meaning Watson's role is safe, for now. Both Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon could return at some point this week, albeit in a limited role. This means we might be able to squeeze one more week of value from Watson, a player who has averaged 12 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 3-pointers in four games over the past week. Consider starting: Jaylon Tyson, CLEOpponents: @SAS, PHO, DEN, DETDespite recently moving back to the bench, Tyson has been able to continue putting up solid production, averaging 19 points, nine rebounds, 1.7 3-pointers, and 1.3 combined steals and blocks over his past three games. Even though the Cavaliers are starting to get healthy, Tyson should remain a key piece in the rotation, even off the bench. Cleveland is looking to turn around what has been a slow start to the season, with Tyson likely to play a meaningful role. While there is a small amount of risk given the small sample size, managers should feel relatively comfortable rolling him out for a four-game week.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: @LAL, MIA, @CLEThompson's role continues to be a source of frustration for managers, with head coach JB Bickerstaff not afraid to mix things up on a nightly basis. Whether we agree with his decision-making or not, the fact is that Bickerstaff appears to have some trust issues when it comes to Thompson, limiting his overall upside. He is by no means a clear-cut bench candidate, especially for those simply looking for defensive contributions. However, in six appearances over the past two weeks, Thompson has averaged just 12.3 points, six rebounds, and 1.3 steals, including a woeful 51.9 percent from the line.\nCentersConsider starting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: @LAC, BOS, @PHO, MILWith Domantas Sabonis still weeks away from returning from a knee injury, Raynaud's value continues to go up by the day. While he clearly has some things to work on, his touch around the basket is undeniable. In five games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been a borderline top 60 player, averaging 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 0.8 blocks, shooting 52.9 percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the line. His minutes have been a little underwhelming, having logged no more than 27 minutes in each of the past two games. With that said, he has very little competition at the moment, making him a safe addition to any weekly lineup.Consider sitting: Daniel Gafford, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnthony Davis is sidelined yet again, this time with a groin injury, meaning Gafford should be able to serve as the primary center, at least for the short term. On paper, this appears to be a straightforward decision for managers, especially given Gafford's proven ability to put up numbers in limited minutes. However, Gafford has been dealing with injuries of his own, specifically an ankle injury that has already cost him multiple games. He does appear to be healthy right now, perhaps putting managers' minds at ease for the time being. If you simply need rebounds and blocks, Gafford is worth considering, especially if we get some clarity regarding Davis' absence.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The top-4 seeds in the College Football Playoff will finally get their postseason underway this week, as Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia and Texas Tech enter the fray for the quarterfinals after enjoying a bye in the first round. A year ago, the bye week was more of a curse than a blessing, as all four top seeds were bounced in the quarterfinals. That was under the old model where the byes were reserved for conference champions, but it's still a trend worth monitoring in the constant debate about rest vs. rust. The other four teams will be coming in riding the high of a first-round win. Oregon and Ole Miss cruised to wins at home, while Alabama came back from a 17-point deficit to beat Oklahoma in Norman and Miami won a defensive slugfest in College Station over Texas A&M. Each of those teams will have to make adjustments to new competition for the quarterfinals, but each will be brimming with confidence after their victories. We'll find out who will punch their tickets to the semifinals on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, but for now we can try and predict the outcomes of each quarterfinal matchup. \nCotton Bowl\nNo. 10 Miami vs. No. 2 Ohio State: It's a long-awaited rematch of the 2003 BCS National Championship Game that saw the Buckeyes claim their first national title in over 30 years over the defending champion Hurricanes. This time Ohio State enters as the reigning champs and the strong favorites, with Miami needing to conjure up its best performance of the season to topple the Buckeyes and avenge that loss from 23 years ago. The story of this game will be which offense can produce the most scoring opportunities against a pair of stingy defenses. We saw in the first round how well Miami's defense can play, as they held Texas A&M to just three points. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are a ferocious pass rushing tandem and their ability to apply pressure to Julian Sayin to keep him from attacking downfield to Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate will be critical to the Hurricanes having a chance to win. On the other side, Miami has to crack the code of an Ohio State defense that hasn't allowed more than 16 points all season -- even their lone loss was a 13-10 duel with Indiana in the Big Ten title game. The Canes were incredibly conservative with their game plan against Texas A&M, opting not to let Carson Beck put the ball in harm's way with downfield throws. They ran it well inside with Mark Fletcher, but that's a taller order against this Buckeyes defense. If they can't get it going on the ground, they're going to have to trust Beck to put it up to Malachi Toney and others. That'll bring Ohio State's defensive stars into play, with Arvell Reese rushing the passer and Caleb Downs lurking in the secondary. \nThis game really comes down to which quarterback I trust to make positive plays when provided the opportunity, and that's Sayin. It helps to have two of the nation's best receivers on the outside, but I think they'll be able to find a few explosives to get in front and then turn their defense loose on Beck and the Miami offense. PICK: Ohio State 24-13 over MiamiOrange Bowl\nNo. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Texas Tech: Another game featuring two excellent defenses that will likely come down to which offense can create the most explosive plays. The Red Raiders are firmly in the Ohio State-Indiana tier of defense, and have been particularly elite at stopping opponents from running the ball effectively. Texas Tech's front seven is phenomenal, led by Butkus winner Jacob Rodriguez but featuring multiple All-Americans, and they're going to present an incredibly stiff test for Oregon's offense. \nThe Ducks typically look to run the ball first to set up the pass, but they may have to flip the script against the Red Raiders and lean more on Dante Moore's arm to try and pull Texas Tech's linebackers away from the line of scrimmage. Moore will be as confident as he's been all year after carving up James Madison through the air, but this Texas Tech defense is a very different animal.  On the other side, Oregon has a top-10 scoring defense as well, and while they gave up 34 to JMU, 28 of those points came in the second half with the game already put to bed. Texas Tech's offense ranks highly, but against top competition they've had their ups and downs, with the defense often leading the way in their biggest wins. What they are great at, just like Oregon, is creating explosive plays. The Ducks rank No. 1 among FBS teams in 20+ yard plays, while the Red Raiders are No. 3. These offenses don't look to go on long, methodical marches, and that means this game could have a unique rhythm to it. We might see a string of three-and-outs followed by quick-strike scoring drives from both offenses. \nThe team that can create those chunk plays more often will get the win, and I trust Oregon's offense a bit more than Texas Tech's to do that, even understanding how good the Red Raiders are defensively. PICK: Oregon 26-20 over Texas TechRose Bowl\nNo. 9 Alabama vs. No. 1 Indiana: Who ever would've imagined an Alabama-Indiana playoff game with the Hoosiers as a touchdown favorite? Perhaps only Curt Cignetti, who has the Hoosiers as the lone undefeated team remaining in college football. Any questions about Indiana's pedigree have been answered this year with a win at Oregon and a Big Ten title victory over Ohio State. Now they face an Alabama team that was leaking oil coming into the playoff before finding some form offensively in Norman after falling behind by 17 in the first quarter. It took five quarters to crack the code of the Oklahoma defense, but they'll need to figure out a way to move it on Indiana's stout group much faster than that. \nIndiana finished the year second in the country in scoring defense, and for how good Oklahoma is, they present an even stiffer challenge for Ty Simpson and company. On offense, Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza can carve up a defense if they aren't locked in, and the Tide will have to avoid a sluggish start like they had in Oklahoma. I think this game could follow a similar script to the SEC title game, where Alabama just looks overmatched on offense and the defense eventually cracks. It might not be that lopsided, but Indiana has had all the answers this season defensively and Mendoza's knack for creating big plays when they need them most makes me a believer that the Hoosiers get this done and rather comfortably. PICK: Indiana 31-17 over AlabamaSugar Bowl\nNo. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Georgia: For the second straight playoff game, Ole Miss will take on an opponent they faced in the regular season. Their first-round game against Tulane looked a lot like their regular season win, but they'll be hoping for a different outcome against Georgia after a heartbreaking loss in Athens for their lone loss this year. \nThat game was a track meet, and it'll be interesting to see whether Ole Miss can find that same level of success on offense again. They carved up the Dawgs for three quarters before Georgia shut them down in the fourth to come back and get the eight-point win. Georgia might've figured something out, not just against Ole Miss but overall, because they've been a defensive juggernaut ever since. I expect Georgia to try and dictate the pace of this game to avoid another shootout because, while they won the first matchup, there's no doubt it was played largely on Ole Miss' terms. The Dawgs have figured out how to get pressure on the quarterback lately after a woeful start to the season from their pass rush, and I expect Trinidad Chambliss to be under fire from the start. Ole Miss is going to score some because that's what they do, but I don't think it'll be nearly as efficient offensively as the first meeting. Rematches are often tough for the winning team, but I think Georgia will feel like they're the side with the most to improve upon in terms of playing their game. They've found that ability to dictate the pace and terms of engagement in the second half of the season, and if that continues in New Orleans, they'll be rolling into the semis.

    "body": "\n        Five-star edge rusher DJ Jacobs will announce his college commitment live on CBS Sports HQ on Monday at 8:30 p.m. ET. You can watch the announcement live in the video at the top of this page, on the CBS Sports App or via your connected device (Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV). Jacobs, who ranks as the top prospect in the Class of 2027, will choose from a long list of suitors that includes some of the top programs in the nation. Jacobs, a product of Roswell, Georgia's Blessed Trinity Catholic High School, is one of just nine players to receive a five-star ranking at this point in the recruiting cycle. Though he has yet to release an official list of finalists, recent visits point to the programs that Jacobs is seriously considering. He's been on campus at Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State and Texas since the start of November. He also took two unofficial visits to Miami during the season, more than any of the other schools that are pursuing him. The Hurricanes have emerged as a legitimate frontrunner for Jacobs over the past few months. \nGeorgia brings obvious in-state appeal, but the Bulldogs also have a couple of key connections that can be pointed to in the final hours before Jacobs' decision. Jacobs is a double legacy at Georgia, where his father, David, played defensive line and his mother, Desiree, played basketball. Former Georgia coach Mark Richt is also DJ's godfather. Whoever lands Jacobs will be getting a defender that could make an instant impact with immense NFL potential. \n\"Cast-iron edge defender with the size, speed and strength to wreak havoc on Saturdays and then Sundays.\" 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins wrote in his evaluation of Jacobs. \"Projects as a future difference-maker for a College Football Playoff contender that can set the edge and get after the quarterback.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are through to the second round of the College Football Playoff, which means the world can no longer complain about two Group of Five teams being in the field, and wouldn't you know it, the talk around the playoff has gotten considerably quieter since.Is it possible that having Tulane and James Madison in the field generated far more discussion of the games than having Notre Dame in would have? Maybe! I would bet the lack of discussion has a lot more to do with the holidays than the teams involved, but it'd be a lot funnier if it was strictly a result of people not having anything left to be angry about.I do feel the need to point out, though, that while the G5 teams are gone, only one of this week's four quarterfinals has a spread smaller than a touchdown. Do I feel one or two of those spreads is too large? Too small? Let's break it down.Cotton Bowl\nNo. 2 Ohio State vs. No. 10 Miami: This is a trickier matchup for Ohio State than the spread seems to suggest. On the surface, I totally understand why the Buckeyes are favored by as much as they are. Yes, Miami beat Texas A&M on the road in the first round, and the winds were howling through Kyle Field, but the Hurricanes scored only 10 points. Ohio State's defense is a lot better than A&M's, which suggests Miami will have difficulty scoring.\nBut we know they won't have to deal with the wind this time, as the Cotton Bowl is indoors. Regardless, even if Miami's offense struggles again, I believe the Canes will hang around here. Ohio State is the best team in the country, but we have seen its offensive line struggle against the two best defensive fronts it saw all season: Texas and Indiana. A few weeks ago, I was extremely confident the Buckeyes would beat Michigan comfortably because the Michigan front seven wasn't quite as menacing as it had been in recent seasons. Texas and Indiana were, and Ohio State scored 24 points in two games against them.Furthermore, Julian Sayin was pressured on 30.9% of his dropbacks against Texas and Indiana, while the Ohio State offense had a negative play rate of 30.91%. Compare those numbers to the 24.1% pressure rate and 21.15% negative play rate in Ohio State's other 11 games. Miami's defensive line could legitimately be the best one Ohio State has seen, and I'm expecting it to cause a lot of problems. I don't know if the unit can win this game by itself, but I don't know that it can't, either. I have Ohio State winning, but not nearly as comfortably as the spread suggests. The Pick: Miami +9.5 (-110) at FanDuelOrange BowlNo. 4 Texas Tech vs. No. 5 Oregon: I am fascinated by this game. All season, I've harbored a suspicion that Oregon is yet to hit its peak performance, and injuries have certainly played a part in that down the stretch. At the same time, I also wonder if Oregon may not be the team we've seen all year. A very good team with holes like damn near everyone else. You can make all the excuses you want for what happened in the second half against James Madison in the last round, but the truth is, the Dukes were moving the ball before then; they simply didn't finish drives.\nOn the other side, the Oregon offense certainly won't have as easy a time in this one. If you haven't watched Texas Tech this year, the talk about its defensive line isn't hype. It's real. The front seven has been incredible, and I would argue it's the best Oregon has seen this year (they've played Indiana and Penn State, remember). I don't know how successful the Red Raiders' offense will be, as it's struggled to finish drives in the red zone all year, and Oregon's defense has been good in the red zone, but I expect that, like Miami, the Tech defense will keep this team in the game.So I don't know who wins. I can see Oregon winning by enough to cover the spread because Tech's offense can't score. I can also see Tech smothering the Ducks and winning a rock fight. In the end, no matter the result, I don't see nearly as many outcomes where the Red Raiders score 27 points. The Pick: Texas Tech Team Total Under 26.5 (-118) at FanDuelRose Bowl\nNo. 1 Indiana vs. No. 9 Alabama: What's crazier? That Alabama and Indiana are playing in the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff, or that Indiana is favored by a touchdown in the game? It's wild to think of the history of these two programs and see them in this spot, but it's a great reflection of what college football is, and can be heading into 2026.\nAs for how this game will go, the loss of Stephen Daley on defense is a big one for Indiana. He led the team in tackles for loss with 19. Indiana's front seven has been spectacular all year, but it's not so much a talent situation as it is a discipline and coaching situation. That's not to say these guys aren't athletic freaks; they are. They're just also freakishly able to never be caught out of position. At the same time, Indiana has been a juggernaut, but it doesn't have the same kind of depth the other blue blood contenders in the field have, so a loss like Daley's isn't easy to replace.And that will impact the Indiana defense overall. I also think that, based on what I saw from Oklahoma, the Indiana offense will be able to move the ball well against the Crimson Tide defense. If Oklahoma receivers did a better job catching passes, or John Mateer did a better job seeing them, the Sooners may have routed Alabama instead of blowing a 17-0 lead. Fernando Mendoza didn't win the Heisman by being a bad quarterback, and the Hoosiers have a much better rushing attack than the Sooners did, too. I'm not expecting a wild shootout here, but I'm not ruling it out, either. The Pick: Over 47.5 (-115) at DraftKingsSugar Bowl\nNo. 3 Georgia vs. No. 6 Ole Miss: The first meeting between these two was one of the most entertaining games of the year, and I hope the encore is nearly as fun. What stands out to me from that game, though, is how Georgia handled the second half. It was a common occurrence in Georgia games this season. Their opponent would jump out to a quick start and put the Dawgs in a hole, only to see Kirby Smart and company go to the locker room at halftime, get to work in the lab, fix things, then dominate the second half.\nIn this case, it was the fourth quarter. Ole Miss led 21-20 at halftime and 35-26 after three, but Georgia outscored them 17-0 in the final frame. Defensively, Ole Miss' final three possessions lasted 11 plays and totaled 13 yards. The Rebels will be much better than that in this game, but how much better?Also, Georgia had eight full possessions in the game and scored points on all eight of them. The Ole Miss defense has been a sore spot all season, and it was no different last week. Tulane may have only scored 10 points, but it racked up 421 yards of offense. I'm skeptical Ole Miss will suddenly be able to get the stops it needs to pull off the upset in the rematch, much like Tulane couldn't get against the Rebels last week.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                CBS Sports graphic\n            \n            \n    \n        Mark Few has won 22 West Coast Conference regular-season championships in his first 26 years as Gonzaga's coach. Barring a surprise, he'll add one more this season before taking his program to the new Pac-12.Certainly nothing that happened Sunday suggested otherwise, as the Zags dominated Pepperdine in a 96-56 victory that pushed them to 13-1 overall and 1-0 in league play heading into Tuesday's game at San Diego. It was Gonzaga's 50th straight win over the Waves.\"That's just a crazy stat,\" Few told The Spokesman-Review's Theo Lawson. \"I had no idea. My first years as a head coach, they were our fiercest rival.\"\nNot so much anymore. The last time Gonzaga lost to Pepperdine was Jan. 18, 2002. Zags freshman Davis Fogle was still more than four years from birth on that day. He scored 15 points in 16 minutes against the Waves on Sunday.None of this should be interpreted as a shot at Pepperdine, necessarily. Truth is, nobody in the WCC -- other than Saint Mary's, kinda -- has proven capable of challenging the Zags in any sort of meaningful way for decades. Furthermore, Gonzaga appears to be one of the small handful of programs operating outside of the traditional power structure that's been able to maintain its place in the sport while revenue-sharing and big NIL deals have largely grown the divide between the haves and have-nots. It's a testament to Few and why he'll someday be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame.\nGonzaga is No. 7 in Monday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 20th consecutive day. KenPom.com currently projects the Zags to finish 17-1 in league games in their final season in the WCC. That projection would have them winning the conference by three games and in position to perhaps secure a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for what would be a sixth time in program history.

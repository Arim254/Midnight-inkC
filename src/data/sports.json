    "body": "\nThe Indiana Hoosiers are the darlings of college football, but they won't rest on their laurels as they look to make more school history on Friday night. They'll be put to another test in the Peach Bowl when they face the Oregon Ducks in the second College Football Playoff Semifinal. The winner of the game will face the team that survives Thursday night's Miami vs. Ole Miss matchup in the Fiesta Bowl. The Hoosiers (14-0) are the top seed and come in after blasting college football blue-blood Alabama 38-3 on New Year's Day. The Ducks (13-1) have two dominant victories in the College Football Playoff, beating James Madison 51-34 in the first round and shutting out Texas Tech 23-0 on New Year's Day.       These teams have only met four times before, and Indiana has won the past two, including a 30-20 victory in Eugene back in October that set the tone for the rest of this storybook season. It was also the only loss for Oregon, and both teams beat three teams that were ranked at the time during the regular season.\nKickoff from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta is set for 7:30 p.m. ET on Friday. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, and the Over/Under for total points is 47.5. Indiana is a -184 favorite on the money line (wager $184 to win $100), while the Ducks are +154 underdogs (wager $100 to win $154). Here are our best bets for this CFP semifinal round matchup, with predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times. Oregon +3.5\nAt some point, the stage might just get too big for the Hoosiers, right? Maybe. But Oregon has been here before, losing to Ohio State in the 2014 title game and again to the eventual champion Buckeyes in the quarterfinals last season as the No. 1 seed. In Dante Moore, Oregon has a quarterback who can match up with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza of Indiana. The Ducks will come in confident after scoring 71 points in the first two playoff games. The SportsLine model has the Ducks winning in 45% of its simulations, and they are covering in 56% of the time.Under 47.5\nIndiana is averaging 41.6 points per game (third in FBS), while Oregon scores an average of 38 (ninth), but these teams can stop opponents too, with both ranked in the top six in scoring defense. Indiana is second in FBS in allowing 10.3 points per game, while Oregon ranks sixth, yielding 15.1. Oregon shut out a potent Texas Tech team in the quarterfinals, while IU gave up only a field goal to Alabama. The teams also could come out tentative on offense but should be fired up on the other side of the ball early on in such a huge game. The Under is hitting in 54% of simulations.  Oregon money line\nAs noted, the Ducks have been on this stage several times, and while these are totally different teams, the institutional expectations could matter. The Ducks have played in one CFP title game and lost in another in the BCS era. They'll be out to atone for last year's misstep as the top seed, and while the SportsLine model has Indiana winning the majority of the time, Oregon has value on the money line. The Ducks are winning in 45% of the simulations, offering value in relation to the implied odds. \n            ",

The Lakers (23-11) have won three in a row, including a 111-103 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday. San Antonio (25-11) has lost back-to-back outings, including a 106-105 defeat to Memphis on Tuesday. LeBron James (sciatica, foot) is listed as questionable, while Austin Reaves (calf) and Rui Hachimura (calf) are both out for Los Angels. San Antonio lists Victor Wembanyama (knee) as questionable, while Devin Vassell (adductor) is out. Tipoff is at 9:30 p.m. ET from Frost Bank Center in San Antonio.

The total has not been reached in each of the last three Spurs games, while the Under has also hit in each of the Lakers last two contests. Not only that for San Antonio, but it has seen the Under go 9-2 over its last 11, and one can't forget this is the second night of a back-to-back for both teams. That's played a factor in Spurs games as the Under is 4-1 in such situations this season.The Lakers haven't reached the total in each of their last five road games, and the team will be shorthanded on Wednesday with Reaves (calf) definitely out, while James may sit as well as he hasn't played a back-to-back this entire season. The teams are projected to combine for 232 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Lakers vs. Spurs, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl LX is just around the corner, and that means companies will be spending big bucks to make sure their brand is the star during breaks in the action. There have been some iconic Super Bowl commercials throughout the years, and some even started viral trends.Last year's commercials definitely had some standout performances, even if none of them were able to crack the top 20. Nike, however, did just sneak into the top 25. Will any Super Bowl 60 ads be able to top that?Since 1984, when companies really began stepping up their game for the Super Bowl, there have been some truly iconic ads from some of the most recognizable brands in the world. Apple really got things kicked off with its \"1984\" ad, which ran during Super Bowl XVIII.Since then, there have been countless commercials that stuck with people well after the game was over. Budweiser's Clydesdale horses are one example, and the E*Trade babies are another. Those are the types of commercials that keep people seated even when the action on the field stops.\nWith none of the Super Bowl 59 commercials shaking things up, here are the top 25 Super Bowl commercials of all time.25. Doritos | Pug Attack | 2011\nThis one is simple -- and maybe a little predictable -- but it's effective. Set up a bully who apparently loves seeing dogs smash into glass doors and watch him get his comeuppance. Doritos has turned in some great Super Bowl commercials over the years, but this one from Super Bowl XLV was one of their best.24. FedEx | Caveman | 2006\nFedEx may not have been the first company to feature cavemen in a major advertising campaign, but they still nailed this one. From the T-Rex devouring the Pterodactylus to the caveman getting trampled -- spoiler alert -- this Super Bowl XL ad delivers a few good chuckles in the 45-second runtime.\n23. Mountain Dew | Puppy Monkey Baby | 2016\nThis is one of the greatest ever in the category of \"What did I just watch?\" The Frankenstein creature is off-putting, but at the same time it's hard to look away. Besides, the repetitive \"Puppy Monkey Baby\" is a bit of an ear worm. Sometimes, leaning into the weirdness is the way to go.22. Nike | So Win | 2025\nNike really channeled its \"Just Do It\" roots with this one, and it works. If you put Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" over any montage of elite athletes silencing their doubters, it's probably going to be a winner. On top of that, the shots were great, and it was narrated by now Grammy-winning artist Doechii.21. The Farmer's Dog | Forever | 2023\nIt feels a little bit like cheating to use dogs as a way to score points, but we'll allow it this time. The Farmer's Dog gave us a tear-jerker during Super Bowl LVII, and it was one of the more memorable ads from that year. A heartwarming tone can be hard to nail, but it works perfectly here.\n20. Tide | Talking Stain | 2008\nFew things are more bothersome than being out in public with a glaring stain on the front of your shirt, and this Tide commercial captures that perfectly. The \"Talking Stain\" ad aired during Super Bowl XLII, and it was one of the most popular from that game. It made a pretty good case for keeping a detergent pen on hand at all times.19. Honda | Yearbooks | 2017\nSuper Bowl Sunday is a day in which every player on the field gets to live out a lifelong dream, and that is the theme of this Honda ad from Super Bowl LI is about exactly that. A handful of celebrities, in the form of their yearbook photos, talk about chasing their dreams in life. This one provides some nostalgia and humor, making for quite the Super Bowl combo.18. Hyundai | Smart Park | 2020\nHyundai looked to New England for inspiration in this Super Bowl LIV ad. They pulled together quite a bit of Boston star power in John Krasinski, Chris Evans, Rachel Dratch and Big Papi himself. The \"Smaht Pahk\" commercial provided some laughs during the commercial break, and it definitely got the message across. There were no questions about the newest feature on the Sonata after this one.\n17. PopCorners | \"Breaking Bad\" | 2023\nAaron Paul and Bryan Cranston reprised their roles as Jesse Pinkman and Walter White for this \"Breaking Bad\" commercial. The show's creator and director, Vince Gilligan, also returned to write this Super Bowl LVII ad for PopCorners, which featured a cameo appearance from Raymond Salamanca's Tuco. At least this time, Walt and Jesse were dealing with a perfectly legal product.16. Walmart | Famous Cars | 2019\nThis commercial for Walmart's pick-up service, which aired during Super Bowl LIII, has a little something for everybody. Lightning McQueen. The Batmobile. The Ecto-1. A \"Jurassic Park\" Jeep. Those and several more recognizable cars from pop culture provided a fun touch for viewers who scrambled to see how many they could identify before the commercial was over.15. NFL | NFL 100 | 2017\nThe NFL has aired some fun Super Bowl commercials recently, but the one celebrating the league's 100th season is probably the best. Some of the biggest NFL stars, past and present, got together for this Super Bowl LIV ad. It was fun to see players like Joe Montana, Prime Time and Barry Sanders interacting with the best current players while smashing up a ballroom.\n14. Budweiser | Instant Replay | 2003\nThe Clydesdales are something of a Super Bowl tradition, and this is one of the more popular ads in which they've starred. The addition of the zebra, as well as the one-liner at the end of the ad, made for a memorable moment during the Super Bowl XXXVII commercial breaks. Another notable feature of this ad is that it was directed by now famous filmmaker Zack Snyder.13. Parmount+ | Mountain of Entertainment | 2024\nParamount went out on a limb for its Super Bowl LVIII commercial, and it really paid off with the most memorable ad of the game. I'm sure there was some internal discussion about whether letting Sir Patrick Stewart fire Arnold from \"Hey Arnold\" into the side of a cliff was the best premise, but it worked. Add in an appearance from Creed and Jeff Probst jamming out on a \"Survivor\" torch and an understandably anxious Peppa Pig, and you've got a real winner here.12. FedEx | \"Cast Away\" | 2003\nWhen \"Cast Away\" was released in December 2000, it became a huge hit, and it also served as the inspiration for a FedEx Super Bowl commercial just a couple years later. The Super Bowl XXXVII commercial is a spoof on Tom Hanks' character in the movie, a FedEX employee who is stranded on an island after a plane crash. This commercial's ending did take a slightly different tone than that of the Oscar-nominated film.\n11. Volkswagen | The Force | 2011\nWhen in doubt, play the \"Star Wars\" card. That is the approach Volkswagen took in this Super Bowl XLV ad in 2011. \"The Imperial March' provides a familiar tone, and little Darth Vader was the perfect way to show the remote start feature on the new Passat. Volkswagen gets credit for sticking out among the bevy of car commercials fans see during Super Bowl Sunday.10. Reebok | Terry Tate: Office Linebacker | 2003\nTerry Tate made his debut during Super Bowl XXXVII and immediately became a viral sensation. Tate even got a series of ads in which he strictly enforces rules around the office. The actor who plays Tate, Lester Speight, did play linebacker at Morgan State and tried out for several USFL teams before taking on the popular role of Office Linebacker.9. E*Trade | Talking Babies | 2008\nLong before AI could turn celebrities into crooning babies, the E*Trade talking baby made quite the splash in Super Bowl XLII. It was so popular that it inspired a host of spin-off ads featuring even more talking babies. The spit-up at the end of the original was the perfect way to end it. E*Trade has even brought the babies back for other Super Bowl spots in recent years, but nothing will ever beat the first.\n8. Pepsi | Cindy Crawford | 1992\nThey say the best comedy is subversive, and that is the case with this Super Bowl XXVI ad featuring supermodel Cindy Crawford. Throughout the entire commercial, the focus is on Crawford -- until the rug gets pulled out from under viewers at the end when the young boys reveal they are actually focusing on the newest Pepsi can. Crawford came back for another role in a Pepsi's 2018 Super Bowl commercial.7. Coca-Cola | Mean Joe Greene | 1980\nThis commercial did debut prior to Super Bowl XIV, but we will choose to ignore that because many modern Super Bowl ads drop before the actual game now. Besides, this commercial really shot to iconic status when it aired during that Super Bowl, which Joe Greene played in and won with the Pittsburgh Steelers, defeating the Los Angeles Rams.6. Budweiser | Frogs | 1995\nBudweiser has made a habit out of creating hit Super Bowl ads over the years, and its Super Bowl XXIX commercial featuring the frogs was another example. Like the \"Whassup?\" commercial, this one takes a very simple approach, and it worked like a charm. These frogs were so successful and popular that the little amphibians hung around for several years.\n5. Wendy's | Where's the Beef? | 1984\nSuper Bowl XVIII was a big game for commercials, and one of the icons that came out of it was \"Where's the Beef?\" Prior to the existence of social media, Wendy's subtweeted its fast food rivals by calling them out for having an absurdly high bun-to-beef ratio on their burgers. This commercial also got a shoutout from Michael Scott in an episode of \"The Office\" entitled \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity.\"4. McDonald's | Jordan vs. Bird | 1993\nWho wouldn't want to watch Michael Jordan and Larry Bird go up against each other in a game of one-on-one? That makes this Super Bowl XXVII a winner right off the bat. The two NBA legends were battling on the court for a Big Mac, and neither one wanted to relent. This ad really capitalized off the buzz that Jordan and Bird helped create from the 1992 Dream Team.3. Apple | 1984 | 1984\nNormally, to see a Ridley Scott project you have to go to the movie theater. However, he was hired to direct this now famous Apple commercial that aired during Super Bowl XVIII, along with \"Where's the Beef?\" The ad really does feel like the type of sci-fi movie Scott would direct, and it even gives some \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner\" vibes. No wonder this one was so well-received.\n2. Snickers | Betty White | 2010\nThe Snickers \"You're Not You When You're Hungry\" campaign has taken several different forms in recent years, with multiple celebrities appearing in the ads. However, this Super Bowl XLIV commercial starring Betty White is probably the funniest and most famous. Seeing the late actress and comedian lay punishing hits and talk trash at a pickup football game was pretty memorable.1. Budweiser | \"Whassup?\" | 2000\nIt's not very often commercials start trends in real life, but that's what Budweiser did with its \"Whassup?\" ad during Super Bowl XXXIV. It was just a case of guys being dudes and calling one another up during the big game. The simple yet effective commercial wriggled its way into pop culture as well, and it was even referenced by Steve Carrell's Michael Scott in the pilot episode of \"The Office.\"\n            ",

The College Football Playoff pits those squads against each other in semifinal action this week when No. 6 Ole Miss clashes with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl and No. 1 Indiana battles No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl. Those Thursday and Friday contests are set to determine the two squads that will play for the CFP National Championship.From a war between two underdogs to a showdown featuring the potential top two quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft, these semifinals are destined to deliver ample theatrics. Will Miami move one step closer to returning to glory? Can Ole Miss continue the hot start to the Pete Golding era? Only one will prevail in Thursday's bout. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza then meets Dante Moore again in a compelling rematch on Friday.Both the Ducks and Hoosiers advanced to the penultimate round by way of convincing victories. Their blowout wins over No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 9 Alabama, respectively, made them appear as the top two contenders to win the championship. On the other side of the bracket, the Rebels and Hurricanes both toppled blue-blood opponents in the previous round and planted their flag as worthy title hopefuls.There is a lot of new blood left in the bracket. Oregon is the only team of the bunch to have played in the national semifinals. Indiana, like Oregon, is in search of its first national championship, while Ole Miss has yet to win a title outright and Miami is in the midst of a more than two-decade drought.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: (6) Ole Miss vs. (10) Miami -- 7:30 p.m. | ESPN | Predictions, previewState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: (1) Indiana vs. (5) Oregon -- 7:30 p.m. | ESPN | Predictions, previewMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "description": "\n        The Atlanta Hawks are trading Trae Young to the Washington Wizards, according to ESPN. The Wizards will send CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert to",
    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Hawks are trading Trae Young to the Washington Wizards, according to ESPN. The Wizards will send CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert to Atlanta in the deal. There is reportedly no draft compensation in the deal. The trade marks the end of Young's seven-plus-season tenure with the Hawks. The man who drafted him for the Hawks, Travis Schlenk, is currently the vice president of player personnel for the Wizards, so the two will now reunite in Washington and attempt to finish what they started in Atlanta.Young's tenure with the Hawks began with quite a bit of promise. In just his third NBA season, Young led the Hawks to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals, and had he not been hurt in the series, Atlanta might have gone even further. He's made four All-Star Games as a Hawk, including last season, and even earned All-NBA honors in 2022, establishing himself as Atlanta's franchise player for the better part of the past decade.But a few things have changed of late that conspired to push Young toward a trade. Atlanta's front office has turned over multiple times during Young's career, with the current group led by Onsi Saleh taking over last offseason. He was on his third permanent head coach in Atlanta as well, with Quin Snyder taking the job in 2023. That meant that many of the decision-makers that built around him early in his career were gone.\nThis season, the Hawks underperformed with Young on the floor. Meanwhile, when he sat, the Hawks shared the ball, played faster and, more importantly, played better defense than they ever had with the small, often indifferent defensively Young. This is indicative of a league-wide shift. The NBA is simply less interested in small, defensively-deficient guards that can't shoot well enough to play off of the ball than it used to, as characterized by the seemingly limited trade interest Ja Morant has drawn this season well. Such players can still have a place on competitive teams, but not at max salaries.Atlanta was staring down the barrel of a $49 million player option for Young next season that would have deprived them of significant flexibility to build around their younger cornerstones. By moving Young now, they set themselves up to either generate significant cap space in the summer or use that flexibility to trade for another veteran like Anthony Davis now.\n\n        \n            \n                Trae Young trade rumors: Why a Hawks-Wizards deal would make sense for both sides\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Wizards, with nearly limitless cap flexibility on a roster devoid of expensive veterans, had no such issues with Young's cap figure. They could afford to take a buy-low risk on Young with the idea that he could help develop their raw, younger players. As talented as many of their recent first-round picks are, having a traditional point guard on board to set them up will only make their lives easier. Now the Wizards, who have not reached the playoffs since 2021, have taken their first true steps out of the lottery and toward competing for the postseason.\n            ",

The statement did not mention Rice by name but was released after the woman -- known to be his longtime girlfriend -- accused an unnamed former partner of abuse in a social media post.\"The club is aware of the allegations on social media and is in communication with the National Football League. We have no further comment at this time,\" the team said, via the Kansas City Star.Dacoda Jones, the mother of Rice's two children, posted photos to Instagram of herself with a bloody lip, as well as scratches and bruises on her face and body. In the caption of the post, she accuses an unnamed partner of physical abuse that spanned years. She says the two broke up two months ago and alleges that her former partner abused her while she was pregnant, locked her outside in freezing weather and broke the door to her home.\n\"I'm so tired of keeping quiet I'm so tired of protecting his image. I've been through enough in the span of 8 years and I've had ENOUGH! I've dealt with abuse for years, me and this man decided to break up a couple months ago and it's been nothing but hell,\" Jones wrote.\"He literally left us in Kansas and I had to beg him to send money so that I could drive to Texas with my kids and all our stuff. We have an agreement because of everything he's put me through and he still doesn't follow it. He's now trying to remove me and my kids from our home for no apparent reason. I've known this man for YEARS. He tries to put on this persona like he's dad of the year. He does the bare minimum and I have to beg for that. I've protected his image too long and I'm done doing that. It's time to protect my peace, protect my children and stand up for myself.\"Rice, 25, was suspended for the first six games of the 2025 season for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy due to his involvement in a 2024 hit-and-run in Dallas. Rice pled guilty to two felony charges in the case -- collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury -- after he and four men left four victims injured in the crash. Rice was sentenced to 30 days of jail time and five years' probation. \nRice was a second-round pick of the Chiefs in the 2023 NFL Draft. He caught 79 passes for 938 yards and seven touchdowns as a rookie but was limited to four games in 2024 due to injury. After serving his suspension this season, he caught 53 passes for 571 yards and five touchdowns in eight games as the Chiefs finished 6-11 and missed the postseason for the first time since 2014. \n            \n    ",

The trio -- along with a fourth suspect -- are accused of stealing $200,000 in property from the Cleveland Browns quarterback during his NFL debut in Week 11.While Sanders was getting his first taste of NFL action, three suspects allegedly entered Sanders' home wearing masks and gloves shortly before 7 p.m. and made off with roughly $200,000 in property. A fourth suspect was driving the vehicle that transported the group. While three of those suspects are now in custody, one more remains at large with an active warrant out for his arrest.Sanders is far from the only high-profile NFL player who has been burglarized during a game. In 2024, the homes of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were robbed during a game. Additionally, Joe Burrow's house was broken into during a \"Monday Night Football\" game.On the day his home was robbed, Sanders replaced an injured Dillon Gabriel against the Baltimore Ravens. In his first NFL game, Sanders completed four of his 16 passing attempts for 47 yards and an interception. Sanders remained the Browns' starting quarterback for the rest of the season, completing 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\nSanders and the entire Browns organization is entering a new era this offseason after the firing of coach Kevin Stefanski, who spent six seasons with the team.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Field-goal percentage can quietly swing fantasy matchups, especially when high-usage guards start piling up inefficient nights. Whether it's the result of tougher defensive attention, expanded offensive roles, or a growing reliance on 3-point volume, several notable backcourt players are having trouble converting their looks this season. In this article, we highlight 10 guards whose shooting efficiency has dipped well below expectations, examining the trends behind their struggles and what they mean for fantasy managers. From established stars to emerging scorers, these players present important decisions on whether to stay patient, adjust expectations, or explore roster alternatives.Derrick White, CelticsWhite has shot below 43 percent just twice in his eight NBA seasons, but could be on track to do it again, as he is shooting a career-low 39.7 percent from the field. Part of the reason for the dip is the fact that he is also shooting a career-high 9.4 3-pointers per game and hitting 34 percent from deep. However, he shot 9.1 3s last season and still managed a field-goal percentage of 44.2 on the year, which, although being the lowest among his three full seasons with the Celtics, is still significantly better than his current rate. On the other hand, he is also dealing with a lot more defensive attention while having to take on a larger role in the offense with the absence of Jayson Tatum. Donte DiVincenzo, TimberwolvesDiVincenzo is working on his lowest field-goal percentage in the last four seasons and the third-lowest among his eight seasons, as he is shooting just 40.5 percent from the field. Similar to the case of many players on this list, a major reason for the dip in field-goal percentage is the fact that an increasing amount of his shot attempts are coming from long range, as he is averaging 8.1 3-point attempts among his total of 10.6 field-goal attempts per game. However, in addition to a large portion of his shots being from distance, his long-range shooting is struggling in relation to the last three seasons, where he shot better than 39 percent in each. LaMelo Ball, HornetsBall has yet to average better than 44 percent shooting from the field in a season and is currently working on a 41.1 percent average through 26 games played this campaign. On the other hand, he is showing better efficiency from deep, going from 11.2 3-point attempts with 33.9 percent accuracy last season to 8.8 3-point attempts with 37.1 percent accuracy this season. His current 3.3 made 3-pointers per game would be the third-most in his career, matching up behind the only other two seasons where he took more attempts. \nRussell Westbrook, Kings Although he recently became the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history, it has been a common criticism throughout Westbrook's career that his scoring lacks efficiency. Unfortunately, that is certainly the case this season, as his 41.6 percent shooting from the field represents the lowest mark of his career aside from his rookie season. He is shooting 5.5 3s per game, which makes this just the third time in his career that he is averaging more than five per game, but his finishing from closer range is still lagging enough to drag his overall percentage to such notable lows. Devin Vassell, SpursVassell shot 47.2 percent from the field in 2023-24, and then 44.3 percent in 2024-25. However, this year he is down to 42.2 percent shooting, which is on track for the second-lowest mark of his career. His long-range shooting is holding up, as he is hitting 37.9 percent on seven attempts per game, but he is not having the same relative success elsewhere on the court. The recent struggles could be a result of him having a tough time finding his groove in the offense, as the Spurs now have a number of other very capable creators and scorers who are taking up more of the offensive flow compared to recent seasons. Bennedict Mathurin, Pacers At the beginning of the season, it seemed that Mathurin had the path laid out for a perfect opportunity to take his game to the next level, as his squad needed someone to help fill the offensive void left in the absence of Tyrese Haliburton. However, after a dominant first couple of games, he was struck with an injury that kept him out for about three weeks. Since then, despite averaging 16.6 points per game, he has not been able to establish a great rhythm, shooting just 40.9 percent from the field over his last 22 games. Some of his struggles could be affected by the team's injury issues, but it is more likely that he is still getting used to an expanded role and more defensive attention, as his squad is looking to him as a preferred offensive option. \nImmanuel Quickley, RaptorsQuickley is shooting just 43 percent from the field, which is unimpressively on pace for his third-best mark in his six seasons. Just over half of his 13 field-goal attempts per game are 3-pointers, of which he is knocking down a decent 35.7 percent. Nonetheless, he is filling an important role by pushing the pace for a talented and sizable lineup around him, delivering a career-best 6.2 assists per game.James Harden, ClippersAs another player who takes a significant amount of shots from deep, Harden has shot above 45 percent from the field just three times in his 16 seasons. He is knocking down 43.3 percent of his shots this season, which is actually better than his previous two campaigns with the Clippers. He is also averaging more than nine 3-point attempts per game for a fifth time in his career, hitting 35.8 percent from the outside. Although he has shot larger volumes from long range in the past, at 36 years old, he is less able to augment his efficiency with as many drives to the basket and creative finishes, contributing to a lower overall shooting percentage in recent years.  Anfernee Simons, CelticsDespite shooting just 43.3 percent from the field, Simons is working on the fourth-best shooting percentage of his eight seasons. After shooting over eight 3s per game during the last three seasons, he is down to 6.5 3s per game in a significantly decreased role with his new squad. However, the reduction in responsibility has not been helpful in him finding his rhythm, as he has only reached the 20-point mark six times in 35 games, which is a significant drop back from the 38 instances in 70 outings last season. \nQuentin Grimes, 76ersGrimes is hitting just 43.5 percent from the field this season, but is also knocking down 36.5 percent of his career-high 6.6 3-point attempts per game. However, he has recorded better than 46 percent from the field twice in his previous four campaigns and has shot better than 38 percent from the field in three of those seasons. After starting during most of his time with the 76ers last season, he is back in a bench role, which could also be affecting his ability to find his comfort zone.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFor just the second time in seven years, the AFC will have a team other than the Kansas City Chiefs as its representative in NFL's championship game. The road to Super Bowl LX begins with Wild Card Weekend but will not be traveled by the Chiefs, who appeared in the \"big game\" five of the last six seasons but posted a 6-11 record this campaign and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2014.The Denver Broncos (14-3) finished as the No. 1 seed in the conference and received a first-round bye. Two AFC wild card games take place Sunday, with the third-seeded Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4) hosting the No. 6 Buffalo Bills (12-5) on CBS at 1 p.m. ET and the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Chargers (11-6) visiting the No. 2 New England Patriots (14-3) at 8 p.m. ET. Wild Card Weekend concludes Monday night as the No. 4 Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7) host the fifth-seeded Houston Texans (12-5) at 8:15 p.m. ET.Denver is the favorite to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy among the AFC teams as it is listed at +650 at DraftKings Sportsbook. However, the Broncos are only the third favorite to win the \"big game\" behind a pair of NFC West rivals, as the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks are +330 and the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams are +425.The SportsLine Inside the Lines team and its projection model have crunched the numbers and have a slightly different take. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has Denver winning the championship in 16.2% of its simulations, second only to Seattle (22.3%).The ITL team's model has identified each AFC team's most favorable paths to Santa Clara on Feb. 8. Here they are:Denver BroncosAs the No. 1 seed, Denver needs only two victories to make its first trip to the \"big game\" since 2015, when it defeated the Carolina Panthers 24-10 in Super Bowl 50 for its third championship. The Broncos will play their first playoff game - and should they win it, also their second - at home, where they went 7-1 during the regular season.The model gives Denver more than a 53% chance to defeat every other AFC team in the postseason and a better than 52% chance to beat four of the seven NFC clubs in the \"big game.\" It says the Broncos should be pulling for the Chargers to upset the Patriots on Sunday, as it feels Denver has the best chance to post a win against Jim Harbaugh's squad (65.1%) than any other team in the conference. Conversely, the model views Jacksonville (46.5%) as the AFC club most likely to knock off the Broncos, especially since the Jaguars posted a 34-20 victory at Denver in Week 16.Seattle is the obvious team the Broncos - and every other AFC club - would want to avoid in the Super Bowl should they get there, and the model's simulations have them beating the Seahawks a mere 42.5% of the time. It also doesn't like their chances against two other clubs as they defeat the defending champions Philadelphia Eagles in only 46.7% of the simulations, even though Denver won 21-17 in the City of Brotherly Love in Week 5, and the Rams just 47.2% of the time.OPPONENTBRONCOS' AVERAGE WIN %New England Patriots54.4Jacksonville Jaguars53.5Pittsburgh Steelers62.7Houston Texans57.2Buffalo Bills57.4Los Angeles Chargers65.1New England Patriots\nAfter back-to-back 4-13 seasons under two different head coaches, the Patriots made an incredible turnaround in their first year with Mike Vrabel at the helm and ended Buffalo's five-year reign in the AFC East. They only faced two of the conference's other six playoff teams during the regular season, however, and went 1-2 against them.The model says Patriots got the second-best matchup they could in the wild card round, as they defeat the Chargers in 61.5% of simulations. They'll be hoping Buffalo and Pittsburgh emerge victorious this weekend, which would set up a meeting with the Steelers in the divisional round. According to the model, New England's best matchup in the AFC is against Pittsburgh, which it defeats 62.2% of the time in the simulations.Since Seattle is the worst Super Bowl matchup for every AFC team, the Patriots - like Denver - should want to avoid the Eagles and Rams the most if they make it to Santa Clara. The model says New England defeats Philadelphia in just 47.4% of its simulations and the Rams 47.6% of the time.OPPONENTPATRIOTS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos45.6Jacksonville Jaguars50.5Pittsburgh Steelers62.2Houston Texans53.0Buffalo Bills55.7Los Angeles Chargers61.5Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe Jaguars enter the postseason with an eight-game winning streak and went 3-1 against AFC playoff teams during the regular season. During the eight-game run, Jacksonville became the lone club to defeat Denver at Empower Field in 2025.According to the model, the Jaguars have favorable matchups against every team in the conference other than the Broncos and Patriots, defeating all four in at least 51% of its simulations. The model also says the AFC South champions get past every NFC club not named the Seahawks more than 50% of the time, with Philadelphia (49.8%) giving them the most difficult battle.OPPONENTJAGUARS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos46.5New England Patriots49.5Pittsburgh Steelers65.6Houston Texans59.9Buffalo Bills51.0Los Angeles Chargers66.5Pittsburgh Steelers\nThe model is not a big supporter of the Steelers, who won four of their last five regular season games and edged the Baltimore Ravens 26-24 in a drama-filled finale to capture their first AFC North title since 2020. Pittsburgh went 1-5 against all NFL playoff teams this campaign and lost two of three versus AFC clubs, although the lone victory was recorded in New England in Week 3.The Steelers have unfavorable matchups with every team in their conference except the Chargers, whom they beat in almost 60% of the model's simulations. Surprisingly, those simulations say Pittsburgh defeats two NFC clubs more than 50% of the time, with Carolina (64.8%) being its most preferred opponent in the Super Bowl and Chicago (51%) coming in second.OPPONENTSTEELERS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos37.3New England Patriots37.8Jacksonville Jaguars34.4Houston Texans48.6Buffalo Bills48.4Los Angeles Chargers59.7Houston TexansWhile Jacksonville is red hot as it enters the postseason, the Texans are downright sizzling. Houston, which began the regular season with a three-game losing streak, won its final nine contests and finished just one game behind the Jaguars in its quest for a third consecutive AFC South title.The Texans posted wins against three of the four AFC playoff teams they faced in 2025, and the model believes two of those clubs (Bills and Chargers) provide their best matchups in the postseason. Its simulations say Houston defeats both the Chargers (67.3%) and Buffalo (63.4%) more than 63% of the time while giving the Texans a 51.4% chance to beat Pittsburgh, their actual opponent in the wild card round.Like the Jaguars, Houston has a better than 50% chance to win against every NFC playoff team other than Seattle in the \"big game,\" according to the model. It says Carolina (69.4%), Chicago (58.1%) and San Francisco (57.2%) are the clubs the Texans should hope to meet in Santa Clara should they get there.OPPONENTTEXANS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos42.8New England Patriots47.0Jacksonville Jaguars40.1Pittsburgh Steelers51.4Buffalo Bills63.4Los Angeles Chargers67.3Buffalo BillsThe Bills won five of their final six regular season contests but still were unable to overtake New England and win their sixth consecutive AFC East title. Still, with Kansas City and Baltimore failing to reach the postseason, reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen will feel immense pressure to lead Buffalo to its first Super Bowl appearance since its unprecedented four-year run from 1990-93.Only two matchups are favorable for the Bills in the AFC playoffs, as they defeat the Chargers in 67.6% of the model's simulations and the Steelers 51.6% of the time. If Buffalo manages to get over the hump and make it to Santa Clara, the model says it would have unfavorable matchups against the NFC's big three in Seattle (41.9%), Philadelphia (45.9%) and the Rams (46.6%).OPPONENTBILLS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos42.6New England Patriots44.3Jacksonville Jaguars49.0Pittsburgh Steelers51.6Houston Texans36.6Los Angeles Chargers67.6Los Angeles ChargersThe Chargers still were in the hunt for their first AFC West title since 2009, when they resided in San Diego, before ending the regular season with losses to the Texans and Broncos. They also were defeated by the Jaguars in Week 11 before going on their bye and then reeling off four consecutive victories.As expected for a No. 7 seed, the Chargers don't have a favorable matchup in the AFC playoffs as the model's simulations give them a better than 39% chance against only the Steelers. Should the club become the first seventh seed to make it to the Super Bowl, the only opponent the model sees them beating in the Panthers (61.3%).OPPONENTCHARGERS' AVERAGE WIN %Denver Broncos34.9New England Patriots38.5Jacksonville Jaguars33.5Pittsburgh Steelers40.3Houston Texans32.7Buffalo Bills32.4\n            ",

On Wednesday, we learned that Bowles will indeed be back for his fifth season, per CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones.Bowles reportedly met with the Glazer family on Tuesday, and conducted interviews with his coaching staff on Wednesday. He also told the Tampa Bay Times that there will be some changes made to his coaching staff. This season marks the first time that the Bucs missed the playoffs in the Bowles era. Tampa Bay started the 2025 campaign 6-2 and looked like it had an MVP frontrunner in quarterback Baker Mayfield. However, after their Week 9 bye, the Bucs lost seven of their remaining nine games. That includes four straight losses from Weeks 14-17 to the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers and Miami Dolphins. \nThat four-week stretch was a tough one that ultimately decided the Bucs' season. In Week 15, Bowles' defense allowed Kirk Cousins to convert a fourth-and-14 late in the fourth quarter to set up a Falcons game-winning field goal. In Week 16, Mayfield threw an interception while attempting to lead a game-winning drive against the Panthers. Then in Week 17, the Buccaneers were upset yet again, allowing rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers to earn his first career win in the Dolphins' 20-17 victory. The Buccaneers did defeat Carolina in a Week 18 showdown last Saturday, but the Falcons' victory over the Saints on Sunday gave the three-way NFC South tiebreaker to the Panthers, who will host the Los Angeles Rams in wild-card weekend.Bowles previously signed a three-year extension that runs through 2028, and has gone 35-33 in his four seasons as coach. That includes a 1-3 record in the playoffs. Jones had reported that this losing season was unlikely to spell the end of the Bowles era in Tampa.\n\"I understand their frustrations, and I understand our own frustrations, as well,\" Bowles said on Monday. \"It's well warranted and well warranted within the building, as well.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        John Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin faced off for the 44th and final time this past Sunday night as the coaches of the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. Harbaugh, who was the second-longest-tenured coach in the NFL behind Tomlin, was fired less than 48 hours after Baltimore's 26-24 loss to Pittsburgh that eliminated the Ravens from postseason contention. Tomlin, whose own future with the Steelers has also been a hot-button topic the past few seasons, said Wednesday that Harbaugh became an example of a \"sport culture\" that lacks \"patience.\" Harbaugh won a Super Bowl and guided the Ravens to the playoffs in six of the last eight years but was let go after coming up just short of winning a third straight division title. \"I just have so much respect for Harbs,\" Tomlin said on the Rich Eisen Show. \"Our stories will forever be interwoven in this rivalry that we've been fortunate and honored enough to be a part of. I've just got so much respect for him and how he's gone about his business, and we've certainly had some legendary battles over the years. \"You know, in terms of him being let go, unfortunately, I just think it's a component of today's sport culture. There have been many examples of that, and so it's unfortunate, but I'm sure that he is going to move on. And if he chooses to coach again ... I'm sure he'll be very successful at doing so. But more than anything, I just think it's a larger example of today's sport culture in terms of not a lot of patience and the entertainment component of what it is that we do. There's just not a lot of longevity.\n\"I'm sure we all would like to be Don Shula and Tom Landry, but I think those days are gone.\" \n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTomlin 'tunnel-visioned,' doesn't think about own futureTomlin, in his 19th season with the Steelers, is the NFL's longest-tenured head coach. With Harbaugh out in Baltimore, Andy Reid is now the second-longest tenured coach as he just concluded his 13th season with the Kansas City Chiefs. No other coach has been with their team prior to the start of the 2017 season. \"I'm miles away from Tom Landry and Don Shula,\" Tomlin said with a laugh. Tomlin, whose Steelers will host the Houston Texans next Monday night in the AFC wild card, round has two years remaining on his contract after this season. He said that while he appreciates the \"stability and steadiness\" of the Steelers' ownership, he doesn't spend much time thinking about his contract status.\n\"I'm tunnel-visioned,\" Tomlin said. \"As a leader, I'm called upon to serve these guys. NFL playing careers are very short, and so I certainly can't seek comfort in the longevity of my career. I work with guys who have very short careers, and I just tend to try to always mirror that urgency. I think it's disrespectful not to have that level of urgency when I lead them. ... Very rarely do I delve into big picture perspectives or appreciate the longevity component of what I've been able to do. There's just so many things that are waiting for me today, this week, that demand my attention.\"Can Steelers make a playoff run?Tomlin has the record for the most consecutive seasons without a losing season to start a coaching career, which reached 19 this year. He recently tied Steelers Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll with 193 regular season wins and is two seasons away from tying Landry's record for the most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history. Playoff wins have eluded Tomlin's teams in recent years, though. The Steelers haven't won a playoff game since the 2016 AFC divisional round. After winning five of his first six playoff games, including a Super Bowl in just his second season, Tomlin's teams are just 3-10 in the postseason since.  \nPittsburgh's lack of recent playoff success has led to criticism of Tomlin and some clamoring for Steelers president Art Rooney II to consider going in a different direction. The noise level grew this season when the Steelers lost five games over a seven-game stretch that left them at 6-6. The Steelers, as they often have under Tomlin, responded with a winning streak that culminated with last Sunday night's win over the Ravens that clinched Pittsburgh's eighth division title under Tomlin. \"I just realize it's a component of what I do and what we do, and you better learn to live with it, or at least endure it,\" Tomlin said of the outside noise. \"You know, there's more US senators than NFL head coaches. I have a respect and appreciation for that, and an understanding of maybe some of the things that come with that.\"As he approaches 20 years on the job, Tomlin is just as energized for the job as he was when he accepted the position on Jan. 22, 2007. \n\"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami and Ole Miss are chasing history in the College Football Playoff. Ole Miss has already broken the school record with 13 wins, and is closer than ever before to winning the school's first solo national title. Miami has bucked expectations, sneaking into the playoff and navigating the most difficult postseason path to reach the semifinals.It's the ACC vs. SEC, a high-flying offense against a big-time defense. It's The U against The New. No matter who wins, the victor will land in the national championship as an unlikely participant. Simply put, No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss doesn't get much better in terms of stakes and storylines. The Rebels could win a national title without Lane Kiffin, who bolted town for rival LSU -- and grabbed a few Ole Miss assistants -- before the playoff. Miami can cap its long-gestating return to glory under alum Mario Cristobal, who left Oregon three years ago to lift his alma mater back on the national stage.Neither team is short on superstars. Quarterback Carson Beck is the most accurate passer remaining in the playoffs. Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss went from a Division II national champion to a backup on the Rebels' bench to perhaps the most electric player in the postseason. Georgia couldn't keep up with him in the quarterfinals as he led the Rebels to a thrilling, 39-34 comeback victory. \nMiami's defense has been a brick wall, allowing only 17 total points in wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State in the CFP. They sacked mobile quarterback Marcel Reed seven times on the road. Julian Sayin, the nation's most accurate passer, couldn't pick up first downs.The Fiesta Bowl pits two of the most fascinating stories in the CFP.Miami vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Fiesta BowlTrench warfare: Miami's postseason run has been highlighted by the incredible pass rush provided by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped lead the nation's best sack-producing defense. The Hurricanes have 12 sacks in two playoff games and have recorded at least four sacks in four straight games, pushing their total to 46 for the season. Their pressure rate is also an elite 40.5%. Ole Miss only allows 1.3 sacks per game, ranking in the top 20 nationally, and actually ranks behind Ohio State, which gave up six sacks to Miami. Still, the difference for the Rebels is quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, whose mobility kept Georgia out of reach. The Bulldogs had zero sacks and only three tackles for loss in the quarterfinals. Ole Miss is sacked on only 3.1% of pass plays, ranking seventh nationally. Championship pedigrees: Ole Miss has never won a solo national title, and Miami is chasing its first since 2001, but championship-worthy quarterbacks lead both teams in their pursuit of history. Chambliss led Ferris State to a Division II national title last season before transferring to Ole Miss. Carson Beck is 36-5 in his career, including a 15-3 record against ranked opponents. He's the first quarterback to win that many games over three years since 2012-14 (Marcus Mariota). Beck has completed 74.4% of his passes, but in the last two games, he's thrown for fewer than 150 yards for the first time in his career as a starter. Chambliss has thrown for 300-plus yards in eight games this season, including a career high in the win last week against Georgia.\nWhich elite running back steps up?: Get ready for a run-off in Arizona. Miami's Mark Fletcher Jr. has been a bull in the playoffs, especially late in games, rushing for 262 yards in the postseason to rank fourth all-time in CFP history. Ole Miss' Kewan Lacy is a scoring machine, recording rushing touchdowns in the last eight games while picking up an incredible 877 yards over that span. Lacy's 23 rushing touchdowns rank third in SEC history, behind two Alabama running backs who won national titles in their respective seasons.Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Miami vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\nIf Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Cubs in 2025 made the playoffs for the first time in a while and advanced a round, but coming in second place in the NL Central to the Milwaukee Brewers and then losing the NLDS to that same Brewers team should be filed under \"not good enough.\" In light of that, this is a big offseason for club president Jed Hoyer. On Wednesday, the Cubs finally struck a big blow, landing potential frontline starter Edward Cabrera from the Marlins.That's a good move. It could even be a big move. Is it good enough? Let's examine where things stand with the North Siders.\n        \n            \n                Edward Cabrera trade: Cubs acquire Marlins frontline starter for top outfield prospect\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe rotationThis should be set. There are three potential frontline starters in Cabrera, Matthew Boyd and Cade Horton. Cabrera has ace-caliber stuff at times and finally made a career-high 26 starts last season in 137 ⅔ innings, striking out 150. Boyd ran out of gas late last season -- his first full season since returning from Tommy John surgery -- but had a 2.34 ERA through his first 22 starts. Horton was 11-4 with a 2.67 ERA in 118 innings as a rookie.\nThis isn't a stable of 200-inning guys, at least not yet, so the Cubs need depth. They've got it. Shota Imanaga returns and he's flashed frontline upside at times. Veteran righty Jameson Taillon is back as well. Colin Rea can serve as a swingman but made 27 starts last season and is a fine sixth starter. Past those six, there's Justin Steele, who will return from Tommy John surgery at some point. Remember, he had a 3.10 ERA in 78 starts from 2022-24. Javier Assad is also a swingman type like Rea. That's eight options for starting pitchers down the stretch and, if everything breaks right, four frontline starters for a playoff rotation in Horton, Cabrera, Steele and Boyd with Imanaga as a fallback.My expectation is the Cubs are done looking for starting pitching now after the Cabrera acquisition. This is a good stable with the upside being one of the most productive rotations in baseball. \nWhat's next? The Cubs had a robust offense in the first three months last season before it sputtered down the stretch. What made the Cubs great in the first half was the emergence of Pete Crow-Armstrong as a big-time power hitter, Kyle Tucker doing Kyle Tucker things and Seiya Suzuki posting the best several months of his life. In the second half, PCA struggled, Tucker dealt with injuries and the worst slump of his career and the streaky Suzuki reverted to the bad part of the streakiness. As the 2026 roster stands today, the Cubs have a good number of quality hitters -- to varying degrees -- who aren't superstar-caliber bats like Michael Busch, Dansby Swanson, Ian Happ and Nico Hoerner along with supporting cast types like Carson Kelly/Miguel Amaya (the catchers) and Matt Shaw. The front office is relying on Shaw taking a big leap forward, Moisés Ballesteros becoming a monster DH and Suzuki and PCA hitting all year like they did in the first half. Still, there are plenty of questions in there from a team looking to win the division and make a deep playoff run. \nAnother middle-of-the-order bat would sure make things look more promising. The Cubs have been attached in rumors to free agent infielders Bo Bichette and Alex Bregman. Tucker remains a free agent, as does former Cubs outfielder Cody Bellinger. How might things fit?The infieldBusch is firmly entrenched at first, as is Swanson at short. Hoerner, at second, was one of the best \"glue guys\" in baseball last year, but trade rumors are circulating because he's only signed through 2026. Shaw was good in the second half and could come back at third. This is to say that the Cubs aren't desperately in need of filling an infield hole. Grabbing someone from outside the organization would be an effort to upgrade the team. The weak link there right now is clearly Shaw and that's where Bregman comes in. Shaw could then be traded or become a utility backup (he could play third to rest Bregman, play second to rest Hoerner or Swanson -- with Hoerner playing shortstop when Swanson sits, etc.). \nBichette's fit is slightly trickier. He played second base for the Blue Jays at the end of the season; would he do the same for the Cubs, leaving Shaw at third (and Hoerner either on the bench or traded)? What about third base to replace Shaw?Regardless, either Bregman or Bichette would be a big get for the offense, especially if they did so while holding onto Hoerner. The outfieldFor ease, we'll include the DH role here too. Remember, last season with Tucker in the fold, the Cubs set up with Happ in left field, PCA in center and Tucker in right while Suzuki was the primary DH. If the Cubs don't bring in another outfielder, it looks like Happ-PCA-Suzuki is the outfield set up with Ballesteros taking over as the primary DH. \nIf the Cubs fail to bring in an infielder like Bregman or Bichette, perhaps they turn their attention to the outfield, especially with Owen Caissie now gone as part of the Cabrera trade. Tucker would make sense, but the Cubs' front office -- whether it's Hoyer or ownership -- seems content to operate as a middle-market team. This is to say, Tucker's demands on the free agent market appear too rich for the Cubs' blood. This could leave an opening for a Bellinger reunion. He was great in 2023 and pretty good in 2024 before the Cubs traded him to make room for Tucker. He's coming off his best year since his 2019 MVP season. \nWould the Cubs bring Bellinger back to beef up their lineup? I think this only becomes a discussion if they miss out on both Bregman and Bichette. If you look at a potential lineup right now, though, it sure seems like they could use another big bopper in the middle: 1. Michael Busch, 1B2. Nico Hoerner, 2B3. Ian Happ, LF4. Seiya Suzuki, RF5. Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF6. Dansby Swanson, SS7. Moisés Ballesteros, DH8. Carson Kelly, C9. Matt Shaw, 3B\nIt's pretty good. It just seems like, come the middle of October, we'd be saying once again that it wasn't good enough. \n            ",

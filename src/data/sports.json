For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                    What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                    To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                    If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                Ready to get off on the right foot? Here's how to approach every play for this week in PPR leagues, and you can find our Non-PPR cheat sheet. \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nJetsRTG (MAX 10)PatriotsRTG (MAX 10)Justin Fields2.6Drake Maye8.2Breece Hall6.45TreVeyon Henderson7.0Isaiah Davis2.75Stefon Diggs6.3Mason Taylor2.85Mack Hollins4.42Jets DST 2.4Kyle Williams3.42\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Demario Douglas2.92\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Hunter Henry4.25\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Patriots DST 9.4\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nCommandersRTG (MAX 10)DolphinsRTG (MAX 10)Marcus Mariota5.9Tua Tagovailoa6.4Chris Rodriguez Jr.3.65De'Von Achane9.7Jacory Croskey-Merritt3.05Jaylen Waddle8.0Jeremy McNichols2.7Malik Washington3.55Deebo Samuel5.3Greg Dulcich2.9Zach Ertz4.8Dolphins DST 5.6Commanders DST 3.9\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nPanthersRTG (MAX 10)FalconsRTG (MAX 10)Bryce Young2.2Michael Penix Jr.3.6Rico Dowdle7.65Bijan Robinson8.6Tetairoa McMillan6.02Tyler Allgeier4.85Panthers DST 3.0Drake London8.4\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Kyle Pitts4.98\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Falcons DST 7.2\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nBuccaneersRTG (MAX 10)BillsRTG (MAX 10)Baker Mayfield6.7Josh Allen8.9Rachaad White6.08James Cook9.1Sean Tucker4.32Khalil Shakir6.5Emeka Egbuka8.7Keon Coleman3.68Tez Johnson6.05Dawson Knox3.85Sterling Shepard3.18Bills DST 3.7Cade Otton6.25\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t Buccaneers DST 3.3\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nChargersRTG (MAX 10)JaguarsRTG (MAX 10)Justin Herbert7.3Trevor Lawrence3.9Kimani Vidal7.2Travis Etienne6.9Ladd McConkey8.25Parker Washington6.48Quentin Johnston6.75Jakobi Meyers4.38Keenan Allen5.15Hunter Long1.9Oronde Gadsden II6.66Jaguars DST 2.9Chargers DST 8.2\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nBearsRTG (MAX 10)VikingsRTG (MAX 10)Caleb Williams7.1J.J.

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.              We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.               We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to sit Noah Fant). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

Their test at New England will be much tougher than what they dealt with at home against the Browns. Drake Maye was sacked once by a better Buccaneers defensive front last week and figures to have enough time to pick apart the Jets secondary much more effectively than Dillon Gabriel did on Sunday. That's particularly good news for Stefon Diggs, who leads the Patriots with a huge 30.6% target per route run rate and is second among receivers with 9.1 yards per target when Maye isn't pressured. He should skewer matchups against backup defensive backs Jarvis Brownlee, Isaiah Oliver and Qwan'tez Stiggers, all of whom figure to replace Thomas. Hunter Henry also is north of 20% in the target per route run department against no pressure defense and is due for a decent stat line.  The Jets run defense held Quinshon Judkins to 3.4 yards per run over 22 carries on Sunday. Part of that was because the Jets played about half of their defensive snaps in single-high safety coverage to stop the run and dare Dillon Gabriel to throw. I would be surprised if they did that as much this week against a quarterback like Drake Maye. That should lend optimism for TreVeyon Henderson after his breakout Week 10, but what will really stir up excitement is if he's not sharing with Rhamondre Stevenson again. That would give him plenty of touches and chances for good efficiency. Running backs tied to inferior quarterbacks (or at least quarterbacks who had tough games against the Jets) did not have good efficiency against the Jets. That shouldn't be a problem this week for Henderson with Maye.  STARTS: Drake Maye, Breece Hall, TreVeyon Henderson (No. 2 RB), Patriots DST FLEX: Stefon Diggs (high-end flex) SITS: Justin Fields, Hunter Henry (bye-week TE), Mack Hollins (desperation WR), Kyle Williams (stash), D'Ernest Johnson, all Jets WRs and TEs, Jets DST \n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe Commanders have allowed at least 28 points in four straight games (44 points twice) and will play the Dolphins in Spain with a depleted secondary and arguably their best remaining pass rusher suspended. Washington has zero sacks in its past two games and four total in the almost four games they've played since Dorance Armstrong's season-ending injury. That's on top of already having a slow-moving linebacker group that has underperformed for much of the year. It's a perfect scenario for the Dolphins' fast-paced offense to rack up numbers and even give Tua Tagovailoa a shot at being the fifth consecutive quarterback to get 29-plus Fantasy points against the Commanders ... or at least the ninth to notch 22 Fantasy points in 10 games.  In the Dolphins past four games excluding garbage time they have held opposing running backs to 3.7 yards per rush and three total rushing touchdowns (none in their past three games) with a stunningly good 70.8% defensive success rate. Judkins, on the strength of three touchdowns in a bad-weather game, is the only runner to get more than 13.1 PPR points on the Dolphins, a list that includes Derrick Henry (over 120 yards), Bijan Robinson (48 total yards) and James Cook (77 total yards). Last week especially the Dolphins linebackers did a mostly good job containing James Cook on his 18 touches. Chris Rodriguez figures to be the lead running back for the Commanders this week but he'll split with Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols to some degree. He'd be the most likely guy to score but none carry much upside.  I fully expect Washington to take to the air, be it because they're trailing or because the Dolphins secondary isn't very good and it makes sense to attack it. Doesn't mean Marcus Mariota will thrive: The Dolphins play a lot of zone and lately have been generating good pass rush pressure, even last week without Jaelan Phillips against the Bills (they sacked Josh Allen three times!). This is about as bad as a matchup would be for Mariota, who has been much more effective against man-to-man coverage and has especially delivered poor numbers when pressured versus zone (47.4% completion rate, 78.9% catchable pass rate, 5.3% TD rate is good but not in comparison to when he sees man-to-man). A positive: Mariota averages 7.4 yards per carry against zone coverage and has been known to take off running when pressured. At least that boosts his floor.  \nMUST-STARTS: De'Von Achane STARTS: Jaylen Waddle  FLEX: Deebo Samuel (low-end PPR flex) SITS: Tua Tagovailoa (high-end No. 2 QB), Marcus Mariota (high-end No. 2 QB), Chris Rodriguez (desperation RB), Zach Ertz (high-end No. 2 TE), Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Jeremy McNichols, Ollie Gordon, Greg Dulcich, Malik Washington, Dolphins DST (borderline DST), Commanders DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nI would expect a typical Panthers offensive approach this week: Lots of running and as many quick throws as possible from Bryce Young. That's because the Falcons have become the blitz-heaviest defense in the league, cutting down both Drake Maye and Daniel Jones in consecutive weeks when they've held the ball too long. When pressured, Young's accuracy sinks like a stone but he does have a higher TD rate, a lower INT rate and a higher-but-still-rough QB rating in comparison to when he's not pressured. Tetairoa McMillan has just two games this year over 13.5 PPR points with Young throwing to him; one came when Young threw 55 times, the other was a two-score game against the Cowboys. Given the matchup, McMillan is a risky bet in any format but especially in half- and non-PPR leagues.  MUST-STARTS: Bijan Robinson, Drake London STARTS: Rico Dowdle, Falcons DST (start next week too) FLEX: Tyler Allgeier (non-PPR), Tetairoa McMillan (PPR flex) SITS: Michael Penix Jr., Bryce Young, Kyle Pitts (borderline No. 1/2 TE), Jalen Coker, Darnell Mooney, Ja'Tavion Sanders, Panthers DST \n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nTough spot for Baker Mayfield -- eight straight QBs have failed to get even 17 Fantasy points on the Bills defense. That list doesn't include many stud passers but Patrick Mahomes and Drake Maye are on that list and neither had even 13 Fantasy points. Buffalo averages the second-most pass rush pressure in the league and typically does so without blitzing. Their secondary has mostly been good as a result of that pressure. There's a reasonable chance the Bills get pass rusher A.J. Epenesa, linebacker Shaq Thompson and cornerbacks Christian Benford and Taron Johnson back after they missed last week. All of them make the entire matchup tougher on the Buccaneers. Mayfield's been nails pretty much all season but this game feels like one we'll be lucky if he makes it out with more than 24 Fantasy points, especially if the Bills pull a throwback and play heavy zone coverage. Downgrading expectations is probably a good idea.   MUST STARTS: Josh Allen, James Cook, Emeka Egbuka STARTS: Baker Mayfield (borderline No. 1/2 QB), Cade Otton, Rachaad White (low-end No. 2 RB) FLEX: Tez Johnson, Khalil Shakir SITS: Sean Tucker (stash), Dawson Knox (desperation TE), Keon Coleman, Sterling Shepard, Ty Johnson, Ray Davis, Bills DST, Buccaneers DST \n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nI don't know if it was in response to the Chargers offensive line issues or the matchup against the Steelers pass rush, or both, but Quentin Johnston took on a much larger role catching short-area targets like hitches, screens and slants. As a result, Johnston had a season-low 3.4-yard average depth of target but a second-best 10 targets in a game ... and another week with disappointing numbers for Keenan Allen. We've already seen Allen's route rate decline over the last month, a trend we should expect to continue. But if Johnston's adding more easy targets to his game while still being looked for deep, then the days will come where he'll put up huge Fantasy numbers. This would be such a week: The Jaguars gave up over 15 PPR points to both Nico Collins and Jayden Higgins last week with Davis Mills starting at QB for the Texans. If you include Brock Bowers, the Jaguars have given up at least 20 PPR points to someone through the air in each of their last four games. That might speak to a better game for Ladd McConkey, but it drives the point home that basically anyone getting good target volume against the Jaguars is a cinch for good statistics.

McCarthy was more than passable as an NFL quarterback. One week ago, he started fine but began pressing and rushing and ultimately unraveled despite multiple dropbacks where he wasn't immediately pressured. This week will be telling: The Bears are fifth-worst in generating pass rush pressure rate but accumulate sacks when opposing quarterbacks hold the ball too long, which McCarthy has been known to do. McCarthy has also struggled against man-to-man coverage this season and the Bears tend to play coverages based on their opponents weaknesses. It would make all the sense in the world for the Vikings to stick with a simple pass game approach without going up-tempo and not throwing deep too often, a plan that works even better if center Ryan Kelly plays and brings the O-line back to full strength. That could mean modest target volume for both Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, the latter of which has yet to score even 10 PPR points in either of two games with McCarthy this season (Jefferson has one over 15 PPR points). It wouldn't be wrong to downgrade expectations for the Vikings receivers a little.   MUST STARTS: Justin Jefferson (high-end No. 2 WR) STARTS: Caleb Williams, D'Andre Swift, Rome Odunze (high-end No. 2 WR), Bears DST FLEX: Jordan Addison, D.J.

Last year he was second among qualifying quarterbacks in average depth of throw (8.9 yards) and attempts of 10-plus air yards (39.5%) while also throwing the fewest passes at or behind the line of scrimmage. Winston lives and dies by his gunslinging mentality, which often means defenses bring out a lot of zone coverage against him. That plays right into the Packers' strengths this week as they can play a lot of zone coverage and use just four defenders to pressure Winston into some potential mistakes. And the reality is that without any quality downfield threats, Winston could end up turning the ball over a bunch and capsize any chances the Giants have of keeping this game close. And after Monday night, the Packers would love a game where they can take some downfield shots themselves while still keeping balanced offensively.   MUST-STARTS: Josh Jacobs STARTS: Packers DST  FLEX: Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Darius Slayton, Wan'Dale Robinson (PPR) SITS: Jordan Love, Jameis Winston, Theo Johnson (No. 2 PPR TE), Devin Singletary (desperation RB), Tyrone Tracy Jr., Luke Musgrave, Matthew Golden, Emanuel Wilson, Giants DST \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIf the Steelers are truly focused on improving their offense after last week's debacle, then expect them to come off the bus running against the Bengals. In Cincy's past four games, they've opened the floodgates to the tune of 6.8 yards per carry, five rushing touchdowns and a gaudy 13.4% explosive rush rate allowed. In Week 7 at Cincy, Jaylen Warren turned 20 touches into 19.8 PPR points without scoring a touchdown (he did have one called back). Aaron Rodgers had a bad game last week and probably would love more than to rectify that, but he can do that on limited pass attempts while not feeling any pressure from the Bengals whatsoever. Remember, he had 30.6 Fantasy points at Cincinnati but had to attempt a high-for-him 34 passes in a shootout loss. Scaling that back while controlling the clock via running the ball is probably something the Steelers would love and could probably pull off.   \nMUST-STARTS: Ja'Marr Chase STARTS: Joe Flacco, Aaron Rodgers (low-end No. 1 QB), Jaylen Warren, Chase Brown, Tee Higgins FLEX: DK Metcalf SITS: Pat Freiermuth (high-end No. 2 TE), Calvin Austin III and Roman Wilson (desperation WRs), Noah Fant, Samaje Perine, Kenneth Gainwell, Jonnu Smith, Steelers DST (tough matchups until maybe Week 15), Bengals DST \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nWoody Marks played his first game with over 61% of the snaps last week and crushed it. Okay, fine, he had as many mediocre pass pro reps as he had good ones, and there were a couple of runs where Marks could have picked a different lane to run through, but he otherwise displayed the kind of speed, cuts and versatility to become the Texans' best three-down back since Joe Mixon. There's no way the Texans could justify going back to a four-way split with Marks, Nick Chubb, Dare Ogunbowale and British Brooks. Expect Marks to get another heavy workload for however long the game between them and the Titans is competitive. In their past four games excluding garbage time the Titans gave up 4.8 yards per rush and four rushing touchdowns. That's the kind of matchup Marks could take advantage of. \nMUST STARTS: Nico Collins STARTS: Woody Marks, Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (but not next week) SITS: Davis Mills, Nick Chubb, Christian Kirk, Xavier Hutchinson, ALL TITANS \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe Cardinals chances took a major blow when coach Jonathan Gannon announced this week than receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. and linebacker Mack Wilson would miss the game and that edge Baron Browning was in concussion protocol. That's on top of right tackle Jonah Williams leaving last week's game early, cornerback Will Johnson missing last week's game entirely and both missing practice early in the week. Fantasy managers should be most concerned about Harrison's absence -- without him, Jacoby Brissett will be without the guy who caught 15% of his completions, 20% of his yards and 25% of his touchdowns since Week 6. Harrison's backup, Zay Jones, is out for the year with a torn Achilles. We'll probably see more two-TE sets from Arizona with Elijah Higgins working as a receiver along with Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch. Unquestionably it's a downgrade for Jacoby Brissett, but Harrison's absence coupled with potentially a weaker offensive line and a defense that might not stop the 49ers much could force the game script into a high-volume game for Brissett. It's simply a matter of other Cardinals players beyond McBride stepping up. Brissett isn't a top-12 option this week but still fares as a bye-week replacement or streamer; McBride is the only Cardinals pass-catcher worth a lineup spot.

That's not anything to freak out about, but their lack of pass rush pressure is -- they haven't been as dominant getting to the quarterback as they were earlier this year (just seven sacks in their past four games) and it might be enough to free up Bo Nix from playing a lot of dink-and-dunk football. One huge key for Denver is not allowing as much pass rush pressure as it did in Week 10 -- hopefully Quinn Meinerz doesn't miss any time and Mike McGlinchey gets on his A-game. That's the key to Nix's game as he's been horrid when pressured, much better when not. I'd give the Broncos the benefit of the doubt this week, making him a borderline start. Troy Franklin is the Broncos new No. 1 receiver. He has out-targeted Courtland Sutton by 11 passes over the past four games and has 15.8 PPR points per game compared to Sutton's 10.7. Franklin has four touchdowns in his past four games (three inside the 10-yard line) while Sutton has four touchdowns all year. Franklin is used more across the formation and gets both layup and longball targets; Sutton is more stationary and tends to work a little further downfield. And there's no comparison when it comes to speed or quickness -- the only advantage Sutton has is that he's bigger and rangy by comparison to Franklin. Sutton does have four scores in his past five against the Chiefs, but it feels like his role has changed and he may specifically need a touchdown in order to deliver a good stat line. Only three receivers have had 15-plus PPR points on the Chiefs this year, and it's been speedy wideouts who have hit Kansas City the hardest. That profiles much more to Franklin than Sutton, though both are at least No. 3 options.   The Broncos pass rush is on pace to break the NFL's single-season sack record by 10 sacks! That's going to be Patrick Mahomes' biggest issue this week, especially one game after he struggled against the Bills' pass rush pressure. And Denver went with a lot of blitzing and a lot of man-to-man coverage in their one game against Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City last year and they held him to a 266-1-0 stat line with 19 rush yards, sacking him four times. I would expect a similar attack from the Broncos, which could mean trouble for Mahomes. If he deals with that by getting the ball out quickly then Rashee Rice is going to have a ton of targets -- since he's been back he has a 43.2% target per route run rate when Mahomes has thrown under 2.5 seconds from the snap (Xavier Worthy is next highest at 27% in Rice's three games, not Travis Kelce). But Mahomes also has a tendency to throw deep when pressured, and if he does that then the guy he'll look for is ... Rashee Rice based on the 36.4% target per route run rate he has on 20-plus air yard targets over the past three weeks; Marquise Brown is second (27.3%) and Worthy third (18.8%). You already knew to start Rice, and you're starting Mahomes, but you should lower expectations for him. You should also lower expectations for everyone else besides Rice in the Chiefs offense since there's a lot of uncertainty based on how Mahomes will react to what the Broncos throw at him.

In those cases, they're fine with short underneath throws their defenders can rally to and tackle. Harold Fannin and David Njoku could easily do a bunch of that but both are more than short check-down options. The issue is that the Browns are pretty much resigned to quick throws from Dillon Gabriel due to a combination of his limited skill-set and their offensive line. Just 5.6% of his last 85 pass attempts have gone 20-plus air yards downfield. This should suit Fantasy managers chasing both tight ends in PPR leagues just fine, especially since Gabriel figures to throw a lot. In four games when Gabriel has thrown 30-plus passes, Fanning has seen seven-plus targets and 10-plus PPR points three times, while Njoku has seen five-plus targets and a touchdown three times. Fannin's the better bet, but both are in play, especially against a Ravens defense that has an emboldened secondary but no fiery pass rush.  MUST-STARTS: Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry (No. 2 RB) STARTS: Quinshon Judkins, Zay Flowers, Harold Fannin Jr., David Njoku, Ravens DST SITS: Dillon Gabriel, Mark Andrews (borderline No. 1/2 TE), Jerry Jeudy, Cedric Tillman, Isaiah Likely, DeAndre Hopkins, Keaton Mitchell, Justice Hill, Dylan Sampson, Jerome Ford, Browns DST \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThis won't be a game where Seattle can rest on its run game and defense -- Sam Darnold is going to have to end up throwing a lot. In the past that's meant mixed results but this season, and this week, it should be a positive. Los Angeles' pass rush has sort of tumbled over the past couple of weeks, not really getting the chance to get to Tyler Shough in Week 9 because he got the ball out so quickly but also not putting a lot of pressure on Mac Jones last week. They have one sack combined over those two games with a kinda-low 29.7% pass rush pressure rate. As long as Darnold doesn't hold the ball too long then he should be able to operate from a clean pocket for most of his dropbacks. That has to be key for him -- in two meetings against the Rams last year he averaged over 3.1 seconds to throw in each and was sacked 12 times and threw three total touchdowns. Darnold has beaten that average in every single game this year, and if he sticks with that against the Rams, he should fall into at least good production. He's also been a little more efficient against zone coverage than man-to-man this season, which helps since the Rams tend to play a lot of that.  MUST-STARTS: Kyren Williams, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams STARTS: Matthew Stafford, Seahawks DST (low-end No. 1 DST) FLEX: Zach Charbonnet, Kenneth Walker III SITS: Sam Darnold (high-end No. 2 QB), Rashid Shaheed, Terrance Ferguson, Tyler Higbee, Cooper Kupp, Blake Corum, Rams DST (high-end No. 2 DST) \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nJameson Williams dominated on stop/hitch routes along the sideline as well as in-breakers last week, but most impressive of all was Williams' timing with Goff on pretty much every single throw. I did find it weird that all but one of Williams' catches came with Amon-Ra St. Brown off the field. Lots of quirks, but here's what's real: The Eagles figure to stick with zone-heavy coverage and a juiced-up pass rush without blitzing much, a recipe that shut down Jordan Love for much of last week and a staple of what Vic Fangio does defensively as long as he's not trailing. With the Lions offensive line a little shakier than normal, particularly along the interior, there will be pressure on Goff. This season he's been much less effective when pressured (51.9% completion percentage, 6.7 yards per attempt, zero touchdowns, 62.9 QB rating) than not pressured (83.3% completion percentage, 8.8 yards per attempt, 20 touchdowns, 136.0 QB rating). And when he's been pressured he's looked for Sam LaPorta (21.2% target per route run rate) and Amon-Ra St. Brown (15.6% target per route run rate) the most with Jameson Williams (14.9%) and Jahmyr Gibbs (9.8%) behind them. St. Brown is especially Goff's target when he gets the ball out under 2.5 seconds (42.9% target per route run rate). What's it all mean?! It means they're not taking on the Commanders and their man-to-man, weak pass rush defense, and the results could be very different for Williams, and candidly for Goff too since pressure is not his friend. It might work out for Sam LaPorta, though.  A.J. Brown has been dominant against man-to-man coverage this year, the problem is that he and the Eagles rarely see it. But the Lions play the fourth-most man-to-man coverage and are stubborn enough to stick with it almost regardless of who they play. On the season, Brown has a 36.1% target per route run rate against man with 17.4 yards per catch and three touchdowns. That sounds like the Brown we know and love! When he and the Eagles face zone coverage, Brown gets targeted on just 17.2% of his routes with 9.7 yards per catch and zero scores. Trusting Brown isn't something we want to do, but in a potential high-scoring game, this helps provide some hope that you should, in fact, not get rid of him from our Fantasy teams.   MUST-STARTS: Jalen Hurts, Jahmyr Gibbs, Saquon Barkley, Amon-Ra St. Brown STARTS: A.J.

But the 10 PPR points in Week 9 was a step forward from what happened in Week 8 (no catches). The hunch is that Dak Prescott goes right back to him as a red-zone target (35% target per route run rate there). Ferguson's efficiency is better against zone coverage (7.7 yards per catch) than man-to-man (4.9), and the Raiders have been a zone-heavy defense over the course of the season. As long as the Cowboys get better pass protection from the tackles and guard Tyler Smith (he had a bad game against Arizona), Prescott should be able to locate all of his top targets, Ferguson included. Only three tight ends have had six-plus targets against the Raiders in 2025, two of them (Hunter Henry, Chig Okonkwo) scored 10.6 PPR points; Tyler Warren had 14.4 PPR points on four targets. It's not a tough matchup, just a rarely tested one.  Expect a much different Cowboys defense from before their bye. Not only will new additions Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson find playing time, but do-it-all linebacker Demarion Overshown could also be back on the field. Williams should especially change the fortunes for Dallas both against the run and rushing the quarterback -- he's not always a clean tackler but his size and power makes him really tough for offensive lines to deal with, especially offensive lines down at least one interior lineman like the Raiders have. Last Thursday we saw Geno Smith not only struggle with instantaneous pass rush pressure but get hurt from it. The results for him and his receiving corps weren't pretty. The same thing could happen in Week 11.  MUST-STARTS: Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Javonte Williams, Brock Bowers STARTS: Ashton Jeanty, George Pickens, Jake Ferguson, Cowboys DST (low-end DST) SITS: Geno Smith, Tre Tucker, Tyler Lockett, Raheem Mostert, Raiders DST \n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot? Here's how to approach every play for this week in Non-PPR leagues. And you can find our PPR cheat sheet. \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nJetsRTG (MAX 10)PatriotsRTG (MAX 10)Justin Fields2.6Drake Maye8.2Breece Hall6.45TreVeyon Henderson7.05Isaiah Davis2.68Stefon Diggs6.4Mason Taylor2.8Mack Hollins4.3Jets DST 2.4Kyle Williams3.32Demario Douglas2.85Hunter Henry4.25Patriots DST 9.4\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nCommandersRTG (MAX 10)DolphinsRTG (MAX 10)Marcus Mariota5.9Tua Tagovailoa6.4Chris Rodriguez Jr.3.65De'Von Achane9.5Jacory Croskey-Merritt2.95Jaylen Waddle7.88Jeremy McNichols2.62Malik Washington3.42Deebo Samuel5.11Greg Dulcich2.82Zach Ertz4.5Dolphins DST 5.6Commanders DST 3.9\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nPanthersRTG (MAX 10)FalconsRTG (MAX 10)Bryce Young2.2Michael Penix Jr.3.6Rico Dowdle7.65Bijan Robinson8.4Tetairoa McMillan5.25Tyler Allgeier5.05Panthers DST 3.0Drake London8.18Kyle Pitts5.02Falcons DST 7.2\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nBuccaneersRTG (MAX 10)BillsRTG (MAX 10)Baker Mayfield6.7Josh Allen8.9Rachaad White5.55James Cook8.9Sean Tucker4.32Khalil Shakir6.38Emeka Egbuka8.3Keon Coleman3.55Tez Johnson5.85Dawson Knox3.82Sterling Shepard2.98Bills DST 3.7Cade Otton6.1Buccaneers DST 3.3\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nChargersRTG (MAX 10)JaguarsRTG (MAX 10)Justin Herbert7.3Trevor Lawrence3.9Kimani Vidal7.2Travis Etienne6.85Ladd McConkey8.05Parker Washington6.3Quentin Johnston6.7Jakobi Meyers4.2Keenan Allen5.0Hunter Long1.9Oronde Gadsden II6.5Jaguars DST 2.9Chargers DST 8.2\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nBearsRTG (MAX 10)VikingsRTG (MAX 10)Caleb Williams7.1J.J.

    "body": "\n        It's fair to say that Week 12 of the 2025 college football season is shaping up to be one of the most important slates yet. There's a lot on the line as multiple teams jockey for spots in the 12-team College Football Playoff and, now that rankings are released weekly, we have an even better idea of how the landscape looks. With that in mind, there are several prominent programs facing make-or-break games this weekend. For instance, neither No. 9 Notre Dame nor No. 22 Pittsburgh could brunt another loss and still keep their playoff hopes intact -- especially not Notre Dame, which does not have the benefit of a conference championship at the end of the year. So it's fascinating that Notre Dame and Pittsburgh must face one another Saturday. No. 10 Texas and No. 11 Oklahoma don't play each other, but they do have to contend with ranked conference foes and, with two losses already, their respective seasons are likely on the line. It's a lot of action for one weekend of college football and the CFP Rankings will almost assuredly look entirely different next Tuesday. \nWe here at CBS Sports have been overreacting to each college football weekend for a while now. Let's try and manifest some into existence for a change ahead of the 12th week of the season. Lane Kiffin shouldn't go anywhere \nNo. 7 Ole Miss continues its push for a playoff appearance Saturday as it hosts a Florida team searching for a new coach after the midseason firing of Billy Napier. Ironically, Kiffin's name has received plenty of buzz in connection with Florida's vacancy. Kiffin has also been linked to LSU and there's been a prevailing thought -- for quite some time -- that he would jump at the chance to fill a high-level opening. This is not the year to do that. \nKiffin's Rebels should dispatch the Gators handily. In that, Kiffin should realize how good he has it at Ole Miss. He could do no wrong in Oxford. He has steadily built Ole Miss into a legitimate national competitor while teams like Florida have been mired in decades of inconsistency. Why would he leave one rebuild for another? LSU is a little more stable -- on paper, at least -- but there have been plenty of red flags cropping up in the early days of its coaching search, including interference from the state's governor and the \"will they, won't they\" nature of Verge Ausberry's promotion to athletic director. Going to either Florida or LSU would also increase the level of expectations that Kiffin faces. LSU just fired a coach who produced multiple double-digit win seasons because he was unable to win a title. Kiffin could cruise at Ole Miss with consistent nine or 10-win campaigns. \nIt just seems like an unnecessary risk when he already has it made with the Rebels. Pittsburgh is championship quality \nPittsburgh has flown under the radar all season even though it has landed inside the top 25 of each of the first two College Football Playoff rankings. The Panthers have quietly won five games in a row to emerge as a real contender for the ACC Championship Game and beyond. Saturday will serve as their coming out party. It's an ideal chance to make some noise, as they welcome No. 9 Notre Dame to Acrisure Stadium in a colossal matchup between two programs that really need the win. \nThe nation will recognize Pitt's legitimacy after it takes down the Fighting Irish. This will be Notre Dame's second road test since the start of October. The only other away game the Irish played in that span was at one-win Boston College. Outside of that, Notre Dame has lost its only road contest against a ranked opponent, though that came all the way back on Aug. 31 at Miami. Pittsburgh will be able to limit Notre Dame's explosive rushing attack with a defense that is tops in the ACC against the run. If the Panthers can put the onus on Notre Dame quarterback CJ Carr -- especially in what should be a hostile environment -- they can pull out the stunner. \nThe CFP's Group of Six team will come from outside the American\nConventional wisdom this season has regarded the eventual winner of the American Conference as the Group of Six's most likely College Football Playoff representative. After all, the American is filled to the brim with seven and eight-win teams, some of which -- like South Florida -- have marquee wins over Power Four programs on their résumés. Memphis was the highest-ranked (outside the top 25) Group of Six program in the initial College Football Playoff rankings and South Florida followed suit on Nov. 11. Navy, Tulane and North Texas are all still in the hunt, as well. The problem with the American is that it continues to cannibalize itself. Navy lost to North Texas. North Texas lost to South Florida. South Florida lost to Memphis. Memphis -- somehow -- lost to UAB and dropped a pivotal game against Tulane. Tulane suffered a bad setback against UTSA. \nIt's a mess, and it's going to get messier Saturday when South Florida drops its road game to Navy. That will allow a program outside of the American Conference, like James Madison, to enter pole position. James Madison remains unblemished in conference play and its lone loss on the year came by 14 points against Louisville, a potential ACC champion, on the road. If the Dukes can finish undefeated and win the Sun Belt, they should have a compelling case against whatever champion emerges from the beat-up American.    Jerry Mack will be a top coaching candidate one day \nIf you're not familiar with Jerry Mack, it's time to learn his name. The former assistant coach at Tennessee and with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the NFL got his first crack at being an FBS head coach at Kennesaw State. \nIn just his first year in that capacity, and in Kennesaw State's second season as an FBS program, he has the Owls looking like a favorite to win Conference USA. This just one year removed from a 2-10 campaign, as well. Kennesaw State is 5-0 in league play this year and, on Saturday, Mack's squad will take a commanding lead in the standings when it downs fellow undefeated C-USA opponent Jacksonville State. Mack may not be a hot coaching name this cycle, but he will be down the road if he sustains the success. \n            ",

On Thursday night, Ohtani won National League MVP, beating out fellow finalists Kyle Schwarber (Philadelphia Phillies) and Juan Soto (New York Mets). By sweeping all 30 first-place votes, Ohtani was a unanimous selection for the award.

He is the second player in history with four career MVP awards, joining Barry Bonds, who won a record seven. Bonds (2001-04) is the only other player to win three MVPs consecutively.Last year, Ohtani joined Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in each league. Ohtani won the 2021 and 2023 AL MVP awards with the Los Angeles Angels and now the 2024 and 2025 NL MVP awards with the Dodgers.\nHe joins Aaron Judge, the Yankees captain who won the American League MVP over Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh.Ohtani, 31, had another thunderous season at the plate, slashing .282/.392/.622 with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. He led the National League in slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.014), and all of baseball in runs scored (146) and total bases (380). Ohtani's 6.6 WAR as a position player only ranked eighth in baseball.In June, Ohtani returned to the mound following his September 2023 elbow surgery. He threw 47 innings in 14 closely monitored starts and was terrific, pitching to a 2.87 ERA with 62 strikeouts and only nine walks. Ohtani amassed 1.1 WAR as a pitcher. His combined 7.7 WAR was third highest in baseball.\nSchwarber, now a free agent, slugged an NL-leading 56 home runs in 2025. He also led baseball with 132 RBI and hit .240/.365/.563 overall. Schwarber finished with 4.7 WAR despite starting 154 of 162 games at DH.Soto got off to a relatively slow start to his first season with the Mets, but rallied to finish the year with new career highs in home runs (43) and stolen bases (38). He hit .263/.396/.525 and was worth 6.2 WAR.Voting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason.

Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman José Ramírez for the award, the BBWAA announced Thursday night.As the voting results show, it was a close race between Judge and Raleigh: Player1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th10thPointsAaron Judge, Yankees1713355Cal Raleigh, Mariners1317335José Ramírez, Guardians1965224Bobby Witt Jr., Royals91911215Tarik Skubal, Tigers1271043139Julio Rodríguez, Mariners188651136George Springer, Blue Jays176743125Garrett Crochet, Red Sox14564274Junior Caminero, Rays11312537Jeremy Peña, Astros47632Byron Buxton, Twins331730Nick Kurtz, Athletics1123429Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays11314Cody Bellinger, Yankees1117Maikel Garcia, Royals317Bo Bichette, Blue Jays115Riley Greene, Tigers113Aroldis Chapman, Red Sox11Yandy Díaz, Rays11Jacob Wilson, Athletics11This is Judge's second straight MVP and the third of his career (he also won in 2022). He is the 13th player with three MVPs. Only Barry Bonds (seven) and Shohei Ohtani (four), who won this year's National League MVP, have more. Judge is the fourth Yankee with three MVPs, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio (1939, 1941, 1947), Yogi Berra (1951, 1954-55), and Mickey Mantle (1956-57, 1962).He joins Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers superstar who won National League MVP.Judge slashed .331/.457/.688 this season and led baseball in batting average by 20 points, on-base percentage by 58 points, and slugging percentage by 66 points. His 53 home runs were second in the AL behind Raleigh's 60. Judge's 9.7 WAR was 1.7 wins better than the next best player, per Baseball Reference's calculations. \nRaleigh had a historic season and in fact is the first player other than Judge and Ohtani to receive a first-place AL MVP vote since José Abreu won the award in 2020. His 60 home runs are a new single-season record for a catcher, for a switch-hitter, and for a Seattle Mariner. Raleigh is one of only seven players with a 60-homer season. All told, Raleigh hit .247/.359/.589 and led the AL with 125 RBI, and also in games started at catcher (119) and innings caught (1,072). FanGraphs WAR, which includes catcher framing, pegs Raleigh as a 9.1 WAR player in 2025. That is third among all players behind Judge (10.1) and Ohtani (9.4). In just about any other year, Raleigh wins AL MVP with ease. Ramírez has finished in the top five of the MVP voting six times now, though he has yet to win the award. He had another tremendous season, hitting .283/.360/.503 with 30 home runs and 44 stolen bases. It was Ramírez's second straight and third career 30-30 season. His 5.8 WAR was sixth among AL position players. \nVoting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason. They are regular-season awards.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Patriots became the first team to have rookies score three 50-yard touchdowns from scrimmage since 1998. TreVeyon Henderson had 55-yard and 69-yard touchdowns, while Kyle Williams caught a 72-yard touchdown pass. Henderson has finally arrived, as he recorded 150 yards from scrimmage.More of that special special teams play. The Jets couldn't have defeated the Browns last week without special teams. They became the first NFL team since 2017 to have a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown in the same game, and the first team since 2011 to have back-to-back possessions with a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown. Kene Nwangwu ran back a kick 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, then Isaiah Williams ran back a 74-yard punt return touchdown following a Browns three-and-out. Speaking of special teams, we have to give a shoutout to kicker Nick Folk as well. He's one of two kickers to have not missed a field goal this season, going a perfect 19 of 19. He hasn't missed an extra point yet either. The Jets will need good play from special teams if they want to upset the Patriots. Mike Vrabel's historic start. The former NFL Coach of the Year is tied in having the best 10-game start for a coach who inherited a 13-loss team in NFL history. Andy Reid started 9-2 in his first season with the Kansas City Chiefs, and finished 11-5. Four for IV. The Jets aren't known for their defense, but Will McDonald IV racked up four sacks vs. the Browns last week. He became the first Jet to record four sacks in a game since John Abraham in 2001! No other Jets player has more than 2.5 sacks this season. Jets vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThere's too much going against the Jets in this matchup. The defense has recorded just one takeaway all season, Justin Fields has thrown fewer than 60 yards in three out of his last four starts and Garrett Wilson is expected to miss a few weeks with his knee injury. I don't believe the Patriots will win this game by 40 points, but I'll take them at -12.5. Pick: Patriots -12.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Familiar matchups may incentivize Week 11 NFL bets, and there's no shortage of those on the NFL schedule. There are nine divisional contests you could make Week 11 NFL picks on, the most of any week thus far. The entire AFC North and NFC West will do battle with Steelers vs. Bengals (+5.5), Ravens vs. Browns (+7.5), Rams vs. Seahawks (+3) and 49ers vs. Cardinals (+3). In terms of non-divisional games, there's a potential Super Bowl preview at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday as Buffalo is a 5.5-point home favorite over Tampa, per the latest Week 11 NFL odds, in a matchup of 6-3 teams coming off defeats. The biggest Sunday spread has Baltimore as 7.5-point favorites over Cleveland after the Ravens authored a 24-point win when they played earlier this year.The NFC East is featured in the Week 11 NFL schedule with its teams taking part in three standalone games. Washington faces Miami in the first NFL game in Madrid, as the Dolphins are favored by 2.5 points, per the NFL lines. Nearly 12 hours later, Eagles vs. Lions (+2.5) takes place on SNF, and finally on Monday, the Cowboys visit the Raiders, which has Dak Prescott and Dallas as 3.5-point road favorites, according to the latest Week 11 NFL spreads. All of the updated Week 11 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 11 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 11 on a 47-32 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Being at home doesn't appear to be much of an advantage for the Vikings, who committed eight false starts during a Sunday home loss to Baltimore. That's the second-most false starts by a home team in a game since 2000, as J.J. McCarthy has struggled in his debut season. He has six interceptions and four fumbles (one lost) across his four starts while being sacked 15 times. Meanwhile, Chicago has won six of its last seven games, going 5-2 ATS over that stretch. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 11 NFL predictions: the Steelers (-5.5, 49.5) cover at home versus the Bengals in well over 50% of simulations. Cincy owns the worst defense, by far, in the NFL, ranking dead last in points allowed and yards allowed, with bottom-three rankings in pass defense, takeaways and redzone defense. Additionally, its three spread victories this year are tied for the fewest in the league, and coming off a bye won't give the Bengals much of an edge as the team is 1-5 ATS over its last six games with a rest advantage. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS at home since the start of last year, and its No. 16 offense could look like a top-five unit versus Cincy. The model projects Pittsburgh to score a touchdown more than its season average as the Steelers cover. SportsLine's advanced model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 11 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 11 NFL schedule and just revealed two underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 11 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which two teams should you lock in now?

The lawsuit states that the woman reported the incident to the NFL and that the league investigated and suspended Jackson.The woman, unnamed in the lawsuit, alleges violations of gender violence and revenge porn laws and accused Jackson of invasion of privacy, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and fraud. She initially reported the incident to the Los Angeles Police Department but elected not to pursue a criminal case and instead reported it to the NFL.According to the lawsuit, after the woman learned that Jackson had filmed her without consent, she demanded that he delete the video. Jackson refused, and she asked him again after leaving Los Angeles to return to Philadelphia. Jackson later said that he deleted the video but one day later sent it to her, indicating that he lied about its deletion.\nJackson was suspended for the first two games of the 2024 season for a violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Neither the league nor the Rams, Jackson and coach Sean McVay offered further details at the time of the suspension.Following his two-game absence, Jackson made his season debut in Week 3 and proceeded to start every game until the regular-season finale. He played 100% of the Rams' offensive snaps from Sept. 22 through Dec. 28 as a stalwart on the offensive line protecting quarterback Matthew Stafford's blind side.\nJackson has been in the lineup for each of the Rams' first nine games of the 2025 campaign. This is his fourth year as a starter, and he has remained healthy throughout the season after missing much of training camp with blood clots. He sat the final nine games of the 2022 season with the same issue.\n            \n    ",

Yuracheck will replace former chairman Mack Rhoades, who stepped away from his role on Thursday. Utah athletic director Mark Harlan will also rejoin the selection committee after previously serving a one-year term during the 2023 season. This change comes just two days after the CFP unveiled its second set of rankings and less than a month before the final 12-team playoff field is unveiled on Dec. 7.\"We are deeply appreciative of Mack Rhoades' leadership and service as Chair of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee this season,\" College Football Playoff executive director Rich Clark said in a statement. \"Mack has informed us of his decision to step down for personal reasons, and our thoughts are with him and his family during this time. \"We are pleased to announce that Hunter Yurachek will assume the role of Selection Committee Chair, effective immediately. Hunter's experience, integrity, and commitment to the game make him exceptionally well-suited to lead the committee as it continues its important work throughout the remainder of the season.\"\nYurachek has served as an athletic director for 15 years and has been at Arkansas since 2017. He also had stints directing the athletic departments at Coastal Carolina (2010-15) and Houston (2015-17). Yurachek has presided over two coaching changes during his time at Arkansas. He hired former boss Sam Pittman in 2020 to replace Chad Morris and then fired Pittman midway through the 2025 season. The Razorbacks are actively searching for a new coach. \nHarlan, meanwhile, has been at Utah since 2018 after a six-year stint as the athletic director at South Florida.   \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        SEC heavyweight matchups highlight the slate of games to make Week 12 college football picks on with No. 4 Alabama (-6) vs. No. 11 Oklahoma and No. 10 Texas vs. No. 5 Georgia (-6.5) both set for Saturday as four of the nine winningest FBS programs all-time meet up. Meanwhile, the team they're all looking up to in the College Football Playoff rankings, No. 1 Ohio State, will have its first Big Ten matchup versus UCLA, with the Buckeyes favored by 31.5 points according to the Week 12 college football odds.That matchup will see Nico Iamaleava face the team where his Tennessee tenure ended against, as the Vols fell to Ohio State in last year's CFP. Is that extra incentive for the UCLA quarterback enough to back the Bruins with Week 12 college football predictions? Before locking in any Week 12 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 12 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and Week 12 college football betting lines on the spread, money line, and over/under. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top college football predictions for Week 12One of the college football picks the model is high on during Week 12: the 11th-ranked Oklahoma Sooners (+6, 45.5) cover versus No. 4 Alabama in a 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff. Oklahoma pulled off a road upset at Tennessee on Nov. 1 before having a bye last week, while Bama had a physical win over LSU on Saturday. One can't discount the rest advantage that provides the Sooners as Alabama has covered in just one of its last five games when it has a rest disadvantage. OU quarterback John Mateer is undefeated (3-0) on the road with Oklahoma and has 17 total touchdowns versus just two interceptions over his last six road games overall. The model forecasts Oklahoma to go into Tuscaloosa, Ala., and cover over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Miami (-15.5, 55.5) covers at home versus NC State on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Being at home is important to note for the Canes as NC State has lost both on the scoreboard and versus the spread in three straight road games. The Wolfpack's defense will be the weakest unit on the field come Saturday as it's allowed 41.7 points over its last three, while Miami's defense is the strength of its team. The Hurricanes rank 10th in FBS by allowing just 15 points per game, and of their last six home games, they've allowed a lone touchdown -- or no trips to the end zone at all -- in five of them. The model has Miami covering well over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 12The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 12, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 11 schedule features nine divisional clashes. Among the biggest are Sunday, when the AFC West co-leading Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams face off as Sam Darnold looks to guide the Seahawks past Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Anothr key divisional matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos in a pivotal AFC West meeting. The Rams are 3-point favorites as both they and the Seahawks sport 7-2 ATS records, while Kansas City is favored by 3.5 points on the road.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications features the Detroit Lions against the Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5). Philadelphia has won the last two meetings, the last a 38-35 triumph in 2022. The largest Sunday spread has the Ravens (-7.5) over the Cleveland Browns despite uncertainty surrounding Lamar Jackson, who missed practice with a knee injury on Wednesday. Other big favorites include the Packers (-7) vs. the Giants, as Jameis Winston will start in place of Jaxson Dart (concussion) and the Texans (-6) vs. Titans, in which a concussion will also keep C.J.

Jackson said he tweaked his knee in last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings but that the issue is \"getting better\" ahead of the Week 11 divisional clash with the Cleveland Browns.Coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Wednesday that Jackson \"should be OK\" after missing practice early in the week.Baltimore has received a jolt, offensively, since the return of Lamar Jackson, as the return of the former MVP to the lineup in Week 9 helped the Ravens to consecutive wins over the Dolphins and Vikings. Those wins have Baltimore just one game back of the falling Steelers for the AFC North division lead, but as they prepared to face the Browns on Sunday in an effort to get back to .500 on the season, they initially did so without Jackson. \nJackson missed three games with a hamstring injury suffered in a Week 4 loss to the Chiefs, but he looked good in his return to the field. On the season, he's completed 70.1% of his passes for 1,249 yards, 15 touchdowns and one interception. Jackson's return, coupled with the run game and defense returning to form, has Baltimore looking like a threat in the AFC again, but his health will likely be the determining factor in the overall success to the team. Jackson took some big hits in Sunday's win over Minnesota, and the Ravens will have to establish a balance between their need to keep Jackson healthy to achieve their long-term goals of winning a Super Bowl. \nWednesday's absence appears to have been a matter of precaution, and Ravens fans will hope his return to the practice field on Thursday indicates he will be under center against Cleveland on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

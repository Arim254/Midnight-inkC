    "body": "\nThe Chicago Bears will try to regain their footing Sunday when they host the floundering Cleveland Browns in NFL Week 15. The Bears (9-4) saw their five-game win streak snapped with a loss to the rival Green Bay Packers last week, and they need a victory before hosting the Packers next week. The loss dropped them from the top seed to seventh in the NFC playoff race. Cleveland (3-10) is evaluating for the future and has some talented rookies like quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who aim to keep proving they belong on the big stage.    Kickoff from Soldier Field is set for 1 p.m. ET on FOX. The Bears are 7.5-point favorites, per the latest Browns vs. Bears odds from DraftKings, while the total, or over/under for points scored, is 39.5. The Bears are -392 money line favorites (risk $392 to win $100), while the Browns are +308 underdogs. Before making any Bears vs. Browns picks of your own, make sure to look at the top NFL picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times. \nWhere to watch Bears vs. Browns on SundayWhen: Sunday, Dec. 14Time: 1 p.m. ETTV: FOXStream: FuboFollow along: CBS Sports AppBears vs. Browns betting previewOdds: Bears -7.5, over/under 39.5Chicago's success has been a surprise after the team went 5-12 last season and hadn't had a winning season since 2018. This is a different Bears team, with new coach Ben Johnson getting more out of quarterback Caleb Williams. Chicago is 8-4 against the spread this season, while Cleveland is 5-8 ATS. The Browns have just one victory in their past 14 road trips, winning at Las Vegas in Week 12, and are 5-14 ATS the spread over their past 19 overall games. The total is typically low when Cleveland is involved, since the Browns have one of the league's top defenses, and this is the second-lowest total of Week 15. Both teams are 7-6 to the Over this season.Bears vs. Browns SGPBears -7.5Caleb Williams Over 16.5 rushing yardsQuinshon Judkins anytime touchdown scorerBet it at DraftKings:\nModel's Browns vs. Bears score prediction, picksThe model projects a pretty comfortable victory for the Bears, with Chicago winning outright 74% of the time and covering the spread in 54% of simulations.

    "body": "\nNo bye weeks and no games outside of the traditional primetime slots sets up a jumbo Week 15 NFL DFS main slate schedule with 13 games unfolding on Sunday afternoon. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye are among the most expensive quarterbacks on this slate, but their matchups differ substantially with Stafford facing a Detroit squad that has given up the 28th most Fantasy points to opposing QBs, while Maye faces a Buffalo defense ranked No. 6 against opposing quarterbacks.How should all that factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups? Quarterbacks such as Kenny Pickett, Brady Cook and Philip Rivers are expected to make their first starts of the season.

He threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 55 against a tough Denver defense in his last start. He get a more favorable matchup this time, facing the Giants and a defense that has given up the third most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. See who else to pick here.You can also bet on Mariota to go Over 206.5 total passing yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Ravens running back Derrick Henry at $8,400 on FanDuel and $7,300 on DraftKings. Henry has scored four touchdowns in the past four weeks, and he's generally known as a back who dominates late in the season in cold-weather games.

    "body": "\nThe Week 15 NFL DFS main slate is one of the largest of the season with 13 games kicking during the afternoon windows. Though the NFL DFS player pool has increased, so has the size of many injury lists this time of year. Freezing temperatures could also slow offenses in games like Bears vs. Browns and Chiefs vs. Chargers. That's why Rams vs. Lions might be one of the top games for daily Fantasy players to target.Both teams have prolific offenses with the likes of Matthew Stafford, Jahmyr Gibb and Puka Nacua, and they're playing in a dome, leading to an over/under of 54.5 points, easily the highest total on the board this week. Which NFL DFS picks should you target, and which sleepers can differentiate your lineups? Before making any DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Sunday NFL DFS main slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Week 15One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Week 15 is Ravens running back Derrick Henry at $7,300 on FanDuel and $8,400 on DraftKings. If you're looking for a cold-weather bulldozer, Henry could be your pick. He's known to get stronger as the season goes on, and he thrives in games like Ravens vs. Bengals late in the season when the run games are essentially. Cincy's run defense has also struggled mightily this season, making Henry a go-to player to build NFL DFS lineups around on Sunday. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Derrick Henry to go Over 87.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki ($5,100 on FanDuel, $3,300 on DraftKings), who is coming off a huge 6-86-1 performance in Week 14. After being targeted five or fewer times in the first six weeks of the season, he's now seen six targets twice in the past three weeks. Joe Burrow seems to be comfortable with him, and there are 17 other tight ends ahead of him on the DraftKings price list, making him a steal in Week 15. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine. How to set Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

The Lions are battling for a playoff spot, while the Rams are seeking to retain the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Rams enter as 6-point home favorites. Sunday's largest spreads include Raiders vs. Eagles (-12.5), Titans vs. 49ers (-12.5), Jets vs. Jaguars (-13.5) and Colts vs. Seahawks (-13.5). Indianapolis rookie quarterback Riley Leonard (knee) doesn't carry an injury designation for the game, but the Colts promoted 44-year-old Philip Rivers from the practice squad in order to activate him for this contest.

Many of the NFL games with playoff implications occur later on Sunday, including a Sunday Night Football matchup when the Dallas Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings. The Cowboys, who at 6-6-1 are in the playoff mix, have been elite at home in recent weeks, with victories over both teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. That's a trend the SportsLine Projection Model expects to continue on Sunday Night Football, backing the Cowboys to cover as 5.5-point favorites in its NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Cowboys vs. Vikings has an over-under of 47.5.A pair of SportsLine's top experts have picked a side from games in the 4 p.m. ET slate that could vie for the game of the week for Rams vs. Lions (+6) and Packers vs. Broncos (+1.5). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Broncos should not be underdogs at home against anybody, not with a 10-game SU win streak,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The fact Denver is winning these games close shouldn't be held against Sean Payton's crew; their style of game simply is methodical, with few big plays these days on offense, and the defense is good enough to win most games. Margins can start to expand for Denver when the stop unit begins to convert pick-sixes and scoop-and-scores like a year ago. That hasn't happened as much this season, but the Broncos keep winning as Bo Nix and the offense do just enough each week. Note the Pack has covered just three of its last 12 away.\" Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lions (+6) vs. Rams\"I have the Rams as the best team in the league in my power ratings, but I'm jumping on the Lions with this line at 6 at DraftKings,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"Detroit has the No. 1 scoring offense in the league after a big game against the Cowboys, with a top-five mark in net yards per pass attempt and yards per rush. Recent losses have come down to uncharacteristic struggles on fourth down, and a typical day on that front will allow them to stay close. There are a few teams I trust more to get a backdoor cover if needed as well. The lookahead was 4.5 and the Lions had a much-needed big win. Why the inflation? I think this line should be 4.\" Back Detroit at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cowboys (-5.5) vs. VikingsThe Cowboys are 4-1-1 straight up at home this season, and 4-2 against the spread at AT&T Stadium. Dallas defeated the Eagles, 24-21, and the Chiefs, 31-28, at home over the last three weeks, and this current version of the Vikings isn't nearly the competition level of the two teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. Dallas is third in the NFL in scoring at 29.3 ppg this season, including 32.7 ppg at home. Dallas gave up 44 points on the road to the Lions last week, but their defense has performed much better at home since adding to the unit at the trade deadline. Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy has the third-worst quarterback rating of 48 QBs this season. The Vikings are 26th in the league at 19.6 ppg this season, and the model doesn't expect Minnesota to be able to keep pace with Dallas, projecting the Cowboys to cover in 60% of simulations. Back the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Byes are done with for the 2025 NFL season, which means you have a full complement of Week 15 Fantasy football picks to choose from as the Fantasy playoffs arrive in many leagues. There are, however, player injuries, which is a season-long thing to deal with when composing a Fantasy football strategy. Nonetheless, the likes of Stefon Diggs, TreVeyon Henderson, Jaxson Dart, Christian McCaffrey and Rico Dowdle are back in action after being on a bye. But who should start along side them in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups?Speaking of injuries, Daniel Jones (Achilles) was one of many casualties on Sunday, as those who have been riding him all season long at quarterback are likely seeking out some Week 15 Fantasy football advice. His absence has a ripple effect, and while Jonathan Taylor remains a must-start, where do the Fantasy football projections forecast for Colts pass catchers like Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren with the Colts uncertain on their quarterbacks plans and even bringing Philip Rivers in as an option alongside Riley Leonard? Among those questionable for Week 15 include Josh Jacobs (knee), Rome Odunze (foot) and Jake Ferguson (calf).Before making your Week 15 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 15 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 15 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 15: The model is fading Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who is being started in around 65% of leagues, may not warrant a spot in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. Warren is a by-product of Indy's passing game, which just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, has Anthony Richardson on IR, and has third-strong rookie, Riley Leonard (knee) dealing with his own ailment, leading to the Rivers signing this week. Warren had season lows in both catches (2) and yards (15) on Sunday, with Leonard playing most of the game. Not much more is expected on Sunday versus Seattle, which has the No. 2 scoring defense and hasn't allowed a tight end touchdown since Week 11. Warren sits outside the top 15 in Fantasy football TE rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr., despite him being the RB50 in standard leagues and being started in just 35% of leagues this week. Rodriguez has leapfrogged Jacory Croskey-Merritt on the depth chart, as the former has more touches each of the last three weeks. He hasn't disappointed with more opportunities as Rodriguez has at least 52 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five straight games. With the Giants' league-worst run defense on tap, as New York allows the most yards per carry and the second-most rushing yards per game, Rodriguez should find his way into your Week 15 Fantasy football lineups.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

    "body": "\nThree teams can punch their ticket to the postseason with a victory in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. One of those clubs is the New England Patriots (11-2), who also would clinch their first AFC East title since 2019 with a triumph over the visiting Buffalo Bills (9-4) on Sunday. The Patriots, who edged the Bills 23-20 on the road in Week 5, are looking to extend their winning streak to 11 games and end Buffalo's five-year reign atop the division.The Denver Broncos (11-2), who also have won 10 in a row, and Los Angeles Rams (10-3) can clinch a playoff berth as well with home wins against the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, respectively.For Sunday's matchup between the Patriots and Bills, top sportsbooks have set the passing yards prop for New England's Drake Maye at 233.5 yards while James Cook of Buffalo - who is second in the NFL with 1,308 yards - has his rushing yards prop set at 83.5.Before you play a side on Maye, Cook or any player prop for Week 15 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The expert is +829 on his last 45 NFL player prop picks. Here are his picks and analysis.Michael Pittman Jr. Under 16.5 yards longest reception\nThis is a line I'd have considered betting even if quarterback Daniel Jones was starting for Indianapolis. Pittman has failed to clear this longest reception total in seven of his 13 games, and the matchup against Seattle is brutal.The Seahawks have allowed the fewest receiving yards to outside pass catchers, at the lowest yards per reception (10.31) and yards per route run (1.36). Pittman runs 71% of his routes out wide and when he does venture into the slot, his average depth of target is only 5.4 yards.And the Colts are starting 44-year-old Philip Rivers, whose arm strength was below average when he initially retired in 2020. While the basis of this bet isn't heavily rooted in assumptions, I'd surmise the Colts gameplan doesn't involve Rivers sitting back in the pocket and throwing the ball deep down the field. I have Pittman's longest reception projected around 14 yards, and I'd bet this down to Under 15.5.Chase Brown Over 3.5 receptions\nBrown had seven catches on seven targets against Baltimore two weeks ago. Granted, Joe Burrow did throw 46 passes in that game, but I do like Brown in this matchup.The Ravens' defense has allowed a lot of receiving volume by running backs of late, and Burrow and the Bengals' passing game once again will be without Tee Higgins. The rest of Cincinnati's receivers are low volume, and Mike Gesicki has a tough matchup against Kyle Hamilton.Since becoming a starter in the middle of last season, Brown is Over this line in four of the last five games with Burrow and without Higgins. Included in those contests are 16 total catches in two outings against this Baltimore defense.I have Brown projected close to six targets, which should be more than enough to snag four catches.Colby Parkinson Under 15.5 yards longest reception\nDespite the fact Parkinson has come on strong with Tyler Higbee on injured reserve, this is a high line for the tight end. Parkinson only has two receptions this season that have exceeded 16 yards, and his average depth of target is only 3.0 yards.He runs 75% of his routes in-line, and the Lions have allowed the second-fewest catches (1.6 per game) and the lowest yards after catch per reception (2.62) to that alignment this season.With Detroit running man coverage at the second-highest rate, I'm expecting a ton of targets for Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, both of whom thrive against man coverage.Even at a projected four targets, I have Parkinson's longest catch closer to 13 yards. I'd bet this line down to Under 14.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\nRaiders running back Ashton Jeanty is one of the rare rookie running backs selected in the first 10 picks of an NFL Draft who hasn't had a monstrous rookie campaign. However, few running backs have been selected by a team with an offense as dysfunctional as Las Vegas' has been the majority of the season, with the Raiders ranking last in the NFL in scoring at 15.1 points per game. When the Raiders do score, it's often because of Jeanty, and at +175 odds at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Jeanty as one of its top values for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets at online sports betting sites. Jeanty's over/under for total rushing yards against the Eagles is 53.5. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 15 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt and Texans wide receiver Jayden Higgins to cash for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 15 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 15 NFL picks. Best Week 15 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Jayden Higgins, Texans (+310)\nAshton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Jeanty played 70% of snaps last week for his sixth straight week reaching that snap percentage. The rookie played 96% of snaps the week before, as Las Vegas' poor record hasn't limited how much it wants to utilize Jeanty. The No. 6 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is the Raiders' unquestioned top playmaker, and he's accounted for 38.1% of the team's touchdowns this season. The Raiders play the Eagles, who have allowed at least one touchdown to the opposing team's running back in back-to-back weeks, and Jeanty is the only Raiders player with a rushing touchdown this season.\nKareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Hunt has continued to play the majority of running back snaps, even with the return of Isiah Pacheco in the last two games. Hunt has played at least 59% of snaps in all five weeks since Pacheco suffered his initial injury, and Hunt has scored at least one touchdown in four of those five contests. He had a 2-yard touchdown run last week for his sixth touchdown over the last six weeks. The Chiefs play the Chargers in a must-win game for Kansas City to keep its postseason hopes alive, and Los Angeles has allowed at least one running back touchdown in two of its last three games. The model projects Hunt to score in more than 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. \nJayden Higgins, Texans (+310)Higgins has scored a touchdown in two of his last five games, and he's taken on a more impactful role in the offense in recent weeks. The second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft had a slower start, but after seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in five straight contests, averaging 6.6 targets per game during that stretch. The 22-year-old has more than 40 yards in three of five games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. The Texans are 9.5-point favorites against the Cardinals, who have the 26th-ranked scoring defense in the league, so there should be multiple scoring opportunities. At longer than 3-1 odds, the value sees strong value in Higgins for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. \nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 15.

    "body": "\nTime is running out for teams to make their moves, and NFL Week 15 will start to bring some clarity to a convoluted playoff picture. The marquee matchup is Bills vs. Patriots, but Chargers vs. Chiefs and Packers vs. Broncos should get plenty of attention. The Patriots (11-2) are looking to secure the AFC East title for the first time since they won 11 straight with Tom Brady at the helm from 2009-19. The Bills (9-4) have won every season since, and they are 1.5-point favorites in the latest Patriots vs. Bills odds at DraftKings after New England opened as a 1.5-point favorite.Bye weeks are over, so there is a full slate in Week 15, and the Chiefs (6-7) are in do-or-die mode (for real this time) against their AFC West rivals. Kansas City is in true danger of missing the postseason after reaching five of the past six Super Bowls, winning three. The Chargers (9-4) are two games behind the division-leading Broncos (11-2). Denver hosts the 9-3-1 Packers, who have a tentative hold on the NFC North lead.  Lines are sharp this time of year, as the books have tons of data to parse, but there has been some notable NFL line movement in Week 15. Here, we will break down the games that have seen the biggest shifts since lines first opened, with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Bills vs. Patriots (1 p.m. ET)Open: Patriots -1.5, O/U 47.5Now: Bills -2.5, O/U 49.5\nThe Patriots had their bye last week, while Josh Allen and the Bills were rallying to beat the Bengals 39-34. New England won the first meeting this season 23-20 when Drake Maye threw for 273 yards and Buffalo had three turnovers. Allen has thrived under pressure, going 27-9-1 against the spread in his career against defenses that allow fewer than 20 points per game. New England allows 18.5. The Pats are 9-4 ATS this season, while Buffalo is 6-7. Jets vs. Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)Open: Jaguars -8.5, O/U 42.5Now: Jaguars -14, O/U 40.5\nThe Jaguars (9-4) lead the AFC South after knocking off the Colts last week, and the Jets' uncertainty at quarterback has shifted this line considerably. The Jets are 3-10 so it was already expected to be ugly, but both Justin Fields (knee) and Tyrod Taylor (groin) have health issues. Brady Cook, who completed 14 of 30 passes and threw two interceptions last week, could be the only option for New York. Five of New York's losses have been by 13 or more points, including the past three, while the Jags have outscored their past two opponents 61-22. Cardinals vs. Texans (1 p.m. ET)Open: Texans -7, O/U 42.5Now: Texans -10.5, O/U 42.5\nHouston opened a lot of eyes with their dominant defensive performance against the desperate Chiefs last week. The Texans forced three turnovers and held Patrick Mahomes to 14-of-33 passing in the 20-10 victory. The defense allows 266 yards and 16 points per game, both tops in the league. The Cardinals are 3-10 after winning their first two games thanks to a defense that allows almost 27 points per game and an offense that can't run the ball.Chargers vs. Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)Open: Chiefs -4.5, O/U 44.5Now: Chiefs -5.5, O/U 41.5 \nThe Chiefs are getting the benefit of the doubt, and Justin Herbert's surgically repaired hand looks like it could force Los Angeles to be a bit more conservative. The Chargers (9-4) looked shaky on offense but still beat the Eagles in OT last week. Kansas City (6-7) needs this one badly, and its defense allows fewer points (19.4 per game) than the Chargers (20.8). With major issues on both offensive lines, this line has dropped, and the home-field advantage favors the Chiefs. The Chargers are 1-4 against the spread on the road this season.Colts vs. Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)Open: Seahawks -9.5, O/U 43.5Now: Seahawks -14, O/U 41.5\nThe Indianapolis quarterback situation has been unclear since Daniel Jones tore an Achilles in Week 14's 36-19 loss to the Jaguars. Riley Leonard took over for the Colts (8-5) but Phillip Rivers has been brought in and will get the start over Leonard in Week 15. Seattle (10-3) has no such issue, with Sam Darnold and NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading the second-highest scoring offense in the league (29.8 ppg). The defense allows just 17.4, the second-fewest mark in the NFL.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Every year during the college football transfer portal cycle, fans of teams across the country get a renewed sense of hope. Because of the mass exodus that happens every season, players often fall under the radar and become stars at their next destination. On the flip side, some highly touted players don't work out at their next stop -- or it takes time to do so.The biggest name who entered the transfer portal this past offseason was Nico Iamaleava. The former Tennessee quarterback went back to the West Coast and enrolled at UCLA. Although there were some low lights during Iamaleava's first season with the Bruins, there were moments when Iamaleava showed why he was a highly regarded recruit in the first place. One of those was when he engineered one of the biggest upsets of the 2025 season against Penn State in the best statistical game of his career.Another player from Iamaleava's high school recruiting class was Jackson Arnold. The former Oklahoma quarterback transferred to Auburn last offseason, and it didn't work out. Arnold was benched against Arkansas on Oct. 25 and appeared in just two more games the rest of the season.\nWith the college football transfer portal set to open again next month, it's time to look at some of the biggest disappointments from this past cycle.\n        \n            \n                Who will be at forefront of 2026 Heisman race? Arch Manning, Julian Sayin among top contenders to watch\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n    Nic Anderson, WR, LSUPrevious school: Oklahoma | 247Sports transfer ranking: 9Outside of logging just nine snaps in a game against Tennessee, Anderson was sidelined for the majority of the season. During the 2023 campaign, Anderson had a breakout year, accounting for 798 yards and 10 touchdowns. The third-ranked wide receiver in the 247Sports transfer portal rankings enrolled at LSU, looking for a fresh start, but couldn't replicate similar production. Anderson finished with 12 catches for 106 yards and two touchdowns in seven games.\n    \n                                        \n    Elo Modozie, EDGE, GeorgiaPrevious school: Army | 247Sports transfer ranking: 46The eighth-ranked edge transfer by 247Sports was expected to be a key part of Georgia's defense this season. After all, Modozie was the third-highest-ranked transfer the Bulldogs added this offseason behind receivers Zachariah Branch and Noah Thomas. After posting 6.5 sacks at Army, Modozie has yet to record a sack with his new team. In the SEC title game against Alabama, Modozie logged just 12 snaps.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Rahsul Faison, RB, South CarolinaPrevious school: Utah State | 247Sports transfer ranking: 49Faison had to wait until days before South Carolina's first game to find out if he would be eligible to play in 2025. Ultimately, Faison, the third-ranked running back in the transfer portal rankings, was granted an additional season of eligibility by the NCAA. His best game of the season came against Vanderbilt, when he finished with 74 rushing yards and a touchdown. Overall, he ran for just 470 yards and three touchdowns in 12 games.\n    \n                                        \n    Jaydn Ott, RB, Oklahoma Previous school: Cal | 247Sports transfer ranking: 50Perhaps one of the most surprising developments of the entire season was Ott seeing his production plummet. After rushing for over 1,700 yards and 16 touchdowns the last two seasons with Cal, Ott was limited to just 21 carries (68 yards) during the regular season. His best game came against Kent State, when he ran for 49 of his 68 total yards on 11 attempts. He hasn't recorded a stat since the Red River Rivalry showdown against Texas.\n    \n                                        \n    Micah Hudson, WR, Texas TechPrevious school: Texas A&M | 247Sports transfer ranking: 64Hudson, who originally committed to Texas Tech out of high school, transferred to Texas A&M after the 2024 season ended. However, during the spring window, Hudson re-committed to Texas Tech. The former five-star recruit caught eight passes for 112 yards and two touchdowns in five games for the Big 12 champs.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Maalik Murphy, QB, Oregon StatePrevious school: Duke | 247Sports transfer ranking: 82Murphy, the former Texas and Duke quarterback, transferred to Oregon State this past offseason. The No. 82 overall player in the 247Sports transfer rankings finished the season with 1,805 passing yards and a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 9-to-8. Murphy completed 58.1% of his passes and Oregon State finished the season 2-10.\n    \n                                        \n    Jackson Arnold, QB, AuburnPrevious school: Oklahoma | 247Sports transfer ranking: 146The best way to sum up Arnold's season at Auburn is the quote his former coach, Hugh Freeze, gave Justin Hokanson of AuburnSports.\"... But certainly, it didn't work out to the level that he nor I both expected for him and our team. And that's why I'm sitting here.\"\nArnold, the former Oklahoma quarterback, was benched during a 33-24 win over Arkansas. He finished the season with 1,309 passing yards and was never able to find consistency within the offense. It went downhill for Auburn and Arnold after he rushed for 137 yards and two touchdowns in a win over Baylor in the season opener.\n    \n                                        \n    Gio Lopez, QB, North CarolinaPrevious school: South Alabama | 247Sports transfer ranking: 421After a productive season at South Alabama last year, Lopez entered the transfer portal and enrolled at North Carolina. Lopez was named the starting quarterback over veteran Max Johnson ahead of UNC's opener against TCU and finished 4 of 10 for 69 yards after leaving early due to injury. That blowout loss was a sign of bad things to come for UNC in Bill Belichick's first season in Chapel Hill. Lopez completed 65.1% of his passes for 1,747 yards and 10 touchdowns (to five interceptions) as UNC finished 4-8.\n    \n                                        \n    Zach Calzada, QB, KentuckyPrevious school: Incarnate Word | 247Sports transfer ranking: 408Calzada enrolled at Kentucky this offseason after previous stints at UIW and Texas A&M. He was expected to be UK's starting quarterback for the full season. However, he was benched after just two games and ended the year with 238 yards passing and two interceptions. Kentucky reportedly paid around $1.25 million to pull him out of the transfer portal.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Kaidon Salter, QB, ColoradoPrevious school: Liberty | 247Sports transfer ranking: 203One of the most watched quarterback competitions this offseason was at Colorado, where the question \"who will be Shedeur Sanders' successor\" came up frequently. Coach Deion Sanders landed Salter out of the transfer portal. Salter was a star at Liberty, and the fit on paper seemed ideal. However, Colorado's quarterback situation was fluid throughout. Three different signal callers (Salter, Julian Lewis and Ryan Staub) got starting-level snaps. While Salter played the most of the bunch, he never established himself as the Buffaloes' full-time starter.\n            ",

College football bowl season provides an opportunity for fan bases to see their team one last time and get a sneak peek into the future as younger players get into the game. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        The slate of NFL games on CBS in Week 15 is lit, as Philip Rivers' kids would say.We are entering the crucial final month of the regular season in perhaps the most wide-open Super Bowl race of all time, and we get to kick it off with perhaps the best week of NFL action on any network in the history of the game.It will be a statement Sunday for some teams and a survivor Sunday for others. All six games on our air feature playoff implications, particularly in the AFC, where nine of the top 10 seeds will be playing on CBS. Here's the full slate:1 ET Ravens (6-7) at Bengals (4-9)1 ET Chargers (9-4) at Chiefs (6-7)1 ET Bills (9-4) at Patriots (11-2)1 ET Jets (3-10) at Jaguars (9-4)4:25 ET Packers (9-3-1) at Broncos (11-2)4:25 ET Colts (8-5) at Seahawks (10-3)There are nine or 10 legit Super Bowl contenders in action, including at least one in each game. Yes, it's that wide open and we can't rule out teams like the Ravens and Chiefs until they are dead and buried. \nThis is the first CBS slate on record in December or later where teams have a collective win percentage of at least .600. There's a potential Super Bowl preview, a former vs. future MVP quarterback battle, a matchup between Offensive Player of the Year frontrunners and players chasing NFL records.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks:  Packers knock off Broncos on road, Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe craziest part is that this already had a case for the best slate ever, and then a 44-year-old all-time great quarterback decided to come out of retirement after nearly five years to crash the party. In the words of Philip Rivers, \"Daggumit, let's go!\" Rivers' return is the cherry on top of a must-watch day of NFL action on CBS.Since your head is going to be swirling trying to follow all the action on Sunday, I'm going to sort it out for you. Here's my top 10 things to watch.\n1. Philip Rivers' returnWe need to thank the NFL script writers for this one. I don't know about you, but this is by far the most intriguing storyline of the NFL season so far. The utter shock and delight of Philip Rivers coming out of retirement for the love of the game and with a chance to rescue the Colts' season from a historic collapse is beyond remarkable. It's also unprecedented in the NFL. When you factor in the position he plays, how good he was, how long he was retired, how old he is and what's at stake here, there's never been anything like it. The closest examples in other sports would be Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson or Mario Lemieux coming back after long retirements, for a variety of reasons. When you sprinkle in facts like Rivers is a father of 10, and now a grandfather, one of the best trash talkers in the sport, has been coaching high school football, it only adds to the intrigue. This is all straight out of a movie. It's also why it's so much fun to watch sports. You never know what is going to happen. \nThen there's the on-field intrigue. I want to see the sheer physics of how this is going to work. How is a 44-year-old QB who is out of shape and hasn't thrown a pass in the NFL in 1,800 days going to survive, let alone thrive, against a Seahawks defense on Sunday that leads the NFL in pressures? Yes, I'm assuming he's going to start; all signs are pointing in that direction.How long is he going to last vs. this gauntlet of a schedule? It's a long shot, but imagine if he somehow has the Colts in playoff contention in Week 18 against a Texans ferocious defense and he lights them up to lead Indianapolis to the playoffs? I want to live in a world where it's possible for a 44-year-old grandfather to come off the streets and sling it around against the best defense in the world that just tore apart Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. It seems impossible, but so did Philip Rivers coming out of retirement up until Monday. Literally no scenario is off the table once a situation like this occurs. We are officially allowed to live in a full-fledged fantasy world. The Colts have the hardest remaining schedule in the NFL and are trying to avoid becoming the first team in 30 years to miss the playoffs after an 8-2 or better start. I'd love to see Rivers keep them in it. Count me in as one of the millions of people who will have their eyes glued to the TV as the Seahawks host the Colts at 4:25 ET on Sunday. \n2. Chiefs trying to stay aliveThere's always history on the line on any given Sunday, but this one has a lot of juice. The wheels are starting to turn in the heads of media members around the world as we get ready to write the obituary on the Chiefs' dynasty. They could be eliminated from playoff contention as soon as Sunday with a loss and wins by at least three of these teams (Colts, Bills, Texans, Jaguars). Their current run of 10 straight playoff appearances is the second-longest in NFL history, behind the 11 seasons of the 2009-19 Patriots. They also have AFC Championship (seven straight) and Super Bowl trip (three straight) streaks hanging in the balance. It's going to be interesting to see if they can still salvage this season despite all of the struggles. They currently have a 6% chance to make the playoffs, according to Sportsline, but the path is there, as John Breech laid out earlier this week. They need to essentially steal the Chargers' wild card spot and hope the Colts' collapse continues. Considering Patrick Mahomes is the quarterback you'd probably want most if you needed to run the table, plus the Chargers and Colts have brutal schedules, it's still within reach.\nNo team has ever won a Super Bowl when they were under .500 this late in a season, but if anyone can pull it off, it's the Chiefs. 3. Broncos and Patriots on 10-game winning streaksIf the Chiefs do get eliminated, teams like the Broncos and Patriots will be among the beneficiaries who will happily avoid Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs. Both are currently on 10-game win streaks, but are underdogs at home as the Broncos host the Packers and the Patriots host the Bills. A team on a 10+ game win streak has never been an underdog when you exclude regular season finales, when starters get rested on occasion. Now, it's happening twice in one week. All it means is an opportunity for both teams to make big statements. \nThere's also a little history for CBS here. Sunday is the first day this century a network will air two NFL teams on 10+ game win streaks. The last time it happened was on December 26, 1999, when the Colts beat the Browns and the Titans beat the Jaguars, also on CBS.Networks aside, this is the ninth time in NFL history that 10+ game win streaks have occurred at the same time, and in seven of the previous eight cases, at least one of those teams went on to play in a championship game. Simultaneous 10+ game win streaks in NFL historyTeams in bold made the championship game or Super Bowl that season2025\tBroncos & Patriots2015\tPanthers & Patriots2009 Colts & Chargers2009\tColts & Saints 1999 Colts & Jaguars 1990 49ers & Giants 1969\tVikings & Rams1948 Cardinals & Browns1934 Bears & LionsSo I'll be watching both teams to see just how legit they are as Super Bowl contenders as they face teams with Super Bowl hopes, as well. \nI'll also enjoy watching all the quarterbacks face stiff tests. Sophomore quarterbacks Drake Maye and Bo Nix can match a record, too. They each have a chance to tie the longest win streak by a second-year quarterback in NFL history. The mark is currently 11 straight wins held by former MVPs Lamar Jackson (2019), Peyton Manning (1999) and Dan Marino (1984). 4. Super Bowl rematch could be Super Bowl previewWhen you flip the channel to Packers on Broncos (4:25 ET on CBS), I hope you can enjoy the '90s nostalgia of a Super Bowl rematch while being treated to a potential Super Bowl preview. The Broncos beat the Packers back in Super Bowl XXXII, remembered best for Terrell Davis winning Super Bowl MVP (the last running back to do so) while playing through severe migraines, plus John Elway breaking through with his first Super Bowl title, thanks in part to his famous \"helicopter dive\". \nWhen you wake up from fantasy land, you can enjoy watching Jordan Love against the Broncos' defense and maybe another thrilling comeback led by Bo Nix. If you want to keep the throwback theme alive, you can watch Micah Parsons going up against a Broncos team with the fewest sacks allowed in the league and pretend he's Lawrence Taylor. 5. Bills trying to chase down Patriots (and MVP battle)Besides watching to see if the Patriots are legit Super Bowl contenders, I want to see if they can even hang onto their division lead vs. a Bills team that has made a habit of stealing the division lately.They were two games behind the Patriots with four games to play in 2021 when they avenged an early-season loss in Buffalo with a Week 16 win over the Patriots in Foxborough. That helped Buffalo eventually overtake the Patriots in the division before dismantling them 47-17 in the playoffs. It could be deja vu all over again in 2025.\nThe Bills also erased a three-game deficit with five games to play vs. the Dolphins in 2023.The subplot here is the matchup of last year's MVP (Josh Allen) vs. this year's potential MVP (Drake Maye). Maye's first MVP statement came in Week 5 in Buffalo when he led the Patriots to a 23-20 win thanks to a series of drive-extending conversions outside the pocket in the second half. Whoever wears the Superman cape in this game will come out victorious. Plus, don't forget the Patriots are in the middle of a historic turnaround. If they win out and finish 15-2, they would have the largest year-over-year win improvement (+11) in NFL history (they were 4-13 in 2024). 6. Active quarterback Mount Rushmore on CBS There's no shortage of great quarterbacks on CBS this week. This is the first time in four years that Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow are all on CBS in the same week. They were pretty much the consensus top four quarterbacks in the NFL going into the year, but that's not really set in stone anymore:Mahomes could miss the playoffs for the first time in his careerThe turnover bug is biting Josh Allen againLamar Jackson is in the worst stretch of his career since returning from a hamstring injuryJoe Burrow missed a few months after turf toe surgery.Three of those four quarterbacks are currently on the outside of the playoffs looking in, after at least three have made the playoffs every year since Burrow was drafted.There's competition now for their spots on the NFL's Mount Rushmore of active quarterbacks. Drake Maye and Matthew Stafford are up for discussion, and Jordan Love is within shouting distance.The top spot is up for debate, too. I saw this tweet from CBS' Adam Aizer early this week and it's one thing I'll be thinking about on Sunday (and the rest of the season) as I watch Patrick Mahomes. \nHe's not having the best season of any quarterback, but I think he's still the best quarterback in the league. He's at least the guy I'd want if I had to win one game, although Josh Allen is a close second.Still, Mahomes' ranks in EPA per dropback in the last three years (since he won MVP in 2022) are as follows: 10th in 2023, 10th in 2024 and ninth in 2025. This will probably be the third straight season he doesn't finish top five in NFL MVP voting and his deep ball has been pedestrian since Tyreek Hill left. Here's where he ranks on deep throws (20+ air yards) in four seasons without Hill:12th in completions (75)32nd in completion rate (33%)34th in catchable attempt rate (63%)27th in touchdown passes (7)He was top two in completions and touchdowns on deep throws from 2018-21 with Hill and average in completion rate and catchable attempt rate. Is Mahomes the best quarterback in the NFL is a discussion worth having as he continues to distance himself from the MVP he won in 2022. Another thing to chew on is Lamar Jackson's performance since he returned from his hamstring injury. He ranks third-worst in the NFL in EPA per dropback (-0.16) and worst in off-target rate (16%) since and he's got the fewest rush yards (141) and yards per rush (3.7) in a six-start span in his career. I'm wondering if this is just the aftereffects of his hamstring injury or if he's starting to lose a step. Or, if it's a combination of both and more nagging injuries will start robbing us of the most electric quarterback of all-time in future seasons. For now, I'd love to see another track meet between Jackson and Burrow (like last year's 41-38 and 35-34 duels) as both fight to keep their teams' playoff hopes alive.7. Bengals, Seahawks and NFL's nightmare playoff scenarioYes, that's BOTH teams. Do not dismiss the Bengals and their 4-9 record, yet. I want to see if they can throw the entire AFC playoff picture into disarray. They have the fourth-easiest schedule left with games vs. the Ravens, Dolphins, Browns and Cardinals. Count me in on the bandwagon of the Bengals running the table and winning the division as the Ravens and Steelers stumble to the finish line.It's crazy, but if you've been watching the Ravens and Steelers, it's not that crazy. John Breech mapped out how the NFL's nightmare playoff scenario can actually play out. The Bengals could win the AFC North at 7-10 and host the 13-4 Patriots in the playoffs.As of Thursday morning, losing teams could actually still host 13-win teams in the wild card round in BOTH conferences. The 8-9 Buccaneers would host the 13-4 Seahawks if these things happened.The Buccaneers win the NFC South (and get the four seed in the NFC) with an 8-9 record if they finish 1-3 and split their last two games with the Panthers, who also go 1-3. The Seahawks finish second in the NFC West (and get fifth seed in the NFC) with a 13-4 record if they finish 3-1 with a loss to the Rams and the Rams go 4-0 or 3-1.It would be crazy if Sam Darnold leads a different 13+ win team in back-to-back seasons (Vikings and Seahawks) and neither wins its division!8. Jonathan Taylor vs. Jaxon Smith-NjigbaIf you're able to stop admiring Philip Rivers in the Colts vs. Seahawks game, you should probably briefly turn your attention to a battle of Offensive Player of the Year candidates. This is the first matchup between the NFL's leading rusher and receiver in December or later since 1999 between Stephen Davis and Marvin Harrison. Yeah, trust me, I did not expect Stephen Davis to be the answer to that trivia question, either.Jonathan Taylor is going to have us covered on the ground and Jaxon Smith-Njigba will be patrolling the air in this one. Taylor is going for his second rushing title and Smith-Njigba is on pace for 1,867 receiving yards this season. The NFL record is 1,964 by Calvin Johnson in 2012.It's going to be tough for Taylor to hold off James Cook in the rushing title race. Taylor has gone under 100 rushing yards in three straight and four of his last five games. He faces several tough defenses the rest of the way and they'll be keying in on him even more with Philip Rivers likely taking over at quarterback. Smith-Njigba's pace is slowing down, but incredibly, he's in range of becoming the first player in the Super Bowl era to lead the NFL in receiving yards on a team with the fewest pass attempts in the NFL. What a remarkable season.9. Broncos chasing historyKeep an eye on the Broncos' pass rush on Sunday. It'll be the key to slowing down Jordan Love and the Packers offense and they are also currently on pace to tie the 1984 Bears for the most sacks in a season in NFL history (72). It won't be easy to sack Love, though. Only 10 percent of pressures vs. Love turn into sacks in the last two years, the lowest rate in the NFL. Translation. He's the best quarterback in the NFL at avoiding sacks when pressured. If you've watched Denver at all this year, you know they bring a ton of pressure and usually get home on the quarterback.10. Polar vortexWhat's the one ingredient that could somehow make this amazing slate even better? A polar vortex! There's extremely cold weather headed for the northeast this weekend, so we could see frigid temperatures across the NFL, including a few games on our air in Cincinnati (hosting the Ravens), Kansas City (hosting the Chargers) and especially in Foxborough (Patriots host the Bills). I've heard it said that nothing is better than watching football played in wintry conditions and nothing is worse than playing in it. Luckily, I'll be doing the former. So cheers to Week 15! I hope it will live up to the hype and be as fascinating to watch as it has been to write about.\n            ",

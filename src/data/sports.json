    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users can take advantage of $200 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass, and Tuesday night MACtion and a six-game NBA slate provide multiple ways to capitalize on this promotion. The San Antonio Spurs will take the court without the phenom Victor Wembanyama, who is expected to miss multiple weeks with a calf injury, and he's been integral to San Antonio's winning start to the season. The Spurs are favored by 5.5 in the latest Tuesday NBA odds at DraftKings against the Grizzlies, but without Wemby on the floor, the SportsLine Projection Model views this as too many points to lay. Instead, the model is including the Grizzlies to cover as 5.5-point underdogs as one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Grizzlies are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against San Antonio, and Memphis' over/under for total points scored on Tuesday is 114.5.The model also sees value in MACtion, backing UMass to cover as massive 33.5-point underdogs against Ohio in a 7 p.m. ET college football matchup as one of its Tuesday best bets. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on Akron vs. Bowling Green. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight seasons.

The reason this is kinda low, I'm guessing, is that BGSU is the only FBS program to start four different QBs this season (due to injuries, etc.). I don't care. It's Akron. On the road.\" Back Bowling Green at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:UMass (+33.5) vs. Ohio (-112)You could make the argument that UMass is the worst team in the FBS, but 33.5 points is a huge number to give against a fellow MAC opponent. This is the most points the Minutemen have been underdogs by since playing Missouri, of the SEC, and UMass covered that 44.5-point spread in a 42-6 loss. Ohio is the defending MAC champions and has a 4-2 record in the conference this season, but the Bobcats aren't anywhere near the level of an SEC program such as Missouri. The model views 33.5 points as simply too many points in a conference matchup, despite UMass being 0-10 this season. Ohio hasn't won a game by more than 27 points this season, and it is 0-3 against the spread when favored by 11 points or greater this year. The model projects the Minutemen to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this matchup airing on CBS Sports Network. Back UMass at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Grizzlies (+5.5) vs. Spurs (-105)Both teams are without their superstar, with Victor Wembanyama out for the Spurs and Ja Morant out for the Grizzlies as both players deal with calf injuries. Wemby was off to an MVP-caliber start, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game, so although both players' absences significantly affect their teams' outlooks, the Spurs playing without their superstar could be the harder of the two to overcome. The Grizzlies will rely more on their size with players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Cedric Coward and Zach Edey, and without Wemby in the paint, that could be a significant Memphis advantage on Tuesday. The Spurs are 3-6-2 ATS as the favorite this year, and the model projects the Grizzlies to cover the spread in 61% of simulations. Back the Grizzlies at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed), Logan Paul, Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, TBA and TBA vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and TBA: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind.

    "body": "\n        The tension is building in Oxford and Lane Kiffin is trying to dissipate it with a friendly interview.A day after a wild scene of plane tracking and Kiffin family members caught on camera taking a visit to Baton Rouge, the Ole Miss head coach appeared on the Pat McAfee Show to put on a forced smile and try to calm the waters. If you wanted any real clarity, this wasn't the show for you. The most notable point was Kiffin denying that Ole Miss administrators had ever issued an ultimatum that he must make a decision before the Egg Bowl. \"There has been no ultimatum, anything like that at all,\" Kiffin said. \"And so I don't know where that came from, like a lot of stuff that comes out there. Like I said, man, we're having a blast. I love it here.\"\nThat is ostensibly true -- no source CBS Sports has talked to has used the word \"ultimatum\" -- but there is more to the story than simply what Kiffin said Tuesday. What has been bubbling behind the scenes for weeks finally came spilling out Monday after the unprecedented situation of a sitting head coach's family members, including ex-wife Layla Kiffin, taking a private plane for a campus visit to a rival school he was considering taking a job with. There had already been a similar visit to Gainesville the previous day, sources told CBS Sports, but the public nature of LSU's efforts sent the college football industry into a tizzy and had Ole Miss boosters furious over how brazen it all was. Why were Kiffin family members taking visits to Florida and LSU in recent days? It all comes back to Ole Miss wanting clarity on Kiffin's situation, according to sources, and a recognition from Lane that putting off a decision until after the Rebels' season was no longer possible. As the timeline started to get sped up, Lane wanted as much information as possible from trusted sources as he weighed his stay-or-go decision.For weeks now, sources have told CBS Sports that if Ole Miss was convinced Kiffin was not staying long-term in Oxford, it would not let him coach in the College Football Playoff. Of course thinking that and even expressing that sentiment is different than actually doing it and accepting all the complications that come with it. But it has been a real conversation happening within the Ole Miss athletics administration. \nIt might sound crazy to think Ole Miss wouldn't let Kiffin coach in the playoff -- as the school's preference is for clarity before the Egg Bowl -- but in many ways it has been years in the making, dating back to Kiffin's very public dalliance with the Auburn job back in 2022.Kiffin has since admitted he made mistakes in how he handled Auburn's interest in him. The will-he-or-won't-he drama derailed Ole Miss' season and left a sour taste in the mouths of Ole Miss administrators, boosters and fans. In some ways Kiffin almost taking the Auburn job helped spur Ole Miss into this moment. It prompted a NIL fundraising drive to compete with Auburn's perceived bigger war chest. Ole Miss fans rallied to do and give everything they had to keep Kiffin in Oxford, to show him that he could have the resources necessary to win big. It was still fraught at times, especially when a 8-1 season imploded into a 8-5 finish which included an embarrassing Egg Bowl loss to Mississippi State.\nIn a scene first reported in my book \"The Price: What It Takes to Win in College Football's Era of Chaos,\" a prominent booster promised to make a $500,000 contribution to the NIL fund if Kiffin stayed at Ole Miss. And after the loss to Mississippi State came an updated offer from the booster: \"I'll give that f—er $500,000 to leave.\" That's how frustrating the whole process was by the end, and that booster wasn't alone in that thinking. All of the winning in the three years since has made Kiffin the celebrity du jour of Oxford, but that scar tissue didn't go away. Ole Miss administrators were deeply frustrated with how the Auburn distractions derailed that potentially special season, according to sources, and it appears to be having an impact on not wanting that to play out all over again, even if it did work out for Ole Miss the first time. The consternation isn't isolated to athletics, either, as university-side folks have expressed frustration in recent weeks with Kiffin's hold over the school. There's also the very real timeline issues that would occur if Kiffin left for another program in January. With early signing period starting Dec. 3 and the transfer portal window opening Jan. 2, Ole Miss would be at a significant disadvantage if it lost Kiffin after, say, a quarterfinal or semifinal game in early January. If there's no way of changing Lane's mind -- and to this point, Lane has continued to tell people he hasn't made a decision, according to multiple sources -- Ole Miss is prepared to turn to either quarterbacks coach Joe Judge (the former New York Giants head coach) or defensive coordinator Pete Golding as an interim coach and to start a coaching search, according to sources. \nThat's not ideal and is driving a lot of the angst and frustration Ole Miss fans are now directing at Kiffin. Everything Kiffin and Ole Miss administrators and boosters dreamed of doing together in Oxford is happening this season. The Rebels (10-1) are all but guaranteed to make the playoff and could possibly even earn a bye, or at least a first-round home game, if they can beat Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. This is supposed to be the culmination of all the blood, sweat and dollars spent to turn Ole Miss into a legitimate national contender. This should be the peak and instead Kiffin's very public flirtation with two rival SEC schools has sucked all the oxygen out of the room. That isn't all Kiffin's fault -- the brutal college football calendar has put him in a personally enviable yet impossible situation of having to manage outside interest while trying to finish the season out. Kiffin is a mercurial menace in some ways, college football's version of Loki. All the trolling is plenty fun when you think you're on the inside of the joke. When you think you may instead be the butt of it, those feelings can change in a second. That's what's happening right now with Ole Miss boosters and fans. They feel the man who had gone to painstaking lengths to prove he has changed is back to his old antics. They fear they are being played, that their hopes and dreams are nothing more than social media fodder for Kiffin. \nWill they accept him back if he decides to stay? Of course. But there is a growing fear within Ole Miss that Kiffin doesn't love the school quite as much as he's publicly professed. He has complained, publicly and privately, about the fanbase -- including a shot Saturday night about the crowd for The Citadel game. He's long been enamored with the idea of coaching a true blue blood again, an opportunity LSU and Florida are both very eager to give him. Perhaps, as one booster who knows Kiffin well put it, he feels he's already done it all in Oxford. \"He's run it like his town,\" the source said, \"and there's no chase for him anymore. And he's a chaser. The chase is gone cause he conquered it.\"\nKiffin hasn't won the ultimate conquest -- a national championship -- but making a playoff at Ole Miss would be a tremendous accomplishment. And if he left Ole Miss for LSU or Florida, it'd be because he felt he hit his ceiling in Oxford and had a better shot at winning a national championship in Baton Rouge or Gainesville, according to sources. There are important people in Lane's life advocating for all the possible outcomes -- some have said LSU offers the best title chances, others believe he could win big and be happy at Florida -- but ultimately it will come down to where he thinks he can win it all and his family can be happy.Deep down, Ole Miss just wants to hear Lane say he loves it and isn't leaving. But Kiffin, still unsure of what he wants to do per sources, can't say those words. He can't say out loud to McAfee that he's definitively not leaving Ole Miss because that'd be a lie. He might. In fact, multiple sources have told CBS Sports over the last week they believe it is more likely than not that Kiffin leaves, though there are always multiple caveats of \"you never know what he's going to do\" when it comes to him. Nothing is truly done until he signs the deal, no matter how many people tell you it's happening, as Auburn learned the hard way three years ago. And while Kiffin will continue to fall back on his stance that he doesn't deal with these things in season -- of course that hasn't precluded him from considering other jobs in season-- it has put him on an island. In what is already a wild coaching cycle, multiple of the top names have taken themselves out of the mix in favor of an extension and raise at their current school.\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana. Mike Elko and Texas A&M. Matt Rhule and Nebraska. Rhett Lashlee and SMU. If Kiffin wanted to do the same, he could. Ole Miss desperately wishes he would. But every day that passes that he won't, it signals to Ole Miss folks that Kiffin may soon be out the door. \nIt isn't over yet. And there are some still clinging to the dream that Lane will soon announce that while Florida and LSU badly wanted him to come save their programs, he was staying at Ole Miss to finish what he started. It's possible that he could. More than anything, Ole Miss just wants clarity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first big splash of the 2025 transfer cycle did not come Tuesday, but rumor season kicked off in earnest with reports that Arizona State star quarterback Sam Leavitt is considering the transfer portal for the 2026 season. Whispers of Leavitt possibly leaving aren't new. It's been an open discussion point among industry sources since Leavitt's season ended early with a foot injury in late October. Arizona State is set to lose a good chunk of its starting 22 to graduation or the NFL, and the Sun Devils are expected to have significant work to do in the portal to rebuild. Leavitt would be a big part of that 2026 effort. He'd also be expensive. The salary for a quarterback of Leavitt's caliber will be $3 million-plus next season. Arizona State as an athletic department isn't spending the full rev share allotment this year ($18 million versus around $20.5) and the Sun Devils would be bidding against schools who have both the full rev share and significant resources via name, image and likeness dollars beyond the rev share cap to offer Leavitt. \nThe sheer math of the situation may make it hard for Arizona State to retain Leavitt if it got into a bidding war. And even if it kept him, it might prevent the Sun Devils from building a quality roster beyond QB1. All of that said, Leavitt hasn't made a final decision on his future, nor has the Sun Devil staff been informed of his impending departure. Leavitt's brother, Dallin, aggressively shot down a report that Sam was leaving, stating that he is \"still deciding what to do.\" CBS Sports reached out to Dallin, a former NFL player who helps with his brother's process, and he referred to his post on his Instagram story.  Leavitt is just one of thousands of college football athletes currently weighing their future as the season comes to and end and the Jan. 2 to 16 transfer portal window looms. Negotiations are happening between players and schools, and agents are actively testing the market for their players. \nIt's happening with Leavitt. It's happening with many others as well. If Leavitt were to enter the portal, he would have a robust market interested in him. Some of the schools this school that will likely enter the quarterback market this cycle include Indiana, LSU, Miami and Texas Tech. Leavitt, if he were to leave, would be of interest to almost any program that needs a QB1.As for the rest of the season, the Sun Devils remain in the Big 12 mix, and the portal remains over a month-and-a-half away. Leavitt would be a big domino if he did jump. It just remains to be seen if that domino tips. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dallas Mavericks All-Star guard Kyrie Irving has been sidelined to start the season as he rehabs from the torn ACL he suffered in March. The Mavericks haven't given a definitive timeline on his return, though January has been floated before as a possibility. Irving has been seen during recent Dallas practices helping rookie Cooper Flagg work on his game, and he's reportedly \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery, according to ESPN's Marc Spears.Irving is rehabbing with the intention of returning some time this season, according to Spears, who said someone close to Irving told him the veteran guard could return right now if it were the playoffs. Spears listed late January or the All-Star break in mid-February as potential return windows for Irving, whose presence would provide a boost for with a 4-11 record through the first month of the season. Irving would especially make things easier for a Mavericks roster that is severely lacking in backcourt depth. But given where this team is right now, would Irving's return actually be detrimental to Dallas' big picture outlook for the rest of the season?Why the Mavericks should prioritize the 2026 NBA DraftThis isn't about taking minutes away from anyone. Let's be honest, the fewer minutes the Mavericks get from someone like D'Angelo Russell at this point, the better. The Mavericks aren't struggling to find enough minutes for everyone on this roster, instead they're starting Brandon Williams -- who,  as impressive as he's been, was just on a two-way contract a season ago. To this point, Williams has been the most reliable point guard on the team, and when Irving returns, Williams should become his backup.\nThe Mavericks need Irving out there, if for no other reason than to have someone who can organize the offense, not turn the ball over and draw attention from the defense to make life easier for the likes of Anthony Davis and Flagg. Beyond that, pairing Flagg with an elite guard will only make him better and ease some of the pressure that's persisted for the No. 1 pick in the first month of the season.\n        \n            \n                Tearing down the Mavericks: Finding a trade for every player who can legally move (except Cooper Flagg)\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut Irving's return also means the Mavericks could contend for a play-in spot at the very least, something they really shouldn't be doing. Now that Nico Harrison has been given the boot just nine months after trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, there's no need to play out this foolish plan to compete for a playoff spot -- especially when the 2026 draft class is expected to have some of the best prospects in recent memory. It's a draft class that should make several teams want to bottom out with the hopes of improving their chances at landing a top pick. And the Mavericks should be one of those teams that has a one-way ticket on the tank express. But Irving's return may result in winning too many games to give them a legitimate shot at landing a top three pick. Given that the Mavericks don't control any of their own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030, prioritizing the 2026 draft should be the goal.\nIt's time for Mavericks to build around Cooper FlaggIt will be a difficult line for the Mavericks to tow when Irving returns. Assuming Davis also returns in the near future from a calf strain, Dallas will have a healthy roster that is capable of being far more competitive than it has been to open the season. That would have been good news a month ago when Harrison was still in charge, but he's not, and Dallas doesn't have to force this fake championship window Harrison deluded himself into. Now it's about building around Flagg for the long-term future, and the first step in doing so is ensuring they're able to land as high of a draft pick as possible in 2026.There's already been talk of the Mavericks exploring the trade market for Davis, but they should also be doing the same for Irving after he returns. If he returns in mid-to-late January, and is operating at the levels he was prior to the ACL tear, it'll build up enough of a trade market to generate some interest from rival front offices before the Feb. 6 trade deadline. \nThe Mavericks have to untangle the mess Harrison got them in, which means recouping assets that they've lost. The only way to do that is through trades. Between now and the trade deadline, the only player who should be off limits is Flagg. And if it means getting closer to a top draft pick next summer, the Mavericks have to consider trading Irving.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James has spent the better part of two decades playing Atlas for franchises that would collapse without him to keep them aloft. He's also spent a good chunk of that time making it clear he was ready for that to change. Heck, that was what motivated him to ditch the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in the first place. As far back as 2017, he talked about handing the Cavaliers over to Kyrie Irving. That was eight All-NBA selections ago. The Lakers made a point of supporting him with ball-handling from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles and, when that wasn't enough, he pushed for the disastrous Russell Westbrook trade. The moves kept failing. James kept playing Superman.In fairness, it's all he's ever really done in the NBA, save perhaps the brief moments of overlap with a healthy, peak Dwyane Wade in Miami and the best of Irving in Cleveland. James has talked a big game about sharing the workload, but when the games actually start, 20 years of habits kick in and he tends to control everything. And hey, he's LeBron James. Who's gonna stop him? Even after the Lakers acquired Luka Dončić last February, there was a push and pull between the two. Dončić led the team in shots and usage, but at lower clips than he'd posted since his rookie season. James deferred for most of the game, but cranked his usage and shot attempts back up above Luka's by a meaningful margin in fourth quarters in both the regular season and their first-round loss to Minnesota. Dončić joined James' team on the fly in the middle of a season. The torch never fully passed.If there is a silver lining to James' absence thus far this season, it's that it has allowed the Lakers to find themselves without that question hanging over their heads. Dončić is settled and playing like an MVP, but just about everyone else is thriving as well. Austin Reaves is trending towards his first All-Star appearance. Rui Hachimura is having a career year and Deandre Ayton is having the bounce-back season the Lakers needed. For so long, James played on teams that needed him to do everything. Now, he's on a team that, at least thus far, really hasn't needed much of anything. He's getting what he's wanted for so long. He's also entering a situation he's never really played in before.Sciatica has kept him out the entire season so far, but James is aiming to make his season debut Tuesday night vs. the Jazz. His injury may prove helpful in that respect. He'll be reintegrated somewhat slowly. He said himself after his first practice with the Lakers this season that his lungs feel like a newborn baby's and that he'll need to get his wind back with real minutes over time. A couple of games with somewhat limited minutes will go a long way towards figuring out where exactly he fits onto this new team. It certainly helps that the Lakers have reached the cupcake portion of their schedule. Between now and the stretch in mid-December in which their games are currently unscheduled due to the NBA Cup, they'll play the Jazz twice, the Clippers, the Mavericks, the Pelicans, the Suns, the Raptors and the Celtics. They'll be favored in all of those games as long as they're reasonably healthy. They can afford to get a bit experimental.James will never be a role player. He's too good for that, team needs aside. But there's a balance here the Lakers should strive for. They don't need him to average 25 points per game. Something like 18-20 will more than suffice, with the hope that most of them come within the flow of the offense so as not to disturb the rhythm Dončić and Reaves especially have developed.\nGetting there should be relatively simple. More and more of James' points have come in transition in recent years, not because he's getting out and running more often, but because he's been more aggressive about finding his own, easier shots there while setting up teammates in the half-court, where creating his own looks is more taxing. He's become a far more eager catch-and-shoot gunner over the past few years as well. In Cleveland, he peaked at 1.6 catch-and-shoot 3s per game. With the Lakers, he's gotten as high as 3.5, a figure the current team would love for him to match or exceed, as they're taking the fewest catch-and-shoot 3s in the NBA by a wide margin so far this season. James, to his credit, recognized this as a key area coming into the season.\"I spent a lot of time on my catch-and-shoot 3-pointers,\" James said at media day in October. \" ... Understanding how can I make the most of when I don't have the ball, either moving into space. Obviously, Luka and AR [Austin Reaves] going to do a lot of time handling the ball. …We have a lot of guys that can handle the ball, so how can I still be effective on a team where I don't have to handle the ball as much?\"\nThat quote notably came before the extent of his injury was known. Dončić didn't have to assert his place as team alpha on the court. James was seemingly prepared to willingly cede it and his return to action will be our first glimpse into what his newfound role as a supporting player really means for him. It's probably going to be bumpy. There will be hiccups as the Lakers figure out how to reintegrate one of the most ball-dominant players of all time. But he's also among history's most versatile stars. By skill set, he's equipped to do whatever the Lakers need. Mindset and circumstance were always going to be the barometers here. His return will be our first glimpse into how he's going to handle this. It's something he's said he's wanted for quite some time and now the Lakers need him to embrace it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is underway, and that means the rumor mill is in full operation. Below, CBS Sports has gathered Tuesday's most interesting moves and rumors in one convenient spot.Blue Jays considered favorites to land TuckerThe Blue Jays, fresh off an American League pennant, are considered by other front offices to be the favorites to land Kyle Tucker, per ESPN. Naturally, given that Tucker is the best available free agent, there are plenty of other teams in the running here in the early going.\nThe Dodgers, the club that defeated the Blue Jays in the World Series, are expected to have interest if Tucker is open to a short-term arrangement. The Phillies, Giants, Orioles, Yankees, and Mets are also potential landing spots, depending on how the market develops over the coming weeks.One team not expected to be involved in the Tucker sweepstakes: the Cubs. Chicago acquired Tucker in a trade last winter with the Astros, but does not appear to have serious interest in retaining him.\n\n        \n            \n                Kyle Tucker free agency: Pros and cons, contract prediction, landing spots and more for star outfielder\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYankees still want Bellinger backIn Yankees outfield news, center fielder Trent Grisham accepted the qualifying offer at Tuesday's deadline. With him back in the fold, it might look like the Yankees don't need free-agent Cody Bellinger back. There's Aaron Judge in right field, obviously, Grisham in center, Jasson Domínguez in left, Giancarlo Stanton at DH and Ben Rice at first. Still, the Yankees \"plan to continue to pursue\" Bellinger, per MLB.com. Bellinger, 30, hit .272/.334/.480 (125 OPS+) with 25 doubles, five triples, 29 home runs, 98 RBI, 89 runs and 5.1 WAR last season. There's certainly room for him on the Yankees. Domínguez still isn't a sure thing and Stanton is injury-prone. Domínguez could be the fourth outfielder in this case.Imai postedRight-hander Tatsuya Imai's negotiating window will open on Wednesday after he was posted by the Saitama Seibu Lions of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league, according to multiple reports. Imai will then have until Jan. 2 to reach an agreement.\nCBS Sports recently ranked Imai as the 12th-best free agent available this winter:Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.The Lions will receive a fee based on Imai's total contract worth. Pirates intend to spendThe Pirates will attempt to buttress a roster built around ace Paul Skenes this winter, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Passan reports that the Pirates were willing to sign first baseman Josh Naylor for more than twice the franchise's previous record free-agent deal (currently $39 million) before he opted to return to the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million contract. Pittsburgh is known to have interest in DH Kyle Schwarber, among others. Passan also notes that the Pirates are toying with the idea of allowing top prospect Konnor Griffin to compete for the starting shortstop job next spring. There are complicating matters at play however, including another looming work stoppage ahead of the 2027 season. Here's more on Pittsburgh's thinking: \nThe decision is complicated. The last teenage position player to debut in the big leagues was Juan Soto in 2018. A talent of Griffin's caliber shouldn't be rushed because a team wants to win now. And the concerns over the new basic agreement are particularly acute for a team such as Pittsburgh: If the doomsday scenario occurs and 2027 is lost, players will recoup lost service time, and with the potential for players to negotiate a shorter window to reach free agency, the Pirates don't want to start Griffin's clock early only for the rules to whipsaw and punish them for it.Griffin, 19, hit .333/.415/.527 across three levels, finishing the year with a 21-game stint in Double-A. Phillies facing steep competition on SchwarberThe Phillies would like to reunite with DH Kyle Schwarber, one of the top five free agents in the class, but accomplishing that objective will mean outmaneuvering a slew of other interested parties. There's an immense demand for Schwarber in part because of his production at the plate and in part because his age and positional concerns will limit his contractual term, according to ESPN.\nESPN lists a slew of teams as having some degree of interest, ranging from the expected highrollers -- Phillies, Red Sox, Mets, and Blue Jays -- to the Pirates, who, as noted above, pursued Naylor before he re-upped with the Mariners.\nSchwarber, 33 come March, has hit .228/.358/.508 (135 OPS+) with 47 home runs on average over the last three seasons. Rangers have discussed Garcia, Heim in tradesThe Rangers have engaged in trade talks concerning outfielder Adolis García and catcher Jonah Heim, according to MLB Network's Jon Morosi. That should come as no surprise: García is coming off a down year and is embarking on his final season of team control. Heim, meanwhile, appears to be a potential non-tender candidate. As CBS Sports wrote earlier this week:Heim's inclusion seems silly only if you haven't updated your priors since the Rangers won the World Series. In the two seasons since, he's been a well-below-average hitter offering diminishing defensive returns. The Rangers have publicly asserted they intend to trim payroll. Heim's price tag wouldn't stand out otherwise, but the Rangers can surely find Kyle Higashioka a new dance partner for less than $6 million. Morosi notes that no deal is believed to be close. \nMets shopping Nimmo, other position playersThe Mets are willing to deal from their surplus of hitters, and that includes being open to moving either utility player Jeff McNeil or outfielder Brandon Nimmo, per ESPN. Youngsters Luisangel Acuña, Mark Vientos, and Brett Baty -- all perpetually on the trade block -- are out there, too.\nNimmo, 33 come March, is a relatively new addition to the rumor mill. It's unclear if the Mets will be able to find a suitor, however, given his advanced age and contract. Not only is Nimmo signed for five more years (at more than $20 million per pop), but he also has a no-trade clause. In other words, he would have to consent to any trade, making the Mets' quest for a deal all the trickier. Last week, the New York Post reported the Mets have internally contemplated how much money they'd need to include to facilitate a Nimmo trade.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's deadline for players to accept the qualifying offer passed on Tuesday afternoon. With it, four players accepted a one-year tender worth $22.205 million to return to their 2025 teams: right-handed pitcher Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), lefty Shota Imanaga (Cubs), infielder Gleyber Torres (Tigers), and outfielder Trent Grisham (Yankees). The other nine players, including Kyle Tucker, Bo Bichette and Framber Valdez, will remain free agents and will now allow their former team to gain draft-pick compensation if they sign elsewhere. For the Yankees, getting Grisham back to play center field and possibly hit leadoff in front of Aaron Judge again is nice. They have Ben Rice at first base, Giancarlo Stanton at DH and Jasson Domínguez is slotted for left field. This likely means either that there isn't a place for the return of free agent Cody Bellinger or the Yankees would have to do some reshuffling if he is brought back. Could that mean a Domínguez trade?As for the Cubs, Imanaga rejoins a rotation that includes Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton and Jameson Taillon along with depth options Colin Rea and Javier Assad, not to mention the return of Justin Steele from Tommy John surgery at some point. The Cubs are likely still looking for a frontline starter, but there's plenty of depth here, to the point that it's possible someone from the group is traded.\nWoodruff, meanwhile, will become the highest-paid Brewers pitcher in a single season in franchise history. Free agents have to meet certain criteria to be eligible for the qualifying offer (QO). Players can only receive the QO once in their career and they must have spent the preceding season with only one team -- that means anyone traded in-season is ineligible. The value of the QO isn't random: it's the average of the top 125 salaries for a given year. This winter, that means it's $22.205 million.\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

That's true of both the team signing and losing the free agent.\nEntering this offseason, just 14 of the 144 players to receive the QO accepted it.

For the season, Travis Etienne has scored 142.9 PPR Fantasy points, good for RB12 on the season. Neither has a difficult matchup. Which probably makes it seem strange that they are two of the most difficult backs for me to rank in Week 12. It's because of the other backs in the backfield.We are expecting Rhamondre Stevenson to return from his toe injury in Week 12. In the first nine weeks of the season, when Stevenson was healthy, Henderson had just a 25%share of the team's rush attempts. It would be tempting to believe that Henderson has proven he is so much better that Stevenson will take a back seat now. But I thought Henderson was clearly the best back three months ago, and that didn't seem to matter until Stevenson got hurt. For now, I am projecting close to a 50/50 split, which makes Henderson a high-upside RB2 who ranks just outside of my top 20. Dave and Jamey have more faith in Vrabel than I do, ranking Henderson inside the top 13 at running back this week.Etienne has pretty much been the lead back all year, but it looked like that was maybe changing early in Week 11. At halftime, Tuten had a 47.1% rush share and Etienne had a 35.3% share. Tuten also scored the team's first touchdown and was more efficient in the game. Tuten left with an ankle injury, and Etienne had a solid second half, but we are expecting Tuten to play this week and have little reason to feel confident that Etienne will lead the team in rushing. I have both Jaguars backs ranked around RB24, with Etienne just ahead of Tuten.At this point in the season, you may not have much choice but to just start Henderson or Etienne. But running back does look like the one position this week you may have options. I have 30 backs projected to score double-digit PPR Fantasy points this week, including multiple guys on the waiver wire. Check out that section below before you make your waiver claims.Now let's get to the rest of the Week 12 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 12 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            46.4% -- Bhayshul Tuten and Travis Etienne both played 46.4% of the snaps in the first half of Week 11.81.8% -- Chase Brown played 81.8% of the offensive snaps in Week 11. He's back to must-start status even in a bad matchup against the Patriots.19 -- Kenneth Walker had 19 touches last week, his second-highest total of the season. Head Coach Mike MacDonald said Walker is earning more opportunities.50% -- Amongst qualified running backs, Kareem Hunt's 50% success rate ranks second only to James Cook.15 -- Chris Rodriguez had a career-high 15 rush attempts against the Dolphins. He could be a borderline RB2 after their Week 12 bye.3.99 -- TreVeyon Henderson's 3.99 yards after contact per rush attempt is second only to Jonathan Taylor. Rhamondre Stevenson ranks 32nd at 2.89.35 -- Woody Marks has 35 touches over the past two weeks. He has another great matchup on Thursday against Buffalo, hopefully, he takes advantage of it.14.5% -- Kenneth Gainwell has a 14.5% target share this year, fifth amongst running backs. He is a smash start if Jaylen Warren misses Week 12.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n

this week. But you may need to take that risk in Week 12. As of Tuesday, we are not expecting Josh Jacobs to play this week, which would make Emanuel Wilson a must-start running back. Wilson has had double-digit touches in two games this year and has scored 11 Fantasy points in both. In Week 12, he could see 15-20 touches against the Vikings. Minnesota's defense doesn't provide an easy matchup, but it's not one to avoid either. Maybe more importantly, their offense has been so meek that you should expect the Packers to be run-heavy against them.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PIT\n                    \n                         \n                        Pittsburgh\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CHI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -2.5\n                                    O/U 45.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                43%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    244\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    204\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Gainwell's situation is even dicier than Emanuel Wilson's. Head Coach Mike Tomlin is optimistic that Jaylen Warren could play this week, but doesn't expect Warren to do much early in the week. That means you probably won't know when you make your waiver claim. The last game Warren missed, Gainwell had 25 touches for 134 yards and two touchdowns. That means you have to at least put in a claim, but with Warren potentially back, you may not want to bid much.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #33\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    JAC -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                24th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                48%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    238\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    61\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Tuten looked fantastic before he left Week 11 with an injury, and the opportunities indicate that the coaches noticed.

I would not be surprised if this is close to a 50/50 split in Week 12.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #20\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        JAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    JAC -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                50%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    181\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Emari Demercado has a high ankle sprain, and Trey Benson, as of Tuesday, is still on Injured Reserve. That could mean that Knight and Michael Carter are the top two backs for Arizona in Week 12. Knight should be the leading rusher and should certainly be the goalline back. He also has four targets in three of his last four games. View him as a high-end flex this week.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAR -6.5\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                3rd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                48%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    235\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                For the second time in two years, Sean Tucker had a monster one-game performance. If Bucky Irving comes back this week, it may be another case of Tucker disappearing as soon as you add him to your Fantasy roster. Last year, after his 192-yard performance, he didn't have one game the rest of the year with double-digit touches. Then again, we have been waiting a long time for Irving to return, and there is no guarantee he does so in Week 12. Proceed with caution.\n            \n            \n\nStashes (RB Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #36\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    WAS -2.5\n                                    O/U 46.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                5th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                18%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    279\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Rodriguez is on bye this week, but he pretty clearly looks like the lead back in Washington and could be a high-end flex in the Fantasy playoffs. With all the other options available on the waiver wire, he may be close to free this week.

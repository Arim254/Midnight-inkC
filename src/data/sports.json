The main card begins at 9 p.m. ET and will stream on Paramount+, with Qudos Bank Arena playing host. Many UFC 325 bets will center on the main event of Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2, which is a featherweight championship rematch. Reigning two-time champion Alexander Volkanovski (27-4) will look for another victory over challenger, Diego Lopes (27-7), after the former prevailed via decision at UFC 314 last April.The latest UFC 325 odds have Volkanovski as the -148 favorite (risk $148 to win $100) as the Aussie will have the backing of the home crowd. Lopes, the No. 2 ranked featherweight, comes in at +124 (risk $100 to win $124). The co-main event is a lightweight battle between No. 6 Dan Hooker (+295) and No. 8 Benoit Saint-Denis (-375).

He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards.

This is a modest edge on the favorite, but playable at this price.

In the co-main event, Benoit Saint-Denis put a hurting on veteran Dan Hooker in a second-round stoppage before calling out the elite of the division. Here's a look at the biggest takeaways from an exciting night of action inside Qudos Bank Arena at UFC 325. 1. Death, taxes and Alexander Volkanovski on top of the featherweight divisionEven though the 37-year-old Volkanovski wouldn't cop to it himself during fight week out of respect for Aldo, whom he defeated in 2019, we can all say it for him: \"Alexander the Great\" is the best featherweight in MMA history. Volkanovski is 18-1 at 145 pounds throughout his 14-year pro career (including a mark of 13-1 in the UFC), with his only blemish being a second-round knockout loss to current lightweight champion Ilia Topuria in 2024. And not only did Volkanovski regain the vacant UFC title following the setback, he defended once more in his rematch with Lopes on Saturday that somehow looked even easier than the five-round decision he claimed nine months ago. Volkanovski took a knee on a flash knockdown in Round 3 but outside of that, it was lights out as the Australian met Lopes' pressure with clean boxing, a stiff jab and constant footwork patterns that never allowed his Brazilian foe to get into a rhythm. The fact that Volkanovski still appears to be at the top of his game this far into his 30s in a smaller weight division in which speed is prioritized is remarkable. A true living legend of the Octagon, who owns three career wins over Max Holloway, it wouldn't be out of bounds to suggest that Volkanovski is a top 15 fighter in the history of the sport. And even though some difficult style matchups remain should he choose to stay active and continue his title, it would be hard to imagine Volkanovski not being favored from a betting standpoint against the likes of Movsar Evloev, Lerone Murphy, Jean Silva or Aljamain Sterling.\n2. The lightweight division is reshuffling the deck at a rapid rateEven with 37-year-old Justin Gaethje turning back time last Saturday at UFC 324 to claim the interim title for the second time in an exciting win over Paddy Pimblett, the lightweight division has seen many of its all-action heroes retire or enter their twilight in recent years, from Dustin Poirier and Michael Chandler to Charles Oliveira and even Conor McGregor. But a new breed of 155-pound fighters are on the rise, as evidenced by Ilia Topuria's championship win last year and the rise of top contender Arman Tsarukyan. Three more lightweights scored breakthrough wins on Saturday's main card to move closer to title contention; Benoit Saint Denis, Mauricio Ruffy and newcomer Quillan Sallkilld. Saint Denis improved to 4-0 with four stoppage wins since he suffered a pair of devastating losses in 2024 and suddenly looks like a legit title contender following a violent second-round TKO win over a brave Dan Hooker. BSD took some damage at times but was able to take the fight to the ground and suffocate Hooker when it mattered most. Ruffy, meanwhile, bounced back from a humbling submission loss to Saint Denis last September by switching camps and continents to deliver an impressive second-round stoppage of Rafael Fiziev to likely catapult himself back into the top 10. But it was Sallkilld who very much looked like the long-term future of the division when the 26-year-old improved to 4-0 in the UFC since making his debut one year ago by submitting Jamie Mullarkey with relative ease.\n3. There are no excuses left for Tai TuivasaEntering the fight riding a five-fight losing streak (including four by stoppage) and an 18-month layoff to heal himself mentally and physically, Tuivasa's Sydney homecoming turned out to be an absolute disaster. Even though he nearly rallied for a dramatic stoppage win in Round 3 against an opponent, Tallison Teixeira, who had never fought past the first round in 12 career pro fights, Tuivasa's lack of cardio after so much time away was embarrassing. Claiming he undertook the layoff to heal himself both mentally and physically, Tuivasa somehow looked in worse physical shape than he did amid the losing skid and clearly hadn't improved on his lack of a ground game as the 6-foot-8 Teixeira, who isn't known as a ground specialist, largely relied on takedowns and top pressure to win the first two rounds. The only fighters in UFC history to stay employed following losing skids of at least six consecutive fights are BJ Penn, Tony Ferguson and Sam Alvey. Given that Tuivasa is a fan favorite who competes in an exciting style and is still just 32 in a division that ages slower than the rest, he just might get another opportunity inside the Octagon. The real question is, however, how much pride does Tuivasa have left to try and save his career? It's now or never. \n            ",

Dan Hooker is no stranger to tough fights, but he melted under the sustained pressure that Saint Denis brought at UFC 325.Saint Denis' evolution was a talking point heading into Saturday's event. Old habits die hard, however, as his technical advancements sometimes took a backseat to his aggressive instincts. Hooker offered serious resistance early with body kicks that visibly hurt Saint Denis. Ultimately, Saint Denis' relentlessness forced critical errors from \"The Hangman.\"\"I had to resort to old Saint Denis,\" the Frenchman said in Saturday's post-fight interview. \"Seek and destroy shit.\"Follow live updates on UFC 325: Alexander Volkanovski vs. Diego Lopes as event debuts on Paramount+\nHooker worked hard to negate Saint Denis' wrestling by hunting guillotine chokes and not settling for bottom position. Amid the chaos, Hooker mistakenly pursued his own takedown. Saint Denis landed in a terribly advantageous position. Saint Denis, from the beginning stages of a mounted triangle, trapped Hooker's arm and reigned down elbows. Hooker eventually freed his arm, only to fend off a tight arm triangle choke. Through grit and a narrow airway, Hooker survived the submission attempt. Saint Denis abandoned what little caution he exercised in the fight, posturing up and throwing an elbow barrage that busted Hooker open. Referee Herb Dean gave Hooker every chance to escape, but the veteran lightweight only managed to cover up. The fight was ruled a TKO victory for Saint Denis at 4:45 of Round 2. \nPost-fight, Saint Denis demanded either a lightweight or BMF title shot. Saint Denis called out Ilia Topuria, Justin Gaethje, Max Holloway and Charles Oliveira by name, but also had one other fighter in mind.\n\"Arman Tsarukyan, you say you're the No. 1 contender? I'm here to take your f---ing spot.\"\n            \n    ",

What he sometimes lacked was elite composure. At UFC 325, Ruffy showed off the championship composure that comes from training with UFC featherweight champ Alexander Volkanovski. Ruffy collided with fellow striker Rafael Fizev on Saturday. It was a pivotal fight for Ruffy, who was coming off his first UFC loss against Benoit Saint Denis. Ruffy's demise in that fight was his urgency to force a memorable finish. Against Fiziev, he took his time. Fiziev looked good earlier, pressuring Ruffy to the fence and lighting him up with kicks. Ruffy started refreshingly slow and found his groove towards the end of Round 1. Follow live updates on UFC 325: Alexander Volkanovski vs. Diego Lopes as event debuts on Paramount+That slow escalation served him well. Ruffy started taking control of the fight in the second frame. In the last minute, he blasted Fiziev with an ultra-precise right cross. The punch sounded like a baseball bat, putting Fiziev in immediate trouble. Fiziev barely survived the initial onslaught of strikes, but fell over immediately after getting to his feet.

Saint Denis battered Hooker after securing a takedown in the second round before the referee finally waved the fight off. Plus, Mauricio Ruffy bounced back from a defeat against Saint Denis to score a knockout of his own against Rafael Fiziev in a featured bout. Both men could find themselves in interesting matchups next as they jockey for position in the title race.\nCBS Sports was with you all week long with the latest news, features and other content around this massive event.

Ortega announced on Instagram that a series of injuries has forced him to take time to recover, as well as receive physical therapy.  The fight with Moicano was to be Ortega's lightweight debut, a move he has been planning for more than a year. Now, that move will need to wait until later in 2026.\"Obviously, the news is coming out that no longer am I fighting March 7 in Vegas,\" Ortega said in an Instagram story. \"I'm OK. Health is good. No surgeries, nothing crazy like that, but I do need to take a little bit, some time off to nurse these injuries that I have right now. It just sucks. It's not crazy like where I need to have surgery, but I have to rest it and let it heal and chill and do some physical therapy. I'm going to be on that mission. That's it.\"But it's just a little bit delayed. Nothing crazy. I'm still planning on fighting twice this year. Look out.\"Ortega holds a submission win over Moicano, though that victory came at UFC 217 in July 2017.\nLengthy stints on the sidelines have plagued Ortega's career over the past decade. He previously was out of action from December 2018 to October 2020, and again from July 2022 to February 2024.The move to lightweight came after a 2-5 stretch at featherweight beginning in December 2018. Over that stretch, Ortega came up short in featherweight title bids against Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski, with both bouts receiving Fight of the Night honors.Ortega has also badly struggled to make the featherweight limit in recent years. He had to withdraw from a UFC 303 bout with Diego Lopes the day of the fight after missing weight, and then experienced complications cutting weight for his most recent fight, a loss to Aljamain Sterling, which had to be contested at a 153-pound catchweight. Ortega claimed he passed out for an extended period of time during the weight cut for the Sterling fight.\nUFC 326 takes place March 7 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The card is headlined by a BMF title bout between current ceremonial titleholder Max Holloway and challenger Charles Oliveira.\n            \n    ",

But an honest Lopes, who still managed to drop Volkanovski, admitted after the fight that he failed to follow his corner's gameplan and got caught simply following his opponent around in hopes of a knockout. Expect a more seasoned and more dangerous Lopes in the rematch. Not only did he rely on grappling and the traps he set with striking to ultimately finish Jean Silva last September, he has been working relentlessly on rounding out his game. If Lopes does a better job cutting off the cage and using both his size and the threat of the takedown to make the 37-year-old Volkanovski feel his age, this should be a very different fight. And while Volkanovski's chin did hold up during their first fight despite having been fresh off of back-to-back knockout losses, his time at the top may be running out. Lopes via TKO3\nBrookhouse: It's hard to believe that this fight plays out much differently than the first fight unless Volkanovski has aged considerably in the past year. Yes, 37 is old for a fighter, especially a featherweight, but Volkanovski is a uniquely skilled tactician in his ability to not only prepare, but execute a gameplan. I don't see any reason to think that losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria signal a fighter is \"done\" at an elite level, simply that he ran into two of the best fighters on the planet in their prime. Lopes doesn't have a reliable takedown game, which means that this is a striking battle, and Volkanovski is great at working angles and finding timing. Yes, Lopes did hurt Volkanovski in the first fight, but that came in between Volkanovski clearly controlling the rest of the action. I simply don't believe that Lopes can out-gameplan and outexecute Volkanovski. Volkanovski via UDMahjouri: If this fight were a year from now, I'd pick Lopes in a heartbeat. The challenger has every physical advantage over the champ: height, reach, durability, and power. Lopes' inexperience cost him the first fight. Volkanovski showcased why he's a featherweight GOAT. He controlled the lead outside foot positioning, feinted brilliantly, and significantly outstruck Lopes. The champ pitched a near-perfect game, yet still gave up one or two rounds to Lopes' power. That's the worry here. Lopes' physical gifts will become a bigger factor as he narrows the technical gaps. The question is whether Lopes can cover enough distance in nine months to beat Volkanovski. It will be a much closer second fight, but Volkanovski should have enough in the tank to win a narrow decision. Volkanovski via UDMormile: Volkanovski UDWise: Volkanovski via UDDan Hooker vs. Benoit Saint Denis predictionsCampbell: Reformed following a pair of TKO defeats, Saint Denis has looked like a completely different fighter in three walks to the Octagon under the tutelage of new coach Nicholas Ott, which produced a trio of stoppage wins in 2025. The task at hand against Hooker on Saturday will be for 'BSD' to ignore the urge to throw caution to the wind off the start and get into a full-blown slugfest. Saint Denis is at his best when he balances patience and grappling with the threat of his powerful striking. And considering Hooker was finished in less than two rounds by Arman Tsarukyan just two months ago, this could be the perfect catapult for the French \"God of War\" to score a systematic stoppage victory and enter the top five at 155 pounds. Hooker is always game for battle, but his one-dimensional style has caught up with him on the elite level. Saint Denis via KO2\nBrookhouse: As long as Saint Denis remains solid in his approach and doesn't willingly engage in a brawl, this is his fight to lose. Hooker is a fighter who leaves a lot of defensive openings in his wide-open attacking style. Saint Denis has the ability to hurt Hooker on the feet in those exchanges, but would be well served to look to grapple and put Hooker on the floor. If Saint Denis can work from on top, he can damage Hooker with strikes to eventually set up a submission. Saint Denis via SUB2Mahjouri: Hooker has no designs on changing his style. He's hell-bent on action, and it'll cost him against on Saturday. Neither man has perfect durability, but Hooker has more wear and tear. That's concerning against Saint Denis, the younger and arguably more powerful fighter. Saint Denis looks revitalized working with top middleweight contender Nassourine Imavov. The French special forces soldier has the natural gifts and evolving skillset to make short work of Hooker. It's imperative, however, that he doesn't abandon his defense. Hooker can still crack and will catch Saint Denis if he's not careful. Saint Denis via KO2Mormile: Saint Denis via submissionWise: Saint Denis via TKO3Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy predictionsCampbell: Urgency is the name of the game in this top 15 matchup at lightweight as both fighters can desperately use a big win to further propel themselves back into contention. Ruffy, who suffered a humbling submission defeat at the hands of Saint Denis last September in a fight that exposed his lack of a grappling game, moved from the Fighting Nerds camp in Brazil to train with Volkanovski in Australia. Fiziev, meanwhile, who snapped a three-fight losing skid last June when he took a decision from Ignacio Bahamondes, is finally healthy and looking to put a pair of decision defeats to new interim champion Justin Gaethje behind him. That means this fight has all the potential to be a fun striking match over three rounds and one that is very evenly contested. If Ruffy can add the threat of wrestling, it could be the difference. Ruffy via UD\nBrookhouse: If anyone can add wrestling threats to this fight, it's Fiziev. Ruffy has never scored a takedown in the UFC and he was taken down three times while being dominated by Saint Denis. Fiziev, meanwhile, has scored six takedowns in his two most recent fights, including two against Justin Gaethje. In a fairly even battle of strikers, though Ruffy may be a bit more dynamic in his angles and shot selection, one fighter having the edge in grappling is enough to tilt the fight on paper. While either man could catch the other on the feet, Fiziev's new confidence in his wrestling gives me some comfort in siding with him. Fiziev via UDMahjouri: This might be an even more compelling action fight than the co-main event. Fiziev and Ruffy are on the cusp of entering the lightweight elite. Fiziev is a first-class Muay Thai striker with an improving wrestling game. Ruffy, a textbook KO artist, recently migrated from the Fighting Nerds to featherweight champ Volkanovski's camp. I was prepared to count Fiziev out, but I think he's a victim of bad luck. His three UFC losses are a majority decision to Justin Gaethje, a freak knee injury against Mateusz Gamrot and a close rematch against Gaethje, which he took on two weeks' notice after a year-and-a-half layoff from the aforementioned injury. Fiziev showed signs of life in a bounce-back win against Ignacio Bahamondes, complementing his striking with newfound wrestling. Ruffy might revolutionize himself with Team Volkanovski, but I'll need to see the results before assessing his future.

    "body": "\n        Kentucky went into Bud Walton Arena on Saturday and left with an 85-77 upset victory vs. No. 15 Arkansas. The Wildcats' win over former coach John Calipari was not only symbolic, but also marked their best win of the season. Kentucky (15-7, 6-3 SEC) entered the weekend 3-6 against Quad 1 opponents, and this victory over the Razorbacks (16-6, 6-3)   could be exactly what Mark Pope's team needed to get back on track for good.Entering the game, Pope and Calipari had identical 38-19 records since taking over their respective programs last season. To draw even more parallels, Arkansas' upset win over Kentucky last year on the road got Calipari's team back on track after a disappointing start.\nA year ago, the Razorbacks started 1-6 against SEC competition before going 7-5 the remainder of the regular season/SEC Tournament to punch their ticket to the NCAA Tournament. Kentucky still has its flaws and the injuries could ultimately derail a deep run in March, but getting its first win over Calipari since his high-profile exit is one of the most important wins Pope will have coaching his alma mater.Although the start to the SEC play hasn't been as dire for Kentucky, this is the kind of win that could turn things around. Kentucky is somehow just 1.5 games back of Texas A&M for first place in the conference heading into February. Before UK suffered a 25-point loss earlier this week against Vanderbilt, Pope's squad had won five consecutive games against SEC opponents.\nAs Kentucky star Otega Oweh put it, this game was \"personal\" for his team.\"It was definitely personal,\" Oweh told the ESPN broadcast. \"More the fact that the last time we played, the last time we had, we didn't do a good job of representing Kentucky. We had to sit with that for a couple of days. We were eager to get back out there.\"Oweh steps up for KentuckyIt's no secret that the Preseason SEC Player of the Year didn't start the season strong. However, since conference play began, Oweh has been the steady scoring presence that Kentucky needs. He has recorded at least 20 points in seven of Kentucky's nine conference games, including a 24-point outburst against Arkansas. Those 24 points marked a season high for Oweh, less than a week after scoring 23 points in a win over Ole Miss. His resurgence also comes at a time when star guard Jaland Lowe has already been ruled out for the season, and big man Jayden Quaintance -- Kentucky's best NBA Draft prospect on the roster -- is without a timeline to return. The best version of Kentucky down the stretch will involve Oweh playing like this.\nOweh shot 9 of 12 from the floor and added eight rebounds and three assists. Although he missed his lone 3-point attempt, his team had one of its most efficient outings of the year. Kentucky shot 6 of 13 (46.2%) from beyond the arc, which marked the second-highest 3-point shooting percentage of the season.\nOne of the staples of what made Year 1 of Pope's tenure so successful was Oweh's breakout and how well his team shot from beyond the arc. Last season, Kentucky shot 37.5% from the 3-point line as a team, which ranked No. 24 in Division I. This season has been a different story, as Kentucky is shooting just 33.9% from the 3-point line. That number ranks in the middle of the pack (No. 185) for Division I teams.This game was déjà vu for multiple reasons. Kentucky was efficient from the 3-point line, Oweh looked like the player he was last season, and on top of that, Kentucky was able to flip the script after losing as a favorite at home last season against these Razorbacks.\nBracketology implicationsKentucky entered the day as a No. 7 seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections, while Arkansas was on the No. 5 line. The Wildcats now have three wins over ranked opponents (St. John's and Tennessee) after beating Arkansas. Notably, Kentucky has six games remaining against Quad 1 opponents for the remainder of the regular season. The Wildcats still have to play Tennessee, Florida (twice), Auburn, Texas A&M and Vanderbilt.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Snapshot: Key games worth monitoring this weekend\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere is still more work to be done for Kentucky to feel completely safe on Selection Sunday, but this is its best win of the season -- for many reasons and it's not close. Sure, Kentucky rallied from a 17-point deficit against Tennessee on the road earlier this month, but getting a win over a top-15 opponent is a huge resume builder for the Wildcats.Acuff struggles early, but steps up in the second halfThe best NBA Draft prospect playing in this game, with Quaintance sidelined, was Arkansas' Darius Acuff Jr. The Razorbacks star guard struggled in the first half against Kentucky (five points, 2 of 10 from the floor), but came on strong during the final 20 minutes to help give his team the lead back midway through the second half.\nAcuff finished with 22 points and three assists. Acuff is the No. 13-ranked player in the CBS Sports NBA Draft prospect rankings. During Calipari's first season at Arkansas, he did not produce a first-round pick. The only player selected was Adou Thiero -- who previously played for Calipari at Kentucky -- in the second round. That snapped Calipari's streak of having at least one first-round pick for 17 consecutive years.The good (and bad news) for Calipari is that a new streak will be started this summer. Acuff is arguably the best point guard in this class. During SEC play, he has posted some efficient numbers while also producing a great turnover-to-assist ratio. Guards win games in March, and the best version of Arkansas will involve Acuff playing at the top level.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Shohei Ohtani will not pitch for Team Japan during the upcoming World Baseball Classic, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters (including the California Post) during Saturday's fanfest event. Roberts said Ohtani made the call and that the Dodgers would have supported him if he had chosen to pitch for Japan. (WBC pool play is slated to begin on March 4.)It's worth noting that Roberts' comments came shortly after Ohtani painted a different picture of his pitching status. Ohtani told reporters he remained undecided, reserving judgment until he begins ramping up over the coming weeks.Ohtani is still expected to suit up for Team Japan as a designated hitter, with Dodgers teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto slotting in as the staff ace.\n\"Wearing a Japanese uniform once again fills me with a deep sense of pride and responsibility,\" Yamamoto said in a Team Japan-issued statement. \"I've trained hard this offseason to be in the best possible condition for the WBC. Together, with great teammates and a dependable coaching staff, we'll unite as one and aim for the top.\"The Dodgers' other Japanese star, right-hander Roki Sasaki, was not named as part of Team Japan's roster. Sasaki had an uneven rookie season in MLB, including a prolonged absence due to injury. However, he did find success in a relief role during the playoffs.\nOhtani, 31, is coming off an eventful season that saw him hit .282/.392/.622 (179 OPS+) with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. He tallied 6.6 Wins Above Replacement as a hitter alone. He also made his return to the mound following elbow surgery. In 14 regular-season starts, he compiled a 2.87 ERA (145 ERA+) and a 6.89 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions as a pitcher were worth an estimated 1.1 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas vs. BYU was billed as a generational prospect duel between presumptive top 2026 NBA Draft picks Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa. Instead gave way to recurring plot lines that have defined each team's season. No. 14 Kansas, celebrating the 1,000th game at Allen Fieldhouse, emerged with a 90-82 victory over No. 13 BYU -- but it was far from a perfect night. The eye-popping Peterson was an unguardable phenomenon in the first half, looking every bit the No. 1 prospect, before sitting out most of the second half with leg cramps. Injuries and ailments have unfortunately been the story of Peterson's one and only season in Lawrence; Peterson has been splendid in the games he's played, but he's missed 10 games and long chunks of all 11 contests he's suited up for.BYU, meanwhile, was obliterated in the first half, but in part because of Peterson's absence, the Cougars again roared in the second half, like they did against UConn in November, against Clemson in December and at Arizona last Monday. Comeback attempts are compelling, but BYU is 1-3 in the games we just listed (only beating Clemson). Peterson and Dybantsa didn't have a chance to go blow-for-blow in crunch time, but lessons were still learned. Let's dive into the top takeaways.\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan uses big second-half rally to beat Michigan State for first time in Breslin Center since 2018\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas' depth is starting to round into formIf the basketball gods are kind and Peterson is allowed to ever play a full game, Kansas has the supporting cast in order to do some serious damage. Redshirt freshman Bryson Tiller has been outstanding and this was his best showing yet. The big, physical forward delivered 21 points, seven rebounds and a block to propel KU to its 16th victory of the season.It's been a bit of a rollercoaster for Tiller in conference play, but he's rounding into serious form. He's all of 6-foot-11, so Kansas' interior defense is a fortress when he's on the floor next to the lean, mean, shot-blocking machine that is Bidunga. But Tiller made BYU's defense pay for swarming the paint and leaving him open. He confidently splashed three triples after downright refusing to shoot 3-pointers for long stretches in January. That proved to be the difference in the game, and changes the complexion of this Kansas club in March.The Peterson-Tiller-Melvin Council-Tre White-Flory Bidunga  lineup has terrific positional size at all five spots with tons of talent. It gave BYU fits, and Good Tiller transforms Kansas into a terrifying March draw.\nWith the victory the Jayhawks are expected to move up from a No. 4 seed to a No. 3 seed when the CBS Sports Bracketology model is updated Sunday. BYU is expected to remain a No. 4 seed in the latest bracket projection.Council adds to his burgeoning Kansas loreNo transfer has changed the tenor of a team quite like Kansas' Council, the spindly guard from Rochester who last played at St. Bonaventure. The raucous student section barks at his beck and call. When Kansas was teetering without Peterson in the second half, it was Council who had an in-your-eyehole trey, a steal and a layup, and a late-game, pull-up jumper from the elbow to stem the tide once and for all.Council totaled 15 points, six rebounds, six dimes and just one turnover. Council is beloved by this program, and he's wrapped his arms around them just as tightly. \nPeterson is the best player on this team. Bidunga is the Defensive Player of the Year on this club. Council is the soul.Inside Self's latest magic trickKansas chose to sic Bidunga -- its starting center -- on Dybantsa. The move worked brilliantly. Dybantsa balked a bit at the early assignment, almost like he was caught off guard a bit at the idea that a center, not a wing, was the choice to shadow him. Dybantsa attempted just two shots in the first 12+ minutes of regulation. By that point, BYU was already in a 20-point hole. As you'd expect, the brilliant Dybantsa got it going in the second half and finished with 17 points. But Bidunga's length and athleticism certainly gave him problems whenever they got matched up one-on-one. \nSaunders stars for BYU in losing effort It's unfortunate that it came in a loss, but that was an absurd showing from Saunders. The veteran BYU guard erupted for 33 points -- 24 in the second half -- to breathe life into BYU. Saunders' barrage of off-movement treys, slice-and-dice cuts, relentless offensive rebounding and all-out hustle should be a valuable lesson that sticks in the brains of the dozens of NBA decision-makers that crammed into Allen Fieldhouse for the Dybantsa-Peterson show.Thirty-three points, 10 rebounds, two steals and one block on that type of stage? Saunders just guaranteed his spot in the 2026 NBA Draft. \n            ",

You can catch all the action on CBS Sports Golazo Network as this continental competition takes place. Arsenal booked their place in the tournament by winning the UEFA Women's Champions League over Barcelona before defeating Moroccan side ASFAR in the semifinals. Corinthians are the holders of the CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores Femenina where they defeated Deportivo Cali before getting past the Concacaf representatives, NY/NJ Gotham FC.How to watch Arsenal vs. CorinthiansDate: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonTV: CBS Sports Golazo Network While Arsenal and Corinthians meet for the title, Gotham and ASFAR will meet in the third-place game, which is also on Sunday. Arsenal got a little healthier during their semifinal game as Choe Kelly returned from a two-month injury absence in the 77th minute, and having her for the final versus an organized Corinthians side will be important. \"It's hard even talking about it, because we know how difficult this game will be,\" Corinthians midfielder Duda Sampaio said. \"It will be one of the hardest games of my career. We know how great Arsenal is in Europe, and we are doing our best to be ready to make another great game, just like we did in the semis.\" Corinthians have already shown that South American soccer needs to be respected after defeating Gotham despite the NWSL side holding most of the possession, and that will be a similar game plan that they'll need to stay in the match against Arsenal. The winner will receive $2.3 million which is the largest ever payout in a women's soccer tournament, while the runners-up receive $1 million, so the financial incentives are also important here.\nIt's the first meeting between Arsenal and Corinthians, and the Gunners will have the backing of home support for the match.How to watch Gotham FC vs. ASFARDate: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 9:45 a.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonTV: CBS Sports Golazo Network \n            \n    ",

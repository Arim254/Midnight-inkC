    "body": "\n        Welcome to the NFL's season of parity. Want a dominant team? Sorry, the Rams lost to the Panthers in Week 13. The Broncos eked out another nail-biter to become the first team in NFL history to have a nine-game winning streak in which they trailed in every game. The Patriots extended their own winning streak to 10 games, but exactly two of those wins have come against teams that would be in the playoffs if they started today. Just when you think you can trust a team, they lay an egg or show a serious, troublesome flaw.       Or they simply remind you the NFL is a hard, hard business. As Broncos coach Sean Payton said after a 27-26 overtime win at the Commanders, \"We don't survive. We won.\"       The numbers back up a season of tiny margins and historic parity. From CBS Sports researcher Doug Clawson:       This is the first time in NFL history where there are five divisions with a lead under one game this late in the season.There are 20 teams with a .500 or better record, tied for most through 13 weeks in NFL history.There are 11 teams with 20-1 or shorter Super Bowl odds (via FanDuel Sportsbook), the most through Week 13 since 2010.Trying to parse through all of these challengers is an immense chore, one that seemingly gets more convoluted each week. As such, we're breaking down the 20 teams in the playoff race into tiers of trustworthiness as the season hits the stretch run.       \n       Tier 1: Inner circle of trustworthiness  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams: Yes, the Rams still land here, even after a loss to the Panthers. Each of the three last Super Bowl champions has an inexplicable loss. The 2025 Eagles lost to the Kirk Cousins-led Falcons; Philadelphia eventually became the first team to win a Super Bowl the same season it lost to Cousins. The 2023 Chiefs lost to the Aidan O'Connell-led Raiders in Week 16. The 2022 Chiefs lost to the Matt Ryan-led Colts, who finished 4-12-1.       The Panthers, who got two fourth-down touchdown passes from Bryce Young and some help from a rainy day, might just be that for Los Angeles. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive success rate, are 10th in defensive success rate, have a Super Bowl-winning quarterback in Matthew Stafford, two superstar wide receivers in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, arguably the NFL's best coach in Sean McVay and a defense that can create havoc and rarely allows big plays.       \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay Packers: The Packers also claim a spot here. Like the Rams, the Packers lost to the Panthers. They also lost to the Browns. But Green Bay is fourth in offensive success rate and 11th in defensive success rate. Jordan Love has played outstanding football; PFF has him as the third highest-graded quarterback in the NFL behind Stafford and Dak Prescott. Micah Parsons is wreaking havoc as part of one of the NFL's most fearsome defenses.       \nNo team is perfect, and this year especially, no team is all that close. But these two teams have separated themselves from the others.              Tier 2: Quarterbacks can carry them  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs: The Chiefs are currently 6-6 and 10th in the AFC. They are very much fighting for their playoff lives, with a Week 14 \"Sunday Night Football\" showdown with the Texans a near must-win.       And yet they have Patrick Mahomes, who is enough reason to think they can not only stage a late-season rally, but be a factor in the Super Bowl conversation. Mahomes was sensational in a 31-28 Thanksgiving Day loss to the Cowboys. He is second in expected points added per play this season. He's been to the Super Bowl five times in seven full seasons as a starter.       \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills: Allen has been as individually brilliant as any quarterback in postseason history, and if Mahomes didn't exist, he may well be a multi-time Super Bowl champion. Allen's been more up-and-down this year than he was in last year's MVP campaign, but he remains a singular force who can take over. Just ask the Buccaneers, against whom Allen accounted for six touchdowns in Week 11.       \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Chargers: Herbert also gets a nod here, though the Chargers' crumbling offensive line and Herbert's health are significant causes for concern. Rewatch his performances from Week 1 against the Chiefs and Week 3 against the Broncos, though, and you'll see the magic he can produce on any play.              Tier 3: Trust the offense, not the defense \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    It was a meandering path to get here -- one that included acquiring the talented-yet-mercurial George Pickens, trading away superstar Micah Parsons and then landing Quinnen Williams at the trade deadline -- but Jerry Jones has suddenly combined his love for being newsworthy with the football goal of fielding a good team. Dallas has won three straight. \nPickens has turned all that talent into superstar production, and he and CeeDee Lamb make up one of the best wide receiver duos in the league. Dak Prescott is playing at a high level, and the defense, boosted by the trade deadline and by improved health, is playing better of late.       Still, Dallas, at 6-5-1 and ninth in the NFC, has its work cut out for it. The defense has gone from untenable to middle of the pack, but is that enough?       \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The 11-2 Patriots, meanwhile, are 13th in offensive success rate and sixth in explosive play rate but 24th in defensive success rate. Drake Maye has ascended to stardom. Still, until the Patriots beat some more of the league's best, they can't be in Tier 1. They won't get that opportunity until the postseason.       \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Since Week 9, the Lions are 27th in net yards per attempt allowed. The run defense is terrific, but the pass defense is really struggling, and with an offense that's been good but not great, that weakness is even more exposed.

After all, Seattle is +850 to win the Super Bowl at FanDuel Sportsbook, the second-shortest odds in the NFL. But that should tell you more about the state of the league than Seattle. Sam Darnold has never won a playoff game, and after an outstanding start, he has started to tail off significantly. He has thrown just two touchdowns and four interceptions over the past three games, looking especially shaky when pressured.       Bo Nix continues to provide a roller coaster ride for the Broncos, but Denver just keeps winning. C.J. Stroud and the Texans are coming off their biggest win of the season over the Colts and have won four straight but are still eighth in the AFC standings.              Tier 5: Wild cards       Philadelphia EaglesChicago BearsSan Francisco 49ersIndianapolis ColtsJacksonville JaguarsBaltimore RavensTampa Bay BuccaneersFittingly, this is the largest tier, and yes, it even includes the top seed in the NFC. How are we truly supposed to judge the Bears, who are 9-3 but have a +6 point differential on the season, 16th in the NFL? Chicago isn't elite on either side of the ball: Its running game is among the league's best, its passing game among the league's worst, its defense among the league's worst on a down-to-down basis but its best in terms of creating turnovers.The Bears' best win came against another team in this tier, the Eagles. Philadelphia has the league's worst defensive rushing success rate, and the offense has ranged from sloppy to strange to simply bad.       Also in this tier are several teams whose quarterbacks give us pause. The 49ers defense has struggled, and Brock Purdy can be a turnover machine. Lamar Jackson hasn't looked close to his normal self as a runner or a thrower. Trevor Lawrence's highs and lows are a wide chasm. Daniel Jones has started to struggle after a white-hot start, and a fractured fibula is clearly hindering him.              Tier 6: Not trustworthy       Carolina PanthersPittsburgh Steelers\"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in\": The story of the 2025 Panthers. Carolina has alternated wins and losses since Week 7. They have wins over the Packers and the Rams. They also have a 10-point loss to the Saints, an 11-point loss to the 49ers and a 31-point loss to the Bills; in all three of those games, they failed to score double-digit points.       If that's not trustworthy, I don't know what is. Carolina deserves tremendous credit for being in this playoff race. The defense has played a scrappy, opportunistic brand of football. The offense will pound the rock and hope Bryce Young can make just enough plays to complement that. It's just too narrow of a path for success. Carolina is 6-3 when it has at least a 40% rushing success rate. It is 1-3 when that number dips below that.       The Steelers are running the late-career Aaron Rodgers gambit. He's struggling and blaming others, and fans are booing and chanting for Mike Tomlin to be fired. It's a mess.       \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup is fast approaching and with almost all the qualifying finished, Friday's draw will confirm the path for most teams through the tournament. There new 48 team field. after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup, means 12 groups of four. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and ending on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City.Because of the tournament's expansion, Europe is guaranteed 16 slots out of the 48 total teams, while the African confederation (CAF) gets nine, and Asia (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.In part thanks to the expansion there are four teams that secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, Cabo Verde and Curacao will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 185,494, Curacao became the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup. Let's take a look at who has already booked their tickets to the World Cup:Already qualified for the 2026 World CupSpots clinched: 42/48World Cup hosts Since the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. United StatesMexicoCanadaAFC Qualifiers IranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaConcacaf QualifiersHaitiCuracaoPanamaOFC Qualifier\nNew ZealandCONMEBOL QualifiersArgentinaBrazilEcuadorColombiaParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCabo VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandFranceCroatiaPortugal Norway Germany Netherlands SwitzerlandScotlandSpainAustriaBelgium Chaos in UEFATeams such as England, Portugal, France and Croatia booked their place in the World Cup, as the winners of each qualifying group will head directly to the tournament. But the second-placed team in each group will head to a playoff phase, such as Italy that might miss their third World Cup in a row. Those 12 second-placed teams will be joined by the four best UEFA Nations League group winners.That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoffs. These also won't conclude until March of 2026.Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs?The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups. A playoff will take place in North America in March, including one team each from the following regions: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, alongside two from Concacaf to determine the final two places in the World Cup. The bottom four teams in the FIFA World Rankings will be drawn into two single-elimination matches, where the winner will advance to face the top two teams in the rankings, with the winners of those two matches qualifying for the World Cup. Currently in the inter-confederation playoffs\nBoliviaDR CongoIraqJamaicaNew CaledoniaSurinameWhen is the World Cup draw?Paths to the World Cup final will be revealed on Dec. 5 in a ceremony taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C..

Drake Maye is second in the MVP odds (+145), while Jaxson Dart is second in the Offensive Rookie of the Year odds (+230), as both will be popular in NFL player props and with a Patriots vs. Giants SGP. New England is a 7.5-point favorite to utilize in NFL picks, but the over/under of 46.5 points may be of even more interest. That's because the Over is a combined 9-3 for the two teams over their last six games.Your 'MNF' SGP could include a combination of predictions related to the total or spread, as well as NFL props in regard to a player, team or the game in general. Dart has seven rushing touchdowns across his seven pro starts, so are his +340 prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer worth gambling on with an NFL same-game parlay? Dart also has an over/under of 201.5 passing yards and 27.5 rushing yards.

In his last game, Henry had a career high of 115 receiving yards which came on seven receptions, one of which ended in a touchdown. The seven grabs were one shy of tying a career high, and over New England's last five games in which it was favored, as is the case on 'MNF', Henry's gone over his receptions bar in four of those contests.New York has a bottom-10 pass defense and has already seen a pair of tight ends go off with nine-reception games against it this season. Henry will also enjoy the comforts of Gillette Stadium as he has more catches, yards and touchdowns at home than on the road, despite playing the same number of games. Henry is projected to have 5.2 receptions on average, as this plus-money NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Giants vs. Patriots SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has seven other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better, including one that returns plus money, that could be a part of your Patriots vs. Giants SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Giants vs. Patriots predictions?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suffered a fracture in his left, non-throwing hand during the 31-14 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, and the team announced Monday that he underwent successful surgery to stabilize the fracture. Herbert is considered day-to-day, and his status for the Week 14 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night is to be determined. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. Herbert told reporters he's treating this week as if he's playing, per ESPN. He will surely be pushing to play, and will need to wear a protective device on that injured hand, but it's possible Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14.\nThe former No. 3 overall pick of the San Francisco 49ers made one start for the Dallas Cowboys last year, a 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders in which he completed 20 of 34 passes for 244 yards. Lance is 2-3 in his career as a starter. \n            \n    ",

That means even going undefeated the rest of the way might not get them into the playoffs.\nThe playoffs without Mahomes?Talk about weird.\n        \n            \n                Should you bet on Chiefs to make playoffs?

They played the Cowboys game without right guard Trey Smith and then lost tackles Josh Simmons (who could go on injured reserve with a wrist injury) and Jawaan Taylor.Mahomes has been Superman at times in his career, but getting this team to the playoffs would be among his best achievements. It just doesn't look like it will happen.The Chiefs are down to No. 16 in my Power Rankings this week, which is amazing to see after having them in the top 10 for most of the past eight years -- and most of the time in the top five.\nAnother team that needs to do some work is the Detroit Lions. Many picked them to be a Super Bowl team before the season, and now they are 7-5 after losing to the Packers last Thursday. They are down to 15 in my rankings this week.How many people picked a Chiefs-Lions Super Bowl before the season?Now we have the Eagles getting mauled in the run game, the Rams losing at Carolina and the Jaguars in first place in the AFC South.What in the hell?The weird season just keeps getting weirder by the week, but the Chiefs missing the playoffs would be the strangest thing of all.\n\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                6\n            \n                Bengals\n            \n                8\n            \n                Colts\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Patriots\n                                \n                            They just keep on winning.

However, Carter entered the game in the second quarter, and recorded his first career sack on Drake Maye. In Week 11, Carter was held out for the opening series vs. the Green Bay Packers. It was reported that the rookie was benched for sleeping through a walkthrough. Carter said this was untrue, and that a schedule change led to his confusion. He claimed he was getting treatment at the time he should have been at practice. \"My mistake was an honest mistake,\" Carter told ESPN. \"I own the fact that it was an honest mistake. I was getting treatment and I told Coach Kafka that, too. But to say I was sleeping at that time just wasn't true. And it also wasn't a trend. This was the only time it happened.\"\nIn 12 games played this season with two starts, Carter has recorded 27 tackles, 12 QB hits and one fumble recovery. Considered to be one of the best players in the 2025 NFL Draft, Carter became the third Penn State defensive player to be selected in the top three in the common draft era. He recorded 12 sacks and 24 tackles for loss in his final collegiate season, making him the first FBS player to reach both of those marks since former Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. did so in 2021. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Devin Williams is changing boroughs. Williams and the New York Mets have agreed to a three-year contract, reports The Athletic. The deal includes $45 million in salary plus a $6 million signing bonus and deferrals, according to the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the move. The signing reunites Williams with David Stearns. Williams was a minor leaguer with the Milwaukee Brewers when the club named Stearns their general manager in September 2015, and the two overlapped in the organization until Stearns left to take over the Mets two years ago. Surely that relationship played a role in the signing.Williams, 31, spent this past season across town with the Yankees and had a turbulent season, throwing 62 innings with a 4.79 ERA. He allowed 37 runs in 2025 after allowing 33 runs combined from 2022-24. Williams was dominant at times, however, and he finished the season with 90 strikeouts in those 62 innings. He was a trusted late-inning reliever in the postseason. \n\"At first it was a challenge, but I've grown to love being here,\" Williams said after the Yankees were eliminated from the postseason. \"I love this city. I love taking the train to the field every day.\" We ranked Williams as the 19th-best free agent available this offseason, and the second best reliever behind erstwhile Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Here's the write-up: \n\"High-Lev Dev\" is a strong rebound candidate based on, if nothing  else, the incongruity between his ERA and his underlying data. There  were 21 pitchers who made 30 or more appearances in 2025 without any  starts and who possessed a strikeout rate above 30% and a walk rate  below 10%. Williams' 4.79 ERA was the worst of the group, which as a  whole put up a 2.76 mark -- to the extent that the next worst ERA was  just over 4.00. Williams somehow managed that while sporting the fourth-best hard-hit percentage of the bunch, behind names like Josh Hader and Abner Uribe.  Things happen in this game sometimes, particularly with individual  relief seasons. There's no compelling reason to think Williams has lost  his touch just yet. \tWe explained further why Williams, despite his disappointing season with the Yankees, was a highly coveted free agent with a chance to bounce back to his All-Star form. The Williams signing does not necessarily preclude Díaz returning to the Mets, though it does make it less likely. New York's bullpen was in rough shape most of the 2025 season and it could be that they hope to pair Williams with Díaz rather than have Williams replace Díaz. Either way, Williams figures to be the first reliever the Mets acquire this winter, not the only one. Lefties Brooks Raley and A.J. Minter are the only other locks for New York's bullpen at the moment. Minter missed most of this past season with season-ending lat surgery. Righty Huascar Brazoban is a candidate for another bullpen spot.  \nThe Yankees did not make Williams the $22.025 million qualifying offer, so they will not receive a compensation draft pick for losing him nor will the Mets surrender draft picks to sign him. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest CBA proposal from the Women's National Basketball Association to the WNBA Players Association includes a maximum base salary of $1 million in 2026, a source with knowledge of the situation told CBS Sports on Monday. The proposal -- which comes after the two sides recently agreed to a 40-day extension of the current CBA -- also includes a minimum salary of more than $225,000 and would bump the league's salary cap to $5 million in Year 1 of the new deal. The WNBA's minimum salary and salary cap were $66,079 and $1.5 million in the 2025 season, respectively.The supermax in 2025 was $249,244. The league's proposal would push the max salary to seven figures and that number could be more than $1.2 million based on projected revenue sharing, per sources.Meanwhile, the league's proposal would see the salary cap rise to $5 million in Year 1, and it would be tied directly to revenue growth in each year of the CBA.\nPlayer salaries figure to increase substantially in whatever deal is eventually reached between the WNBA and the players. The players, however, have voiced that changing the revenue-sharing model is a top priority in the new CBA. Here's more from CBS Sports' Jack Maloney:While the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share [and] salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has not yet been a public response from the players union regarding the league's latest proposal. \nSunday's 40-day extension of the current CBA keeps it intact through Jan. 9, 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin had plenty of people to give him guidance while he was trying to decide between staying at Ole Miss and leaving for LSU. In an interview before he hopped on the plane to Baton Rouge, Kiffin credited mentor Pete Carroll, whom he coached under at USC, with encouraging him to leave for the Tigers. But during his introductory press conference at LSU on Monday, Kiffin revealed that none other than Nick Saban also had a huge hand in the process. \"Coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference so I can't really say exactly what he said,\" Kiffin said. \"I will say, I think the world of coach Saban and I respect him. So there's a reason I'm here.\" \n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaban won a national title at LSU before a brief foray in the NFL gave way to his legendary career at Alabama, where he spent 17 seasons from 2007-23. Kiffin was his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16. The two won three consecutive SEC titles and one national title together. \nThough he had the support he needed to make the move to LSU, Kiffin noted that it wasn't an easy process. He had several meetings with Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter and the university's administration in the hours before he made his final decision. Kiffin doubled down on the claim that, in spite of the fact that he had player support after a team meeting Sunday morning, Ole Miss determined that he would not coach in the Rebels' expected College Football Playoff appearance. According to Kiffin, the timing of Ole Miss' decision also prevented him from telling the team that he was leaving. None of that deterred Kiffin, who made his final announcement via social media Sunday. \n\"I hate that I didn't get to explain to the players why,\" Kiffin said. \"But I also totally respect and understand the decision they felt they had to make for the program.\" He left for Baton Rouge the same day. Kiffin, who agreed to a seven-year, $91 million contract, had to contact a police officer that he knew to guide him and his son to the airport, where Ole Miss fans met him with boos and middle fingers. \"That airport scene, and all the things being said, I understand it's the passion,\" Kiffin said. \"But they're saying that about you and you thought you did a really good job for six years for them. That affects you.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's turbulent departure from Ole Miss to become LSU's new coach has drawn the ire of many, including Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher. Cowher and the rest of the \"NFL Today\" crew took time out of their Week 13 coverage to address Kiffin's controversial exit. They reacted to his comments that he asked -- and was denied -- the chance to coach Ole Miss during its upcoming College Football Playoff run. Kiffin also allegedly gave his former coaches at Ole Miss an ultimatum to either leave with him this past weekend or lose the opportunity to join his new staff at LSU. \"I would say, why would you even ask that question?\" Cowher said in response to Kiffin's request to continue coaching Ole Miss for the remainder of its season. \"Why would an AD let a coach -- who made a decision that he wanted to go to LSU and not stay at Ole Miss -- coach my players and use my coaches and tell them for the next month why they should be joining him at LSU. Totally understand. I would just say, 'Thank you Lane, and goodbye.'\" Cowher also offered his two cents to any player who choose to play for Kiffin in the future. \n\"Just understand one thing: it's not about the program, it's about Lane Kiffin,\" Cowher said. \"Because he doesn't care about the players that he just went through a season with, a special season. Players he's had for four years with an opportunity to go to the playoffs. He's decided to only leave them, which I get. Okay, you want to do that, but now you take offensive coaches with you and destroy the program. Deplete the program and the dreams of these young men who you said that you want to be there and you want to do it with, but if I can't do it, I'm not going to let you do you it yourself.\" Cowher made it clear that he doesn't have an issue with Kiffin pursuing another opportunity. It's the way that he left that bothers Cowher and many other people for that matter. \"If you go, then go and wish them nothing but the best,\" Cowher said. \"Don't disrupt that program. Don't take any of those coaches. Let them stay there and let them finish the job that you left because you didn't want to finish it, because you decided you want to go somewhere else. That's fine. But don't take everybody else with you and try to destroy that program.  \n\"A football program is not just about the head coach. It's about the assistants. It's about the organization. It's about everybody else. Administrative staff that sat there and supported you all those years, all those alumni that sat there gave you money for NIL, it's about them too. You've left them. And so it isn't just about you, Lane Kiffin.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State is targeting BYU's Kalani Sitake to fill its coaching vacancy, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. The Nittany Lions' brass turned their attention toward Sitake to replace James Franklin, who was fired Oct. 12, six games into his 12th season on the job. The news of Penn State's pursuit of Sitake comes ahead of No. 11 BYU's showdown with No. 5 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game -- a matchup with a College Football Playoff bid on the line. Sitake, 50, has served as BYU's coach since 2016 and guided the program's transition from the independent ranks to the Big 12. The Cougars have a combined 22-3 record over the past two seasons, including an 11-1 (8-1 Big 12) mark heading into Saturday's conference title game. Sitake has an 83-44 overall record at his alma mater and the Cougars have reached the 10-win mark in four of his 10 seasons on the job. Sitake was asked about the Penn State job on Monday, but declined to answer directly. \n\"We're trying to finish the season the right way, it's on us to be our best to play against Texas Tech,\" Sitake said. \"So as we go through this week and go through the prep, I also want them to live through all the moments and have a great experience and not waste a moment thinking about anything else. ... This is a great distraction to have, let's be honest. But you know, right now we need to be focused on making sure that we're giving our best shot in this game against Texas Tech.\"If it lands Sitake, Penn State gets an experienced coach to succeed Franklin, who was hired by Virginia Tech just weeks after being fired. Penn State began the season ranked No. 2 on the heels of a trip to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season, but sputtered to a 3-3 start with losses to Oregon, UCLA and Northwestern. Penn State athletic director Patrick Kraft fired Franklin a day after the home loss to Northwestern. \n        \n            \n                Kalani Sitake to Penn State?

But is he a fit in Happy Valley? Sitake has never coached outside the Mountain or Pacific time zones and was widely viewed as a BYU lifer, tied to the program culturally and personally in ways few Power Four coaches are to their schools. He played at BYU under LaVell Edwards and remains deeply connected to its identity as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But with Penn State's position in the Big Ten and access to greater resources and the College Football Playoff, Sitake may opt to make the move East. Penn State played out the season under interim coach Terry Smith. Smith, a Penn State alum and longtime assistant under Franklin, publicly campaigned for the job while leading the Nittany Lions to a 3-3 record, including wins in its final three games to get to 6-6 and bowl eligibility. \n            ",

In non-Toyotathon games, Green Bay was 7-9 with Love throwing 29 touchdowns, 20 interceptions and completing just 59.0% of his throws. The Packers' quarterback has embraced his success during Toyotathon, which has carried over into this season. This year, Love and Toyotathon teamed up to create 250 Panini cards that include Love's numbers during the previous two Toyotathons. Each card also includes a piece of Love's Toyotathon sweater. \nAs alluded to earlier, Love's success during Toyotathon (which began Nov. 19) has continued this year. During his first two games of Toyotathon, Love has thrown four touchdowns and no interceptions while leading the Packers to wins over the Commanders and Lions. \nAgainst Detroit, Love was awarded the John Madden Thanksgiving MVP trophy after throwing for 234 yards and four touchdowns during Green Bay's 31-24 win. \nToyotathon vs. non-Toyotathon performance (2023–25) CategoryToyotathonNon-ToyotathonRecord13–513–12–1TD Passes3244Interceptions223Completion %67.8%62.7%Packers fans are obviously hoping that Love's success during Toyotathon continues for the remainder of the 2025 regular season, starting with Sunday's crucial matchup between the NFC North-leading Bears. The Packers will play Chicago twice in a three-week span with a home game against the 10-2 Broncos sandwiched in between. While fans are hoping the Packers' regular season will end with some readily available playoff merch, getting hold of one of Love's exclusive Toyotathon cards may be harder to come by.

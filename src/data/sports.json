    "body": "\n        Teams on the fringe of the NFC playoffs will wrap up Week 12 as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. The over/under in this matchup is 49.5, up two points from the opening line. San Fran's offense runs through former Panthers standout Christian McCaffrey as daily Fantasy managers always have him top-of-mind when making NFL DFS picks. But the Niners also have the No. 2 passing offense, which makes Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle, all back in the lineup after recent injuries, desirable for NFL DFS lineups, despite their injury-plagued seasons. As for Carolina, its top-10 rushing attack makes the backfield tandem of Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard an intriguing MNF DFS stack.Any NFL daily strategy must include affordable options to balance out the big names with big price tags. Can Bryce Young, coming off a 448-yard, 3-TD game, be one of those options amongst the NFL DFS player pool? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Buccaneers vs. Rams, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Panthers vs. 49ersPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering Niners tight end George Kittle, who has an over/under of 56.5 receiving yards. Since coming off IR in October, Kittle has looked every bit like the six-time Pro Bowler he is. He has four touchdowns over his last four games, also averaging 5.8 receptions and 56.5 yards over this span. He's been the TE2 in Fantasy during this stretch and has at least five catches in all three career games versus Carolina. This year's Panthers have struggled defending tight ends, as just six teams have allowed more receiving yards to tight ends than Carolina, while only seven teams have allowed more touchdowns to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Panthers RB Rico Dowdle, who is averaging over 100 scrimmage yards with three total touchdowns over his last three games. He's clearly unseated Chuba Hubbard as Carolina's No. 1 RB, as the latter hasn't had more than five carries over this three-game stretch. Dowdle entered Week 12 ranking fourth in rushing yards (833) and eighth in scrimmage yards (1,030), and one shouldn't overlook the impact he could have out of the backfield. He tied a career high with five catches last week, going for 55 yards, and only one team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than San Fran. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        Brock Purdy takes the field for consecutive weeks for the first time this season for the San Francisco 49ers as they play the Carolina Panthers on Monday Night Football, and with the latest DraftKings promo code, new users receive $200 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass to bet on 49ers vs. Panthers or anything else on the Monday sports calendar. The 49ers are 7.5-point favorites after a 19-point win over the Cardinals last week, and with that, the SportsLine Projection Model has San Francisco covering the 7.5-point spread as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings. The 49ers are 3-2 over their last five games, and each of the three wins came by at least 10 points. The over/under for 49ers vs. Panthers is 49.5 points, up two from the opening line. The model is also backing the Phoenix Suns as 6.5-point underdogs to cover against the Houston Rockets in NBA action, and one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on No. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 Alabama at the Players Era Festival in college basketball action to include in Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 12 on a 48-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook49ers (-7.5) vs. PanthersSuns (+6.5) vs. RocketsAlabama (+4.5) vs. GonzagaCombining the model's three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +593 (risk $100 to win $593). Bet it at DraftKings here:\n49ers (-7.5) vs. Panthers (-108)The 49ers haven't had many opportunities to showcase their full offense this season, and although it's still not at 100% healthy, it's as close as it may be this season. Last week, with Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings all on the field together, San Francisco put up 41 points against the Cardinals. Purdy had three touchdown passes, and McCaffrey scored three times (twice rushing). Although the Panthers are 6-5 this season, they rank 28th in scoring at 18.8 points per game. Their limited offensive upside may struggle to keep pace with the 49ers, as the model projects San Francisco to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Back the 49ers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (+6.5) vs. Rockets (-108)The Rockets travel to Phoenix on Monday, and they'll be without Kevin Durant, who is out for personal reasons, for what was supposed to be the future Hall of Famer's return to Phoenix. While the Rockets won't have the star they received in that trade, the Suns will have one of the key returns with Dillon Brooks getting the chance at some revenge against his former team. Brooks is averaging 21.4 ppg, forming a strong duo with Devin Booker, who is averaging 26.9 ppg this season. The Suns enter on a three-game winning streak and are 8-1 over their last nine games. Given their recent play and Durant being out, the model views 6.5 as too many points to give Phoenix, projecting the Suns to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. Back the Suns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Alabama (+4.5) vs. Gonzaga (-115)Alabama takes on Gonzaga at the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas, with the Crimson Tide coming off a 90-86 win over No. 8 Illinois on Wednesday at a neutral site. \"I actually make Alabama the small favorite here,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"I'll take the 4.5 in a run-and-gun game that the Tide love to play. Bama has already beaten St. John's and Illinois and was tied with Purdue late. Give me the 4.5 points.\" Back Alabama at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Monday Night Football, NBA, college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "description": "\n        New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner says the club remains committed to winning a championship in 2026, but at the same time he expressed ",
    "body": "\n        New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner says the club remains committed to winning a championship in 2026, but at the same time he expressed uncertainty over future payroll commitments. Steinbrenner said Monday that the team's payroll in 2025 was $319 million, likely referring to the team's payroll as calculated for Competitive Balance Tax purposes. The more familiar measures of team payroll -- Opening Day payroll and 40-player roster payroll -- were quite a bit lower than Steinbrenner's figure, according to Cot's Contracts data. Of that payroll figure, Steinbrenner said, \"Would it be ideal if it went down? Of course. But does that mean that's going to happen? Of course not. We want to field a team we know can win a championship, or we believe could win a championship.\"The obvious counter to this is that a team with the Yankees' resources should be prepared to spend what it takes to prime itself for a serious World Series run. On that point, Steinbrenner also said this regarding the assumption that the Yankees are running profits, via MLB.com: \n\"I don't want to get into it, but that's not a fair statement or an accurate statement. Everybody wants to talk about revenues. They need to talk about our expenses, including the $100 million expense to the City of New York that we have to pay every Feb. 1, including the COVID year. So it all starts to add up in a hurry.\"Whenever an owner says anything about a team's finances, it's worth noting that, with the exception of the publicly traded Atlanta Braves, clubs are under no obligation to reveal anything about those finances. Stated another way, anything an owner says about a team's profitability or lack thereof, the assumption should be that those claims are designed to influence perception as opposed to reflecting actual facts. Such words from owners who are not legally bound to speak the truth about financial matters involving their clubs should not be trusted. The larger truth is that MLB franchises are investments, not cash-flow businesses. The next owner not to make hundreds of millions of dollars -- or even billions -- on the sale of an MLB team will be the first.Insofar as the heart of the matter is concerned, Steinbrenner's Yankees are coming off a 2025 season in which they won 94 games and claimed a wild card berth. After bouncing the Red Sox in the Wild Card Series, they fell to the Blue Jays in the next round. That means the Yankees still haven't won the World Series since 2009.\nLooking toward 2026, the Yankees have a number of question marks, including the possible loss of outfielder Cody Bellinger on the free-agent market. Given the competitive nature of the American League East, Steinbrenner needs to have an appetite for more than just half-measures. His Monday comments hint that he might not.  \n            ",

Chase, who initially denied spitting on Ramsey, will play in Cincinnati's Thanksgiving Day game against the Ravens after he served his suspension for a Week 12 loss to the New England Patriots. \"What I did was wrong,\" Chase said in a statement he posted on Instagram. \"The circumstances don't matter. My passion for the game is no excuse. There's zero place in our sport -- or life -- for that level of disrespect.\" Chase apologized \"to everyone within the Pittsburgh Steelers organization.\" He also extended an apology to his coaches, teammates, the Bengals' organization and his fans while vowing that he \"won't let it happen again.\" \n\"I do not take anyone who wears my jersey for granted,\" he said. \"I do not take my position as a role model lightly. As someone who strives to lead with character and authenticity, I should have taken immediate accountability for what happened. I am committed to earning back your respect -- not just with words, but with my actions, day after day, on and off the field.\" \nWith his suspension behind him, Chase will now resume the task of helping the 3-8 Bengals get back on track, staring with Thursday night's road game against the Ravens. Helping his cause will be the return of Joe Burrow, who is slated to play for the first time since he suffered turf toe back in Week 2. \nThe Bengals will not, however, have fellow wideout Tee Higgins against the Ravens after he sustained a concussion during this past Sunday's loss to the Patriots. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- Gonzaga entered the season ranked No. 21 in the AP poll and was regarded as a quality team but one that, if it had aspirations of being Final Four-good, well those might be a bit too lofty.The thinking went: With ace point guard Ryan Nembhard gone off a squad that had its worst season in a decade-plus, how good could it be now? Its nine losses last season were the program's most in 14 years, and it failed to reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.Gonzaga would probably settle into second-tier status. Good, but not too good. Everyone who thought that -- myself included, for I also ranked Gonzaga 21st back in October -- misread the situation. Badly. The Zags are still good. Damn good.Mark Few's program got its best win of the early season with a 95-85 win over No. 8 Alabama Monday night in the first round of the Players Era Championship. A game between two dynamic offensive teams was expected to be a race to 90 and that's exactly what played out. \nBy the way, four of Gonzaga's six wins to date have come vs. power-conference competition. That's led Gonzaga's push from No. 21 three weeks ago to No. 12 as of Monday's poll refresh. The Bulldogs dropped a cool 1.23 points per possession on Alabama's head, led by 21 apiece from a pair of guys whose combined ages equal 48. Graham Ike, 23, and Tyon Grant-Foster, 25, pushed the pace and roughed up Alabama's overmatched front court. Another Gonzaga big, Braden Huff, put up 18 points, and then there were 12 more off the bench from Steele Venters. \"Our starting 3/4/5 had 16 points, and theirs had 60,\" a displeased Nate Oats said after the game. Oats has been at the head of an Alabama operation that qualifies as a top-10 program in the sport over the past five years. He knows what competing in the deep end looks like.\nIt looks like Gonzaga. \"Big, they're physical, every time we made a run they had an answer,\" Oats said. \"Gave up 25 second-chance points, it's hard to win doing that.\"The scary part with Gonzaga: It got to 95 points and was just 6 of 22 from 3. Mark Few's got a squad that is old, proud and sure looks a lot tougher than some of his previous squads that had a sheen of finesse to them. Oats tried to warn his players about the physicality, but sometimes you can't learn without firsthand experience. \n\"We showed them video of Tyon Grant-Foster just destroying people on the glass, multiple boards just keep coming,\" Oats said. The 25-year-old Grant-Foster got it done in key spots in the second half. In total, more than 50% of Gonzaga's points came in the paint. \"This game is about after the sets, the possessions, the broken plays and things like that, and that's where Ty really shines,\" Few said. \nLabaron Philon Jr. can be an irresistible talent for the Tide. He's one of the best guards in the country -- and perhaps the most talented. Philon finished with 29 points in 30 minutes -- because he couldn't score in the final 10. \"He was cooking us pretty good,\" Few said.Gonzaga totally shut Philon down by tossing a medley of defenses at him to sputter Alabama out of options.\"Down the stretch we knew what we needed to do, and that's when we pad locks,\" Grant-Foster said.\nI love that quote. This team has real verve. After seeing Gonzaga up close, it's evident there's enough variety in this Bulldogs lineup that it should be able to match up with just about anyone in college basketball. Freshman guard Mario Saint-Supery got all 10 of his points from the foul line vs. the Tide, but he's the most talented of the group. \"He plays with great spirit and it's contagious,\" Few said. \"We're still ironing out things with the crazy-ass jump passes.\"With a 6-0 mark and a game against a still-developing Maryland team awaiting Tuesday night, Gonzaga's poised to be in a good position to play for the championship on Wednesday. \nIts goals look a lot bigger than that, though. And Few is putting out signals that he believes this team can be up there with some of his best. \"Our wings our bigger than we've had, and we're a bigger team, almost like that '17 team,\" Few said. He's talking about the 2016-17 team, the one with Nigel Williams-Goss, Przemek Karnowski and Jonathan Williams that went 37-2 but lost the NCAA Tournament championship. Few also invoked the 2020-21 team, the one with Drew Timme, Corey Kispert and Jalen Suggs that went 31-1 but also had to settle for the runner-up spot.\nThose were the two best teams in Gonzaga history.\"Blue-blood level teams,\" Few said.This one's not near being in that group yet, but it's fair to say just about everyone whiffed on Gonzaga's ceiling this year. Few has a bona fide squad, one that has a chance to come out of this week with a big statement and a better track record as one of the very best teams in college basketball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Colorado coach Deion Sanders arrived in Las Vegas early Sunday to see his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, make his first career start against the Las Vegas Raiders.Grinning ear to ear, Sanders was the first to greet his son in the tunnel after earning the win and shared his immediate thoughts on his 209-yard, one touchdown performance.\"The check down was right there, when you get that right, it's over,\" Sanders said told Shedeur before they embraced in a video posted by Well Off Media. \"You played good. You gotta just look at the film and evaluate yourself on what went wrong. You did good, though. I'm proud of you. You're holding it down for the family.\"Cleveland's 24-10 win sparked remarks from President Donald Trump and ignited buzz throughout social media centered around the former Colorado star's outing, which included a 66-yard touchdown pass to Dylan Sampson midway through the fourth quarter.\nSanders didn't showed any nervousness during his first start and even shook off a first-half interception to lead the Browns to a win.\"I think I showed a couple of great pieces, and there's some things I wish I could get back,\" Sanders said in an interview with CBS Sports' Tiffany Blackmon after the game. \"But man, a win is crazy. It's amazing. You know? Off of one week of practice. This is one week of practice! So imagine what a full offseason look like! It get dangerous!\"Last week prior to Colorado's loss to Arizona State, Deion said he was encouraged to attend Sunday's game.\n\"You don't want to be his distraction, but not that I would ever would be,\" Sanders said on the \"Colorado Football Coaches Show\" on Nov. 20. \"But then you think, 'You know, he came all the way up here to see you?' So that's even (a) shorter trip to see him. You start thinking that as a dad, you know. Because you know what it means to him if he just catch a glimpse of him before he walks out.\"Shedeur Sanders' mother, Pilar, was also in attendance. Deion Sanders and Pilar separated in 2011, but have been by their son's side for several of the highlight moments of his career, including April's NFL Draft.\"Being able to see my family, that was important,\" Shedeur said after the game. \"I'm happy they was here to be able to witness it.\"\nDonning a cowboy hat and a brown sweatsuit, Deion met with his son briefly met with his before kickoff and the two went on their traditional pre-game walk together.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The third AP Top 25 poll of the 2025-26 season was released Monday, and despite a push from Arizona, Purdue remains the No. 1-ranked team. The Boilermakers leapfrogged Houston last week for the top spot in the poll after recording a statement win over Alabama and received 46 first-place votes this week to remain No. 1.Arizona comes off a statement 71-67 win on the road over UConn. The Wildcats jumped two spots to No. 2 and received 11 first-place votes in the poll. Houston also received first-place votes.The Wildcats boast arguably the nation's best résumé so far. Arizona already has wins over Florida, UCLA and, most recently, UConn. The Wildcats face Auburn and Alabama before the calendar turns to the new year.Speaking of Alabama, Nate Oats' team jumped back into the top 10 after a 90-86 win over Illinois. The Crimson Tide jumped three spots to No. 8 after picking up their second top-10 win.\nAnother winner from last week was Michigan State. The Spartans made a statement with an 83-66 win over Kentucky in the Champions Classic behind the stellar play of Jaxon Kohler, who has finished as the leading scorer in three of MSU's first five games. MSU jumped six spots to No. 11.AP Top 251. Purdue (46)2. Arizona (11)3. Houston (4)4. Duke5. UConn6. Louisville7. Michigan8. Alabama9. BYU10. Florida11. Michigan State12. Gonzaga13. Illinois14.

The voters already showed willingness to move teams out of the No. 1 spot (see Houston and Purdue the last few weeks) despite either of those teams not losing. One can certainly make the case that Purdue should remain No. 1 until it sustains a loss, but Arizona should be the top-ranked team in the poll. No team in the country has a better résumé. The Wildcats recorded three ranked wins, including one against UConn. It was also surprising that the Wildcats only received 11 first-place votes.Indiana enters the pollFor the first time this season, Indiana gets ranked in the AP poll. The Hoosiers are off to a 5-0 start in Year 1 of the Darian Devries era and have a 23-point win on the résumé over Marquette. Indiana faces a tough stretch coming up, with nonconference games against Kansas State, Louisville and Kentucky. Tucker DeVries, the son of the coach, is also off to a strong start. He averages19.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists after injury cut last season short. Kansas drops outKansas is out of the AP Top 25. Kansas is off to a 3-2 start with losses against North Carolina and Duke so far. The Jayhawks have been without star guard Darryn Peterson, the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, for the last three games. It's unclear when he will return to the lineup. Kansas embarks upon upcoming stretch against Syracuse, UConn, Missouri and NC State before Big 12 play begins. \n            ",

Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for Chelsea vs. Barcelona on Tuesday.Chelsea vs. Barcelona picksChelsea draw no bet (-130): 1uOver 3.5 goals (+100): 0.5uPedro Neto Over 1.5 shots on target (-107): 0.5uChelsea will aim to get their Champions League campaign back on track when they host Barcelona at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. The Blues slipped down to 12th in the group stage table after drawing 2-2 with Qarabag last time out. Manager Enzo Maresca rested several key players for that game, and Chelsea ultimately paid the price. He certainly won't make the same mistake against Barcelona. They're one of the best teams in Europe, so Maresca should field his strongest starting XI. It promises to be an entertaining game as both teams struggle defensively, but they're stacked with attacking talent.Neto and Fernandez keep Chelsea tickingChelsea moved up to second in the Premier League table after securing a routine 2-0 away win against Burnley at the weekend. The Blues are on a three-game winning streak in the league, and they're unbeaten in their last five matches. Star player Cole Palmer has  been out injured for most of the season and he'll miss this game after breaking his toe. Fortunately, his teammates have stepped up. Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Enzo Fernández both scored in the win against Burnley. They're the club's joint top scorers this season with four goals apiece. João Pedro also has four goals, while Moisés Caicedo has found the back of the net three times. Defenders Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, and Josh Acheampong have all chipped in with vital goals, along with forwards Estêvão and Alejandro Garnacho. Liam Delap has now recovered from an injury, and former Barcelona striker Marc Guiu offers another solid option in attack. Chelsea boast a great deal of firepower, so they should be able to exploit Barcelona's defensive weaknesses. Barça have conceded 15 goals in 13 La Liga games this season and they've also conceded seven times in four Champions League matches.However, Chelsea are also vulnerable in defense. Levi Colwill is injured, so Maresca normally pairs Chalobah with Toisin Adarabioyo at center back. They never look entirely convincing. The Blues have conceded four goals in six Champions League matches, and they concede about a goal per game in the Premier League on average. It's hard to see them keeping the likes of Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski at bay for 90 minutes, so this should be a high-scoring match.Barcelona might be Europe's most entertaining teamBarcelona also dropped points in their last Champions League game. They comprehensively outplayed Club Brugge in Belgium but defensive lapses cost them, and the game finished 3-3. They bounced back by beating Celta Vigo 4-2 in a league match, and they then thrashed Athletic Club 4-0 on Saturday. They've fired in 36 goals in 13 La Liga games this season, which is a remarkable record.However, the defense has been their Achilles' heel. They've only kept one clean sheet in their last 11 games, which is concerning. They play a high defensive line, and pacy wingers like Neto and Jamie Gittens could exploit it. Barcelona are arguably the most entertaining team in Europe. Their last six games have seen 30 goals - an average of five per game - and we've seen 4.8 goals per game in their last 20 Champions League matches. Key midfielder Pedri is likely to miss this game, so Marc Casado could partner Frenkie de Jong in the middle of the park. They'll have their work cut out against Caicedo and Fernández, two of the best midfielders in the world. The team that wins the midfield battle should go on and win this game. It could be tight as these teams look evenly matched. They're level on points in the Champions League group, they're both flying in their domestic leagues and both have extremely talented players in most positions.Ultimately, home field advantage could swing things in Chelsea's favor. The Blues have won both Champions League matches at Stamford Bridge this season. They'll face a much sterner test of their mettle against Barcelona but they could ultimately prevail if Caicedo and Fernández grab this game by the scruff of the neck.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline isn't until Feb. 5, but with a month of the season in the books, team's are starting to assess what moves they want to make. There could be several big names on the trading block, but it's still too early for anything substantial to happen. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning before we've even reached Thanksgiving.But that's the nature of the NBA nowadays, things move fast and you have to get a jumpstart on the trade market if you want to make championship moves or changes that can position you better for the draft. With that in mind, here's the latest rumors circulating around the NBA.Clippers interested in DeMar DeRozanAn upcoming fire sale appears to be on the books for the Sacramento Kings, and teams are starting to set their sights on some players who could be available. DeMar DeRozan is drawing some interest from the Clippers, according to The Athletic's Sam Amick, in part because of his partially guaranteed contract for next season that could pay him only $10 million of a $27 million deal. The Clippers have struggled through the first month of the season with a 5-12 record, and have an offense that ranks 21st in the league.DeRozan's scoring would certainly help L.A., but at 36 years old it would only make the Clippers an even older roster that is already relying too much on veterans in a fast-paced NBA landscape. DeRozan has also never been a quality defender, and the Clippers' defense is undoubtedly a bigger issue that needs solving right now.Mavericks will have a difficult time trading Anthony DavisThe moment Nico Harrison was fired, Davis became a trade chip. The issue, though, is that he hasn't played since Oct. 29 as he's been dealing with a calf strain. And when Davis was healthy, he appeared out of shape and struggled defensively. So it's no surprise that those around the league think the Mavericks will have a hard time trying to trade Davis whose injury history is a red flag for opposing teams. ESPN's Tim Bontemps is reporting that Davis' injuries and his contract, which pays him $54.1 million, $58.4 million and $62.7 million over the next three seasons, are why there have not been very many suitors for the veteran forward. \nIf Davis, 32, manages to come back and show a sustained level of success without injury, then that could change. But this situation appears to be something that will drag out closer to the trade deadline.LaMelo Ball trade talk is premature, but doesn't mean it won't happenHeads started to turn when it was reported by Yahoo Sports' Kelly Iko that Ball was growing disgruntled with the direction of the Hornets and that he would be open to a trade. Ball shot down those rumors, but that doesn't mean a trade won't happen, either initiated by Charlotte or Ball. Jake Fischer is reporting that while talks of Ball getting traded are premature, it's something the Hornets could explore ahead of the deadline.Ball, 24, comes with his own red flags, primarily his continuous ankle injuries that have allowed him to play only 20 games more than Zion Williamson over his career. But amongst the big names mentioned, Ball certainly has the most trade value given his age, talent and a contract that isn't completely egregious.\nGrizzlies will explore Ja Morant trade marketMorant recently said he has lost his joy for playing basketball, he's been suspended a game for conduct detrimental to the team and the Grizzlies are 6-11. He's currently sidelined with a calf strain, but even when healthy, the 26-year-old is averaging near a career low across the board, and still hasn't been able to improve as a shooter. Combine that with the off-court issues he's had over the years and it creates a situation where he might be more trouble than he's worth for the Grizzlies. Bontemps reports that Memphis will explore the trade market, but it won't be an easy sell to find a package worth considering. That's not surprising given everything I just cited above, and who knows, maybe the Grizzlies turn things around and these trade rumors fizzle out. \n            ",

McCarthy is in concussion protocol and his availability for Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks is in question, coach Kevin O'Connell announced Monday. If McCarthy is unable to go, rookie Max Brosmer would be in line to make his first career start. McCarthy apparently suffered the setback in Minnesota's 23-6 Week 12 loss to the Green Bay Packers. He was on the field for Minnesota's final drive late in the fourth quarter and threw an interception to Packers defensive back Evan Williams that allowed Green Bay to run the clock out. That was McCarthy's second interception of the game and 10th of the season. The former first-round pick also threw for a season-low 87 yards and posted a passer rating of 34.2, the worst of his career. McCarthy has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in four of his six starts this season. He entered the 2025 season as Minnesota's starter after the Vikings let former quarterback Sam Darnold, who will suit up for the Seahawks on Sunday, walk in free agency. \nMcCarthy had three interceptions to two touchdowns in Minnesota's first two games before suffering a high ankle sprain that kept him sidelined for over a month. McCarthy returned on Nov. 2 and led the Vikings to a win against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings are 0-3 in their last three games with McCarthy leading the offense. McCarthy, who joined Minnesota as the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, also missed all of his rookie season after tearing his meniscus in his first preseason game with the Vikings. \nBrosmer signed with Minnesota in April 2025 as an undrafted free agent. The Minnesota product made his first appearance on Sept. 21 against the Cincinnati Bengals and has completed five of his eight passes for 42 yards this season. \n            \n    ",

Daniels suffered a dislocated elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks and has not played or practiced since. Daniels, 24, has battled a bevy of injuries this season. He also sprained his knee late in the Commanders' Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed two games due to a hamstring injury. In total, Daniels appeared in just six of Washington's 11 games this season and emerged healthy from just three of them. Overall, he has thrown for 1,184 yards, eight touchdowns and two interceptions and run for 262 yards and two touchdowns, though most of his numbers are down from his Offensive Rookie of the Year-winning 2024 campaign.Quinn said the team had not had internal discussions about shutting Daniels down for the year, even given the team's record. He also did not have an exact timetable for Daniels' return. The Commanders face the Vikings in Week 14 and the Giants in Week 15.\nQuinn said getting Daniels reps down the stretch was important as he's \"learning to play the position at the highest level,\" though he later said the team will be smart with his return.\"You just gotta try to do what's best,\" Quinn said. \"By no means are we careless about that. It's important, not just for Jayden, but for the entire team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels' elbow injury is latest cruel knife twist in Commanders' season gone awry\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMarcus Mariota has played in Daniels' stead. Injuries have been a major issue for Washington this season, with wide receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) having played in just four games and fellow starting wide receiver Noah Brown having played in just two games. Starting running back Austin Ekeler, top pass rusher Dorance Armstrong and a plethora of other players are out for the season, and Washington has lost six straight games to fall to 3-8 one year after going 12-5 and reaching its first NFC Championship game in over 30 years.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Matt Norlander is on the Vegas Strip and bouncing back and forth between the two arenas hosting this year's Players Era Championship. He'll be providing frequent updates and insider information throughout each day of the event, so check back in regularly. This is his Monday notebook.   LAS VEGAS — The Big 12 had a really good Monday in Las Vegas. The league started the day by announcing a landmark five-year deal worth purportedly at least $50 million in revenue with Players Era. I've got a lot more on that further down the story, so be sure to scroll down and scope the details.Let's open with the on-court stuff from Monday, though. The league went 4-0, albeit with four close games: Baylor beat Creighton (81-74), No. 15 Iowa State won out in a great fight against No. 14 St. John's (83-82), Kansas (without Darryn Peterson) got separation down the stretch against Notre Dame (71-61) and, the surprise of the day: third-ranked Houston needed overtime to beat Syracuse (78-74). In the preseason, I said on Eye on College Basketball that I thought the league would ascend back to its status at the No. 1 conference. There's a long way to go, but through Monday night, the Big 12 has six teams still undefeated and a collective record of 75-14. \nAnd with four of the nine teams that will be 1-0 after Monday's slate here at Players Era, the conference has a healthy shot to have the eventual winner come Wednesday night. We'll see what Tuesday brings, when Iowa State plays shorthanded Creighton, Baylor gets tested against St. John's, Kansas faces suddenly interesting Syracuse and Houston gets the biggest test of all: No. 17 Tennessee.You can check the tip times for all those games at the very bottom of this story. Let's tour through the other action I saw on Monday. ISU loses Lipsey to injury; St. John's PG concerns remain The theme coming out of Iowa State's 83-82 win over St. John's: point guard play. And lack thereof. \nIowa State's Tamin Lipsey went down with a tough shot to the groin area with 2:09 remaining, prompting him to sit the rest of the game. Lipsey, a senior, is one of the better floor generals in college basketball. His status is uncertain for Iowa State's Tuesday morning Vegas-time tilt against Creighton. \"We're still evaluating,\" ISU coach TJ Otzelberger said after the game. \"The training staff, medical staff, just told us it's going to be a day-to-day, lower body extremity, so I don't have great detail on it. We haven't had time to really, truly evaluate him over time. So we'll get back to the hotel, check him out and see what that means.\" I caught up with Otzelberger one-on-one after the presser and he told me the injury is on the opposite leg from the groin issue that beleaguered Lipsey last season. Given how soft-tissue/groin/hamstring injuries can be fickle, it would be no shock if Lipsey didn't play Tuesday, or even Wednesday.  \nBut we'll see. Thanks in part to one of the better games of Milan Momcilovic's career (23 points, 5-of-9 3-point shooting), ISU was able to win out without its point guard on the floor in the pivotal final two minutes. The win improved ISU to 5-0 and was the Clones' second victory against a Power Five school this season (Mississippi State is the other).  St. John's also didn't have its starter at the 1 available down the stretch. The Johnnies dropped to 3-2 with their second loss vs. a power-conference opponent (Alabama being the other), as the glaring weakness of not having a true high-major point guard reared its head. Dylan Darling, a transfer from Idaho State, got his first start of the season and wound up fouling out with just four points and three assists.  As St. John's and ISU traded blows in the final minutes, the Red Storm had a chance to tie and send it to OT, but Pitino opted not to call timeout on SJU's final possession. I asked Pitino afterward why the no-call and he dismissed the question, citing St. John's getting two stoppages in final minute of game time. Still, St. John's wound up with a busted play that led to center Zuby Ejiofor launching a prayer from deep that didn't fall. Dillon Mitchell put back an offensive board as time expired.  \n\"With the game on the line, we didn't come up with the rebounds to put the game away,\" Pitino said afterward.  And that was pretty much his talking point: losing out on box-outs and not winning enough of the physical, one-on-one battles. Despite being irked by the loss, Pitino said he wasn't disappointed in the team's effort — and in fact was satisfied with the overall execution of the offense against a quality opponent. \"I have no gripes with the way our guys played,\" he said. \"It's a disappointing loss, very disappointing loss for us. But we've got to do something. You can't lose the game by giving second shots up. You're not going to win games that way. So, we'll make the adjustments.\" \nIt's important to not overstate or knee-jerk on Day 1 of these three-day/game MTEs, but with that said, St. John's game on Tuesday vs. Baylor is a matchup to monitor. A preseason top-10 team, SJU would be one of the bigger disappointments of the first three weeks of the season if it leaves Las Vegas 1-2 or worse.   New-look Baylor passes test vs. Creighton One of the more under-discussed bizarre stories of the offseason was Scott Drew having to replace his entire roster. A high-major program flipping over every scholarship is the kind of thing that happens due to a coaching change.  For a coach with a national championship on his résumé, it was bizarre. He also hasn't complained, at least not to my knowledge, about being put in a predicament not coach wants to be in.  \nAnd because of all the turnover, Baylor didn't enter the season ranked. The Bears weren't even projected to be in the top six of the Big 12. The hesitation was understandable. Baylor slipped last season, after all (20-15, a No. 9 seed in the NCAAs). But in BU's second test of the season against a power-conference opponent, the new-look Bears looked pretty nice. Drew's team beat Creighton 81-74 in the lid-lifter at Michelob Ultra Arena, leading wire-to-wire. When I talked to Drew in recent weeks, he felt great about this team's ability to jell and truly embrace each other. They didn't feel like a group that had just met a few months ago.  \"You work as hard as you can in the portal and trying to put together a team in a short period of time,\" Drew said after the win. We're always prayerful. We get who God wants us to have. We've got a good group that we enjoy going to practice with. They enjoy being together, and life is short. You want to be around people you enjoy, and that's been a blessing.\" \nThat chemistry played out nicely: Baylor's starters all hit double figures with Tennessee transfer Cameron Carr leading the way with 21 points. Carr could emerge as one of the breakout players at this event by the end of it if he keeps this up and Baylor can go at least 2-1.  Baylor's 4-0 and will get No. 14 St. John's on Tuesday. The Bluejays are 3-2, with both their losses to power-conference teams (the other at No. 12 Gonzaga) and faces No. 15 Iowa State. Greg McDermott's team is trying to be NCAA Tournament caliber after losing one of the best players in school history, Ryan Kalkbrenner, in addition to the likes of Steven Ashworth and Jamiya Neal. Making matters more difficult for the Jays, 6-10 starter Jackson McAndrew is out for the year due to a broken foot suffered less than a week ago.  Big 12, Players Era agree to massive five-year deal The Big 12 is getting into the equity space. But by investment, not loan.  The conference, Players Era and EverWonder Studio jointly announced Monday a partnership that will guarantee eight of the league's 16 teams inclusion in the Players Era Championship over the next five years. \nThe 18-team event that is paying out millions to schools and players will increase to a 32-team field in 2026 and beyond, Players Era organizers told CBS Sports. The expansion plan and the economics of how Players Era is pulling off something unprecedented has prompted a lot of reaction around college basketball.   In exchange for at least 25% representation in Players Era, the Big 12 hopes to earn back big money on its commitment. \"Over the next six years, Players Era will commit no less than $50 million dollars to Big 12 basketball programs in rights fees,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger said. \nPlayers Era is ballooning to 32 teams beginning in 2026. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The league is represented in the 2025 field by Baylor, Houston, Iowa State and Kansas. The informal arrangement is to send the top eight teams in the Big 12 standings at the end of each season into the ensuing season's Players Era event, though that will not be a hard-and-fast rule. For example, Arizona will likely be a top-eight team in the Big 12 this season, but the Wildcats are scheduled to play in the 2026 Maui Invitational.   \"If a school has prior commitments, we're never going to hurt a school, but ultimately, in the long-term the vast majority of [the top eight] Big 12 schools will play every year,\" Players Era co-founder Ian Orefice told CBS Sports.   The Big 12 could potentially end up with more than eight of the 32 spots, as Kansas, Baylor, Houston and Iowa State all have deals with Players Era into the end of the decade, Berger told CBS Sports, with Kansas' being the longest at six years and Houston's being a \"lifetime\" agreement so long as Kelvin and/or Kellen Sampson are coaching the Cougars.   \"The Big 12 Conference is thrilled to grow its partnership with Players Era,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. \"The tournament is a tremendous platform to showcase our conference, student-athletes and coaches as the best in college basketball, and we look forward to continuing to make Players Era a national marquee event.\"   \"You think about, if you're anchoring Players Era with the eight best Big 12 teams every year, it is already the best event in the country,\" Orefice said. \"With the commitments we've received now from the Big 12 and best teams in the country, we believe we are where we need to be to make sure Players Era is around for the long-term. We want all of the best teams, so we are actively talking to a few of the other select schools to figure out where we land in 2026 and beyond.\"    In addition to the 18 teams playing in this year's event, other teams that recently agreed to join Players Era include Louisville, Florida, Virginia, Miami and Texas A&M. Should all 18 schools playing in 2025 return for 2026, that means 24 of the 32 spots for next year are accounted for, per Berger, who's been involved in deep discussions with a few more schools trying to secure spots in the weeks to come.    Players Era has been under consistent scrutiny from competitors over its claims that it's a sustainable long-term model. The event will pay out more than $20 million to schools this year and has received major sponsorships from Geico, MGM Resorts, Publicis Groupe, Lilly, Sam's Club and more.   \"The 2025 men's tournament itself is profitable,\" Orefice said. \"We are incredibly proud to have made the financial commitment to schools.\"   Other high-major leagues were approached by Players Era about multi-year deals that would ensure representation in the event, per sources, but the Big 12 was the only conference willing to make the commitment. Monday's announcement is the next step in what organizers see as a huge evolution of what's now overtaken the Maui Invitational as the most prominent nonconference regular-season event in college hoops.   Berger and Orefice told CBS Sports they hope to secure a four-year media rights deal by the end of December. They have had discussions with \"four premium distributors.\" Players Era is currently a property under Warner Bros. Discovery, with the games airing on TNT and truTV.     \n        \n            \n                Big tournament, bigger money: How the Players Era event is changing college basketball in just its second year\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I think we're really close to getting this done. And when it's done, I think the number of teams that want to fill these last remaining spots is going to be many,\" Berger said. \"I feel like this is an opportunity to have a global impact for thousands of college basketball players.\"   2026 FORMAT: The 2026 Players Era will include four eight-team pools. The Big 12 will get at least two teams per pool, with the expectation that Big 12 schools will not play each other in the group stage. The tournament will play out over approximately three weeks in November 2026, with 16 teams one week, 16 more the next. From there, the four champions of each group will exclusively playing as the \"Four Kings\" of their respective pools in a final stage, with all four of those schools earning prize money that will total approximately $1 million. The winners of each group/pool will be determined by record, head-to-head, margin of victory (with a cap, as to not run up the score) and points per game allowed as tiebreakers.   \"There were many people who challenged the premise that early season college basketball can bring meaningful revenue for the event organizer and for the broadcast networks. Typically that's been left to broad season packages, conference championships and March Madness,\" Orefice said. \"If Players Era is even 10% of March Madness, it is a runaway financial success for the players, the schools and everyone involved.\"    2025 Players Era schedule, scores Games played in Las Vegas | All times ET Monday's gamesNo. 17 Tennessee 85, Rutgers 60RecapBaylor 81, Creighton 74 RecapKansas 71, Notre Dame 61RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 83, No. 14 St. John's 82RecapNo. 3 Houston 78, Syracuse 74 (OT)RecapNo. 21 Auburn 84, Oregon 73RecapNo. 12 Gonzaga vs. No. 8 Alabama9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 7 Michigan vs. San Diego State10:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. Maryland12 a.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden Arena Tuesday's games Rutgers vs. Notre Dame1 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 15 Iowa State vs. Creighton2 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaKansas vs. Syracuse3:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 14 St. John's vs. Baylor4:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 3 Houston vs. No. 17 Tennessee6 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 7 Michigan vs. No. 21 Auburn8:30 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. Maryland9:30 p.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaOregon vs. San Diego State11 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. No. 8 Alabama12 a.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden Arena Wednesday's games \t\t\t\tPremier Four\t\t\t\t Third-place game7 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaChampionship9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaConsolation games TBD\t\t\t\t  Thursday's games Consolation games TBD   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season is headed toward crunch time. As we wind down in Week 12, only six full weeks of regular-season action remain until the start of the playoffs. That means, while the postseason picture is far from finalized, the race for playoff berths -- and top seeding -- is well underway.Some preseason favorites like the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles are well on their way to the dance. Others, like the reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs and defending AFC South champion Houston Texans, are on the outside looking in, but making a late push. Meanwhile a slew of surprise contenders, from the New England Patriots to the Denver Broncos to the Indianapolis Colts, are currently challenging for the right to an early-playoff bye.Where, exactly, do all the playoff contenders sit? Which teams would be in the postseason if the schedule were halted today? And which clubs still have a shot to sneak into the mix down the stretch? Below is an updated rundown of the entire playoff picture, complete with remaining schedules for primary contenders:Complete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:\nAFC standingsNew England Patriots (10-2)Denver Broncos (9-2)Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Baltimore Ravens (6-5)Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Buffalo Bills (7-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (10-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Giants, vs. Bills, @ Ravens, @ Jets, vs. DolphinsDrake Maye is still on an MVP-caliber run as the face of Mike Vrabel's lineup, and the remaining slate sets them up well for the Patriots' first AFC East title since Tom Brady's final season with the club in 2019. Three of the Pats' final five opponents have losing records, and three of those five fall within the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (9-2)Remaining schedule: @ Commanders, @ Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, @ Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver is buoyed by Bo Nix's late-game composure and a stellar defense led by Vance Joseph. Dates with the rival Chiefs and Chargers in the final two weeks of the season will likely determine whether the Broncos can rob Kansas City of its 10th straight division crown. But this group is all but a lock to play January ball.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, @ Jaguars, @ Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, @ TexansCan Daniel Jones rediscover the early-year efficiency that made him a stunning breakout? He'll have to do so against some stingy defenses down the stretch, with almost every one of Indianapolis' remaining opponents boasting a top 10 scoring \"D.\" Accordingly, the Colts might be the safest bet to slip in these standings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Baltimore Ravens (6-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals, vs. Steelers, @ Bengals, vs. Patriots, @ Packers, @ Steelers\nLamar Jackson hasn't exactly lit it up since returning from a hamstring injury, so it stands to reason he's still feeling the effects of said issue. Fortunately for Baltimore, the defense has turned a major corner since October, putting the team in decent position to stay ahead of, or at least keep pace with, the slumping Pittsburgh Steelers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, @ Chiefs, @ Cowboys, vs. Texans, @ BroncosAmong the current wild card contenders, the Chargers might be in the most danger of losing their spot entirely. The Raiders in Week 13 should be very beatable. Otherwise, however, the Bolts will be up against some of the NFL's best defenses while struggling to keep Justin Herbert comfortable behind a depleted offensive line.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Remaining schedule: @ Titans, vs. Colts, vs. Jets, @ Broncos, @ Colts, vs. TitansThe mercurial Jaguars roared back to life in Week 11 by smashing the Chargers and escaped with an OT win against the Cardinals in Week 12. They've got a very favorable schedule moving forward. Two dates with the rival Titans bodes well for Liam Coen's squad, as does a matchup with the Jets.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (7-4)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. Jets\nJosh Allen is still capable of playing Superman, as evidenced in Buffalo's Week 11 win over Tampa Bay. But Sean McDermott's defense has been more volatile. New England may be out of reach atop the AFC East, but the Bills have a relatively clear path to a wild card berth if they can claim three or four of their final six matchups.In the huntThe Texans (6-5) aren't to be written off in the South despite C.J. Stroud's recent absence, with DeMeco Ryans' defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL. The Chiefs (6-5) finally rediscovered their late-game flair against the Colts in Week 12, but can Patrick Mahomes and Co. straighten out the offense? And the Steelers (6-5) have bigger issues than Aaron Rodgers now battling a wrist injury, with Mike Tomlin's defense a boom-or-bust operation.NFC standingsLos Angeles Rams (9-2)Philadelphia Eagles (8-3)Chicago Bears (8-3)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-5)Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Green Bay Packers (7-3-1)San Francisco 49ers (8-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (9-2)Remaining schedule: @ Panthers, @ Cardinals, vs. Lions, @ Seahawks, @ Falcons, vs. Cardinals\nMatthew Stafford is slinging it with as much, if not more, confidence than he did in his title-winning Rams debut. That means L.A. is poised to feast on lesser clubs like Carolina, Arizona and Atlanta moving forward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Philadelphia Eagles (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, @ Chargers, vs. Raiders, @ Commanders, @ Bills, vs. CommandersThe reigning Super Bowl champions are more rugged than explosive, but Vic Fangio's defense was playing lights out before blowing a huge lead in a loss to the Eagles. The NFC's No. 1 seed is still within reach, but the Eagles have competition and face a huge showdown with the Bears in Week 13.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Chicago Bears (8-3)Remaining schedule: @ Eagles, @ Packers, vs. Browns, vs. Packers, @ 49ers, vs. LionsThe No. 3 seed is where bigger questions arise in both conferences. Chicago, after all, has not necessarily been a clean operation with Caleb Williams at the controls. But the unit keeps winning under Ben Johnson's watch. Now comes a slew of big tests against more formidable foes like Philly and Green Bay.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, @ Panthers, @ Dolphins, vs. Panthers\nEvery year, the Bucs scrape their way through the NFC South race, regardless of who's healthy around Baker Mayfield. The remaining schedule suggests a fifth straight division crown is well within reach, although Week 12's blowout loss to the Rams showed the Bucs aren't ready to hang yet with the heavyweights in the NFC.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, @ Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, @ Panthers, @ 49ersEven after falling to the rival Rams in Week 11, Seattle should hang around in the race for the NFC West title due to Mike Macdonald's physical defense. It helps the Seahawks have a couple upcoming matchups with young and/or replacement quarterbacks; Week 13's date with Sam Darnold's old friends in Minnesota should be spicy.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Green Bay Packers (7-3-1)Remaining schedule: @ Lions, vs. Bears, @ Broncos, @ Bears, vs. Ravens, @ VikingsRaise your hand if you expected them to be trailing the Bears at this point in the year. Matt LaFleur's offense has been more scattershot than usual, but the NFC North is still up for grabs with four divisional matchups still on tap. We expect this group in the postseason one way or another. But it'll still be a fight.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. San Francisco 49ers (8-4)Remaining schedule: @ Browns, vs. Titans, @ Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksBrock Purdy finally returned in Week 11, taking over for long-term substitute Mac Jones, and San Francisco's attack hit new heights. All year, the 49ers have hung around, and now their defense should get some confidence-boosting matchups. The first one came against the Panthers, and despite Purdy's three first-half interceptions, the 49ers held on to defeat Carolina.In the huntThe Lions (7-4) are probably out of the mix for the No. 1 seed they held a year ago, but Dan Campbell's unit still has too much talent on both sides of the ball to be written off, as Jahmyr Gibbs' explosive Week 12 proved. The Panthers (6-6) have an outside chance to leapfrog the Bucs in the South if Bryce Young can bounce back from a poor performance against the 49ers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n            ",

It will be Burrow's first game in nearly three months. Bengals coach Zac Taylor said on Monday that he anticipates Burrow playing for the first time since he underwent surgery following a Grade 3 turf toe injury that was sustained back in Week 2. Burrow returned to practice two weeks ago in a limited capacity and was a full practice participant during the Bengals' first two practices last week. Burrow also spoke on his status for Thursday night by posting an old image of himself wearing a LeBron James jersey on social media with the caption, \"He's back.\" Burrow himself said two weeks ago that playing in Baltimore would be \"very\" significant for him. Baltimore is where Burrow's season ended prematurely two years ago after he suffered a wrist injury that ultimately required surgery. \nThe top overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in 2021, his first full season as the team's starting quarterback. He led Cincinnati to within a game of the Super Bowl the following season while garnering serious MVP consideration. Last year, Burrow won NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time after leading the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns. \nCincinnati (3-8) has won just one game since Burrow injured his toe during the team's win over the Jaguars. But despite his team's bleak playoff prospects, Burrow clearly feels compelled to play this season as long as he is physically able to do so, starting with Thursday night's game against the Ravens. \n            \n    ",

Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

    "body": "\n        Just when you thought byes were a thing of the past this NFL season, your Week 14 Fantasy football lineups have to account for four teams being off. That includes Fantasy star quarterbacks like Drake Maye and Jaxson Dart being on a bye, which causes a shuffle in the Week 14 Fantasy football QB rankings. Thus, players like Aaron Rodgers, C.J. Stroud, Bo Nix and Trevor Lawrence, who are often a part of Fantasy football start-sit decisions, may appear a bit more promising for this week, especially with the uncertain status of Justin Herbert (hand).Meanwhile, the likes of Tyrod Taylor, Jacoby Brissett and even rookie Tyler Shough all ranked among the top 12 in QB Fantasy points last week. Are any of them worth considering starting with some leagues beginning their 2025 Fantasy football playoffs this week? Players out for this week include Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) and Rome Odunze (foot), while Jayden Reed (foot/shoulder) and Omarion Hampton (ankle) are questionable after being on IR. Before making your Week 14 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 14 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 14 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 14 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 14 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 14: The model is fading Bears QB Caleb Williams, who has 10 total touchdowns, versus just one interception, over his last five games and is the QB8 this season. Williams, who has an over/under of 193.5 passing yards this week, has been the catalyst to Chicago sitting atop the NFC standings and having the No. 6 total offense, and while he's been efficient as of late, he hasn't been overly productive. He's had one or fewer touchdown passes in seven of his last nine games, and with Chicago going 8-1 over that stretch, the Bears won't tinker with their offensive strategy. Chicago takes on Green Bay on Sunday, with the Pack allowing the sixth-fewest Fantasy points to quarterbacks in 2025. Williams averaged just 189.5 passing yards versus the Packers last season, with one total touchdown, and he won't have the services of Odunze (foot) on Sunday. Williams may not warrant a spot in Week 14 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 15 in quarterback rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Dolphins tight end Darren Waller, who is the TE30 in standard leagues and the TE37 in PPR scoring. The veteran began the year sidelined, then played in a few games only to then head to IR, so he may have flown under the radar for many as he's only being started in 39% of leagues. But he returned to play last week and had 47 receiving yards, despite playing less than half of the snaps. Over his four games this year in which he received targets, Waller's averaged 41 yards with four total touchdowns. That scoring prowess has a great chance to continue in Week 14 versus the Jets, who have allowed the fifth-highest passer rating and the second-most touchdowns to tight ends in 2025. Even when not allowing scores, the Jets are still allowing yards to the position as Kyle Pitts (82 yards) had his most yards in over a calendar year versus New York last week.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff field has finally been set, and as expected the committee's at-large selections produced ample controversy as Miami finally jumped Notre Dame in the final rankings of the season to nab the last at-large spot. Alabama's 28-7 loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game didn't impact its ranking, as it stayed at No. 9, and American champ Tulane and Sun Belt champ James Madison earned the final two automatic qualifiers as the two highest-ranked conference champions after Duke became a five-loss ACC champ. The next two weeks will feature plenty of debate over the committee's decisions, but here we want to set that aside and go ahead and look at the matchups we will see on the football field in the first round of the playoff. We'll see a pair of rematches from the regular season, with Oklahoma beating Alabama and Ole Miss beating Tulane once already this year, and rematches are often tougher for the winning team the second time around. Another fascinating subplot is there being three teams going through coaching changes playing in the first round. James Madison and Tulane will still have Bob Chesney and Jon Sumrall, respectively, for their playoff games before they depart for UCLA and Florida, but Ole Miss will not have Lane Kiffin on the sidelines after he departed for LSU, with Pete Golding taking over in Oxford. \nAll of that will play out in two weeks, and here is how the oddsmakers view the first-round matchups. All times Eastern; Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNo. 9 Alabama (-1.5, 40.5) at No. 8 Oklahoma -- Friday, Dec. 19, (8 p.m.): The first of two rematches will send Alabama to Norman as the only road favorite in the first round. The Sooners effectively punched their ticket to the playoff with a stunning win in Tuscaloosa three weeks ago and then held on for dear life against Mizzou and LSU to stay at No. 8 despite some woeful offensive performances. There is a reason this total opened at 40.5, as neither of these offenses have been in stride of late. The Sooners haven't scored more than 23 points in their last three wins, but they are playing defense as well as anyone in the country. Brent Venables is happy to rely on that group to not just get stops, but to create turnovers and score points themselves. \nThat's how they beat Alabama the first time, and after another sloppy performance against Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, the Tide will have to clean up their offensive operation if they're going to avoid a second loss to the Sooners. Ty Simpson and the Alabama offense have been struggling, but they'll hope two weeks off can get them a bit healthier on that side of the ball and allow them to find the spark they'll need to advance to the quarterfinals. No. 10 Miami (+4.5, 51.5) at No. 7 Texas A&M -- Saturday, Dec. 20 (12 p.m.): These two teams met in the 2022 and 2023 season-openers, with the home team winning both times -- a trend A&M hopes to continue and Miami wants to break in the playoff. The Aggies enter the game as 4.5-point home favorites with a total of 51.5, as this game pits two top-20 scoring offenses against each other. Miami also boasts the nation's No. 6-ranked scoring defense, allowing just 13.8 points per game, but the question on everyone's mind is how they'll fare against this caliber of competition. Motivation should never be a question in the playoff, but the 'Canes ought to have plenty they want to prove about their ability to beat a top SEC team. The Aggies, meanwhile, may feel like the committee was overly penal in dropping them behind Ole Miss and to the No. 7 seed, giving them a matchup with the 'Canes instead of Tulane. \nIn terms of recent form, Miami is the team that's seemed to find its best over the last few weeks, while on the other side, Mike Elko will need to rally his Aggies after their season-ending loss to Texas where their offense seemed to run out of gas -- two weeks after needing a miraculous comeback to avoid a dreadful loss to South Carolina. We'll find out whether a few weeks off can get the Aggies refreshed and back to the form that had them as a top-3 team in the country for much of the season.\n        \n            \n                Notre Dame falling behind Miami, Ohio State over Georgia among College Football Playoff snubs, surprises\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 11 Tulane (+17.5, 56.5) at No. 6 Ole Miss -- Saturday, Dec. 20 (3:30 p.m.): We saw this game once in September, where the Rebels torched the Wave to the tune of a 45-10 victory. We'll find out if Tulane can fare better in a December trip to Oxford, but the oddsmakers are expecting another lopsided victory for Ole Miss, even with all of the turmoil of Lane Kiffin's departure. Both teams are in the midst of a coaching change, but Jon Sumrall will stick with Tulane through the playoff before leaving for Florida. Ole Miss, on the other hand, understandably refused to let Kiffin stay and this game will be the first of the Pete Golding era. The expectation is not just to win but to win comfortably, and anything less than that will lead to some alarm bells going off for the Ole Miss faithful. \nWe know what Ole Miss is capable of against this opponent, but we still are waiting to find out exactly how focused they are on the task at hand after a wild couple of weeks. Rematches are often tougher when you're the team that won -- as we saw with Alabama in the SEC title game -- and Tulane will hope that the game tape from their lopsided loss reveals some opportunities to make dramatic improvements. No. 12 James Madison (+21.5, 50.5) at No. 5 Oregon -- Saturday, Dec. 20 (7:30 p.m.): The Dukes are the biggest underdog of the first round, as expected, but Bob Chesney's bunch will be trying to shock the world at Autzen. Oregon has had its ups and downs this season, but it has been rounding into strong form of late and appear to have figured out how to get its offense rolling again after a midseason swoon. The defense is among the nation's most dominant, allowing just 14.8 points per game, and they are going to look to overwhelm the Dukes on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the football. Chesney is going to have to scheme up a masterpiece to give the Dukes any kind of chance here, because we saw against Louisville early this year that it's just hard for them to sustain drives given the difference in size they have on the offensive line. \nIf the Dukes aren't just happy to be there and aren't worried about simply keeping it respectable, they should go into this game going for broke. I'd expect some trickery and aggression from James Madison, which could end in disaster but is also the best chance they have at a stunning upset. On the other side, Dan Lanning's bunch should be looking to put the Dukes away early. I would expect an early commitment to the running game and allowing that to open up some downfield shots for Dante Moore to try and take the drama out of this matchup quickly. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs will host the Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football in a pivotal matchup for both teams. The Chiefs are led by arguably the two biggest names in the sport in Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, but these aren't the players the SportsLine Projection Model is backing in Week 14 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorers bets when online sports betting. One of the model's top anytime TD scorer bets involves Mahomes, however, with the model projecting value in Kansas City receiver Rashee Rice to score. The model projects him to score in more than 50% of simulations, showing strong value at +125 odds at BetMGM. The model is also backing Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, as well as Texans wide receiver Jayden Higgins in its Week 14 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets. Higgins, a rookie, has scored in two of his last four games. Missouri residents can finally bet on the Chiefs as well, following Missouri sports betting going live on Monday.

New users receive 20 100% profit boost token with your first $1 bet:Rashee Rice, Chiefs (+125)The Chiefs are making up for lost time without Rice, as Kansas City was without its most dynamic wide receiver for the first six weeks due to a suspension. The 25-year-old has five touchdowns in six games this year, including scoring twice in Kansas City's 31-28 loss to the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. Rice has at least seven targets in all six games, including back-to-back games with 12 targets, and he's averaging 9.8 targets per game as Mahomes' top option in the passing attack. The model expects this usage to continue with the Chiefs facing a situation where if they lose Sunday, they'll be in a challenging position to reach the postseason. The model views Rice as the top candidate to find the end zone on Sunday Night Football.Click here to bet on Rice as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+155)Hunt scored a touchdown in four straight games before having his streak snapped last week against Dallas, but Hunt remains one of the most reliable scorers in the NFL. The 5-11, 216-pound back has the size to be utilized at and near the goal line, which has resulted in five touchdowns over his last five games. Even with Isiah Pacheco back from a knee injury last week, Hunt played 64% of snaps compared to Pacheco's 30%, and he had 14 carries compared to Pacheco's three. Expect a heavier Hunt usage again this week with Hunt averaging a reliable 4.0 yards per carry, and the model projects value in Hunt at +155 odds to score on what's likely to be a chilly Sunday evening in Kansas City. Click here to bet on Hunt as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in free bets if your first $5 bet wins: Jayden Higgins, Texans (+400)Higgins was an early second-round pick, No. 34 overall, in the 2025 NFL Draft, and he's showcased why, especially in recent weeks. The 6-4, 215-pound receiver has a touchdown in two of his last four games. After seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in four straight contests, averaging seven targets per game during that stretch. Those targets have led to production, with more than 40 yards in three of four games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. Kansas City's game plan will likely revolve around containing Nico Collins, which creates opportunities for Higgins. At +400 odds at BetMGM and given his increased involvement lately, the model sees strong value in playing Higgins in Sunday Night Football anytime TD bets. Click here to bet on Higgins as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Want more Week 14 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Chiefs vs. Texans in Week 14 Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        In the end, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee took the path of least resistance, bringing head-to-head into the conversation for the first time this season in their final placement of Miami over Notre Dame for the last at-large spot in Sunday's 12-team bracket.Ninth-ranked Alabama did not move despite a 21-point loss to Georiga in the SEC Championship Game, centering the discussion on the Hurricanes and Fighting Irish for the last spot. Miami entered the final rankings at No. 12, while Notre Dame was No. 10.Both teams were idle during conference championship weekend.\"We felt like the way BYU performed in their championship game, a second loss to Texas Tech in a similar fashion, was worthy of Miami moving ahead of them in the rankings,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said Sunday. \"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison. … The one metric we had to fall back on was the head to head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"Yurachek said Duke's win over Virginia and the idea of the ACC being excluded from the bracket entirely \"had absolutely no impact\" on the decision to include Miami at No. 10.\n\"Our charge is to rank the top 25 teams, then you fill out the 5 highest-ranked conference champions and seven at-large spots for the bracket,\" Yurachek said.Miami ended the season on a four-game winning streak with a margin of victory at 27.5 points per game. The Cougars, after losing to Texas Tech on Nov. 1, had won three straight at a 21 points per game clip prior to Saturday's 34-7 beatdown at the hands of the Red Raiders. The metrics were extremely tight when it comes to Miami's case against Notre Dame (10-2) and BYU (11-2) on paper. Game control was this committee's preferred metric as we've seen the last four weeks of rankings and ranked wins are supposed to mean something -- and they did during final deliberations.\nIn terms of common opponents as it relates to Notre Dame specifically, Miami beat NC State 41-7, Syracuse 38-10, Stanford 42-7 and Pittsburgh 38-7. And the Hurricanes beat three of the four common opponents shared with Notre Dame by an even wider margin.Following Tuesday night's penultimate rankings, Yurachek left the door open for the Hurricanes. A loss for BYU placed Miami right behind Notre Dame for the first time during this playoff discussion and was the final data point needed for the boost.\"The management committee during the offseason provided some clarification to some comments that were made last year, and indeed idle teams can move following the results of the championship games,\" Yurachek said earlier this week. \"And how they impact the teams that are around those that play in the championship game and data such as strength of schedule, teams that may be idle. So yes, teams that are idle can move up or down.\"\nMiami will travel to seventh-seeded Texas A&M in the opening round.\n            ",

Now that the dust has settled on the regular season and conference championship weekend, we know the 12 teams that will compete for the national title.It comes as no surprise that Indiana secured the top overall seed after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. It's the highest ranking in program history as the Hoosiers enter the postseason as legitimate national contenders, fresh off their first outright conference title in 80 years.Ohio State didn't fall far. The Buckeyes, looking to defend their 2024 national championship, landed at No. 2, followed by SEC champion Georgia at No. 3 and Big 12 champion Texas Tech at No. 4. Those four teams earn opening-round byes.Oregon (No. 5), Ole Miss (No. 6), Texas A&M (No. 7) and Oklahoma (No. 8) will each host first-round games.The top eight was mostly locked entering Sunday's selection show. Beyond that is where the intrigue surfaced. Alabama wasn't punished for its lopsided loss in the SEC title game, holding firm at No. 9. That sets up a first-round rematch with Oklahoma, which beat the Crimson Tide earlier this season.The real controversy came at No. 10, where Miami edged Notre Dame for the final at-large bid despite trailing the Irish in every previous set of rankings.For the first time ever, two Group of Five teams reached the playoff. No. 11 Tulane earned its bid by winning the American Conference, while No. 12 James Madison benefited from ACC chaos to slide in as Sun Belt champion.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma: 8 p.m. | ABC/ESPNGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner -- : 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner -- : 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 12-team College Football Playoff was supposed to limit the controversy and include more teams in the field. Instead, the expanded system has only created more anger as more fanbases feel snubbed. The bubble of the 2025 field was extra complicated because almost any decision broke with prior precedents. There was the head-to-head issue, where a win by Miami over Notre Dame conflicted with their previous rankings. Last year, SMU was not knocked out of the field after losing a conference championship game; Alabama falling out of would have changed that. But after the final reveal, there are some serious snubs and surprises. Here are a few coming out of the selection committee's final decisions. Snubbed: Flipping Notre Dame and MiamiHeading into the final week of the regular season, Notre Dame rested comfortably multiple spots ahead of Miami, even outranking Alabama. Then, the Crimson Tide suddenly moved up a spot after a mediocre performance against 5-7 Auburn. And now, after not even playing on conference championship Saturday, the committee inexplicably decided to jump Miami two spots over Notre Dame. \nGranted, Miami had a head-to-head victory over the Fighting Irish that they had previously ignored. To hear CFP chair Hunter Yurachek say it, the committee did not view these teams as being comparable. But despite no new information, the committee simply changed their minds with little explanation. Suddenly, the teams became comparable. Now, Notre Dame will miss the College Football Playoff after dropping behind both Alabama and Miami despite winning games by a combined 119-27 over their final two weeks.  \n        \n            \n                Grading the College Football Playoff Selection Committee's final bracket: Were the right calls made?\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSurprised: Ohio State over GeorgiaThe Buckeyes went into the Big Ten Championship Game as the undefeated No. 1 team in the country. From that standpoint, Ohio State didn't deserve too much blame for losing a tight 13-10 decision against No. 1 Indiana. Still, it's a little surprising that the committee did not credit Georgia more after its SEC Championship Game domination. \nThe Bulldogs came into Saturday at No. 3 and avenged their only loss after dominating Alabama 28-7. Outside of the early 24-21 loss against the Tide in September, Georgia has two wins over College Football Playoff teams, along with a more impressive common opponent victory over Texas. Their strength of schedule far outflanks Ohio State -- No. 15 vs. 30. Granted, the only team that the committee punished for losing a conference title game this year was BYU. Flipping Ohio State and Indiana was as far as they were willing to go in the Big Ten. Snubbed: Texas A&M's pathTexas A&M was 11-0 heading into the final week of the season before losing a rivalry game against No. 13 Texas. After the lone loss, the Aggies slipped four spots to No. 7, surprisingly dropping even behind an Ole Miss squad with a strength of schedule in the 40s. \nNow, the slight rankings adjustment makes for a brutally harder path for the Aggies. Texas A&M hosts Miami in the first round of the College Football Playoff at Kyle Field instead of Tulane. Then, if they win, they get Ohio State in the second round. Georgia in the Sugar Bowl wouldn't have been an easy matchup, but the Buckeyes have been the most complete team in the country for most of the year. And then, if they break through the quarters, it's that same Georgia team in the national semis. A Miami-Ohio State-Georgia pathway could be the most brutal on the board. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Houston Texans have put themselves in the thick of the playoff race with their current four-game winning streak, while the Kansas City Chiefs have lost three of their last four contests and are in danger of missing the postseason for the first time during the Patrick Mahomes era. The Chiefs (6-6) attempt to keep alive their hopes when they host the red-hot Texans (7-5) at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football.Kansas City's chances of winning a 10th consecutive AFC West title are very slim as it trails the division-leading Denver Broncos (10-2) by four games with five to play. But more importantly, the Chiefs are at risk of being home for the playoffs for the first time since 2014, when Alex Smith was their quarterback and Mahomes was completing his freshman season at Texas Tech.After losing its first two games of the 2025 campaign, Kansas City seemingly returned to its dominant ways by winning five of its next six. However, the team dropped three of its next four contests, all by one score, and needed a late rally to edge the Indianapolis Colts in overtime in Week 12 for its lone victory in that span. The Chiefs are third in their division, behind Denver and the Los Angeles Chargers (8-4), and two games out of the final wild card spot in the AFC.Houston also is on the outside looking in but is just one game back in both the wild card race and the AFC South. The Texans have climbed within reach of both the Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4) and Colts (8-4) in their quest for a third consecutive division crown as they won three straight with backup Davis Mills under center before C.J. Stroud returned from a concussion last week to help the club post a 20-16 victory at Indianapolis. Much of the team's current success can be attributed to its defense, which ranks first in the NFL in total defense (265.7 yards allowed) and points allowed (16.5).Seven games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a showdown between the Denver Nuggets (16-6) and Charlotte Hornets (7-16) at 6 p.m. ET at the Spectrum Center. Denver has begun its four-game road trip with a pair of wins, including a 134-133 triumph over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday.Meanwhile, the NHL has eight games on its slate, one of which has the Washington Capitals (17-9-3) hosting the Columbus Blue Jackets (13-9-6) at Capital One Arena at 7 p.m. ET. Washington is coming off a 4-3 shootout loss to the Anaheim Ducks on the road that ended its six-game winning streak but extended its points run to seven contests.There also is a plethora of college basketball games on Sunday, including a matchup between SMU (8-1) and Texas A&M (7-2) at 5 p.m. ET in the Hoop Hype XL College Basketball Showcase at College Park Center in Arlington. Tex. The Aggies have won five straight contests, while the Mustangs had their season-opening eight-game winning streak snapped by Vanderbilt last Wednesday.The Chiefs are 3.5-point favorites against the Texans in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Nuggets are 10.5-point favorites against the Hornets, the Capitals are -187 favorites on the money line against the Blue Jackets and SMU is a 2.5-point favorite against Texas A&M.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Dec. 7. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchTexans at ChiefsTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Kansas City, Mo. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 41.5 (-107) | Expert: Texans +3.5 (+100)Kansas City has won five straight meetings with Houston, including a pair of playoff matchups. The Chiefs are ninth in the NFL in scoring, producing an average of 25.4 points per game. But the Texans' defense is the stingiest in the league as the team has held opponents under 20 points in three straight contests, five of its last six and nine overall this season. The SportsLine Projection Model sees another strong defensive effort from Houston as the Under hits in 55% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall believes that with the dominance of their defense and Stroud healthy, the Texans will cover the spread.More NFL best betsBears-Packers Over 44 (-110, Sportsline model play)Broncos -7.5 (-110, R.J.

They've been scoring at a feverish pace away from home of late, producing at least 125 points in each of their last four outings and 130 or more in the past three. All four of Denver's last four road games have had 240+ combined points scored, and the SportsLine Projection Model thinks that streak will continue as its simulations say the Over hits 60.5% of the time. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner feels Charlotte guard Kon Knueppel will contribute to that cause, as he is averaging 18.2 points and Denver will be without two of its better defenders in Christian Braun (ankle) and Aaron Gordon (hamstring).NHL best bets, where to watchBlue Jackets at CapitalsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Washington, D.C. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Capitals -187 | Expert: Capitals -1 (-128)Washington has lost in regulation just once in its last 12 games, going 9-1-2 over that span. One of those victories was a 5-1 home triumph over the Blue Jackets in which defenseman Jakob Chychrun scored a pair of goals. Fellow blue-liner John Carlson also contributed offensively, netting a tally and set up another, and he did the same when the Capitals also posted a 5-1 victory at Columbus in October. The SportsLine Projection Model sees Washington improving to 3-0-0 against the Blue Jackets this season as the Capitals win in 66% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (+1234.5, 20-5-4 on his last 29 NHL spread picks) likes Washington to cover the puck line since Columbus is coming off a 7-6 overtime loss at Florida on Saturday and scored only twice on 58 shots against Capitals goaltender Logan Thompson in the first two meetings between the Metropolitan Division rivals.CBB best bets, where to watchSMU vs. Texas A&MTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Arlington, Tex. | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: SMU -119The Mustangs will be eager to get back on the court as they've had three days to lick their wounds following their first loss of the season, an 88-69 setback at No. 17 Vanderbilt. Head coach Andy Enfield's squad is tied for 23rd in the nation in scoring with an average of 89.4 points per game and has registered six of its eight victories by double digits. Texas A&M has yet to allow more than 87 points this campaign and hasn't tasted defeat since suffering an 86-74 loss against UCF on Nov. 14, but the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Mustangs returning to their winning ways as its simulations have them winning 58% of the time.\n            ",

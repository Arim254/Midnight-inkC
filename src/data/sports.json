    "body": "\nMuch of the NFC's power was concentrated in the NFC West this season, and it's only fitting that two of the three West teams to make the playoffs will now meet in the NFC Championship Game, as the Seattle Seahawks will host the Los Angeles Rams. Both teams have, at various points of the season, looked like the NFL's best team. The two sides split their two regular-season meetings -- with both winning at home -- and the winner of the rubber match will earn a berth in the Super Bowl, where either the Denver Broncos or New England Patriots will be waiting. Kickoff from Lumen Field is set for 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday and game-time temperatures are expected to be in the low-40s with no precipitation in the forecast. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The over/under for total points is 45.5.

    "body": "\nInterest in NFL player props always increases as the importance of games increases as well, and such is the case with the penultimate week of the 2026 NFL playoffs. We've reached the NFL Championship Round with Broncos vs. Patriots (-3.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) in the AFC title game and Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) in the NFC title game. Prop bets for the likes of Drake Maye, Courtland Sutton, Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams and Sam Darnold will be among the most sought after with NFL picks, but considering overlooked players could find value with your NFL bets.Jarrett Stidham could be one of those as he starts in place of Bo Nix (ankle), and the former has an NFL props total of 0.5 interceptions (-202/+157) for Sunday. Those NFL prop odds for the Under are intriguing considering Denver may heavily lean on the run, and limiting Stidham's pass attempts would, in theory, limit his chances to throw a pick. There are several other plus-money NFL props available in the latest NFL championship round odds. Before locking in any conference championship NFL picks, you'll want to check out the top NFL player props and NFL prop predictions for the AFC and NFC championship games powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 bet wins on props like Stidham under 0.5 interceptions:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Championship Round NFL betting, the Machine Learning Model has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided prop picks for every position. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for the NFC and AFC Championship Games at SportsLine.Top NFL Championship Round QB, RB, WR, TE player prop picksHere's a look at some of the top Championship Round NFL prop picks from SportsLine AI: Quarterback: Sam Darnold, Seahawks: Under 1.5 passing touchdowns (-114)Darnold has gone under his passing touchdowns total in four of his last five games, including having one or fewer touchdown in each of his last three games. Darnold notoriously struggles when pressured, and the Rams have the fourth-best pressure rate in the league as they forced Darnold into a zero-touchdown, four-interception game earlier this year. SportsLine AI has Darnold having 0.7 passing TDs on average in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Darnold to go under 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nRunning back: TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots: Over 9.5 carries (+118)Denver led the NFL with 68 sacks, and the best way to neutralize a ferocious pass rush is by running the ball. Henderson has received double-digit carries in 10 of his last 12 games as he had 50 more rushing attempts than Rhamondre Stevenson in the regular season. The Broncos were just gashed for 183 yards versus Buffalo, which is the most Denver has allowed all season, as Henderson will be involved early and often. He's forecasted to have 12.9 carries in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Henderson to go over 9.5 carries at DraftKings:\nWide receiver: Puka Nacua, Rams, Over 92.5 receiving yards (-114)Nacua had an even 300 combined receiving yards in the pair of regular-season contests versus Seattle, including a career-high of 225 yards in the last matchup. The wideout has drawn double-digit targets in each of his last seven games, and Seattle owns the No. 3 run defense, compared to the No. 10 pass defense, so attacking the Seahawks through the air will be the preferred option. Nacua is forecasted to have 111 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Nacua to go over 92.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nTight end: AJ Barner, Seahawks, Under 29.5 receiving yards (-114)Seattle is favored on Sunday versus the Rams, and Barner has gone under his receiving yards market in seven of the last 10 games when the Seahawks are favored. He wasn't even targeted last week, despite playing more snaps than any other Seahawks RB, WR or TE, and Barner had just 14 yards the prior week. The Machine Learning Model has Barner finishing with 18.6 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Barner to go under 29.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make NFL Championship Round prop betsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model locked in confident NFL prop picks involving stars like Matthew Stafford, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Davante Adams and more. It's also identified a tight end with a plus-money payout and has over 20 other NFL props rated 4 stars or better.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams as the 2026 AFC Championship Game and the 2026 NFC Championship Game are both set to unfold on Sunday. The Broncos will host the Patriots in the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and Denver's quarterback sittuation looms large in this matchup. Jarrett Stidham will replace Bo Nix, who was lost for the season on an ankle injury sustained late in Denver's win over Buffalo. The latest NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list the Broncos as 3.5-point home underdogs with the total at 43.5. The NFC title game showcases the NFC West as the Seattle Seahawks (-2.5, 45.5) host the Los Angeles Rams. These teams split their head-to-head matchups in the regular season straight up, against the spread and on both sides of the total, so how should you formulate your NFL best bets this time around? SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and NFL best bets as the conference championship games approach. A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this regular season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFC Championship game and 2026 AFC Championship Game, studied each matchup and the NFL odds in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+3.5)\n\"With two excellent defenses and Denver starting a backup quarterback, I just can't see this one turning into a Broncos-Bills type of shootout. My top play is the Under (43.5). I have a hard time seeing either team score more than 24 in this one. While I would've probably leaned Denver at home with a healthy Bo Nix, it's hard to imagine Jarrett Stidham pulling a Jeff Hostetler (see the 1990 Giants) and leading his team to the Super Bowl. Whereas the NFC game will likely be exciting to watch from an offensive standpoint, expect just the opposite here. Both of these teams have skated by with relatively easy schedules this season. This time, the Nix injury benefits New England significantly. The thing is, Drake Maye doesn't have to play well for New England to win. If the Patriots can run the ball effectively like Buffalo did last week, Denver is toast. And that's exactly what will happen.\"Pick: Patriots 21, Broncos 13Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\"Dating back to 2024, Sam Darnold has faced the Rams four times. His teams are 1-3 in those games, with the one win being a large blown lead by Los Angeles and won on a 2-point conversion (in December 2025). He's thrown six interceptions against L.A. already this season and is once again likely not to be 100% on Sunday with an oblique injury. Meanwhile, Matthew Stafford hasn't thrown an interception against Seattle this season (5 TDs, 0 INTs). Though Stafford hasn't been at his best this postseason, I can't possibly pick Darnold over him in a big game. I saw these two face off in person last January in a playoff game moved to Arizona and if it was a prize fight, they would've stopped it in the third round. While I'm not expecting Rams star wide receiver Puka Nacua to post a 225 yard, two touchdown performance against Seattle like he did in Week 16, I'm also not sure that the Seahawks have an effective answer to slow him down. In yet another playoff thriller, Los Angeles moves on to the Super Bowl for the second time in five seasons.\"Pick: Rams 27, Seahawks 23How to get more NFL conference championship picksSportsLine's model has simulated both conference championship game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\n        NFL DFS players have their final multi-game slate of the year as Championship Sunday brings both the AFC Title Game and the NFC Title Game. The Broncos and Patriots (-3.5, 43) play at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. Rams (+2.5, 46) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Injuries will play a big part in both matchups with Bo Nix (ankle) out for Denver and Zach Charbonnet (ACL) out for Seattle. Denver, especially, will have a new look on offense and daily Fantasy football players will have to craft a strategy around how to value backup Jarrett Stidham and pass catchers such as Courtland Sutton, Evan Engram and Troy Franklin (questionable). Denver also won't have running back J.K. Dobbins, who attempted to return from a foot injury, but was ruled out on Friday. Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Sunday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks on Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for SundayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Rams receiver Puka Nacua. He's been a daily Fantasy stalwart all season with a massive 129-1,715-10 receiving line. He hasn't slowed much in the NFL playoffs, turning 28 targets into 15 catches for 167 yards and a score through two games. A new wrinkle has been using him as a runner. He's now had three straight weeks with multiple carries, giving him even more daily Fantasy value. The Seahawks are tough defensively, but he sliced them up for 12 catches, 225 yards and two touchdowns in Week 16.

He should see an already heavy workload expand against the Rams with Charbonnet done for the year. Walker's track record against the Rams this year was already strong as he totaled 275 scrimmage yards and two scores against them in their two matchups in the regular season. The Rams have also allowed 160-plus rushing yards in three of their last five games after doing so just twice over their first 14 games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Walker to go Over 86.5 rushing yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

Seattle's defense has given up a combined 44 points in six of its last seven games, excluding the win over Los Angeles. The Rams notched a 21-19 win over the Seahawks in November, as the Rams picked off Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold four times.

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots followed back-to-back 4-13 seasons with a 14-3 showing in Mike Vrabel's first year as head coach. They're now one win away from adding to their NFL record with a 12th Super Bowl appearance.No. 2 seed New England can secure a Super Bowl berth for the first time since 2018 when they visit Empower Field to face the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos at 3 p.m. ET in the AFC Championship Game. The winner will compete in Super Bowl LX against the victor of the NFC Championship Game, which has the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks hosting the No. 5 seed Los Angeles Rams at Lumen Field at 6:30 p.m. ET.The Patriots, who went 8-0 on the road during the regular season, played their first two postseason games at home, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 16-3 and Houston Texans 28-16. Denver (14-3) posted its first playoff victory since 2015 last weekend as it avenged last year's wild-card loss by edging the visiting Buffalo Bills 33-30 in overtime. However, the Broncos will have backup Jarrett Stidham under center in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the win against the Bills.Seattle (14-3), which ended the regular season with a seven-game winning streak, kept rolling as it demolished the San Francisco 49ers 41-6 at home in the Divisional Round. The Rams (12-5), who were the last team to defeat the Seahawks (21-19 in Week 11), have been road warriors as they got past the Carolina Panthers 34-31 and Chicago Bears 20-17 in OT.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Brooklyn Nets (12-31) and Los Angeles Clippers (20-24) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, Cal. The Clippers extended their winning streak in the series to four games with a 121-105 victory at Brooklyn earlier this month.The NHL has six games on its slate, one of which has the Pittsburgh Penguins (25-14-11) visiting Rogers Arena to take on the Vancouver Canucks (17-29-5) at 6 p.m. ET. The Penguins, who posted a 5-1 home triumph in their first meeting with Vancouver this season, won the first three contests of their four-game road trip while the Canucks have recorded one victory in their last 13 outings (1-10-2).One of just a handful of college basketball games taking place Sunday is a Big Ten Conference showdown between USC (14-5) and Wisconsin (14-5) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc. The Badgers are riding a five-game winning streak while the Trojans have lost four of six contests, including their last two.The Patriots are 3.5-point favorites against the Broncos in the latest consensus NFL odds, while the Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites against the Rams. The Clippers are 8.5-point favorites against the Nets, the Penguins are -149 favorites on the money line against the Canucks and Wisconsin is a 7.5-point favorite against USC.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Jan. 25. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchPatriots at BroncosTime: 3 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Broncos +3.5 (-108) | Expert: Marvin Mims Jr. Over 1.5 rushing yards (-119, PropBetGuy)The Broncos will be in unfamiliar territory as Stidham makes his first start since 2023 and just the fifth of his NFL career. It also will be his first playoff start. But Denver went 8-1 at home this campaign and New England quarterback Drake Maye has had issues holding on to the football this postseason, fumbling a total of six times in two games. The SportsLine Projection Model feels Stidham will keep the Broncos close as they cover the spread in 58% of its simulations. SportsLine props expert PropBet Guy (66-41, +1916 on his last 107 NFL player prop picks) thinks Denver head coach Sean Payton will have some tricks up his sleeve and get wideout Marvin Mims Jr. involved in the running game against a Patriots team that allowed opposing receivers to gain 8.9 yards per carry in the regular season.Rams at SeahawksTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Seattle | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Seahawks -2.5 (-106) | Expert: Rams Over 22.5 points (-114, Larry Hartstein)The Rams were favored in their first two postseason games and failed to cover the spread. They're now underdogs against a Seattle team that has posted three consecutive double-digit victories. The SportsLine Projection Model has a lot of confidence in the Seahawks in this matchup as its simulations have them covering 58% of the time. While Seattle has allowed 10 points or fewer in each of its last three games, SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein believes the Rams will be able to break through as they put up 37 at Lumen Field in Week 16 without the services of some key offensive weapons.NBA best bets, where to watchNets at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 211.5 (-106) | Expert: Clippers -8.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)These teams are among the worst in the NBA offensively as the Nets are last in scoring (108.3 points per game) and the Clippers are 25th (112.3). But Los Angeles has been productive of late, recording at least 112 points in 11 of its last 16 contests, and the Nets have exceeded their average in four of their past six outings. The teams combined for 226 points when they met earlier this month, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees another high-scoring affair as the Over hits in 68% of its simulations. Kawhi Leonard (knee/illness) is questionable for this matchup, but SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+521 on his last 21 spread picks involving Brooklyn) is confident the Clippers will handle the Mets whether he's in the lineup or not.NHL best bets, where to watchPenguins at CanucksTime: 6 p.m. | Location: Vancouver | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Canucks +1.5 (-196) | Expert: Penguins -143 (Thomas Casale)The Penguins haven't had much difficulty on their road trip thus far, as they defeated the Seattle Kraken, Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers by three or more goals. Vancouver is in a major tailspin but has been very competitive of late, sandwiching one-goal losses around the lone victory in its last 13 outings. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Canucks will at least keep this contest close as its simulations have them covering the spread 68% of the time. SportsLine expert Thomas Casale likes the Penguins to finish their four-game trek with a perfect record, especially since they've won six of their last seven away from home.CBB best bets, where to watchUSC at WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 158.5 (-108) | Expert: Wisconsin -7.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Badgers (second, 84.3 points per game) and Trojans (fifth, 82.6) are among the top five highest-scoring teams in the Big Ten. However, USC has had trouble on offense of late, registering fewer than 70 points in each of its last two outings. The SportsLine Projection Model has taken that into consideration and its simulations have the Under hitting more than 52% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+257 on his last 51 college basketball ATS picks) feels Wisconsin will make things difficult for the Trojans and cruise to its sixth consecutive victory.\n            ",

He then clapped his hands loudly in frustration, put on his socks and turned to face the media. He had bad news to deliver about his right calf, which had been limiting him all night and kept him out of the final 34 seconds. \"The next steps will be go to MRI tomorrow, after the MRI they will tell me probably I popped something in my calf, or my soleus, something. They'll probably give me a protocol of 4-6 weeks that I'll be out. This is from my experience being around in the NBA,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"After that, I'm going to work my butt off to come back. That will probably be the end of February, beginning of March. Hopefully the team will be in a place that we can at least make the Play-In or the playoffs. Just take it day-by-day, try to get better.\"The Bucks have not announced an official timeline for Antetokounmpo's injury, but he missed over three weeks earlier this season with a calf strain on the same leg, and indicated that this injury felt the same to him. He is likely heading back to the sidelines for an extended period, and could be out through the trade deadline (Feb. 5) and All-Star Weekend (Feb. 13-15), and possibly longer. \nWhat does that mean for him and the Bucks, and could this injury actually be a blessing in disguise? Time to tank?The Bucks got off to a 4-1 start that included wins over the Toronto Raptors, Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks. It seemed as though their audacious offseason plan to waive-and-stretch Damian Lillard, sign Myles Turner and surround Antetokounmpo with shooting could pay off. Since then, however, they've been one of the worst teams in the league, in part due to a parade of injuries. Friday's loss to the Nuggets was their sixth in the last eight games, and they're now a season-worst eight games below .500. At 18-26, they are in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, 2 ½ games behind the Atlanta Hawks for the final Play-In Tournament spot. \nThe Bucks are closer to the Brooklyn Nets for the fifth-worst record in the league than they are to the Philadelphia 76ers for a top-six spot in the East. For the season, the Bucks are 3-11 with Antetokounmpo out of the lineup. At that pace, they have little hope of still being in the Play-In race if he's out until after the All-Star break. While the Bucks do not control their own first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, they will have a first-round pick. They will receive the least favorable of their pick and the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round pick. The 11-36 Pelicans have the second-worst record in the league and are well on their way to a top-five selection. If both teams are bad, that guarantees the Bucks a good pick. It's impossible for the Bucks to get the No. 1 overall pick, but they could pick as high as No. 2 if they continue to fall down the standings and get some lottery luck. A top-five selection in what is regarded as a generational draft class is well within the realm of possibility, depending on when/if Antetokounmpo returns. The Bucks haven't drafted higher than No. 10 since Antetokounmpo came to town, and this could be a rare chance to get an elite talent while he is still on the roster. \n\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo shouldn't play another game for the Bucks this season, and probably not ever again\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat about the trade deadline? Earlier this month, Antetokounmpo told Sam Amick of The Athletic that he would never request a trade. However, after the Bucks' narrow win over the Hawks on Monday, Antetokounmpo was asked if he would finish the season in Milwaukee and responded, \"I don't know. I take it day-by-day.\" Following the Bucks' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, Antetokounmpo called out his teammates for being \"selfish\" and \"not playing hard.\" Shams Charania then reported Friday that discussions between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo about his future had \"intensified in nature\" and that the \"tension\" inside the organization and locker room was at an \"all-time high.\"Over the last month, however, there were numerous reports that the Bucks had actually been looking to buy at the deadline to increase their chances of making the playoffs in a weaker-than-usual Eastern Conference. \nAbout the only thing that had been clear about Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee was that the entire league was watching. \"Giannis is the trade deadline,\" Brian Windhorst said earlier this week. \"There is really not a lot of other players out there that can move the needle. There is very small to no market for Ja Morant or Anthony Davis. The entire league is watching Giannis.\"Antetokounmpo's injury throws a major wrench into the deadline plans for the Bucks and every other team that was waiting for a resolution on his status. \nThe Bucks should no longer be buyers at the deadline or entertain any deals in which they give up future assets such as Ryan Rollins or their 2031 first-round pick. It's unclear how Antetokounmpo's injury will impact other teams' pursuit of the two-time MVP, but it likely increases the odds that he remains with the Bucks for the rest of the season. Antetokounmpo likely out of the All-Star Game (again) and award considerationAntetokounmpo was recently named as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 10th consecutive season, which is the longest active streak in the league. However, this calf injury will likely keep him from playing in the mid-season showcase for the second consecutive year. He also sat out last year due to a calf injury. In addition, this injury will end Antetokounmpo's chances of award consideration. The 65-game threshold for major awards means that players cannot miss more than 17 games in a season. Antetokounmpo has already missed 14 games, and even if he comes back earlier than expected, he's going to miss four more games. \nAntetokounmpo has been named to the All-NBA First Team and finished in the top-four in MVP voting in each of the last seven seasons. Those streaks will come to an end. \"It's hard, but always in my mind I think of the good things that have happened in my life, and I think of where I am in this moment, and what my goals are, and what stops me from these goals, which might be this injury, and the first thing that you have to think about is that it can be way worse,\" Antetokounmpo said Friday. \"You can be out for 12 months, 18 months. Being out for two, three, four, five, six weeks, whatever the case may be and not making the All-NBA, for sure it's gonna hurt. For sure it will be a little bit frustrating, but it doesn't matter. That's not where we are right now mentally as a team, as a player. All-NBA it's in June, I'm in January.\"Can the Bucks turn this into a positive?This is the fourth time in the last three seasons that Antetokounmpo has suffered a calf injury. \nIn addition to the right calf strain that kept him out for three weeks earlier this season, he missed over two weeks (and sat out of the All-Star Game) last season due to a left calf strain. A left calf strain also kept him out of the final week of the regular season and the playoffs in 2024. \"I don't think it looks great, personally,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Friday. \"This calf keeps coming up and it's concerning. I'm not a doctor, but I'm smart enough to know that his calf keeps bothering him and there's something that is there and it keeps happening, and that's troublesome for all of us.\"No one in Milwaukee wanted to see Antetokounmpo injured yet again, but there's a chance for the Bucks to turn this into a long-term positive. \nThis team is not going anywhere this season. Since their 4-1 start, they have three wins against teams in the top-six in either conference, and overall they are 24th in offensive rating, 21st in defensive rating and 24th in net rating (-3.4). Even in a world where they made some moves at the deadline and fought their way into the Play-In, they were not going to be a contender. Now, there's a very good chance they end up with a top-10 pick, and possibly even higher than that -- especially if Antetokounmpo's injury keeps him out for more than a month (at which point there's little reason for him to return at all this season). Whatever happens with Antetokounmpo down the line, that's much better for their future than a futile Play-In chase. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        CHICAGO -- Derrick Rose's No. 1 jersey will forever hang from the rafters at the United Center in Chicago. Rose, who was honored with a lavish postgame ceremony after the Bulls beat the Boston Celtics, 114-111, Saturday night, was emotional watching his jersey be placed alongside those of Bulls legends like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.The Bulls pulled out all the stops in celebrating the city's favorite son. Both Jordan and Pippen made videos honoring Rose, with Jordan saying in part, \"Looking forward to coming to the United Center and seeing your jersey hanging up there with my jersey.\"The grandeur of the ceremony, and everything leading up to it, exemplified just how much the Bulls, NBA fans and players, and the city of Chicago appreciates Rose. It was the type of event that is usually reserved for those who go on to have championship-filled careers.But that was not Rose's journey. His wasn't one littered with championships like Jordan and Pippen, he never even appeared in the NBA Finals. He was a three-time All Star (all with the Bulls), a Rookie of the Year winner in 2009 and remains the youngest MVP winner in league history at age 22. He traversed the league over 15 years, with stops in New York, Minnesota, Detroit, Cleveland and Memphis. Though if Rose had it his way, he probably would've retired with his hometown Bulls.\nIn his seven seasons with the Bulls, they never missed the playoffs, making it to the Eastern Conference finals once, and past the first round two other times. The grit and toughness Rose played with personified the spirit of Chicago. He grew up in Chicago's south side neighborhood of Englewood, playing on the local courts and rising through the ranks as one of the nation's top prospects. Though he never brought the city a championship, by the way he's revered in Chicago you would've thought he had.That's not surprising, though. Rose embraced his city, and in return Chicago wrapped its arms around him. He was proud to be from Chicago, and in retirement has moved back to the city. Rose didn't bring titles to Chicago like Jordan or Pippen, or end a 108-year drought like the 2016 Cubs. But he's from Chicago, and that holds a different kind of weight than any championship trophy ever could.\"This journey was never about me,\" Rose said. \"Right from the jump, it was never about me. It was about creating a synergy that somehow people from the city could pull from, and somehow I was that beacon or that vessel for that from hoopin'. Now being 37 and looking at the totality of it, it was about everybody that found ways to come to my games. Somehow, we had some kind of vibration that connected. It all was meant to be.\"\nSaturday night's festivities were filled with nostalgia. A countless number of Rose's former teammates were on hand for the honor, including Joakim Noah, Luol Deng and Taj Gibson, all of whom gave speeches.\nFormer Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau gave an impassioned speech about his former player, and ended it by saying, \"The next stop is the Hall of Fame, and there is no doubt about that.\"Every time Rose talked about his jersey retirement, including in his over 20-minute speech during the ceremony, he made it a point to say \"This was never about me.\" Instead, it was about his mother, Brenda, who sacrificed everything to put him in the position he is today. It was about his teammates who fought alongside him every night. His wife and kids, who keep him grounded. It was about the fans and the city who always stood by him. \nIn many ways, Rose's jersey retirement served as a symbol. It closes the chapter for a man who is ready to move on from his own playing career to focus on becoming a businessman. It serves as a full circle moment a decade later after being traded from the only team he knew. It brings back to light the many highs and lows of his career. A career that many people wonder what would've happened had he never gotten injured. How high could he and the Bulls have climbed? Would Rose be mentioned amongst the greatest of all time had his body not failed him?The 2012 ACL injury that forever altered the trajectory of Rose's career is one he's since made peace with. During his speech, Rose even showed the now infamous photo of him lying on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the injury. The picture got a visceral reaction from the crowd, but Rose explained why it was an important part of his journey.\"We had to do that together, and that's only how I got from [that injury] to here,\" Rose said. \"You all and us being here together. I know a lot of people don't like [Tom Thibodeau] because of [the injury]. Because they look at Thibs as 'the injury.' But I'm here to say f--- that. Thibs is the first coach that made me feel special. ... He felt like he loved the game more than me, which he don't. Thibs, you may have [coached] at Harvard, you may have done physics, but I showed you physics.\"\nRose's jersey retirement also symbolizes the most recent truly great era of Bulls basketball. With so many of his teammates in attendance for the ceremony as well as Thibodeau, it felt as much an honor for Rose as it was for the players who battled alongside him.\"To accomplish this, it took minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, but this [banner] this is forever,\" a tearful Luol Deng said in a speech honoring Rose. \"When people talk about all the minutes, all the injuries, everything we went through, that's our trophy, man.\"As the jumbotron showed highlights from the 2010s Bulls teams throughout the night with cheers and roars from the crowd, it's difficult to ignore the juxtaposition between that era of Bulls basketball and the current one. In the decade since Rose suited up in the red, white and black, the Bulls have made the playoffs just twice. During Rose's time with the Bulls, the team never had a losing record. In the years since, Chicago's had just one winning record.\nDespite the win against a strong Celtics team Saturday, night, and all the fanfare from Rose's ceremony, it doesn't distract from the Groundhog's day cycle the current era of Bulls basketball is in. If anything, Rose's celebration only served as a reminder of how far this team has fallen since then.It's been a constant cycle of winning about 35 games, earning a Play-In Tournament spot only to miss the playoffs yet again. Never good enough to seriously contend, yet too stubborn to completely free fall into what could land them their next Rose.Even right now, as spirited as the win was against the Celtics, the Bulls currently have a 23-22 record. The trade deadline is in two weeks and it may pass without Chicago making massive changes to its roster. In a year where the Bulls could've gotten a generational star like Rose was when they drafted him No. 1 overall in 2008, Chicago's instead content with being just competitive enough to play an 83rd game at the end of the season.\nThe nostalgia of reliving the greatest moments of Rose's career warmed the city of Chicago in the midst of sub-freezing temperatures. But then reality hits, and it sinks in that this franchise is as far as ever from reaching the heights Rose brought the Bulls. And to make matters worse, from the way this team has operated over the last decade, it seems like they're OK with being mediocre.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks are nearly unbeatable at home in conference championship games, combining to win nine of the 10 contests they've hosted. Meanwhile, the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams are a combined 6-7 on the road when a Super Bowl berth is on the line.Therefore, New England and Los Angeles will have their work cut out for them Sunday if they hope to keep alive their hopes for the Lombardi Trophy. The No. 2 seed Patriots visit Empower Field to take on the top-seeded Broncos at 3 p.m. in the AFC Championship Game, while the fifth-seeded Rams face the No. 1 seed Seahawks at Lumen Field in the NFC Championship Game at 6:30 p.m. ET.Including the playoffs, the Broncos are 9-1 at home this season, but they'll have backup Jarrett Stidham under center as he makes his first start since 2023 in place of an injured Bo Nix. Stidham has a difficult task ahead of him as New England won all eight of its contests away from Gillette Stadium this season. Seattle has gone 7-2 on its own field, while Los Angeles is 7-4 on the road.The Patriots played their first two postseason games at home, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans, while the Broncos edged the visiting Buffalo Bills in overtime. The Rams got past the Carolina Panthers and Chicago Bears on the road, and the Seahawks routed the San Francisco 49ers in Seattle.For Sunday's matchups, top sportsbooks have set the passing yards prop for New England's Drake Maye at 223.5 yards, the rushing yards prop for Los Angeles' Kyren Williams at 52.5 and the receiving yards props for Denver's Courtland Sutton at 46.5 and Seattle's Jaxon Smith-Njigba at 90.5.Before you play a side on Maye, Williams, Sutton, Smith-Njigba or any player prop for Sunday's conference championship games, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The expert is +1916 on his last 107 NFL player prop picks. Here are his picks and analysis.Marvin Mims Jr. Over 2.5 rushing yards\nMims' role has ebbed and flowed throughout the season, but the speedster was instrumental for the Broncos last week, recording eight receptions for 93 yards.While Mims still could make his mark in the passing game, I'm expecting Broncos head coach Sean Payton to get creative with his play calling in an effort to help his backup quarterback and bolster the ground attack.Mims had 12 rushing attempts this season, clearing this line in nine of his 15 games. It's a great matchup against the Patriots, who allowed wide receivers 8.9 yards per carry on 15 attempts in the regular season (per Fantasy Points). I'd bet this up to Over 3.5 yards.Matthew Stafford Over 35.5 pass attempts\nStafford is coming off consecutive performances in which he had 42 pass attempts, and I see him poised for a similar workload against the Seahawks.Seattle's run defense ranks first in DVOA (per FTN) - and it doesn't take much as it is for the Rams to go pass heavy, as they rank third in neutral gamescript pass rate (61%, per RotoViz).Meanwhile, the Seahawks are not a ball-control heavy offense as they allow their opponents to execute 62.5 offensive plays per game.I expect Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay to lean on his MVP candidate quarterback in this matchup. I'd bet this up to Over 36.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Our NFL \"final four\" has been finalized, as conference championship weekend takes place this Sunday. Coach Mike Vrabel has taken the New England Patriots from pretender to contender in his first season, while Sean Payton's Denver Broncos finally won their first playoff game since Super Bowl 50. However, they did lose their quarterback in the process when Bo Nix went down with a broken ankle. On the NFC side, it's another NFC West showdown, as Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to take on Sam Darnold and the Seahawks. The teams split their two regular-season meetings, with the home team winning each time. When these teams met last month, they gave us one of the games of the year, as Seattle converted a game-winning two-point conversion in overtime. What will happen this time around?\n        \n            \n                Prisco's AFC, NFC Championship picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich teams should you pick this week, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break them down. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Jan. 21 over at DraftKings Sportsbook. New England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nDajani (Patriots -5.5): I'm not sure what kind of deal Mike Vrabel made with the football gods, but it's pretty incredible that New England got to play the easiest strength of schedule since the turn of the millennium, hosted a hapless Justin Herbert in the wild-card round, the turnover addict C.J. Stroud in the divisional round, and who is waiting for the Patriots in the AFC Championship game? JARRETT STIDHAM.Stidham is the seventh quarterback to make his first start of the season in the playoffs, and only one of the previous six actually won their game. He is 1-3 as an NFL starter, and it will be interesting to see how Sean Payton alters his game plan with Bo Nix out. Regardless of Stidham's role on Sunday, there are two things that must happen if the Broncos want this upset: The run game has to reappear and the defense has to dominate. Since J.K. Dobbins was injured in Week 10, the Broncos rank bottom 10 in rushing yards per game and yards per rush. Dobbins has a chance to return this week, but I'm not banking on him to be an X factor. This Denver defense ranks top three in points allowed per game (18.3), yards allowed per game (278.2) and third-down percentage (33.8%) as well. Vance Joseph's unit can definitely contain Drake Maye, but the Patriots are the only team with a perfect against-the-spread record (8-0) on the road this season. I believe this will be a close game until New England finally covers in the fourth quarter …  Prediction: Patriots 20, Broncos 13\nDubin (Patriots -5.5): This one is pretty simple: the Broncos will not have their starting quarterback for this game. It's really hard to see them putting together a representative offensive performance with Jarrett Stidham at the helm -- especially given how well the New England defense has played so far during the playoffs in holding down offenses piloted by Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud. New England's offense hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in either of its games against elite defenses, and the Broncos present another one for them to go up against, but I have far more trust in Drake Maye going against a Denver unit that has actually shown some leaks since its bye week, than I do in Stidham and Co. against the Pats. … Prediction: Patriots 21, Broncos 10Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nDajani (Rams +2.5): My preseason Super Bowl pick was Ravens vs. Rams, and just because I was wrong about Baltimore does not mean I'm flaking on Los Angeles in this spot. Everyone is going to be on the Seahawks this week because of their incredible defense, but I will remind you that Matthew Stafford and Co. racked up 581 yards of total offense and 37 points in that overtime thriller in Seattle we witnessed last month. This pick comes down to me trusting Stafford and his fantastic cast of weapons more than Sam Darnold. The historical trends are in my favor as well. The Rams are 2-0 all-time vs. the Seahawks in the playoffs, and have won four straight NFC Championship game appearances.I know scoring points against this Seahawks defense will be tough. The only touchdowns they've allowed since Thanksgiving, not including the Rams matchup, are a Philip Rivers passing touchdown and a Bryce Young rushing touchdown. Still, I'm calling for the upset. Sean McVay is 5-2 against the spread and 4-3 straight up as an underdog in the playoffs  …  Prediction: Rams 24, Seahawks 23\nDubin (Rams +2.5): I picked the Rams to beat the Seahawks in the NFC title game in our pre-playoff predictions, so I am obviously rolling with the same pick here. L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely-contested win.  … Prediction: Rams 23, Seahawks 20\n            ",

While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +276 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction.

Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record at least half a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter in off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. The Rams lead the all-time series 49-30-2.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. L.A. has won the last two matchups, with the most recent meeting coming in 2022. The latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7.5-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5. Before making any Rams vs. Falcons     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

Williams said something to Alvarado who grabbed Williams and the two started going at it, with Alvarado throwing punches and connecting with a right hook. \nAlvarado and Williams were both ejected for their roles in the scrap, which was a far more legitimate fight than most tussles we see happen on an NBA court. The best part of it all was Jordan Poole's face in the background when Alvarado landed the punch (0:35 mark of the above video). Alvarado was still hot after getting pulled away and sprinted to the back, seemingly ready to continue things in the hallway by the locker rooms. Williams was less aggressive in his role in the brouhaha, which likely accounts for the shorter penalty.\nThe Suns went on to win, 123-114, after the fight to notch back-to-back wins in New Orleans and improve to 18-13 on the season, as they battle for a playoff spot in the West. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis caught the attention of the NFL world on Saturday night, when he turned in an impressive performance in a 41-24 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. The former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown, and led Green Bay in rushing with 60 yards and two more touchdowns.Willis became the first quarterback all-time to complete 85% of his passes while averaging 13 yards per attempt, and rush for 60 yards. His 13.7 yards per attempt were the most by a quarterback with 50 rushing yards in a game in the last 50 seasons. Willis looked like he could be a starting NFL quarterback, which led some to wonder if coach Matt LaFleur could keep Willis in the starting lineup over Jordan Love when he recovers from his concussion and left shoulder injury. LaFleur told reporters on Sunday that he's excited about how Willis is playing, but wants to \"pump the brakes\" when it comes to Willis overtaking Love on the depth chart. \"I think Jordan Love is playing some pretty high-level football and it's great that we feel the same about Malik and his ability to go in there,\" LaFleur said. \"I thought he's had two really back-to-back outstanding performances. So we're in a good spot with that position. Certainly have a lot of confidence in both of those guys, but it's pretty clear that Jordan is our franchise quarterback and when he's healthy, he's going to be our starter. So I just want to squash all that.\"\nLove is 9-5-1 as the starter this season, and has completed 66.3% of his passes for 3,381 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions. While LaFleur says Love is playing high-level football, he's lost two straight starts following a four-game win streak. Love registered his first multi-interception game of the season against the Denver Broncos in Week 15, then threw for just 77 yards before exiting the Week 16 matchup against the Chicago Bears with his concussion. Willis entered and sparked the offense, completing 9 of 11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in the eventual overtime loss. \nYou also have to remember that the Packers signed Love to a four-year extension worth $220 million in 2024. He's on the books through 2028, but there's no ignoring the fact that Willis has been impressive in his limited action with Green Bay.Malik Willis' career as starterTitansPackersW-L1-22-1Completion percentage51%80%Passing yards per game78.0204.0TD-INT0-33-0Passer rating39.0132.4As a prospect hailing from Liberty, Willis was lauded for his dual-threat ability, but it was also understood that he was a project. Even in his three starts with Tennessee, Willis wasn't trusted to throw the football. Following his rookie season, the Titans traded up in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft to select quarterback Will Levis, who started nine games over Willis when Ryan Tannehill was injured that year. On roster cutdown day in 2024, the Titans traded Willis to the Packers for a seventh-round pick. Willis flashed his potential shortly after arriving in Green Bay, as he started for an injured Love in a Week 2 victory against the Indianapolis Colts, then was given the opportunity to face off against his former team in Nashville in Week 3. Willis threw for 202 yards and a touchdown in that 30-14 victory over the Titans, and added another touchdown on the ground. \nThe Packers will have to be prepared to lose Willis, as he is set to become a free agent this offseason. With what he accomplished on Saturday night, Willis has become an intriguing candidate on the quarterback carousel. \n            ",

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said following Pittsburgh's 13-6 loss that Washington has broken his arm. Washington was seen after the game wearing a cast and sling over his injured arm. His availability moving forward is not currently known. The Steelers host the Baltimore Ravens next week in a game that will determine which team will win the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it. Washington caught both of his targets for 15 yards prior to exiting Sunday's game. A former third-round pick, the 6-foot-7 Washington was in the midst of his most productive season to date with a career-high 31 catches through 16 games. \"Yeah, Darnell is a big part of what we do,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said when asked about how Washington's absence impacted the offense. If Washington is out for a significant portion of time, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth would likely have a bigger role in the offense. Neither player, however, is as good as a blocker as Jones, who is often used in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's offense as a pseudo tackle. \nAlong with Washington, the Steelers played the entire game without DK Metcalf, who also won't face the Ravens next week as part of his two-game suspension stemming from last week's altercation with a Lions fan. The absences of both players clearly had a negative impact on Rodgers, who threw for just 168 yards on 21 of 39 passing. \"We didn't execute very well on third downs,\" Rodgers said. \"I didn't have a very good game. Didn't run the ball early like we wanted to. Pretty bad on third down.\" One Steelers offensive player who did have a good game Sunday was Jaylen Warren, who rushed for a game-high 64 yards on 12 carries. Warren is among Pittsburgh's skill players who will have to pick up the slack even more next week with Metcalf out and Washington's status in question. \n\"Nobody's panicking,\" Warren said after Sunday's game when asked about Pittsburgh's current predicament. \"I'm not worried. We'll be good.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With Jordan Love out of the game on Saturday, Malik Willis took over at quarterback for the Green Bay Packers and he played a nearly perfect game. Although the Packers got blown out, 41-24, by the Ravens, you can't blame the loss on Willis, who totaled 348 yards and three touchdowns. Willis was so good against the Ravens that the Packers didn't punt a single time in the game. Yup, that's right: The Packers didn't punt a single time and they still lost. And now, we get to the ugly part: The loss by Green Bay marks the third time this season that the Packers have lost a game where they didn't punt, which is the most by any team in the Super Bowl era. There have been 60 seasons played since the inception of the Super Bowl, and in that span, there had only been two teams that had even lost TWO games in a single season without punting the ball: The 2021 Chargers and 2024 Bengals. Both of those teams finished with a 9-8 record, which is almost fitting, because the Packers will also finish the season with nine wins if they lose to the Bears in Week 18. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince you might be wondering how a team could possibly lose three games where they didn't punt the ball a single time, let's break down how it happened. The Packers had their first no-punt loss back in Week 9 when Carolina beat them 16-13. The Packers had seven possessions in that game and here's how they played out: FumbleField goalField goalMissed field goalInterceptionFailed fourth downTouchdownThe Packer piled up 369 yards, but they only scored 13 points due to their costly miscues. The failed fourth down came from Carolina's 13-yard line in the fourth quarter, so that wasn't a situation where the Packers would have punted even if it had come at an earlier point in the game. \nThe Packers second loss with no punts came in Week 16 when they blew a 10-point lead against the Bears in the fourth quarter of a game they eventually lost in overtime. Here's how their possessions went in that 22-16 loss: Failed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 7-yard line)Field goalField goalKneel down to end halfFumble TouchdownField goalKneel down to end regulationFailed fourth down in overtime (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 36-yard line)Once again, the Packers offense moved the ball up and down the field, but they had trouble finishing their drives. The failed fourth down in overtime ended up costing the Packers big because four plays after the fourth down failure, Caleb Williams hit D.J. Moore with a 46-yard game-winning touchdown pass. The Packers' third loss with no punts came against the Ravens. Once again, let's check out how their possessions went: \nTouchdownFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 at Green Bay 34-yard line)FumbleTouchdownKneel down to end halfField goalTouchdown InterceptionFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-8 at 50-yard line)The Packers went 0-for-2 on fourth down against the Ravens and that ended up being a huge factor in the game. They also went 1-for-3 on fourth down against the Bears, which means they've gone 1-for-5 over the past two weeks. When you're not punting, that usually means that your offense is playing well, and for that most part, that's been the case for the Packers, but they've also made several costly mistakes in their no-punt games, which is why they're now on the wrong side of NFL history. Thanks to these three no-punt games, Green Bay's Daniel Whelan has only had 41 punts this year, which is tied for the fourth-lowest number in the league for any punter that's played at least 15 games. Although Whelen hasn't punted much, he's actually been pretty solid this year: He's tied for the NFL-lead with a punting average of 51.3 yards and he ranks 11th overall in net punting average at 42.6. \n            ",

Is it possible this is also the last of him with the Las Vegas Raiders? The Raiders shut down Crosby due to a knee injury, placing him on injured reserve. However, this was a decision with which the five-time Pro Bowler \"vehemently\" disagreed, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. Crosby argued he is healthy enough to play, and wanted to finish out the season. This decision will cause Crosby to evaluate his future with the Raiders organization, according to NFL Media. Glazer reports he spoke with Crosby on the phone, and relayed that the star pass rusher is \"not a happy camper right now.\" Crosby is set to have a meniscus trim, which is not a major procedure. On Saturday, he posted pictures and videos of him playing basketball and on a trampoline to his social media, which showed that he's not in debilitating pain that would force him off the field. The Raiders even felt the need to release a statement explaining their decision to place Crosby on injured reserve:\n\"After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season.\"We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field. We look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.\"In 15 games played, Crosby recorded 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 20 QB hits, 10 sacks, six passes defensed and his first career interception. Just nine months ago, Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension that includes $91.5 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Crosby wanted to remain loyal to the franchise that selected him in the fourth round out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, even though he's seen just one winning season. It's possible things may have changed. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 season is far from over but it's already time inspect the report card of the most expensive 2025 summer transfer window moves. Players like Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko kept us busy last summer with their moves, but their start of the season with their new clubs haven't gone as expected, while others have performed up to expectations and beyond. With the 2026 winter transfer window about to start, let's go back and grade the most expensive 2025 summer transfers: 10. Matheus CunhaFrom Wolverhampton to Manchester United for $84.5 million (add-ons included)Three goals scored so far in 16 games played between Premier League and EFL Cup with Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, the former Wolverhampton striker has played regularly and he's having an impact, starting the last nine Premier League fixtures, scoring also two goals in the last three. He's improving, and the feeling is that things can get even better in the near future. Good start. Grade: B9. Victor Osimhen From Napoli to Galatasaray for $87.5 million (add-ons included)Even if this signing wasn't as exciting as the others on this list, the former Napoli striker performed wonderfully in the team he moved to in the summer of 2024 on loan. Galatasaray decided to invest big on him last summer, and they were wise in doing so -- 12 goals scored in 16 games so far, including six scored in the four games played in the Champions League league phase. It looks like he's fitting well in this team and he can achieve big things at Galatasaray this season. Grade: A8. Luis Diaz From Liverpool to Bayern Munich for $88.5 million (add-ons included)By far the best signing in the top 10. Luis Diaz is doing great things in Germany at Bayern Munich where he has already scored 13 goals in the 22 matches he played so far in all competitions, and also seven assists provided to his teammates. One goal every 137 minutes and an incredible impact in the team coached by Vincent Kompany, he is quickly becoming one of the big stars of the German giants. Grade: A+\n7. Eberechi EzeFrom Crystal Palace to Arsenal for $91 million (add-ons included)There were high expectations and ambitions after his late move to Arsenal after he almost agreed terms to join Tottenham. It was one of the biggest stories and surprises of the summer transfer window, and to be honest, we could expect a bit more from his performances. But he has done well in some exciting matches, particularly when he scored the hat trick, ironically against Tottenham in the North London derby won 4-1 by the Gunners. Grade: B6. Nick WoltemadeFrom Stuttgart to Newcastle for $93 million (add-ons included)The German striker suffered a bit from the poor performances and results of Newcastle in the opening part of the season, as the Magpies are currently sitting 14th in the Premier League standings with 23 points after 18 games. On the other hand, Woltemade already scored nine goals with his new team and showed to be at the level of the Premier League and his rivals. If his team also improve, we can expect a lot more goals from him. Grade: B-5. Bryan Mbuemo From Brentford to Manchester United for $95 million (add-ons included)Let's be honest -- when Manchester United signed him this summer, we all thought this was going to be another disappointment. Welp. Seven goals scored so far in the 17 matches he played, he immediately became one of the key players of the team coached by Amorim. He's now in Morocco where he's playing the AFCON with Cameroon, and Manchester United hope to see him back in the team as soon as possible. They need him. Grade: B+\n4. Benjamin Sesko From RB Leipzig to Manchester United for $99 million (add-ons included)The exact opposite of Mbuemo. Back in the summer, I thought he was going to shine and become an important player of Manchester United but so far he has only scored two goals in the 17 matches he has played with the Red Devils. I was expecting a bigger impact and stronger numbers from a player who has consistently impressed me in recent years, but he still has time. At just 22, there is a lot of potential waiting to be realized. Grade: C-3. Hugo Ekitike From Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool for $106 million (add-ons included)The French international immediately proved to be a crucial player in the team coached by Arne Slot. Ekitike has already scored 11 goals in the 24 matches he played and was definitely the best signing made by Liverpool this season, also because the other ones were really disappointing, at least up to now. Grade: B+2. Florian WirtzFrom Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool for $157 million (add-ons included). If the Ekitike signing was one of the best ones, we can't say the same about the Florian Wirtz move to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen, especially considering the money the English team spent for the German striker. Wirtz scored his first goal for his new club over the weekend against Wolverhampton, but expectations were higher. There is still time for him to improve and adapting to the Premier League is never easy in the short term. He will need to show more in the second half of the season. Grade: C-\n1. Alexander Isak From Newcastle to Liverpool for $168 million (add-ons included). The Swedish striker was really disappointing so far, especially considering the money spent and the expectations after the saga of his transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. He has scored only three goals in the first part of the season and is now sidelined with a leg injury that could keep him out for potentially months. They hoped something different in Liverpool. Grade: D\n            ",

They were, however, on the wrong end of the scoreboard, and Garrett believes there was a strong correlation between the two.\n\"To an extent, I feel like they were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron [Rodgers] than, you know, getting the win, and I think that's what came back to bite them,\" Garrett said after the Browns' 13-6 upset win in Cleveland. \"They'll have to fight it out with Baltimore next week, but I'm just proud of the guys for fighting and getting this win. That's the main thing, and I'm always gonna keep it that.\"Garrett, who was often chipped by a running back or tight end or outright double-teamed, managed just two pressures on 43 pass rush snaps, a 4.7% rate. That was his second-lowest of the season; he had just a 4.2% pressure rate in the Week 6 game against Pittsburgh.Garrett remains at 22 sacks on the season, one behind breaking the record of 22.5 shared by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). Sunday represented Garrett's first game without at least a half-sack since that aforementioned Week 6 game against Pittsburgh. The Cleveland defense still dominated, though: Alex Wright and Grant Delpit both sacked Rodgers, who had a season-low 4.3 yards per attempt. As a result, the Steelers will host the Baltimore Ravens for the AFC North title in Week 18; Pittsburgh could have clinched the division with a win in Cleveland.\nGarrett, meanwhile, will have one more shot at the record when the Browns visit the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 18. Garrett had two sacks in the Week 1 matchup between the two teams.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        CLEVELAND -- Instead of rocking division champions hats and T-shirts, Aaron Rodgers and the rest of the Pittsburgh Steelers wore somber looks on their faces following Sunday's 13-6 upset loss to the Cleveland Browns. Before he and his teammates began the journey back to Pittsburgh, though, Rodgers sent a message to his teammates ahead of next week's home game with the Baltimore Ravens that will determine who wins the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it. \"I have full confidence we'll go home and win next week,\" Rodgers said. Why gives Rodgers that confidence?\"Because we've done it all season,\" he said. \"We've handled adversity well and when we've had to play our best ball, we did. Other than today.\" \nRodgers is right. The Steelers overcame an ugly home loss to Seahawks in Week 2 with three straight wins that gave them a commanding lead in the AFC North through five weeks. And after five losses over a seven-game span left them at 6-6 through 12 weeks, the Steelers responded with four consecutive wins that put them on the precipice of clinching the division on Sunday with a week to spare. \nThe Steelers are certainly capable of responding to adversity again, but that alone won't get the job done. Simply put, they cannot afford another offensive performance like the one that took place Sunday in Cleveland. If they do, they'll be watching the Ravens celebrate a division title next Sunday at their house and at their expense. While DK Metcalf's absence (via his two-game suspension) was expected slow the Steelers' offense down, it wasn't supposed to grind it to a halt like it did on Sunday. In that respect, was Sunday's game a chance for the Steelers' offense to see how teams would play them without Metcalf?\"You could say that,\" Steelers running back Jaylen Warren said afterward.\n        \n            \n                Darnell Washington injury: Steelers massive tight end suffers broken arm in loss to Browns\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRodgers in particular was inexplicably off after putting together a four-game stretch that conjured up memories of his MVP seasons with the Packers. He threw low-percentage passes and made head scratching decisions, such as his bomb to Scott Miller on fourth-and-1 from the Browns' 22-yard-line late in the first half that fell incomplete. The turnover on downs negated Jack Sawyer's interception of Shedeur Sanders that had given Pittsburgh possession deep in Browns territory. \n\"One-on-one,\" Rodgers said when asked about his decision to throw deep to Miller in that situation. As he did at the end of the first half, Rodgers quickly moved the Steelers into scoring range at the end of the game. But he finished the game with three consecutive passes to Marquez Valdes-Scantling, who was being tightly covered by perennial Pro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward. Rodgers screamed at the officials for pass interference afterward, but to no avail. \"It was definitely interference,\" he said afterward. Adding insult to injury on the Rodgers' final incompletion was the fact that Kenneth Gainwell had gotten open underneath prior to Rodgers releasing the ball. \nThe game's turning point was on Pittsburgh's second drive of the second half. Down 10-6, Rodgers engineered a 13-play drive that took over eight minutes on the clock. Rodgers completed several big plays on the drive that included a third-and-8 conversion to Miller. At that point, it appeared that Rodgers and the Steelers were on the verge of another one-possession win, which would have made them 7-2 this season in such games. Instead, the drive ended with Rodgers inexplicably taking a sack on third down, which turned Chris Boswell's 49-yard field goal attempt into a 54-yard attempt. Boswell's kick missed the bottom upright by less than a yard. Rodgers and the passing game struggled, but the Steelers did have some good performances in Cleveland. Warren ran for 64 of the Steelers' 131 yards on the ground while averaging 5.3 yards per carry. The defense forced two turnovers while holding the Browns to just 78 yards on 25 carries. Alex Highsmith had two sacks and several other pressures of Sanders. \nPittsburgh's secondary, playing without cornerback Brandin Echols, held Jerry Jeudy to zero catches in the second half after he caught five passes for 54 yards in the first half. Those things, however, were negated by an offense that went 3 of 15 on third down and 0 of 3 on fourth down. \"I don't think we played poorly,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin surprisingly said afterward. \"We just didn't make enough plays. I thought they played well. I thought the game was kind of unfolding in the way that you would anticipate, but we never made that signature play that kind of got us over the hump. That generally is the deciding factor in games like this and we generally make them. We didn't make them today.\"\nRodgers was specifically unable to make the big throw, or many other throws for that matter. Instead of getting easy completions, Rodgers either didn't have any, or when he did, he often tried the more challenging throw. Putting Rodgers in more advantageous situations will undoubtedly take up a large portion of offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's focus over the next week. It's up to Rodgers, however, to capitalize on those chances. \"Not much,\" Rodgers said when asked what needs to chance heading into next week's game. \"We just have to execute better.\" It's fitting that the Steelers' season will come down to Sunday's game against the Ravens. In a season where nothing has come easy, the Steelers will have to defeat their arch rival if they want to continue playing beyond next week. It won't be easy, but Rodgers feels that the Steelers have what it takes to get it done. \nHe isn't the only one. \"One game doesn't take us off the track,\" said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, the longest-tenured Steeler. \"We've been playing good ball as of late. There's still things we can hang our hat on. Stopping the run, turnovers, controlling the ball, we've been good on offense. Giving yourself a shot late. That's all you can ask for.\" \n            ",

The Niners have catapulted themselves into the thick of the race for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and they have two massive games remaining on the schedule with this one against the Bears followed by next week's showdown with the division rival Seattle Seahawks, which could be for all the marbles.Chicago has won two in a row after having its five-game winning streak snapped by the Packers, and is looking to go from worst to first in the NFC North. The Bears have now won seven of eight, with five of those wins coming by just one score. They're the league's premier comeback artists these days, and capturing a win here would further cement their comeback to relevance.Which of these two teams will thrust itself into position to compete for the conference's top spot? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. BearsDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -3, O/U 52.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesPlayoff picture. Chicago and San Francisco have already each clinched playoff spots. But there is still plenty to play for. Chicago can clinch the NFC North win a win, but also may have already clinched by game time if the Packers lose to the Ravens on Saturday. Both of these teams can also still get the No. 1 seed in the conference. The path is clearer for the 49ers, but it exists for the Bears as well. If San Francisco beats both Chicago and Seattle, the Niners capture the top spot on the conference. The Bears, meanwhile, need to win both of their games and have the Seahawks lose at least one of their next two games.Coach of the Year. New England Patriots coach Mike Vrabel is the favorite for Coach of the Year at the moment, with -110 odds at DraftKings. But Niners coach Kyle Shanahan is tied for the second-best odds with Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald at +330, and Bears coach Ben Johnson is next at +650 odds. Whoever's team wins this game could have the inside track on being the top competition for Vrabel. Especially if the Niners win here, Shanahan has a path to overtaking Vrabel, because of the aforementioned No. 1 seed scenario. The Bears could still get the No. 1 seed, too, and if Johnson takes Chicago from worst in the division to first in the conference, he could easily capture the award as well.CMC's 1000-1000 quest. Christian McCaffrey has already reached 1,000 rushing yards on the season, topping the mark with a big game last week. But he's also 151 yards away from getting there as a receiver as well. He's already topped the 1000-1000 mark once in his career, way back in 2019. If he does it again, he'll be the first player in history to do it twice. With George Kittle possibly out for this game, McCaffrey could be even more involved as a receiver than usual.Injury issues. Both of these teams are depleted by injuries, which could make this game a battle of attrition. The Niners are practically a M.A.S.H. unit on the defensive side of the ball, and they could be without George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall or both on offense. The Bears have had Rome Odunze and T.J. Edwards, among others, each out of practice on Wednesday on Thursday, while Kyler Gordon, Dayo Odeyingo and Braxton Jones all remain on injured reserve.PredictionThe Bears have been pulling rabbits out of their collective hats all year, so going against them here feels at least somewhat risky. That's especially the case because their defense remains one of the most injury-ravaged units in the league. They're better against the run than they are against the pass, though, which helps in a game against the Bears, who lean on the run. San Francisco's offense, meanwhile, looks explosive after the bye. If Brock Purdy continues rolling, I like the Niners here.\nPrediction: 49ers 24, Bears 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

His counterpart, Micah Alejado, leads the Mountain West in passing yards per game and has 3 passing scores in five of his last seven games. With the explosiveness of both passing games, the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits 70% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Hawaii vs. California, and which side of the spread hits 70% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Cal vs. Hawaii spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's up on its top-ranked money-line picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Brooks Koepka, 35, announced Tuesday that he is leaving LIV Golf after serving as one of the Saudi Arabia-backed tour's signature faces since he signed with the organization ahead of its inaugural 2022 season. Koepka, a five-time major championship winner, did not hoist a trophy in 2025 for the first time in five years, finishing 31st in the league's individual standings.\"Brooks Koepka will be stepping away from LIV Golf,\" his representation said in a statement. \"... Family has always guided Brooks' decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home. Brooks will continue to be a huge supporter of LIV Golf and wishes the league and its players continued success. Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what's ahead.\"Kopeka, who spent 47 weeks as the No. 1 golfer in the world back in 2018, is a nine-time PGA Tour winner who has claimed two U.S. Opens (2017-18) and three PGA Championships (2018-19, 2023). He missed the cut at three of the four majors in 2025.Whether Koepka plans to return to the PGA Tour remains to be seen; however, there has been speculation that he could spend 2026 with his family before rejoining the organization in 2027. The PGA Tour currently has a one-year suspension in place for any golfer who participates in unauthorized events. LIV Golf tournaments fit into that category.Kopeka would also need to ensure he has playing status on the PGA Tour after being inactive since 2021. As a recent major winner, he may not need to go through lower qualifying rungs, though he would need to reapply for membership before facing any discipline.\n\"Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success. The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness,\" the league said.Much of the bad blood that developed between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf came with different leadership at the top of each organization.While CEO Brian Rolapp could attempt to convince the PGA Tour Board of Directors to roll back some of its policies and open its arms to a returning Koepka, many within the PGA Tour still hold ill will toward players who exited the league and broke apart the sport, believing LIV Golf offered greener pastures.\n\"We have amicably and mutually agreed that Brooks Koepka will no longer compete in the LIV Golf League, following the 2025 season,\" CEO Scott O'Neil said in a statement. \"Brooks is prioritizing the needs of his family and staying closer to home. We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course.\"\n            ",

American defender Chris Richards had to leave the EFL Cup quarterfinal with an injury as Crystal Palace drew 1-1 with Arsenal before being knocked out 8-7 in the penalty shootout that would follow. This comes after captain Tyler Adams tore his MCL and will be out for 2-3 months.Richards went down in the 73rd minute and had to be stretchered off for Palace before Arsenal forced an own goal via a shot from close range from Jurrien Timber as Maxence Lacroix scored what would seem like the game's only goal before another Palace center back got in on the action.\nDespite the result, all eyes will be on Richards. Coach Oliver Glasner said that Richards needed stitches on his foot, said he hopes it isn't too bad but did say he's not ruling him out for playing on New Year's Day. A key player for the Eagles as well as the United States men's national team, there is also the slight quirk of Richards being projected as a starter for the USMNT in a World Cup on home soil in 2026, and his place in the team is pivotal. A player who has captained the side at times under Mauricio Pochettino, Richards will be a critical part of the USMNT setup in an uncertain defensive pairing. Tim Ream has been starting next to Richards, but the Charlotte FC defender is 38, and if Pochettino opts for a back three, questions surround who would partner the duo during the World Cup.\nNow all eyes will be on the official severity of Richard's injury, though Glasner did not appeared too concerned, which is welcomed by the USMNT faithful. While the UMSNT won't play a game until March when they host Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, Palace are right back at it hosting Tottenham on Dec. 28 and Fulham three days later on Jan. 1. With fourth through 10th in the Premier League only separated by five points, any time missed will push what manager Glasner is able to accomplish possibly jeopardizing what has been an excellent season so far. Richards is someone who will be needed with Palace still going in the FA Cup and the Europa Conference League while pushing for a top-four spot in the Premier League.\n            \n    ",

Most of the top Italian clubs are likely to explore options in the upcoming transfer window, especially given how difficult it usually is to find good opportunities in January. AC Milan have already secured a new striker, while Juventus need to find a solution for their striker in the new year, and Inter will look for a new right winger considering the injury and the contract situation of Denzel Dumfries. Let's take a look at five Christmas presents for five Serie A sides: AC Milan: The first signing of the windowAC Milan needed a striker as soon as possible and the Rossoneri have already signed Niclas Füllkrug from West Ham as the German player will be eligible to play the match against Cagliari on Jan. 2. Füllkrug joined the Rossoneri on loan with a $12 million buy option included in the deal, adding depth to the attacking unit coached by Massimiliano Allegri, which has been deeply affected by injuries in recent months. USMNT star Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao, and Santiago Giménez have all dealt with fitness issues, with the Mexican striker in particular undergoing surgery in recent weeks and potentially leaving the club during the winter transfer window. AC Milan needed a central striker considering that Allegri is currently playing with two strikers, with Pulisic and Leao alternating with Christopher Nkunku, who joined AC Milan in the summer from Chelsea, and Füllkrug was the first and only option explored by the Italian club. AS Roma: Joshua Zirkzee back to Italy?While AC Milan signed a new striker before Christmas, AS Roma are also advancing in talks to sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee on loan until the end of the 2025-26 season, according to reports. The Giallorossi manager Gian Piero Gasperini expressed his concerns after the Juventus defeat over the last weekend regarding his attacking options, as both Evan Ferguson and Artem Dovbyk are not performing as he was hoping and needs a new striker to play alongside Paulo Dybala and Matias Soule. AS Roma, despite a promising start to the season under their new manager, have shown attacking struggles. They currently boast the best defense in Serie A but also share the worst attacking record among the top 10 teams alongside Lazio with 17 goals scored in 16 matches. This is why they need to improve their attacking options. \nInter: A new right wingerMeanwhile, Inter need a new right winger in 2026. This is why the future of the Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries is more than in doubt. Dumfries has a $25 million release clause valid in the summer and the expectation is that multiple European clubs will try to trigger it after the 2026 World Cup, where he's expected to be be one of the stars with the Netherlands. For that reason, Dumfries recently decided to change his agent, a move that often means that he's looking for either a new contract or a new club. On top of it, he's currently injured and after undergoing surgery on his ankle in London, and he will be out for at least two more months. In his absence, Luis Henrique, Carlos Augusto, and occasionally Andy Diouf will be tasked with filling the role. For this reason, should a good opportunity arise, Inter are likely to pursue a new signing in that role.Fiorentina: Happy with what you haveIf there is a team to watch in the next weeks, that's Fiorentina. The Viola are in a unprecedented and difficult situation as they are at the bottom of the Serie A standings with nine points and only one win in 16 matches. They are seriously risking getting relegated and have already replaced the manager, with Paolo Vanoli replacing Stefano Pioli earlier this season. This situation can lead some players to leave in the winter transfer window but Fiorentina need them to stay to avoid relegation. This is why the best Christmas gift for Fiorentina would be to keep all the best players at least until the summer. \nJuventus: A new contract for VlahovicLast but not least, Juventus need to solve the situation regarding their main striker in 2026. Dusan Vlahovic will be out of contract in the summer and there are now increasing chances to see him leaving as a free agent in 2026 unless something changes before then. Juventus struggled to find a solution last summer, failing to either sell him or reach an agreement on a new contract. There is no more time to lose; this is something they need to take care of as soon as possible, with the striker averaging 16.3 goals per season the last three campaigns. \n            ",

The Mavs have won four consecutive home games straight-up, and covered a 6.5-point underdog spread in each of their last nine home contests. Both the Mavericks and Nuggets are playing the second half of a back-to-back, so fatigue could be a factor, which could hinder the usage and production of Denver veterans such as Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Cooper Flagg had 16 points, six rebounds and six assists on Monday, and he's averaging 24.3 points per game over his last 10 contests, playing like a true No. 1 overall pick.

However, Ohio has held opponents to 21 points or fewer in seven of its last eight games, and it also had some impressive non-conference showings in holding West Virginia to 10 points and Ohio State to 37 points. The Buckeyes scored more than 37 points in four of nine games in Big Ten play, which makes the fact that the MAC defense held them to that total even more impressive. UNLV's higher-ranked scoring offense often inflates its over/under total, which has resulted in the Under hitting in four of its last five games. The Under has also hit in three of the last five Ohio games, as the model projects the Under to hit in 69% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Trail Blazers (+105) to defeat the MagicPortland had its three-game winning streak snapped in a 110-102 loss to the Pistons on Monday, but Detroit has the second-best record in the NBA at 23-6 this season. Meanwhile, the Magic were mostly non-competitive in their 120-97 loss to the Warriors on Monday, dropping the third of their last four contests. The Magic are also dealing with multiple injuries, which has contribured to their recent skid. Meanwhile, Blazers forward Deni Avdija is averaging 25.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, making significant improvements in his fifth NBA season, and Portland is 2-1 over its last three home games.

    "body": "\n        Eight 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5).

USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "description": "\n        The NFL suspended DK Metcalf two games without pay stemming from his altercation with a fan during the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week 16 win over ",
    "body": "\n        The NFL suspended DK Metcalf two games without pay stemming from his altercation with a fan during the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week 16 win over the Detroit Lions. Metcalf appealed his suspension, but his appeal was denied Tuesday night by an officer assigned to represent both the NFL and NFLPA. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports Metcalf's suspension triggers what could be up to $40 million in voided contract guarantees. Pittsburgh's veteran receiver is slated to miss the Steelers' Week 17 road game against the Cleveland Browns and their Week 18 home game with the Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh (9-6) can clinch the AFC North division title with either a win over the Browns or a Ravens loss at Green Bay on Saturday night. Metcalf, who signed a four-year, $132 million deal with Pittsburgh this past offseason, is slated to lose $555,556 in salary over the next two weeks. \n\"I certainly don't condone the behavior, but I support DK Metcalf,\" coach Mike Tomlin said of Metcalf during his weekly press conference. \"He's been great. He cares, he works hard. He's a heck of a guy. He's a good teammate, and and that's why he's easy to support.\" The NFL determined that Metcalf's actions violated league policy, which specifies that \"players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.\"Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at a Lions fan during the first half of Pittsburgh's eventual 29-24 win. Metcalf reportedly had prior history with the fan when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. \nOn Tuesday morning, another video of the encounter surfaced that included the fan sharing that getting Metcalf to react to him \"was the goal.\" \nBecause this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by officials, it could not be penalized or result in an ejection, according to CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore. \"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in on from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said. \nThe fan, who identified himself as Ryan Kennedy, told The Detroit Free Press that the altercation stemmed from him calling Metcalf by his full name. A source close to Metcalf, however, told NFL Media that Kennedy called Metcalf's mom a derogatory word and also called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"Metcalf, who played the entire game, caught four passes for 42 yards and delivered a key block on Jaylen Warren's second 45-yard touchdown run that proved to be the game-winning score. How does this impact the Steelers?\nMetcalf's suspension won't matter if the Packers defeat the Ravens on Saturday night. If that happens, it would make Pittsburgh's final two regular-season games meaningless from a playoff standpoint.\nIf the Ravens beat the Packers, however, Metcalf's absence could become a significant factor for a Steelers team that would then need to win one of their remaining two games in order to capture the North and the playoff berth that comes with it. In addition to being the Steelers' leading receiver (in terms of receiving yards), Metcalf is also a physical presence in the running game, as evidenced on Warren's game-winning touchdown run against the Lions. Metcalf's physicality was one of the things that compelled the Steelers to acquire him this offseason. \nIf the Steelers need to win one of their remaining two games, Metcalf's absence will undoubtedly put more pressure on Pittsburgh's other skill players. Fortunately for the Steelers, they've received a recent uptick in production from their pass-catchers after acquiring veteran Adam Thielen and signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling off the practice squad. \nTomlin specifically mentioned Roman Wilson has someone whom he hopes steps up amid Metcalf's absence. A 2024 third-round pick, Wilson has 12 catches and two touchdowns this season, but his role has diminished with the recent additions of Thielen and Valdes-Scantling. \"I'm excited what this opportunity might mean for him to display growth in the midst of the time where he hadn't been participating,\" Tomlin said of Wilson. \"To show his professionalism and his readiness and how he's been sharpening his sword for battle in the ranks while he hadn't been playing.\"The Steelers have also continued to receive sizable contributions in the passing game from Warren and fellow running back Kenneth Gainwell. The duo has combined to catch 95 passes for 710 yards and five touchdowns that include Gainwell's unbelievable 45-yard touchdown catch during Sunday's win over the Lions. Gainwell is actually the Steelers' leading pass-catcher with 62 catches through 15 games. \nPittsburgh is also coming off of its best rushing performance of the season, which included 230 yards on 27 carries. Warren, who had two touchdown runs of 45 yards, is averaging 4.5 yards per carry and is 172 yards away from his first 1,000-yard rushing season. Gainwell has complemented Warren with 501 yards on the ground and a team-high 4.9 yards per carry. Metcalf's suspension will only impact the Steelers if the Ravens win on Saturday night. But even if that happens, it appears Pittsburgh has several players capable of stepping into the void.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last time former No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons suited up for an NBA game, he played under five minutes for the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 5 of their first-round playoff exit to the Denver Nuggets last season. He recorded zero points while recording one rebound and one block. It ended a season where Simmons played just 18 games for L.A. after being waived by the Brooklyn Nets in February, and signing a deal for the remainder of the season with the Clippers.He went unsigned as a free agent during the offseason, and while he's still working on an NBA comeback, the three-time All Star's focus has been on professional fishing as of late. Simmons told Andscape that he's been completing two-a-day basketball and strength and rehabilitation workouts six days a week, with hopes of making his return to the NBA. While there's no firm timeline for his return, and with no team there's certainly no expectations placed on him, the two-time All-Defensive player hopes to be healthy enough to join a team during the All-Star break, or perhaps next season. But he doesn't want to just be on a roster for the sake of it.\"I don't believe it's just [about] getting on a team,\" Simmons said. \"So, if I were to play right now, I think I'd fit right into the NBA just given what I can do. But I want to give everything I can to the game. I don't think there's any point in just wasting a spot just to be out there. I think that's a little selfish. And there are guys that do it now. But that's what it is, the business.\"In conjunction with workouts that Simmons says are \"exhausting,\" he's become an owner of a professional fishing team, the South Florida Sails. It's part of the Sport Fishing Championship league, which consists of 16 teams across 11 states. They compete in tournaments catching various fish, with a championship on the line at the end of a season.\n\"It's a very niche sport. And if you don't know, you don't know,\" Simmons said. \"But once you experience it and get out there and see what it's about, you're kind of in awe of what the sport is. And that's just something I've always been interested in in terms of the sport of fishing. The technique. And there's so much to it that people just don't understand. These guys are fishing on million-dollar vessels, and they're out for days at a time. So, it's tedious and gritty, but a lot of fun. It's one of those worlds where you just got to kind of experience it, get into it and see what it's about.\"Simmons isn't a member on the team, as he said he's \"not the best angler,\" but he's been incredibly committed to being involved from an ownership standpoint.\"I have a passion in helping these guys grow the sport because I really believe in it. So, for me to compete, it would be a little selfish. Maybe if I work hard enough to be a bit of an angler, maybe I'll put myself on the roster. But it's more so for me about building the community in Miami around the fishing. That's really important, and it's a responsibility that we have now.\"\nAs far as his NBA return goes, Simmons said he hasn't suffered any setbacks as he tries to rejoin the league. As encouraging as that is, Simmons hasn't played 60 or more games since his second season in the league -- which is pre-pandemic. He played 51 games last season split between the Nets and Clippers, but was still far away from the two-way floor general that earned him several accolades early in his career.In reality, Simmons might not ever return to that version of himself who was locking down the league's best offensive players on one end and dishing out some eyebrow-raising dimes on the other. But he still wants to try.\"We're human, we want to find out,\" Simmons said. \"I got to see. I don't think this story is over for me playing, but let's see where it goes. So as long as I put in that work and put the energy into doing that, then everything else will write itself.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his 2025 season and potentially his tenure with the franchise. Fields missed the last three games with a knee injury that coach Aaron Glenn said did not heal in a timely enough fashion for the signal-caller to return to the field this year.Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor. The latter has been dealing with a pair of injuries of his own, which opened the door for Brady Cook to make back-to-back starts the last two weeks. Cook, an undrafted rookie, projects to remain in the lineup for Sunday's divisional game against the New England Patriots.While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.\"We're gonna put Justin on IR,\" Glenn said. \"We tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.\"\nFields said last week that he underwent an MRI on the injured knee and that the imaging revealed an issue that would keep him out on a \"week-to-week\" basis. The injury occurred in practice ahead of the Dec. 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter. It was an up-and-down year for the former first-round pick wherein the lows were tremendously low and the high points were few and far between. Fields threw for fewer than 55 yards in four of his nine starts and in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills completed just three of his 11 pass attempts in one of the worst games by an NFL quarterback this season.Although he threw just one interception on the year, Fields was highly inefficient in completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards. He did make an impact as a ballcarrier, though, rushing for 383 yards and four touchdowns.\nWill Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?Fields signed with the Jets last spring on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed. While he remains under contract through 2026, it became clear this season that he is unlikely to be part of the team's long-term plans, and both sides could likely benefit from parting ways at the end of the year.Adding to the likelihood that Fields and the Jets break up before the 2026 season is the fact that New York will receive an early-first round draft pick and could use it on a quarterback. Unless they feel as though Cook could develop into a capable starter, the leader of their 2026 offense is probably not yet on their roster.The Jets would incur $22 million in dead cap space if they cut Fields after the season. Fields could command interest on the trade market as a backup, though, and still possesses upside as a potential post-hype breakout candidate in the right situation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Washington Wizards announced that forward Cam Whitmore will be out indefinitely after being diagnosed with deep-vein thrombosis. Whitmore had missed the last six games, and the last two was specifically due to right shoulder soreness, and after further evaluation it was determined that he had DVT.DVT can cause blood clots in the veins of the arms or legs, and has become more commonplace for NBA players to be dealing with it. Last season, Damian Lillard missed time after a blood clot was discovered in his calf. Similarly, Victor Wembanyama's season was cut short last season due to a blood clot in his right shoulder from DVT. He missed the last 29 games of the season.It's an unfortunate blow for Whitmore, who was averaging 10.4 points on 47% from the floor in the last 11 games. While a timeline for his return is unknown, there is precedent for players returning with no issues after being diagnosed with DVT. Wembanyama is a great example of that. Detroit Pistons forward Ausar Thompson, missed the last month of his rookie season and the first month of last season with DVT, but has had no issues this season while averaging a career high on the East leading Pistons.Treating DVT is dependent on the location of the blood clot, but ensuring it's taken care of is crucial. If untreated, the blood clot can potentially travel to the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism, which can be life threatening.\nGiven the timeline of previous players who have dealt with this, Whitmore may miss a significant amount of time while this is taken care of. It's a tough situation for Whitmore in his first season with the Wizards after being traded by the Rockets this past summer. For the Wizards, they lose some wing depth in their rotation, though given they have the worst record in the league at 5-22, the focus is surely more on Whitmore's long-term health than any wins and losses that occur this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Missouri linebacker Damon Wilson II is suing the University of Georgia's athletic association and its Classic City Collective, which he says is attempting to \"punish\" him through a \"coordinated campaign\" for his decision to transfer. Earlier this month, Georgia sought $390,000 in damages citing a clause in Wilson's NIL contract after his departure to another SEC program.The lawsuit initiated what appears to be a landmark case in college football, which now includes the plaintiff fighting back with his own legal documents. Highlighting a 42-page complaint filed Dec. 23 in Boone County, Missouri, Wilson's attorneys claim Georgia tried to sabotage their client's potential destinations after employees \"falsely\" told \"at least three programs that -- if Wilson left Georgia and joined their programs -- Wilson would be subject to a $1.2 million buyout.\"The complaint claims Georgia \"continued to assert similar demands in an effort to harass Wilson and impair his on-field performance for a conference rival\" throughout the 2025 regular season.Wilson signed a new deal with Georgia's NIL collective in December 2024 during the College Football Playoff, but entered the transfer portal and moved to Missouri weeks later. While documents show Georgia paid Wilson $30,000 under the terms of the new deal before his departure, the athletic department states Wilson owed a $390,000 lump sum within 30 days of his exit.\nThe contract was a 14-month agreement worth $500,000, which was set to be paid in monthly $30,000 increments. Georgia would have also paid Wilson two $40,000 retention bonuses at the end of the NCAA transfer portal windows. The exit clause states that Wilson would owe a lump-sum payment worth the total he would have received if he remained with the program through the duration of the contract.\"The era of universities exerting total control over the career trajectories and rights of their student-athletes has been dead for nearly half a decade,\" Wilson's complaint said. \"Nonetheless, UGAA has demonstrated that, left to its own devices, it will attempt to exploit every loophole to deprive student-athletes like Wilson of the ability to reap the benefits of full and fair competition for their NIL rights.\"The previous term sheet signed by Wilson, his representation argues, was not a \"legally binding document\" as Georgia states. \n\"CCC failed even to present Wilson what it promised in the Term Sheet -- a \"full License and Option Agreement,\" the lawsuit said. \"The parties thus never executed a legally binding agreement containing any of the provisions in the Term Sheet.\"Wilson appeared in 26 games at Georgia from during the 2023 and 2024 seasons and projected to be an impact starter prior to his decision to leave the program.Georgia's NIL collective's two now-former CEOs -- Matt Hibbs and Tanner Potts -- were named in the lawsuit. Wilson seeks a \"fair and reasonable amount of damages\" for \"financial and reputational harm he has suffered\" in the aftermath of playing at Missouri this season. \n            ",

McCarthy for their Christmas matchup against the Detroit Lions, as the second-year quarterback suffered a \"very, very small hairline fracture\" on his right throwing hand, coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters on Tuesday.Max Brosmer will make his second career start on Thursday in place of McCarthy. His first NFL start came in Week 13, where the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0. Brosmer threw for 126 yards and four interceptions in that matchup.Despite the late-season injury, the Vikings are not placing McCarthy on injured reserve. He missed the second half of Sunday's 16-13 victory against the New York Giants with the hand injury, and completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and one interception.It's another unfortunate development for McCarthy, who has already missed 23 of 32 career games due to various injuries. The former No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft missed his entire rookie season due to a torn mensicus, and has missed six starts this year due to a high ankle sprain, and then a concussion. In nine starts this season, McCarthy has accounted for 15 touchdowns and 14 turnovers. \nThe 7-8 Vikings are in last place in the NFC North, and have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Minnesota upset the Lions in Detroit earlier this season in Week 9. McCarthy threw for 143 yards and scored three total touchdowns in that matchup.\n            \n    ",

This organization, this city, has been so good to me.\"\nDespite a wide range of emotions and questions on his next move, Hill said the main focus is on the rest of the season, saying he will \"tackle the rest of that as we get down the road.\"\n            \n    ",

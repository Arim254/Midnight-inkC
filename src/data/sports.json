Over/unders of this range have heavenly leaned towards the Under for both teams, with them going a combined 9-4 when the total is between 231 and 234. The Lakers have failed to reach the total in each of their last two games, while the Under is 5-2 over the last seven Detroit contests.Detroit has one of the league's best defenses, ranking second in defensive rating and fifth in points allowed per game. The Pistons lead the NBA in blocks and rank third in steals, which will make a Lakers team missing two starters in Reaves and Hachimura -- who combine for nearly 40 ppg -- struggle to put points on the scoreboard. Add in that both teams rank among the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage and made 3-pointers per game, and there should be lots of rebounds to grab on both ends. The Under is projected to hit 54.2% of the timeIt has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits in over 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Lakers vs. Pistons, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Pistons vs. Lakers spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule continues Tuesday with a three-game slate, including No. 16 USC vs. TCU in the nightcap at 9 p.m. ET. USC fell short of a College Football Playoff berth and had multiple players opt out of the Alamo Bowl, where TCU will have a home-state advantage. The Trojans are 6.5-point favorites in the college football bowl odds, while the over/under is 55.5. SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Over in that matchup, and it has also revealed two other picks for Tuesday's action.  The model has Coastal Carolina (+9.5) covering the spread against Louisiana Tech in the Independence Bowl, while Tennessee (-2.5) covers 71% of the time against Illinois in the Music City Bowl. Before locking in your college football picks for Tuesday, Dec. 30, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can also target the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Coastal Carolina (+9.5) vs. Louisiana TechCoastal Carolina is appearing in a bowl game for the sixth season in a row, but head coach Tim Beck was fired on Nov. 30. Interim coach Jeremiah Johnson was Louisiana Tech's defensive coordinator last season, so he is familiar with the Bulldogs. They lost to Army in the 2024 Independence Bowl, and they dropped four of their final seven games down the stretch of the regular season. Coastal Carolina is on a three-game skid, but one of those losses came to South Carolina, and another came against College Football Playoff entrant James Madison. The model is expecting a much closer game than the oddsmakers, as Coastal Carolina is covering in 66% of simulations.   Tennessee (-2.5) vs. IllinoisTennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar will play his final game for the Vols on Tuesday after leading the SEC with 3,444 passing yards and accounting for 27 total touchdowns. He will be without wide receiver Chris Brazzell II, but he was the only key opt out for Tennessee's offense. Illinois is going to be without left tackle J.C. Davis, who opted out and declared for the NFL draft. The Fighting Illini struggled against the top teams they played during the regular season, losing to Indiana and Ohio State by a combined score of 97-26. The model has Tennessee cruising to a double-digit win on Tuesday in front of an in-state crowd, as the Vols cover in 71% of simulations. Over 55.5 in USC vs. TCUUSC is going to be without star wide receivers Makai Lemon and Ja'Kobi Lane, who opted out to prepare for the draft. However, quarterback Jayden Maiava is still running the show after racking up 3,431 yards and 23 touchdowns during the regular season. Freshman wide receiver Tanook Hines had 28 receptions for 398 yards and two scores this year, so he is one player who can fill the void left by Lemon and Lane. TCU scored 45 points in its regular-season finale and does not have many opt outs for this contest. The model is projecting 64 points, as the Over hits 64% of the time.  Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Tuesday, Dec. 30.

Green Bay is locked into the No. 7 seed and could rest its starters, including a banged-up Jordan Love, but it should still have enough to stay within a touchdown versus an imbalanced Vikings team. Minnesota had 3 passing yards in its Christmas win over Detroit, which is the fewest by any team in a win in 19 years. The Vikings rank 29th in total offense, 30th in turnover differential and dead last in giveaways. Also, since Matt LaFleur became coach in 2019, Green Bay owns the NFL's third best spread record (19-10) as a road underdog. The model has Green Bay prevailing versus the spread nearly 70% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Packers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 18 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-12.5, 47.5) cover versus the Titans in over 50% of simulations in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. The Jags have won seven straight, can wrap up the division with a Week 18 win, and have a shot at the AFC's No. 1 seed if they get some help. So, motivation won't be a question for Jacksonville, which is 6-1 straight up and 5-2 ATS over its last seven matchups versus Tennessee. The Jaguars also boast the league's best home spread record (6-1) in 2025, while the Titans are one of two teams to rank in the bottom five in both scoring offense and scoring defense. SportsLine's model predicts Jacksonville to cover, as well as the over hitting 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Jags to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 18 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 18 NFL schedule and just revealed six teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

The team ruled him out for the second half and the three-time MVP is set to undergo an MRI on Tuesday.Jokić fell to the ground after making accidental contact with teammate Spencer Jones, who was guarding Jaime Jaquez Jr. Jokić immediately fell while grabbing his left knee after making contact with Jones. He was quickly surrounded by members of the team's training staff. \n\"Immediately, he knew something was wrong,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman told reporters after the game. \"Hey, this is part of the NBA. Anybody who gets hurt in this game, it's kind of gut-wrenching, especially somebody as special as he is. We'll find out more tomorrow. We'll move on as a team. Obviously, right now, I'm more concerned just about him as a person and the disappointment of going through something like that.\"Jokić, 30, is in the midst of another MVP-caliber season. A three-time league MVP and the 2023 NBA Finals MVP, Jokić is averaging 29.9 points and is leading the league in both rebounds (12.4) and assists (11.1) per game for the Nuggets, who are off to a 22-9 start. \nBad luck would be better than the luck the Nuggets have had this year from an injury standpoint. Aaron Gordon is currently out with a hamstring injury, Cameron Johnson is expected to miss 4 to 6 weeks after injuring his knee earlier this month, and Christian Braun is out indefinitely after suffering a significant ankle sprain last month. \n            \n    ",

Another vote will also take place to determine who will make it out of the senior/coach/contributor category. On the ballot this year are senior finalists Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, coach finalist Bill Belichick and contributor finalist Robert Kraft. Each of these finalists will also need 80% of the vote in order to receive enshrinement. Here's a rundown of each of this year's modern-era finalists, a group that includes four former players who are eligible for the first time. Willie Anderson, OT (1996-08): One of the best right tackles of his era, Anderson received four straight Pro Bowl selections from 2003-06 and also earned All-Pro three straight years over that span. His blocking helped running back Corey Dillon break Jim Brown's rookie single-game rushing record in 1997 and Walter Payton's all-time single-game rushing mark in 2000. **Drew Brees, QB (2001-20): Brees retired as the NFL's all-time leader in career passing yards and touchdown passes and is second in both categories to Tom Brady. He led the Saints to their first Super Bowl win in 2009, throwing for 288 yards and two touchdowns in New Orleans' 31-17 win over the Colts. Jahri Evans, G (2006-17): Evans was an All-Pro four straight years from 2009-12. A member of the Hall of Fame All-2010s Team, Evans played an key role in the Saints' first Super Bowl win in 2009. **Larry Fitzgerald, WR (2004-20): One of the most productive wideouts in league history, Fitzgerald is second to Jerry Rice in career catches and receiving yards. He put on a clinic during the 2008 playoffs, catching 30 passes for 546 yards and seven touchdowns in four games while helping the Cardinals clinch their first Super Bowl berth. **Frank Gore, RB (2005-20): Gore's amazing longevity allowed him to retire as the NFL's third all-time leading rusher with 16,000 yards. From 2006-13, Gore earned five Pro Bowl nods while being the driving force behind a 49ers team that played in one Super Bowl and three consecutive NFC title games. Torry Holt, WR (1999-09): A key member of the Rams' \"Greatest Show on Turf,\" Holt helped the Rams win their first Super Bowl, catching a touchdown pass in the win over the Titans. He twice led the league in receiving yards and delivered eight consecutive seasons with over 1,100 receiving yards. Luke Kuechly, LB (2012-19): While injuries cut his career short, Kuechly left an indelible mark on the Panthers and the NFL during his eight-year career. A Pro Bowler seven straight years, Kuechly was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2015 while leading the Panthers to a 15-1 season and the franchise's second Super Bowl berth. Eli Manning, QB (2004-19): Manning's legacy is his and the Giants' two remarkable playoff runs that culminated in upset wins over the Patriots in the Super Bowl. New York's first Super Bowl win was iconic in that it was the second-largest upset in Super Bowl history. Manning's incredible completion to David Tyree late in the game set up his game-winning touchdown pass in the Giants' 17-14 win. Terrell Suggs, EDGE (2003-19): One of the most intimidating pass rushers of his era, Suggs racked up 139 sacks during his 17-year career. He won Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2011 after recording 14 sacks, picking off two passes and forcing a league-high seven fumbles. Adam Vinatieri, K (1996-19): The NFL's all-time leading scorer, Vinatieri won three Super Bowls with the Patriots before winning a fourth with the Colts. He made two game-winning field goals in addition to making two clutch field goals in the snow during the New England's comeback win over the Raiders in the 2001 playoffs that jump-started the Patriots' dynasty. Reggie Wayne, WR (2001-14): While many considered him Robin to Marvin Harrison's Batman, Wayne was an elite player in his own right. He sits just behind Harrison on the career receiving yards list and is 11th all-time in career receptions. His 53-yard touchdown catch jump-started the Colts' 29-17 win over the Bears in Super Bowl XLI. Kevin Williams, DT (2003-15): A key cog in the middle of the Vikings' defense for 11 years, Williams earned six Pro Bowls over a seven-year span from 2004-10. During his first two seasons, Williams recorded a whopping 22 sacks, four fumble recoveries and two interceptions. **Jason Witten, TE (2003-20): Witten is the Cowboys' career leader in both career receptions and receiving yards. Tony Gonzalez is the only tight end with more career catches and receiving receiving yard than Witten. Darren Woodson, S (1992-03): The Cowboys' all-time leader in tackles, Woodson was named to five consecutive Pro Bowls from 1994-98 and was a All-Pro three straight years over that span. He played a key role in the Cowboys' dynasty that included three Super Bowls over a four-year span. Marshal Yanda, OL (2007-19): Yanda was a Pro Bowler eight times during his final nine seasons. He spent his entire career with the Ravens and helped Baltimore capture its most recent Super Bowl title at the end of the 2012 season. His blocking helped Joe Flacco earn MVP honors during the Ravens' Super Bowl win over the 49ers. ** -- Players who are eligble for induction for the first time \nThe entire 2026 Hall of Fame class will be announced on  Feb. 5 from the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Tuesday is LeBron James' birthday. He's 41. That's not so old for a person. But for a basketball player, even one as supremely talented and fit as LeBron, it's a pretty advanced age. Given the unforgiving athlete actuarial table, there's been a fair amount of hand wringing about how much longer he'll keep playing. James hasn't announced anything, but that hasn't stopped people from reading the retirement tea leaves. Ahead of getting flattened last week by the Rockets, LeBron was asked about playing in his NBA-record -- at this point it's almost easier to list the things he does that are not NBA records -- 20th Christmas Day game. James has previously been pretty open about his fondness for those games and how much they mean to the league. Just last year he proudly proclaimed that \"Christmas is our day,\" a good-natured but defiant shot at the NFL's hostile takeover attempt of the holiday. This time around James said all the right things about Christmas Day being \"the game that I love\" and the one he watched when he was a kid. He called it an honor to play in it. But he also added a candid caveat. \"I'm gonna be completely honest,\" James said, \"I would like to be home on the couch with my family all throughout the day. But our number is called, so we have to go out and perform and I look forward to it.\"\nThis raised some eyebrows. What does he mean he'd rather be home on the couch?! Which I thought was silly because who among us wants to work on a holiday rather than hang with loved ones and get a little sideways on eggnog? The man is human. Let him live.Not long before that, LeBron was asked about whether Keyonte George -- who is having a breakout season in Utah -- should be an All-Star. James didn't try to fake a response. Looking cozy in a beanie and a hoodie, flecks of gray in his beard, LeBron replied that he was \"the wrong guy to ask\" because \"I watch YouTube golf these days.\" The nonchalance was a bit unusual but not exactly Charles and Shaq doing \"Who He Play For?\" Still, it led to speculation among the pundit class about whether James was a little checked out and perhaps eying the door. It is how things go for James now. The grand accomplishments of his past have people wondering how soon his present playing days will give way to a very different future. It is simultaneously understandable and a little odd. Despite all the mileage -- he has played more seasons than anyone in NBA history -- LeBron remains extremely good at basketball. Last season, he made second-team All-NBA. It was his 21st consecutive selection, another record. \nThis season, he missed the first 13 games with sciatica. As he was nearing his return, he was asked how he might fit in with the Lakers. The basic premise being that it was Luka Dončić's team now, and, oh by the way, Austin Reaves had stepped forward in his absence and signaled that he's an All-Star caliber player who was ready to be the 1A option moving forward. So where did all that leave LeBron, someone wondered. James, arguably the best player of all time, was incredulous. \"I can fit in with anybody,\" James said. \"I don't even understand why that was even a question. What's wrong with these people out here?\"That sort of annoyed reaction did not seem to me like someone who's ready to ease into a rocking chair and stake himself out a good spot at the staring window. Someone ought to go ask Luke Kornet if he thinks LeBron is washed. The poor guy probably wakes up in a flop sweat from what James did to him just a few weeks ago. \nLeBron's insistence that he can fit in with anyone wasn't just his ego talking. There's nothing he can't do on a basketball court. What he seemed to be implying was that he didn't need to be the primary scorer every night any longer, though he can still serve in that capacity as needed (as he did over the weekend when he victimized the Kings with 24 extremely efficient points, going 11-of-13 from the floor in the win). Beyond that, James retains a whole host of useful skillsets. He is, for example, one of the greatest passers of all-time and thinks the game better than just about anyone, ever. For proof of that particular concept, I'd like to enter into evidence the events on the evening of Dec. 4 in Toronto.With the game tied at 120, LeBron took the ball at the top of the arc with four seconds remaining. He had eight points and could have forced his way to the rim in an attempt to extend his double-digit scoring streak, another NBA record that stood at 1,297 consecutive games spanning 17 years. Worst case scenario, he might have missed, the game would have gone to overtime, and the Lakers could have still won while he would have given himself an added opportunity to keep the streak alive. Instead he hit Rui Hachimura in the corner.That was one of a game-high 11 assists LeBron had that night. Two weeks later in Utah, with Reaves unavailable, he had 10 more assists. James also got to the line 13 times and made 12 of his free throws. Maybe he won't be terrorizing the Luke Kornets of the league with sheer athleticism much longer, but it's those kinds of plays -- the passing, making the right reads, doing what's needed in a certain situation -- that have always been the secret sauce to his greatness. If he wanted to play an old-man, dad-bod style game where he whips assists around the court and runs at half-speed like he's the best grey beard dominating the local YMCA pickup game, he could absolutely do so and still have an impact into his mid-40s. \nThe other thing to consider here on the matter of James eventually calling it quits is how he does it. It's hard to imagine him pulling a Tim Duncan and disappearing into the shadows one day without warning. He's LeBron. One-name superstars are industries all to themselves. You have to think that whatever act that comes after this will be preceded by a proper sendoff. When Kobe Bryant announced his retirement he spent an entire season touring the country and being feted at every stop. I covered his final appearance in Philadelphia, a game that doubled as both homecoming and a fitting farewell to one of the greats. He deserved it. So does LeBron. Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part, hoping that LeBron sticks around a while longer and that he still has plenty left to wring out of the basketball rag. He hasn't had anything left to prove in a while, and the allure of sitting on the couch with his family might win out sooner the later. But if we're going to speculate about how much more he'll play, I thought The Onion had one of the better contributions to date: \"LeBron pressures Bronny to have grandchildren before he's too old to play with them in the NBA.\" Get going, Bronny. Time's ticking. \n            ",

Due to Atlanta's win, the Buccaneers WON'T be able to clinch the division on Saturday if they beat the Panthers. The Bucs will also need the Falcons to lose to the Saints on Sunday. That new wrinkle was added following the Falcons' shocking win that improved their record to 7-9. Let's take a quick look at the NFC South standings so we can breakdown why Atlanta's win made such a huge difference in the division title race: TeamOverall recordHead to headConference recordPanthers8-83-0 (2-0 vs. Falcons, 1-0 vs. Buccaneers)6-5Buccaneers7-91-2 (1-1 vs. Falcons, 0-1 vs. Panthers)5-6Falcons7-91-3 (0-2 vs. Panthers, 1-1 vs. Buccaneers)6-5If the Buccaneers beat the Panthers and then the Falcons follow that up on Sunday with a win over the Saints, that would create a three-way tie at 8-9 and the Panthers would the division in that scenario due to having the best head-to-head record among all three teams. \nThis means that Atlanta's win over the Rams gave the Panthers an extra way to clinch the division. The Panthers will now clinch the division title if EITHER of the following two things happens in Week 18: Panthers beat/tie Buccaneers ORFalcons beat SaintsAs for the Buccaneers, they now only have one path to the NFC South title and it looks like this:Buccaneers beat Panthers AND Falcons lose/tie with SaintsIf the Falcons had lost on Monday night, then Saturday's game between the Bucs and Panthers would have been a winner-take-all battle for the division title. Instead, Carolina is now the only team that can clinch on Saturday and that will happen if the Panthers win. If the Bucs win, they'll be rooting hard for the Saints on Sunday because a New Orleans win would send Tampa Bay to the postseason. \nThe team that ends up winning the NFC South will go into the playoffs as the fourth seed and they'll get to host either the Rams, Seahawks or 49ers in the opening round of the playoffs. Although that might sound like a favorable matchup for one of those three NFC West teams, don't forget: The Buccaneers beat both the Seahawks and 49ers this year while the Panthers beat the Rams.\n            \n    ",

The Colts will start rookie Riley Leonard Sunday against the Houston Texans, and send 44-year-old Philip Rivers to the bench, per ESPN.The Colts turned to the Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist after Daniel Jones went down with a torn Achilles in the Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite losing all three of his starts, Rivers played better than expected. He completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions. Those four passing touchdowns are tied for the third-most by a player 44 or older all-time.\"I told you guys I wasn't going to have any regrets about coming back and I don't,\" Rivers said. \"Other than us not winning ... it's been an absolute blast for three weeks. If I go back and say, 'All right, now you know everything's going to happen, what are you going to do?' I'd do it all again. It's been absolutely awesome. So, yeah, I mean, if it's the last one, it's the last one.\"  The Colts selected Leonard in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The Notre Dame product led the Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff National Championship last year, and completed 66.7% of his passes for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Leonard was also known as a tough runner, racking up 906 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns in 2024. In his first extensive NFL action in Week 14, Leonard completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception, but did score a rushing touchdown. \nThe 2025 season fell apart quickly for the Colts, as they lost six straight games following an 8-2 start. As Indy wraps up this disappointing campaign, Shane Steichen will get a look at the youngest quarterback on his roster. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In the seconds after the attempted punch out of the football, Texas Tech All-American linebacker Jacob Rodriguez will occasionally have a concerning thought: \"I think I broke my hand.\" Sometimes he missed and hit a face mask or shoulder pad. Sometimes he connected with the ball, but it didn't move. His wrist though …  Sometimes he can't tell exactly what's wrong because his hand is too busy pulsating with pain. It's happened at least five times this season. It's also led to an FBS-high seven forced fumbles. So, you can bet Rodriguez will keep swinging. \n\"That's just the risk and reward,\" Rodriguez told CBS Sports. \"I'd much rather go punch as hard as I can and miss than punch soft and not get the ball out. It's all about managing that risk.\" In that way Rodriguez is a perfect embodiment of what Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire labels as a \"take three\" defense. The No. 4 Red Raiders, who face No. 5 Oregon in Thursday's College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Orange Bowl, want to create three takeaways every single week. They've largely succeeded, leading the FBS with 31 forced turnovers through 13 games. Rodriguez has accounted for 11 of them on his own -- more than 22 FBS teams have for the entire year. Four interceptions. Seven forced fumbles, many of which have come via punch out. \n\"I've never been around a guy who has that instinct, that ability, that knack for doing it,\" Texas Tech defensive coordinator Shiel Wood said. Pretty high compliment for a player who's only played defense since 2022. Rodriguez is a quarterback by trade. That's what he went to Virginia out of high school to do as a borderline four-star prospect in the 2021 class. It wasn't until he walked on at Texas Tech following his freshman season that defense became part of his reality. The punch out took a season or two to become part of Rodriguez's repertoire. It's something that popped on film as Rodriguez watched the great llinebackers and how they created game-changing plays. Linebackers are already trained to rip at the ball as the second player in on a tackle. Rodriguez wanted to do more.   \n\"I kind of thought, 'Why not?'\" Rodriguez said. \"Why wait to be the second guy in when you can do it all in one?\" \nThere probably isn't a better example of Rodriguez's ability to both finish a tackle and punch at the same time than a fumble he forced this season against Kansas State's All-Big 12 tight end Garrett Oakley. Rodriguez squared up to make the tackle, before planting with his right foot and swinging at the ball. He connected and it went flying. Rodriguez didn't see it. He was too busy bringing Oakley to the ground in one motion, wrapping up with the same arm that punched the ball out.\nWhen Rodriguez thinks about that play, which swung a 12-7 game early in the third quarter, he breaks it down in two areas: 1. Rodriguez likes punching with his dominant right hand. Same foot. Same shoulder. That's how you strike. It's where the power comes from. 2. You can't be afraid. Any hesitation will lead to a missed tackle. You've got to trust your teammates to clean up, and Rodriguez knows the 10 others on the field with him are doing their \"dead-level best\" to fly at the ball.\"That one came out pretty clean,\" Rodriguez said. Punching out may seem like in-the-moment brute force, but it's as much science as it is instinct. Texas Tech spends a period each week practicing different forms of punch outs and strip sacks. There are weighted footballs mounted in Texas Tech's facility that defenders are supposed to strike when they walk by. You've got to hit them hard. As Rodriguez would tell you, punching a dense 10-pound football hurts if you don't hit it with enough force. Even part of Texas Tech's offseason practice is built around the punch.  Every Saturday morning the Red Raiders participate in a \"Fight Club,\" a boxing workout where some 40 players -- spread across two waves -- move through stations that train everything from footwork and hitting speed bags. The Red Raiders aren't trying to become boxers. It's just good cardio. But it's not lost on Rodriguez that those sessions have increased his hand/wrist strength and got his hands ready for contact. \nThere's also a situational awareness necessary to even try the punch. Rodriguez is an All-American linebacker because of more than just his ability to force turnovers. He's the centerpiece of the nation's No. 1 rush defense. Texas Tech gets players to the ground over and over again. When Rodriguez thinks about the punch, it only makes sense in certain situations. If it's third down, Rodriguez probably isn't trying to force a fumble. Why bother if they're just going to punt with a stop and an extra yard or two by the offense can extend a drive? First and second down it's far more likely he'll try. On the goal line? Rodriguez will punch every time. It's all he thinks about. It's the play that can change the game. Punching is a risk-reward pursuit. Rodriguez is so good at it because he's done the calculations to mitigate that jeopardy. \n\"He plays with a ton of confidence because he puts in the work,\" Wood said. \nOnly five FBS players the last 20 years have forced more career fumbles than Rodriguez with 13 of those coming over the last three seasons. Not all of those have come via the punch, but it's become Rodriguez's signature much like it was for Charles \"Peanut\" Tillman on the Chicago Bears. When thinking about the origin of his forced fumble technique, Rodriguez can't remember the exact moment he made it happen the first time. The feeling? That's a different story. He compares it to baseball when you hit a ball square on the sweet spot of the bat, and it just flies effortlessly. It's the same for the punch. So many times, Rodriguez will swing at the ball and his hand stops. It hits the ball. It hits a shoulder pad. \nOccasionally, he'll hit the ball just right and his hand will slide right through where the ball sat moments before. \"It's like euphoria,\" Rodriguez said. \"It's such a cool feeling.\" That's what Rodriguez chases every Saturday. The moment that happens more for him than any other player in college football in recent memory. How could fear or pain outweigh that?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All throughout the latter portion of the season, we have been keeping tabs on the NFL's MVP race. And all throughout the latter portion of the season, there has been a favorite. When we did this exercise last week, for example, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had -220 odds at DraftKings, giving him an implied 68.8% chance of taking home the trophy. What a difference a week makes. Stafford's dud on \"Monday Night Football\" in the Rams' loss to the Atlanta Falcons, combined with Drake Maye's five-touchdown detonation against the New York Jets has totally flipped the narrative and the race.In the space below, we'll examine the odds and the scenarios for one final time this season, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 18 picks and score predictions: 49ers win thriller over Seahawks, Ravens-Steelers goes down to wire\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDrake Maye (-400)\nMaye's -400 odds at DraftKings give him an implied 80% chance of winning the MVP. That's higher than Stafford had at any point during the MVP watch we've been doing throughout the latter portion of the season. It would take something pretty incredible happening in the final week of the season for Maye not to win, unless the voting goes significantly differently than the oddsmakers expect. Basically, unless he has a total meltdown, the award is his to lose. If Maye has a representative performance against the Dolphins on Sunday, he is probably going to take it home.Matthew Stafford (+300)\nStafford entered \"Monday Night Football\" as the favorite for the award despite the fact that Maye had just thrown five touchdown passes and that his own team was in third place in its own division. But his three-interception game in a loss to the Falcons threw a wrench into everything. Now, he needs to come from behind in order to win.\nThe Rams plan on playing at least some of their starters in Week 18, Sean McVay said following the loss to Atlanta, but it'll be interesting to see if he sticks to that. The Rams in the past have generally rested guys when only seeding was on the line in the final week of the season. If Stafford does play, he probably needs to have his single-best game of the year in order to remind people why he was the favorite until this very week, and he needs Maye to fall apart against the Dolphins as well.Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams (+18000)Justin Herbert and Josh Allen (+30000)Sam Darnold and Bo Nix (+40000)Lawrence and Williams each have an implied 0.55% chance of winning MVP, according to these odds. Herbert and Allen have a 0.33% chance. And Darnold and Nix have a 0.25% chance.\nIn other words, none of them are going to win, and they're likely not going to come close. But they are likely going to garner some down-ballot votes, and what happens this weekend will go a long way toward determining whether those votes are third-, fourth- or fifth-place votes.If Lawrence and/or Williams can help their team secure the No. 2 seed in the conference, that could help them rise up the board. If Allen plays and dons his Superman cape, the reigning MVP could remind people what he's capable of. Darnold and Nix seem least likely to land on ballots at all given how much credit their defenses and head coaches get for the teams' successes, but if they put together superb performances to land the top seed in their respective conferences, they could definitely get there. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season's final slate, Week 18, has one-and-a-half win-or-go-home games in each conference: the Carolina Panthers (8-8) at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9) for the NFC South title and the Baltimore Ravens (8-8) at the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7) for the AFC North title. Even with a loss, the Panthers can clinch the NFC South if the Atlanta Falcons beat the New Orleans Saints.These matchups mostly function as unofficial playoff games with the winner clinching their respective conference's No. 4 seed and first-round playoff while both losers' respective seasons will end just short of the postseason. Some may not like that two NFL division winners who will finish either at or just above .500 will be hosting a playoff game against the top wild card team in each conference that will have a better record than the home team they're playing against. That's the NFL's playoff format, and here's how it works and why it makes sense for professional football.The four division winners in both the AFC and NFC earn a home playoff game and are seeded first through fourth based on overall record. The three non-division winners with the top records earn wild card spots and are ranked with seeds five through seven. Those three squads square off against division winners on the road in the wild card round of the postseasonEvery division champion earns a home playoff game, no matter the division winner's record. The Detroit Lions did propose a rule change proposal for the playoffs to be seeded by overall record instead of by division champions this past offseason, but the withdrew it after it lacked league-wide support.\nHere's how the 2025 playoff picture, entering Week 18, would change if winning a division no longer guaranteed opening-round home games. The AFC North and NFC South winners would both slide into the postseason as the seventh and final seeds and have to travel to their respective conference's No. 2 seed instead of hosting their respective conference's top wild card team. The 49ers and Rams, who are the loaded NFC West's current Nos. 2 and 3 teams, would rise to being top three seeds in the NFC as a whole. 2025 playoff seeding entering Week 18*Division championSeedNFC under 2025 formatNFC if seeded only by recordAFC under 2025 formatAFC if seeded only by record  1Seahawks (13-3)Seahawks (13-3)  Broncos (13-3)*Broncos (13-3)*  2Bears (11-5)*  49ers (12-4)  Patriots (13-3)*Patriots (13-3)*  3Eagles (11-5)*Bears (11-5)*  Jaguars (12-4)Jaguars (12-4)4Panthers (8-8)Eagles (11-5)*    Steelers (9-7)Texans (11-5)549ers (12-4)Rams (11-5)  Texans (11-5)Chargers (11-5)6Rams (12-4)Packers (9-6-1)Chargers (11-5)Bills (11-5)7Packers (9-6-1)Panthers (8-8)Bills (11-5)Steelers (9-7)Why divisions matter uniquely to the NFLAll 32 NFL teams can't play each other every season. The sport is too violent. Many teams limp into the postseason from a health perspective after completing the league's current 17-game slate. The NFL requires teams to play all three of their division opponents twice a year -- once at home and once away -- that means some teams that play in tougher divisions get penalized more than others with naturally harder schedules.If divisions were to only exist for scheduling, what's the point of having them at all? A division champion earning at least one home playoff game makes sense because it means the best team is rewarded, no matter the circumstance, out of the four that play the most similar schedules. Without rewarding division winners with home games, what's to keep longstanding rivalries from mattering? The reward of the home playoff game is the driving factor for teams to actually care about winning the division beyond receiving a new hat and t-shirt.How much has home-field advantage mattered in the 4-5 matchup when the lower seed has the better record?Across the past two years, having the home field in the 4-5 matchup in which the top wild card team has had the better record has definitely matter with the division winner winning 4 of 5 such matchups since 2023. Since the playoff format expanded to 14 teams in 2020, home field hasn't mattered as greatly with the No. 4 seed -- the division winner with the lesser record -- winning 5 of 8 such matchups this decade. That's a difference, but it's negligible. Wild card games where lower seed had better record, since 2020 (start of 14-team format)YearDivision winner (record)Wild-card team (record)Winner2020Washington (7-9)Buccaneers (11-5)Buccaneers 2022Jaguars (9-8)Chargers (10-7)Jaguars 2022Buccaneers (8-9)Cowboys (12-5)Cowboys2023Texans (10-7)Browns (11-6)Texans2023Buccaneers (9-8)Eagles (11-6)Buccaneers2024Texans (10-7)Chargers (11-6)Texans2024Buccaneers (10-7)Commanders (12-5)Commanders2024Rams (10-7)Vikings (14-3)RamsNo one cried that the Vikings should have had home-field advantage after the Rams' pass rush sacked Sam Darnold an NFL postseason record nine times last postseason. The same goes for the Chargers after they were curb stomped 32-12 in a game where Justin Herbert threw four interceptions in last year's wild card round. Last season's No. 1 seed, the Lions, lost in the NFC divisional round to a Washington squad that had to fight through the \"injustice\" of playing on the road in the wild card round against a division winner with a lesser record in last year's Buccaneers. Homefield advantage does matter, which is why it's critical for division winners to get home games in their first playoff matchup. That will help uphold the integrity of the NFL's scheduling system and rivalries. Recent history also shows road teams with a superior overall record can breeze past a division champion on the road to go on to make a run. The 2024 Commanders reached the NFC Championship while doing so, and the 2020 Buccaneers won the Super Bowl after playing the entire NFC bracket on the road. The NFL playoff system doesn't require adjustments. Buckle up for two mostly win-or-go-home division championship games in Week 18 as two delicious appetizers ahead of the postseason, which kicks off next week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through the first two months of the 2025-26 college basketball season, this 2025 high school recruiting class has lived up to the hype. In fact, that might be a massive understatement. This is shaping up to be a generational class. BYU's AJ Dybantsa has been playing at an elite level the last few weeks, Duke's Cameron Boozer has been the best player in the sport and UNC's star rookie Caleb Wilson is making a case to be a top-five pick this summer.But even though this class is full of blue-chip recruits, there have been plenty of under-the-radar young players who have made a name for themselves. Perhaps the most notable example is Stanford guard Ebuka Okorie, who was ranked outside the top 100 players in his recruiting class but has been one of the best scorers in college basketball.Okorie currently ranks No. 4 among all qualified Division I players in points per game (22.8). Three of the top four scorers in the sport are first-year players. With the calendar set to flip to 2026 in a matter of days, there will be more players like Okorie who leave their mark on the sport and this class.Let's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season.\n  Freshman of the Week: Ebuka Okorie, StanfordWelcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row, CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  The former No. 119-ranked player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports has been one of the best scorers in college basketball during the first two months. Okorie is averaging 22.8 points, which ranks No. 4 among all qualified Division I players. Ironically, because of how good this 2025 recruiting class is, Okorie ranks third among his classmates in points per game.\nWhile most teams were idle last week, Okorie had a performance to remember. He scored 30 points in a win over Cal State Northridge, which marked his second game this season with at least 30 points. Okorie has scored at least 10 points in every game he has appeared in thus far.\nPrevious Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleNov. 25: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 2: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 9: Hannes Steinbach, WashingtonDec. 16: AJ Dybantsa, BYUDec. 23: Shelton Henderson, Miami Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n    \n                                        \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 23.3 PPG | 10.0 RPG | 4.0 APG Boozer and Duke were idle last week.

    "body": "\nIt's Week 18 of the NFL season, which always brings a challenge for bettors as motivation and rest factors play a big role in the spreads posted by the market. There are five games this week where ratings suggest the spreads should be much different than what is being offered and we'll get to them all below along with giving our leans for betting each.Cardinals at RamsSean McVay said after Monday's upset loss to the Falcons that his starters would play in this game. The market isn't buying it, as the Rams are just 7.5-point home favorites against a Cardinals team that has been one of the worst in football down the stretch. I think that's about nine points off in terms of where I have each team rated, and I don't think the Rams would lay less than 14 in a competitive matchup.Complicating the issue for the Rams is that they might not even have the No. 5 seed as a possibility by the time they kick off, as it would require the Seahawks beating the 49ers on Saturday night. If the 49ers win that game, the Rams have no reason to play any of their key guys as they will be locked into the No. 6 seed. However, I believe Jimmy Garoppolo can lead the offense to points against this woeful, banged-up Arizona defense, so I'll be looking at getting the Over at a good price.\nChargers at BroncosWe know Justin Herbert won't play and it stands to reason Jim Harbaugh will rest other starters as well. That has caused this line to jump about eight points from where I think it should be if the Chargers were treating this like a regular game. It obviously means the world to the Broncos, who earn the No. 1 seed with a win.Considering the Chargers are still going to roll out a competitive defense, can you really back the Broncos as double-digit favorites? They've beaten two teams by double digits all year, in Week 4 against the Bengals and Week 8 against the Cowboys. Since that second blowout win, they've beaten the Texans by three in the game where C.J. Stroud was injured, the Raiders by three and seven, the Chiefs by three and seven (the second of those against Chris Oladokun instead of Patrick Mahomes), the Commanders with Marcus Mariota in overtime, and the Packers by eight. The Chargers defense could keep this one closer than expected regardless of what's happening on the other side of the ball.\nPackers at VikingsThe Packers are expected to rest key players, and they're certainly a team that needs it with Jordan Love, Malik Willis, Josh Jacobs and Christian Watson among those battling injuries. We also don't know who is going to start at quarterback for Minnesota as J.J. McCarthy may not be cleared to return from his hand injury.The market has this 10 points off where I would have it without the rest concerns, which seems like too much of an adjustment and has me wanting to lean to the Packers. But if we get Clayton Tune against Brian Flores' defense, I'm not sure I want to be in that situation. My lean for this game would be to the Under.\nCommanders at EaglesThe Eagles are still deciding as of Tuesday morning whether they are going to rest starters as they have the potential to move up to the No. 2 seed with a win and a Chicago loss, and the Bears are only laying 2.5 against the Lions. The good news is that they're up against a Commanders team that may again be starting Josh Johnson, so there is a decent chance they can rest players and still win the game at home.The market is caught between whether the Eagles go full rest or not as this line is only 6.5 points away from where I'd have it in a competitive situation, a smaller margin than our other rest situations. To me, that puts the value on the Washington side but I'd be more interested again in the Under.\nJets at BillsThe Jets have lost four straight games by at least 23 points, so if the Bills were treating this like a competitive game, I think the spread would be around where it was for Jets-Patriots last week at -13.5, even though my ratings are so down on the Jets that I'd make it around 17. The market has the Bills -7, and that may drop if Josh Allen is rested.The Bills have a lot of issues on both sides of the ball but once the spread gets below 7, I'm still going to back Mitchell Trubisky and Co. to win and cover. That's because I'd probably take any team laying less than seven at home against the Jets right now except maybe the Raiders.\nI'll have several spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 18 power ratingsTeam1817161514LAR7.57.5876SEA7766.56NE55444JAC55321SF4.54.5321PHI4.54.5324BUF454.54.54.5DEN444.52.51.5HOU3.53.53.531.5CHI3.52.51.512BAL3.501.512.5LAC2.541.510GB01.5354.5DET-133.54.53.5TB-10000CIN-1-2-2.500PIT-1.51.510-1.5CAR-1.5-1-2.5-2-2.5DAL-1.5-1.5022.5ATL-3-3-3.5-3.5-3NO-3-4.5-4.5-4.5-7IND-4.5-3.5-4.5-52.5MIN-5.5-4.5-1-3-6TEN-6-5.5-8-8.5-9CLE-6-6-7.5-4.5-6NYG-7.5-8-5-3.5-4MIA-7.5-8.5-2.5-2-3.5ARI-8-6.5-4.5-3.5-2.5WAS-8-8-4.5-4.5-2.5KC-8-7.5-2.52.55LV-10-9-10-7-7NYJ-10.5   -10-9-8.5-7.5There isn't a lot of movement to speak of among the playoff teams. I'm leaving the Rams where they were after losing in a flat spot, but I'm dropping the Bills a point with Josh Allen playing at less than 100%, which feels impossible to overcome for a Bills team that isn't that talented across the rest of the roster. I'm bumping the Ravens up quite a bit with the expectation that Lamar Jackson plays in a must-win spot, and that their newfound success rushing the ball will continue heading into the postseason.I'm out on the Packers defense, which makes them an average team for me heading into the playoffs. I'm putting the Buccaneers, Panthers and Steelers slightly below that, with Pittsburgh likely to be without their best player on both sides of the ball again in a must-win spot.Full Week 18 projected linesAwayHomeConsensusPR SpreadNotesCARTB-3-1.5SEASF+1.5PKMonitor LT health for bothNOATL-3-2CLECIN-7.5-6.5DALNYG+5+5GBMIN-6.5+3.5GB to rest key playersINDHOU-10-9Leonard to start for INDTENJAC-12.5-12NYJBUF-7-17BUF expected to rest startersKCLV+5.5+0.5Big number for Oladokun on roadDETCHI-2.5-7Market still high on DETLACDEN-12.5-4.5LAC to rest key playersMIANE-11.5-13WASPHI-7-13.5PHI expected to rest startersARILAR-7.5-16.5LAR expected to rest key playersBAL   PIT   +3.5   +3.5   This is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home-field advantage data for this week.

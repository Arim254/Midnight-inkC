If that is the case, they ought to be plenty focused for this game against a team that beat them twice last season, once coming in the playoffs,\" NFL SuperContest champion Brady Kannon said. \"I make this number 3.5 in favor of GBay. Philly's defense is not that good and they appear to be playing above what the numbers tell us. They commit a lot of penalties, can't get off the field on 3rd down, and can't pressure the QB.

Just two years ago, the Pistons WERE the Wizards when finishing 14-68, but now off to their best start in twenty years, with Cade Cunningham doing things like scoring 24 points in the second half to lead a comeback on the weekend at Philly.

On Monday, they'll visit the Charlotte Hornets for a cross-conference clash that begins at 7 p.m. ET, and Doncic should be in the lineup after a light 27-minute load on Saturday and then a day off. Doncic is known primarily for his offense, but he's been a menacing defender of late, with nine steals in his last three games.

He has scored 21, 30, and 22, his last three games and has put up at least 20 in 5 of his last 7 games. I'm banking on Alex Sarr continuing to be an aggressive shot blocker as he's upped his average from 1.5 in 27.1 minutes as a rookie to 2.5 in 28.4 this season,\" Oh said. \"Duren will dominate the boards but may look to dish to an open shooter or someone cutting to the rim if Sarr is manning the paint. Even with a low over rate this season, he was 36-38 with a 2.7 average over 2.5 assists last season. We are projecting him for 2.5 assists, and at +130, we want to capitalize on a regression to the mean situation where he should start having a few 4 assist games to get back to last season's levels.\"Bet on Duren with Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users double their winnings on their next 20 bets after their first $1 wager:Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers, Over 0.5 blocks (+127)\"This is another player who has been an absolute PRA monster recently. He's a true star at this point, and that means he's locked in for 35+ minutes. But the strategy from opponents is to try to get him in foul trouble, which is why he's had 5 PFs in two of his last 4 games. I expect the front-court-led Magic to challenge him, and I expect him to get at least one block,\" Oh said. \"Last season, he only went over this in around 30% of his games, but he is currently on a 5-1 over run.

Green Bay has played up and down to its opponents at different points this season, opening the year with back-to-back wins over playoff teams in the Lions and Commanders before losing to the Browns and tying the Cowboys. There is no bigger get-up game than playing the defending Super Bowl champions, as the Packers will do on the Monday Night Football stage. The Packers have the No. 8 scoring defense, allowing 20.8 ppg this season, while surrendering the fifth-fewest yards (286.4 per game) this year. They are allowing the fewest yards per pass (5.8), with the ingredients to frustrate Jalen Hurts, which has the model leaning Green Bay's direction. The model projects the Packers to win and cover in 54% of simulations.Under 45.5 pointsThe Packers suffered a significant loss beyond the scoreboard last week with tight end Tucker Kraft tearing his ACL. Kraft became Jordan Love's top target this season, leading the Packers in receiving yards (489) and touchdowns (six), while ranking second in receptions (32) and targets (44). The Packers have other capable pass-catchers, but this could take a hit on a Packers offense that enters 11th in scoring at 25.8 ppg. The Philadelphia offense has been up-and-down all season, and one of the Packers' strengths is their run defense. Green Bay is fifth in rushing yards allowed (89.4 yards per game), which could challenge Philadelphia's prowess on the ground. Meanwhile, the Packers also rank first in yards per pass allowed (5.8), as both offenses could find themselves in frustrating situations. The model projects the Under to hit in 55% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is officially underway and that means the rumor mill is in full operation. Below, CBS Sports has gathered Monday's most notable news, notes, and moves from around the league in one convenient spot. Imai posted by NPB's LionsTatsuya Imai, a 27-year-old right-hander, has been posted for MLB consideration by the Saitama Seibu Lions of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league. CBS Sports recently ranked Imai as the 12th-best free agent in the class. Here's what we wrote:Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.Imai compiled a 3.15 ERA and a 1.94 strikeout-to-walk ratio over parts of eight seasons in NPB. As per MLB's agreement with NPB, Imai will have 45 days to reach an agreement with an MLB team. Additionally, the Lions will receive a posting fee based on his contract's total value.Giants to pursue pitching depthThe Giants have already made headlines this winter by hiring former Tennessee Volunteers skipper Tony Vitello as their manager. Now, San Francisco's focus has shifted to adding to a roster that hasn't secured a playoff berth since 2021. Specifically, the Giants intend to add to their pitching staff -- a unit that ranked 10th in the majors in raw ERA. \"Right now there are holes,\" general manager Zack Minasian told reporters. \"It's not to say that some of those holes can't be filled from within. You always want to be open-minded of that, and we're always going to challenge the players that we have internally. This year will be no different. But obviously, if we can bring some pitching in from the outside to continue to build up depth and try and find quality, we're going to look at that as much as possible.\"\nCBS Sports' free-agent rankings included five pitchers in the top 15, suggesting the Giants should have some quality options when it comes to filling out their staff. Alas, owner Greg Johnson recently acknowledged the Giants intend to be \"cautious\" about signing any pitcher for more than $100 million. That figures to take them out of the equation on many of those top available arms.White Sox to pass on top free agentsThe White Sox haven't been competitive in any of the last three seasons. Don't expect that to change this winter, at least as it pertains to them pursuing top free-agent talent. Rather, the White Sox have already publicly signaled that they'll continue to focus on their internal options rather than handing out multi-year contracts to veterans.\"Free agency is an avenue to bring in players to help in the win total,\" general manager Chris Getz told MLB.com. \"But to go beyond this upcoming season I think would be a little premature considering the state of our club right now and the development of these young players.\"\nFour of Chicago's top six recipients of plate appearances were in their age-25 season or younger. That doesn't include infielder Colson Montgomery, who led the team in Wins Above Replacement by posting a 130 OPS+ in 71 games. Additionally, four of Chicago's five top innings-throwers were also 25 years old or younger. The White Sox have won 61 games or fewer in each of the past three years. Prior to that stretch, they had enjoyed a respectable three-season span that included two playoff berths.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders' downward spiral appears to have no end in sight. During their fifth consecutive loss, a 44-22 blowout to the Detroit Lions, which is also Washington's fourth straight defeat by at least 20 points, it appears that frustrations reached a boiling point. In the second quarter, Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs rushed for a 13-yard touchdown to extend Detroit's lead to 17 points. After the play, Commanders defensive lineman Daron Payne turned around and punched Lions wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown in the face. Payne was ejected from the game and subsequently given a one-game suspension by the NFL on Monday for his \"act of unsportsmanlike conduct.\" \nThe penalty gave the Lions an even shorter field to attempt a two-point conversion. David Montgomery punched in the two-pointer to extend the lead to 19 points, and that's when another Commander lost his cool, as Javon Kinlaw was given a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for making contact with an official. \nAfter a thrilling win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Jayden Daniels' \"homecoming\" game on Oct. 5, not much has gone right for Washington, now 3-7. The Commanders have been outscored by 88 points in their last four games. Remember, this is a franchise that was looking for even bigger things in 2025 after last season's magical 12-5 campaign that ended with a loss to the Eagles in the NFC Championship just 10 months ago. So why has Washington's season been a disaster? There are a couple of different reasons. Jayden Daniels' availabilityIt was clear last year that Washington found a franchise quarterback in Daniels. However, even as an NFL prospect, his durability was a question mark. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft didn't miss a single start as a rookie, but missed three contests through the first eight weeks of this season. That number is going to increase with Daniels suffering a dislocated elbow last week in the loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\nAny team missing its starting quarterback is going to struggle. That's especially true when we're talking about a talent like Daniels -- who almost took a struggling franchise to the Super Bowl in his first season. When Daniels suffered a hamstring injury in the Week 7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Daniels' mother took to social media to ask fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son. Unfortunately, those comparisons exist for a reason. The defenseDaniels' availability is not the only reason why Washington has struggled this year. In fact, you could make the argument the defense has been much more of a factor why Washington has gone from NFC contender to afterthought. The Commanders entered this week allowing an average of 377.8 yards per game (fifth-worst in the NFL), 253.6 passing yards per game (fourth-worst in the NFL) and 26.2 points per game (10th-worst in the NFL). This Dan Quinn defense allowed 33 of 35 completions for 492 passing yards and seven touchdowns in a four-quarter span from the second half of Week 8 at the Kansas City Chiefs, to the first half against Seattle last Sunday night. Things won't get any better for Washington either, as they just lost starting cornerback Marshon Lattimore for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL and now will be without Payne next Sunday for a meeting with the Miami Dolphins in Madrid.\nTo put it bluntly, the Commanders are struggling on both sides of the ball, and that's why they won't be making the playoffs this year. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The three-peat talk has already begun. This year, the Dodgers became baseball's first repeat World Series champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees and there is every reason to believe they will be in the mix again next year. They have a loaded MLB roster, a stacked farm system, an aggressive front office, and an owner willing to spend. You name it and the Dodgers have it.   \"I'll tell you right now, this group of guys was never going to be  denied to bring this city another championship,\" manager Dave Roberts said at the parade. \"... The last thing I'll say, I talked to a good friend of mine yesterday  on the plane, and he gave me the OK to use this phrase. Pat Riley, what's  better than two? Three! Three-peat! Three-peat! Let's go!\"   The three-peat talk isn't to say the Dodgers are all set going into 2026. They have needs and some frankly glaring issues to address. L.A. finished 2025 with a $415 million payroll for competitive balance tax purposes, per Cot's Baseball Contracts, and they have roughly $313 million on the books for 2026 (including arbitration projections). It could be another active offseason.   What do the Dodgers need this offseason? Who could they target? Who could they move? Let's dive into that now in our offseason preview for the two-time defending champions.   \n   Needs   The outfield and the bullpen most stand out. Michael Conforto was one of the worst regular hitters in baseball this season, so much so that the Dodgers left him off the postseason roster and started utility guy Enrique Hernández in the left field. In the postseason, you can live with it, but Hernández (a free agent) in left is not viable for 162 games. The Dodgers need an outfielder.   The bullpen is tricky. The Dodgers threw money at it last offseason (Tanner Scott, Blake Treinen, Kirby Yates, etc.) and it didn't work. Scott and Yates had poor years and so did Treinen, who was far outside of the Circle of Trust come Game 7 of the World Series. Scott and Treinen will be back next year, as will Alex Vesia, Jack Dreyer, and others. Roki Sasaki could stick in the bullpen too.   Going with smaller bullpen additions or even just standing pat is justifiable. It would surprise me though. It feels like the Dodgers, who have an aging position player core and every incentive to push hard for a World Series title in 2026, will bring in a top bullpen arm to solidify the late innings. Without a doubt, the bullpen and the outfield are the biggest areas of need this winter.   \n   Possible targets   The Dodgers have the best of both worlds. They have money to spend on free agents and the prospects to trade. That isn't to say they'll get anyone they want, just that they shouldn't be at a disadvantage financially or trade chip-wise. Here are a few players who fit what the Dodgers need this offseason and are realistic targets.   \nIt is definitely not great for the other 29 teams that the offseason's No. 1 free agent aligns perfectly with what the two-time defending champions need. Kyle Tucker would improve the Dodgers in all phases: offensively, defensively, and on the bases. The Dodgers could slide Teoscar Hernández to left field (assuming they don't find a way to unload him) and install Tucker in right, upgrading their defense, and he would be another bona fide middle-of-the-order hitter for a lineup that was surprisingly thin after the Nos. 5-6 spots in October. Tucker might make the offense too lefty-heavy through the middle, but when your lefties are Tucker, Freddie Freeman, and Shohei Ohtani, you'll be OK.   \nThe Dodgers were reportedly in heavy on Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan at the trade deadline. The two teams ran out of time to complete a trade though, and the Dodgers pivoted to righty hitting platoon guy Alex Call. I would expect them to rekindle those talks this winter. Kwan has won four Gold Gloves in four big-league seasons (and deserved them) and would massively improve L.A.'s outfield defense. The Dodgers wouldn't need him to hit leadoff either. They could (and would) leave Ohtani in the leadoff spot, allowing them to use Kwan as a pesky, overqualified No. 9 hitter.   \nNot the sexiest name, though a Mike Yastrzemski/Alex Call platoon could be sneaky great in left field. Farhan Zaidi, who unearthed Yastrzemski during his time running the NL West-rival Giants, is in L.A.'s front office now and could push the Dodgers in this direction if Tucker or Kwan or something bigger doesn't come together. Yastrzemski is a consistent .800 OPS bat against righties and still a quality outfield defender. If the Dodgers don't want to give out a long-term outfield contract to keep a lane open for top prospects Josue De Paula and Zyhir Hope, there are far worse one-year contract candidates than Yastrzemski.   \nThe Dodgers have been connected to Pete Fairbanks for about two years now. The Rays declined his $11 million club option last week, sending him out into free agency, and surely they did that only after being unable to come up with a trade. There are some red flags with Fairbanks, who has seen his strikeout rate plummet the last two years, but he remains a viable late-inning reliever for a contending team. After investing big in Scott and having that fall flat in Year 1, another big reliever contract for, say, Edwin Díaz would surprise me. A shorter-term, lower-cost signing like Fairbanks seems more likely. \nI'm mentioning Tarik Skubal here because, if the Tigers do make him available, the Dodgers will be at the front of the line. They don't need another starter -- Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, Emmet Sheehan, Blake Snell, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto are all in place for 2026 -- but Skubal is not just any starter. When you're looking to three-peat, this is a guy you go out and get. He would make every rotation better, even one as stacked as L.A.'s. I'm not 100% sold on the Tigers trading Skubal or even just listening to offers. If they do though, expect the Dodgers to get involved and be aggressive.   \n   Possible trade chips   Two top 100 prospects made their MLB debuts in 2025 and are blocked long-term with the Dodgers: Dalton Rushing and Alex Freeland. Rushing, a catcher, is stuck behind World Series Game 7 hero Will Smith, who is signed through 2033. Rushing has played some first base and left field, and giving Smith more time off his feet during the regular season seems sensible, though it's very possible Rushing is more valuable to the Dodgers as a trade chip. If I needed a catcher, I'd call about him.   Freeland, an infielder, has an easier path to playing time because Tommy Edman can play the outfield and Max Muncy is signed only through 2026, but he is another touted young player without a clear short-term role who could be most valuable as a trade piece. If nothing else, youngsters like Freeland and Rushing can't stand in the way of a big-time trade. Their value to the Dodgers is more long-term and if you can use them to boost your three-peat odds in 2026, you have to do it.   The Dodgers need waves of pitching depth given the injury histories of some of their starters and the fact they like to use a six-man rotation and spot starts to keep everyone's workload in check. Even with that, they have A LOT of arms. Justin Wrobleski and Kyle Hurt are on the outside of the rotation looking in now, plus River Ryan and 2024 Dodgers innings leader Gavin Stone will return from injury next year. Landon Knack and Bobby Miller (moved to the bullpen in July) are still around too.   \nRoster spots are a finite resource. The Dodgers have a full 40-man roster already and that's before making any outside additions or protecting prospects from the Rule 5 Draft (that will happen next week). As much as you want to, you can't keep everyone. At some point, the Dodgers will have to make a consolidation trade, which potentially means trading one or two of these depth arms for prospects who don't have to go on the 40-man roster yet. Wrobleski in particular would generate a lot of interest.   MLB Pipeline ranked the Dodgers' farm system as the best in baseball after the trade deadline. They have plenty of prospects and young MLB players to put on the table this offseason. Between that and their almost unmatched ability to absorb money, the Dodgers are well positioned to pursue any trade candidate this offseason. It doesn't mean they'll get anyone they want, just that they have the pieces to be competitive for anyone.\n            ",

The Pride notched a 2-0 over the Seattle Reign in regular time but the other three quarterfinals all went to extra time in closely contested matches. The Thorns notched a 1-0 win over the San Diego Wave, while the Spirit needed a penalty shootout to beat postseason first-timers Racing Louisville.The most stunning result of the quarterfinals, though, was Gotham's upset win over the Kansas City Current. Teh Current were arguably the favorites to win the NWSL Championship for the first time in club history after winning the Shield and ending the regular season with a 21-point advantage over second place. A last-gasp winner from Katie Stengel in the 121st minute, though, ensured the Current's playoff run would end as soon as it started.All paths eventually lead to the NWSL Championship on Nov. 22, which will take place at San Jose's PayPal Park.

The benefit to Kelly would be getting the money in one lump sum and LSU would remove mitigation language for future earnings from coaching. However, those negotiations have not yielded a new agreement. According to documents obtained by documents obtained by the Baton Rouge Advocate, Kelly's lawyers sent a letter to new athletic director Verge Ausberry on Nov. 5 indicating his expectation that the school will pay his \"full liquidated damages,\" meaning the full $54 million buyout. Kelly showed a willingness to engage in such conversations immediately after his firing, but rejected offers of $25 million and $30 million that were presented to him -- first by then-athletic director Scott Woodward and later by executive deputy athletic director Julie Cromer. Since Woodward's firing after a fiery press conference from Louisiana governor Jeff Landry, talks have apparently stalled. \n\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov.

If there was not a written confirmation of Kelly's firing and the terms of that firing by that time, Kelly would \"pursue all available legal remedies.\" That means the deadline imposed by Kelly will arrive later Monday, and if LSU cannot work out a reduced buyout in negotiations with the coach, he will expect his full payout as laid out in his contract or take them to court. Kelly was in his fourth season at LSU when he was fired on Oct. 26. Kelly had a 34-14 record coaching the Tigers, but never reached the College Football Playoff and was let go on the heels of an embarrassing 49-25 home loss to Texas A&M -- a game where LSU was outscored 35-7 in the second half. \nWIth Frank Wilson serving as interim coach, LSU fell to 5-4 with a 20-9 road loss to Alabama on Saturday.

    "body": "\n        Following one of the worst individual performances in Aaron Rodgers' career during Sunday night's mistake-filled loss to the Chargers, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin offered a blunt assessment of the two-time NFL MVP's outing. Tomlin stared down a reporter when asked to evaluate Rodgers' two-interception, one-touchdown stat line that also featured a 51.6% completion rate, Rodgers' worst single-game number in five seasons.\"How would you?\" Tomlin said. \"Next.\"Pittsburgh's 25-10 dud was its third loss in the past four games since a 4-1 start with Rodgers. It trimmed the Steelers lead in the AFC North to just one game ahead of the Baltimore Ravens.\"We, as an offensive collective were off today, and certainly, he's a component of that,\" Tomlin said. \"I'll let him speak for himself, but we certainly got to be better. Didn't feel like they did anything unanticipated, but certainly, they outperformed us, particularly in possession-down play.\"\nAt one point in the first quarter, Rodgers ate a sack in his own end zone and fumbled, before falling on the football. The lone Steelers touchdown came on Roman Wilson's 27-yard reception from Rodgers with 2:57 to play, which snapped 25 unanswered points from Los Angeles.\n\"This was not my best performance,\" Rodgers said. \"I got to play better than this for us to win. Whatever it takes ... if it's better checks, if it's better throws, whatever it is, I got to play better. I will. ... We got to play better on offense, for sure. But this is part of the season. There's ebbs and flows, there's ups and downs, and we can't ride the wave.\"Sacked three times by a harassing Chargers defense, Rodgers missed on all five passing attempts that traveled at least 15 yards. Leading receiver DK Metcalf was ineffective for the second straight game, finishing with three catches for 35 yards on seven targets.\"A lot of stuff wasn't working,\" Rodgers said. \"We were bad on third down. I was just a little bit off. I missed DK early. Could have been a big play. ... I missed some throws for sure. And then we weren't getting guys open ... times the guys were open, I missed some throws I usually make.\"The Steelers host the Bengals next week before traveling to play the Bears in Chicago.\n\"We stunk it up tonight,\" Tomlin said. \"We'll be back.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Los Angeles Dodgers freshly crowned as repeat champs, qualifying offers extended or withheld, and free agency upon us, the 2025-26 offseason has begun in earnest. While it will likely be a little while until bigger names start getting traded and putting ink to contract, it's not too soon to start pondering what the winter may hold on the player-movement front. We're here to do just that by posing a series of possibly warm-to-the-touch questions regarding how teams will approach the winter, which players might sign where, and who might get in on a blockbuster trade or two. Come with us, won't you?1. How will the Dodgers reload for a three-peat bid?The Dodgers are the best in baseball, not only in terms of winning championships but also when it comes to spending and maneuvering to that end. That's grounds for praise, especially these days. Given all that, the expectation is that president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman will again be aggressive in trying to position his team to win the World Series for a third straight season. The rotation figures to be in good shape -- Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and Shohei Ohtani are all still under contract -- with ace quality at multiple spots and depth to spare. Elsewhere, though, the Dodgers could use an upgrade at one of the outfield corners. As such, don't be surprised if they vigorously pursue Kyle Tucker, the top free agent available. The bullpen probably also needs work. If the recent past is any guide, the Dodgers won't be far from the headlines this winter. 2. Will Bo Bichette be back in Toronto?One of the biggest questions for the reigning American League champs has already been answered -- veteran right-hander and deadline pickup Shane Bieber exercised his player option and will return to Toronto in 2026. That's welcome news from the Jays' standpoint, but the top priority remains re-upping with shortstop Bo Bichette. Bichette enjoyed an impressive bounce-back season this year after nagging injuries sapped his production in 2024. When healthy, he's one of the best-hitting shortstops in all of baseball, and the Jays need him back. Baseball is ascendant in Toronto right now and losing the popular and homegrown Bichette would not be well received by an engaged fan base. There appears to be mutual interest in a reunion.\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n3. Will the Yankees make a splash? And does it qualify as a splash if all they do is bring back Cody Bellinger and Trent Grisham? To be clear, bringing back that outfielder duo is a laudable goal and something the Yankees should work to make happen absent a major upgrade there (i.e., Tucker). Or do the Yanks in the outfield give regular duty to Jasson Dominguez once again and maybe eye Spencer Jones for an early season callup? They'll get back Gerrit Cole in the rotation, but what about the back of the bullpen? Brian Cashman may need to dip into the free-agent pool for saves. Would he pursue Edwin Díaz and get him to make the crosstown leap? \n4. Will the Phillies reunite with their big two free agents? The Phillies are very much in a win-now phase and lead operator Dave Dombrowski has for years been aggressive on that front. Maybe given recent playoff disappointments there's a temptation to give the roster a different look, but that's overlooking all that recent success and over-emphasizing the tiny sample of the postseason. That's why it shouldn't be shocking if the Phillies bring back their two most important free agents -- slugger Kyle Schwarber and front-end lefty Ranger Suárez. Those two in 2025 teamed up for a WAR of 9.4. In what figures to be a tough NL East in 2026, you can't let that kind of value walk without plans to replace it. 5. Where will Kyle Tucker sign?No, the 2025-26 class of free agents isn't a particularly strong one overall, but Tucker is a most worthy No. 1. Even when playing through a hand injury cost him at the plate, he still managed to put up an OPS+ of 143 and a WAR of 4.6 in 136 games in 2025. He's still a defensive plus in the outfield corners and he still runs the bases well. Tucker, one of the most complete players in the game, is also still just 28 years of age. It's hard to read this market, but a contract of $400 million or more wouldn't be entirely shocking for Tucker. As noted, the Dodgers make a lot of sense, as do the Yankees, Phillies, Giants, and incumbent Cubs. As always, an unexpected suitor or three will likely emerge at some point. 6. Will the Tigers trade Tarik Skubal?To be clear, the Tigers should not trade Skubal. They've made it to Game 5 of the ALDS in each of the last two seasons, and that's not a team that should be trading away the pitcher who's likely to win a second straight Cy Young later this week. That's a contender, and even if it means letting Skubal walk at the end of 2026 for nothing more than a compensatory draft pick, it's worth it just to improve Detroit's odds of hoisting the trophy next year. If lead exec Scott Harris does decide to deal Skubal before his walk year begins, then it'll no doubt be a frenzied bidding. Any team could of course use an ace of aces, but clubs like the Mets, Mariners, and Red Sox are among those who could put together compelling trade packages. The Tigers still have a theoretical shot to sign Skubal to an extension, but they'll have to drastically improve their efforts to date on that front. \n7. What is Chaim Bloom's plan for the Cardinals? For the first time since 2006-07, John Mozeliak will not be guiding the Cardinals through the offseason. Mozeliak stepped down from the big chair after this past season and now Chaim Bloom takes over. He inherits a team going through what qualifies as a drought by franchise standards. Trades of veterans like Nolan Arenado and Sonny Gray, provided they waive their no-trade clauses and a fit can be found, are likely, but how much deeper will it go? Will Bloom shop Brendan Donovan, probably his most valuable potential trade piece, or does Bloom see Donovan as part of the next contending Cardinals team? Trades will tell the story of how soon the new front office in St. Louis thinks they can matter again.8. Will the Twins tear it down (even more)? No team sold harder than the Twins did leading up to this year's trade deadline. They may not be done. If the apparent rebuild turns into a full-on teardown, then the Twins might peddle their top two starting pitchers, Pablo Lopez and Joe Ryan. Catcher Ryan Jeffers may be another trade possibility. Star outfielder Byron Buxton says he wants to spend his entire career with the Twins, but what if the shedding of talent continues? Will that change Buxton's mind? An ugly season in Minny could turn into an ugly winter. 9. Will the Pirates trade Paul Skenes? Yes, it's the non-story that won't die. Skenes is excellent and cheap, and that's exactly the kind of player the Pirates cherish. Owner Bob Nutting, an utterly useless figure in a guild overflowing with them, is of course derelict in his duties when it comes to building around Skenes and other young talents. But trading Skenes now, when he's not even arbitration-eligible, makes little sense even from the warped perspective of an owner like Nutting, who has shown no signs he cares about winning baseball games. So, no, they won't trade Skenes this offseason, but the questions will doggedly remain. \n10. Will there be any additional signs of looming labor strife? The unfortunate expectation is that next offseason -- the 2026-27 offseason -- will be blighted by an owner-implemented lockout timed to the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement. The signs are already strong on this front, as commissioner Rob Manfred has tried to spin the likelihood of a lockout as a good thing and has also made comments calculated to drive a wedge between the more tenured members of the MLBPA and the younger players. Talk of a salary cap has also been easy to come by over the past several months, even though the union will never agree to such a thing. We'll probably hear some rumblings on this front coming out of the owners' meetings, which are scheduled for Nov. 18-20. They'll be using the Dodgers repeat as a cudgel, just as they would've been prepared to cite a Brewers win in the NLCS as a meaningless aberration.\n            ",

The model enters Week 10 on a sizzling 47-29 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also enters Week 3 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 26-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

They have covered once in the last six outings. Philly might have gotten over its Super Bowl hangover in the most recent game -- specifically RB Saquan Barkley, who broke loose for 150 yards after previously not topping 88 this season. As a whole, the Eagles ground out 276 yards,\" SportsLine NFL expert Mike Tierney said. \"With Green Bay's rush defense getting punctured recently, Barkley could serve up an encore. Under coach Nick Sirianni, the Eagles have won every game SU following a bye. They won't have to cope with emergent TE Tucker Kraft, whose injury last week closed out his season.\" Back Philadelphia at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Pistons -11.5 vs. Wizards (-110)\"It's a good starting point when the team you're backing hasn't lost a game in two weeks and the team you're going against hasn't won a game in more than two weeks. That's the scenario tonight with the Pistons and Wizards, as Detroit enters Little Caesars on a six-game uptick,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Just two years ago, the Pistons WERE the Wizards when finishing 14-68, but now off to their best start in twenty years, with Cade Cunningham doing things like scoring 24 points in the second half to lead a comeback on the weekend at Philly.\" Back Detroit at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Bulls money line vs. Spurs (+135)The Spurs have been tabbed for an ascension since winning the right to draft Victor Wembanyama No. 1 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft and that's coming to fruition with Wembanyama emerging as an MVP candidate and San Antonio building a solid supporting cast around him. Meanwhile, the Bulls scrapped a roster built around aging veterans Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and have found surprising early success with a young roster built around Josh Giddey, who is looking like a potential all-star. He's averaging 21.4 points, 9.6 rebounds and 9.3 assists per game this season and Chicago has six players averaging at least 12.8 points per game while the team is shooting 39.7% from the 3-point line (fourth in the NBA). The model predicts that the Bulls win 52% of the time while these odds imply a 43% chance to win. Back Chicago at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Monday.

    "body": "\n        Oh, the Dallas Mavericks may fire general manager Nico Harrison? Better late than never, I suppose. They should have fired Harrison the moment he suggested trading Luka Dončić. They should have fired him when he traded Quentin Grimes for Caleb Martin. They should've fired him after his disastrous and bizarre meeting with the press last April. They should have fired him the moment they won the Cooper Flagg lottery and were granted a \"get out of jail free\" card from the basketball gods. They should have fired him in the preseason, when the hilariously unbalanced roster he constructed forced Flagg -- a 6-foot-9 18-year-old who plays forward -- to move to point guard.The best time to fire Nico Harrison would have been any of those moments. The next best time to fire Nico Harrison would be right now. And that is finally, seemingly, a consideration in Dallas. \"The rising and virtually ceaseless negativity that surrounds the franchise is indeed wearing on and troubling ownership,\" insider Marc Stein wrote Sunday. While Stein notes that team governor Patrick Dumont's preference would be to give Harrison more time, \"contemplating whether an in-season change is the wisest course for the Mavericks to try to forge ahead post-Dončić has become unavoidable at the highest levels of the organization.\"\nNo general manager in basketball has had a worse start to the 2025-26 season than Harrison. Dončić is playing the best basketball of his life and is firmly in the early-season MVP mix for the 7-3 Los Angeles Lakers. Grimes is averaging a career-high 17.2 points per game for the Philadelphia 76ers, who are thriving in the Eastern Conference. Speaking of teams thriving in the Eastern Conference, the point guard he lost for nothing when he first took the Dallas job, Jalen Brunson, just led the New York Knicks to Eastern Conference finals a year ago. And these are just the players no longer on his team. Things get far bleaker when you look at the start the Mavericks have had. They currently rank dead last in the NBA in offense. They're shooting 30.3% on 3-pointers (for comparison, bricklayer Russell Westbrook has shot 30.7% for his career). Anthony Davis, the player Harrison essentially bet his career on, is already injured (who saw that coming?) and posting his lowest scoring average since his second NBA season. There's still no telling when injured point guard Kyrie Irving will return. The Cooper Flagg at point guard experiment flopped so spectacularly that D'Angelo Russell was in the starting lineup by Dallas' eighth game of the season. Erstwhile Klay Thompson is washed, dried, folded and placed neatly in the linen closest.These are all valid reasons to fire your general manager. The \"fire Nico\" chants that can still be heard at Mavericks games aren't helping, either. But the miserable vibes of these opening weeks aren't what seemingly concern the Mavericks. According to Stein, the idea that could lead to Harrison's ouster is \"based on the premise that the front office executive who conceived and pushed for the widely criticized Dončić deal can no longer be the one trying to pilot the organization past it.\" This, in a nutshell, is why the Mavericks need to act.As hyperbolic as this seems, the next several months are going to be some of the most important of the entire Flagg era in Dallas. Despite Harrison's atrocious management, there is still a brief and critical window available for the Mavericks this season to set Flagg up for sustained success. If they miss the window that's open to them here and now, there's no telling when or if another is going to present itself. So, what makes these next few months so vital? Primarily, two things:\nThe Mavericks do not control their own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030. They effectively cannot tank, meaning they cannot add cheap upside around Flagg. In that window, they'll either have to trade even more future draft capital or primarily focus on adding proven players at market value. However, they do still control their 2026 first-round pick. That makes the 2026 NBA Draft their best and perhaps last chance to give Flagg a young, affordable running mate.Anthony Davis is still reasonably valuable. He's not playing up to his typical standard and he's already suffered a (hopefully) minor injury, but he'd still generate meaningful interest on the trade market. That could change fairly quickly. His value drops if his slow start persists. His value drops if he suffers a more serious injury, which his history suggests he's at risk for. Those are hypotheticals. What isn't is that Davis becomes extension-eligible this offseason. Davis is already 32. He is enough of a long-term risk given his injuries and playing style that the Lakers reportedly did not plan to offer him this extension before trading him. Should he sign that extension, his trade value likely evaporates.The Mavericks are already 3-7 against a fairly weak schedule in a loaded Western Conference. We don't know when or if they'll get Irving, their only high-end shot-creator, back on the court. Davis is constantly dealing with some nagging injury or another. Most of the team is already banged up. The plan for the remainder of this season should be obvious: take advantage of this final opportunity to tank for Flagg's future, get a high enough pick to land his long-term co-star, and trade Davis and other veterans to try to recoup some of the picks Harrison frittered away. Most general managers viewing the situation rationally would reach that conclusion.\n        \n            \n                NBA rookie roundtable: What's wrong with Cooper Flagg? What's right with VJ Edgecombe? More early questions\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut a hot seat burns away rationality. When a general manager is losing support from ownership, his priority more often than not shifts from his team's long-term interests to his own short-term job preservation. If the Mavericks come to the conclusion that some version of the \"tank and rebuild\" plan is needed, why would they allow the person who necessitated it to lead it? Harrison's path to keeping this job for the long haul isn't to act in the team's best long-term interests. It's to prove that the moves that he's already made were the correct ones. That means, at best, staying the course, and more likely doubling down.It almost felt as if the seeds for that were planted when Mavericks coach Jason Kidd recently said that Irving's return would hopefully be \"in the year '25, not '26.\" A rebuilding team wouldn't bring a 33-year-old back from a torn ACL in 10 months. It would sit him out for the season and resolve to have him back at 100% next year. Irving's health is out of the team's control, but further roster moves aren't. If 3-7 becomes 5-13, does Harrison try to trade for a win-now guard? Harrison has said that the future, to him, is \"three or four years.\" What does he care about, say, the Mavericks' 2032 first-round pick if that's the window he's operating under? If he still has the job by next summer, he almost has to try to extend Davis whether it's in the team's best interests or not if only to justify the controversial trade that he made.\nGiven how poorly basically everything in Dallas has gone since the Dončić trade, it's fair to suggest Harrison's personal, short-term interests do not align with the team's long-term interests. That was frankly true the moment Harrison considered trading Dončić, as no general manager is more valuable than a 25-year-old MVP candidate, but it's even truer today, as the situation has so glaringly deteriorated.It's somewhat astounding that there's even some hope left to be found here. The Mavericks had a 1.8% chance of landing Flagg. He is in Dallas purely through chance, not deft management on Harrison's part. Nothing the Mavericks have actually chosen to do over the past 10 months suggests that this team deserves the chance to salvage the most inexplicable trade in NBA history. But they have it if they're prepared to seize it, and seizing it effectively means admitting that the Dončić trade was a mistake. Nobody is less likely to do that than the person who made it.Again, there is no shortage of reasonable justifications for firing Nico Harrison. Winning back fan sympathies? Entirely valid. Improving the vibes around Flagg's rookie season and preventing any developmental scars from setting in? That matters too. The unbridled success of basically every player that's left Dallas lately? A nice cherry on top.\nBut nothing matters more than getting these next few months right. In a year, Cooper Flagg could be playing with another top prospect on a team with a restocked cupboard of assets and a generally bright future, or he could be wasting his sophomore season as a pawn in Harrison's ill-fated experiments in defense-first roster-building. After perhaps the worst year in franchise history, the Mavericks may finally be recognizing that the first path is more appealing than the second.\n            ",

Houston should still be No. 2, which means the top two teams in the AP poll and CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings are exactly the same.Will Purdue still be No. 1 a week from today?It's impossible to know for sure. But, if you're curious, remaining No. 1 will likely require a big performance Thursday, because that's when the Boilermakers are scheduled to play at Alabama. Put another way, Purdue will lose its No. 1 ranking this week unless it wins a road game against a team that just won a road game at St. John's.That's a big ask, as they say.How big?Consider that even though Purdue will have a No. 1 next to its name Thursday, this could be one of the rare occasions in the sport when the No. 1 team in the country is actually an underdog in a game.

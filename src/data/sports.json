    "body": "\nThe Week 18 NFL schedule and the regular season conclude on Sunday since there is no 'Monday Night Football' this week. It's the final opportunity to set NFL DFS lineups with a full player pool, and some of the big names available on the Week 18 'main slate' include Drake Maye, Bijan Robinson, Puka Nacua and, perhaps for the last time ever, Travis Kelce.

Quarterback Drake Maye will try to lock up the MVP award -- he is the -295 favorite at DraftKings -- and lead the Patriots (13-3) into the postseason on a roll. They can take the No. 1 seed with a victory and a Denver loss. The Dolphins (7-9) are simply trying to help coach Mike McDaniel keep his job.

    "body": "\n        The rollercoaster continues for Kentucky. Saturday's 89-74 loss to No. 14 Alabama wasn't a disaster on the spectrum of the Gonzaga beatdown or the UNC collapse. It's tough to win on the road, especially in the SEC against a Nate Oats-coached club. But any proclamations that Kentucky was fixed for good after grimy wins over St. John's and Indiana have certainly fallen flat.Maybe the biggest takeaway from Saturday's 15-point loss is that the offseason narrative that Kentucky had the deepest roster in the sport could not be farther from the truth.Instead, it was Alabama who flexed its depth, not Kentucky.Alabama superstar Labaron Philon finished with 17 points, but he was a non-factor (two points on 1-4 shooting) in the first half due to foul trouble. Alabama built its 23-point, first-half lead with contributions from brilliant shot-making from Aden Holloway (26 points, six treys), heart and hustle from freshman Amari Allen (11 points, nine rebounds, three assists), the flame throwing display from Houston Mallette (14 points, four 3-pointers) and the best showing of the year from seldom-used backup center Noah Williamson (10 points, four boards). \nOats had nine players he trusted to enter the game on Saturday and play winning basketball.\nHow many does Kentucky have? Preseason SEC Player of the Year Otega Oweh shook off a shaky start and delivered 22 points. Jaland Lowe, balky shoulder and all, gutted it out on his way to a 21-point showing. The lefty point guard is pretty clearly Kentucky's most valuable player. Mo Dioubate was his usual active self, totaling six points and a team-high eight rebounds against his old club. Jayden Quaintance had some rust to knock off, as expected, but his motor was still revving. But who else after that?Denzel Aberdeen, Brandon Garrison, Jasper Johnson, Collin Chandler and Malachi Moreno were non-factors. To this scribe's eye, it wasn't for a lack of effort. Kentucky had multiple flurries to get back into this one, even cutting it to a nine-point game with 5:55 to go. They just weren't good enough and didn't execute well enough. Smashmouth basketball might work against Indiana, but Alabama's bombs-away approach was far too much to overcome.Ultimately, Alabama had its cake and ate it, too. It answered Oats' call to ramp up the effort on the glass and out-rebounded Kentucky, 41-37. Kentucky knew it was not built to win the 3-point battle, but losing the battle at the 3-point stripe by 33 points is a recipe for disaster. \nAlabama has now knocked off Kentucky for the fourth straight time. It's just the third time a SEC foe has done that against Kentucky in the last 40 years.Kentucky is just 17-17 against fellow high-major teams since Pope took over, and it's the way Kentucky is losing that's jarring. It's the 11th double-digit loss for Kentucky in the Pope era (50 games). This isn't the standard, and it's challenging to envision a roadmap for it to magically disappear from this team's range of potential outcomes.Pope doesn't seem to know who to trust on a nightly basis, and this fanbase seems to be losing trust in the organization with each double-digit defeat.\n            ",

During Atlanta's current three-game winning streak, Cousins has thrown for six touchdowns and just one interception and taking just two sacks.Shough, meanwhile, has shown encouraging flashes since becoming the Saints' starter in Week 9. During New Orleans' current four-game winning streak, Shough has thrown for four touchdowns (and run for two more) and just one interception. He has completed over 71% of his passes during that span, and he has gone over 300 yards passing in each of his last two games.However, the biggest importance in this game might not have anything to do with either team. Thanks to a long list of tiebreakers, after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers on Saturday night, the Falcons could still save Carolina's playoff hopes by winning this game. The Saints would do the same for the Buccaneers with a win.\nLong story short, if the Buccaneers win Saturday night, they still need the Saints to win come Sunday. Any other combination, and the Panthers will head to the playoffs as NFC South champs.Here's how to watch Atlanta-New Orleans, along with betting odds, top things to know and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Falcons -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Saints: Need to knowBijan Robinson chasing history. Even in a disappointing season in Atlanta, Robinson has distinguished himself as arguably the best player in the NFL, bar none. Robinson had 229 yards from scrimmage in the Falcons' 27-24 upset win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and is now up to 2,255 on the season. With another 100 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into the top 10 for a single season. With another 200 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into second. The all-time record is 2,509, set by Chris Johnson in 2009. Robinson would need 255 yards from scrimmage to pass that. Regardless, it has been a magnificent season.Cousins, Shough trying to prove themselves. With Penix recovering from a torn ACL, there's a chance Cousins heads into the offseason as the Falcons' potential starter to open 2026. There's also a chance, however, that the Falcons get out of the Cousins contract. Cousins is due a $10 million roster bonus on March 17, 2026. Whether it's in Atlanta or elsewhere, though, Cousins, assuming he wants to keep playing, will want to put more positive play on display. Shough, meanwhile, has impressed as a second-round rookie, so much so that the Saints could continue to build around him, rather than try to replace him this offseason.Rams also have a vested rooting interest. As outlined above, there's a chance the Panthers and the Buccaneers are watching this one very closely. The Rams won't be watching it as closely, but they will still be impacted by it. The Falcons' 2026 first-round pick belongs to Los Angeles. The more Falcons losses, the better for the Rams; the pick could still end up in the top 10.Falcons vs. Saints pick, prediction\nBoth of these teams have played some surprisingly inspired football down the stretch of seasons in which they've long been eliminated from the playoffs. The difference here, between two clubs already with one eye on the offseason ahead, will be Robinson. He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage in the first meeting, a 24-10 Falcons win, as ATL's defense sacked Shough five times.

It only took 10 minutes for Andoni Iraola's Cherries to go ahead in the match, but keeping the lead has been where Bournemouth's issues have come in. It only took six minutes for the Gunners to level the match with yet another goal from a set piece via Gabriel.It was Arsenal's 12th goal via a set piece, joint top of the league with Leeds United. Even with the league's growing emphasis on set pieces, no one has been able to keep up with the Gunners, as 30 percent of their goals have come from set pieces. But that wasn't all that Arsenal would need to dig out the win.Declan Rice's return from a knee injury went a long way as the English midfielder produced a brace. It was a lovely first-time finish from outside the box to put Arsenal ahead for good in the 54th minute of play, and he almost replicated it for his second in the 70th minute. The cutbacks from attackers knowing that someone would be in the box show how orchestrated Arsenal have become under Mikel Arteta.\nThis team have grown together, and they're looking to accomplish something that hasn't happened since 2004 and lead Arsenal to a Premier League title. Even when they aren't at their best, they've been able to do enough to stay ahead of the opposition, as even that third goal proved to be important when Eli Junior Kroupi pulled a goal back for the Cherries. It was far from a vintage performance with Bouremouth producing an xG of 1.34 to Arsenal's 1.17, but the difference was in the finishing.To win the title, these are exactly the kind of matches that Arsenal need to find a way to get points from and behind Rice's leadership, they're more than on the right track. Arsenal are in full control of their destiny, even if they drop points facing Manchester City when the two meet in April.\nNow past the midway point of the season, there's still plenty that needs to happen for the Gunners to break their curse of finishing as runners-up in the league, which ahs happened now in three consecutive seasons, but they're on the right track. The matches won't be slowing down anytime soon, with Arsenal hosting Liverpool on Thursday in what will be yet another test for Arteta's men.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Darius Acuff launched his SEC Player of the Year campaign with a bang on Saturday by leading No. 18 Arkansas to an 86-75 win over No. 19 Tennessee in the conference opener for both teams. The Razorbacks' star freshman established a new career-high with 29 points and thoroughly outplayed the only player in the league who finished higher in the 2025 recruiting rankings. Nate Ament's struggle-filed 13-point performance for Tennessee (10-4, 0-1 SEC) underscored the big difference between the SEC's most highly touted diaper dandies. Acuff is about production, whereas Ament is about potential.Ament finished one spot higher in the 247Sports recruiting rankings at No. 4, is higher in the CBS Sports NBA Draft prospect rankings and may wind up having a better NBA career. But there is no debating who the better player is right now.It's Acuff, and it's not particularly close.In two of his last three games, the 6-foot-3 guard has torched two of the most perennially elite defenses in college basketball. In a Dec. 20 loss to Houston, he made 9 of 15 shots from the field, finishing with 27 points, seven assists and five rebounds. \nAgainst the Volunteers, he hit 9 of 16 shots, which included a run of eight straight Arkansas points during the middle of the second half. \nYou won't find another guard in college basketball capable of stacking better performances against those two defenses. Such performances are becoming routine for Acuff.This time of year, it can be hard to decipher what's real and what's fake. Some players pad their stats against poor competition in November and December, then crash back to reality in league play. Freshmen are among the most susceptible, as the grind of college basketball begins taking its toll.\nBut all indications so far are that Acuff may be impervious to the trend. His least productive games this season came against Winthrop and Jackson State.Much of his best work has come against Arkansas' best competition. He's scored at least 16 points against every high-major opponent, which bodes well for the Razorbacks hopes of contending in the SEC. A year ago, the Razorbacks took a 76-52 loss at Tennessee to open league play.It was a harbinger of the struggles to come for a program that dug out of an 0-5 hole to finish 8-10 in the conference before making a surprising Sweet 16 run as a No. 10 seed.\nCinderella's slippers were a strange look for the Razorbacks, and the Hogs appear to have traded them in for a pair of boots this year. Arkansas went pound-for-pound with a physical Tennessee team on the glass and in the paint, blocking a season-high 10 shots.Acuff better than AmentArkansas isn't elite defensively yet, but there were encouraging signs against Tennessee. Billy Richmond hounded Nate Ament in the backcourt at one point and forced a 10-second violation. Then with 3:20 to play in a five-point game, the Razorbacks forced a 5-second violation as Ament couldn't find anywhere to pass the ball. \nThose two turnovers were part of a frustrating day for the 6-foot-10 prospect. Ament finished just 5 of 11 from the free-throw line and didn't reach double figures until the game was out of reach in the final minute.\nTennessee and Arkansas are configured differently, as the Volunteers also have a veteran point guard in Ja'Kobi Gillespie and a well-established defense. But the fate of both teams will be determined by how far their freshman stars can take them.Acuff is already playing at an All-American level. With the Razorbacks mired in an early slump, he provided their first seven points. Later on, he capped an 8-0 run with a dagger of a 3-pointer to put Arkansas ahead 79-68 with 2:09 remaining. At every turn of his first SEC game, he rose to meet the moment.Arkansas coach John Calipari has shepherded the development of many great freshman guards over the decades. He's got his next great one.\nRick Barnes has coached his share of elite freshmen as well, both at Tennessee and Texas. There is no denying Ament's potential.But Saturday's SEC opener was a reminder of the difference between potential and production when it comes to building around freshmen.Tennessee has promise with Ament. Arkansas has a sure-thing with Acuff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 6 Duke is 12-1 with wins over NCAA Tournament teams like Kansas, Arkansas, Florida and Michigan State, and yet it enters 2026 with questions aplenty after a second-half collapse to Texas Tech, followed up by Wednesday's sweaty, six-point win over Georgia Tech as a gargantuan 27.5-point favorite.Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Perhaps, but even Jon Scheyer seems to be searching for the right combinations. Duke shifted the starting lineup for the third time against Georgia Tech, inserting freshman point guard Cayden Boozer into the fray and diverting wing Nik Khamenia to the second unit.We'll learn about the mental fortitude of this Duke team because even though a date with ACC frontrunner Louisville looms on Tuesday, it has to get past 7-7 Florida State before it can get started on the Cardinals' scout. First-year 'Noles coach Luke Loucks is 0-5 against high-major teams, but if Florida State can push Florida, it can get up for Duke.Let's dive into the ins and outs of this ACC matchup.Duke vs. Florida State: Need to knowHigh-variance tilt: Florida State zooms up and down the floor at a breakneck pace and tries to shoot as many 3-pointers as possible. FSU's offense has the fifth-fastest average possession length, and 54% of its shots come from downtown. Loucks doesn't have Alabama's star power yet, but he is using Nate Oats' game plan on offense. Shooting this many 3s opens up the door for some wild outcomes ... good and bad. So far for Florida State, it's been mostly bad. They shot just 9-for-41 (22%) from downtown against Texas A&M and got smoked by 36 against an Aggies club that is in a similar tier from a talent perspective. We have yet to see FSU get it rolling from downtown against a high-major team. Duke surely doesn't want to become the first team that lets FSU's barrage of snipers get hot, or a dogfight could emerge.\nWill FSU keep Duke from hanging on rims? North Carolina threw down 12 dunks against Florida State on Tuesday. That was the most UNC had in a single game since 2011. Now, FSU has to face off against Cameron Boozer and Patrick Ngongba? That's no fun. There are easy buckets to be had in the paint against this Florida State defense that is vulnerable when it cannot generate takeaways.Will Duke's leaky pick-and-roll defense get shored up? Texas Tech's Christian Anderson took a blowtorch to Duke's pick-and-roll defense, and Scheyer had to pivot to a zone defense in the second half to find some answers after Georgia Tech's ball-handlers were creating far too many advantages. Duke will have its hands full with FSU point guard Robert McCray V, who ranks sixth in the country in assists (7.1). Caleb Foster will get the first turn, but Duke's switch-heavy defense means anyone on the floor better be ready to sit down and try to guard McCray.  Where to watch Duke vs. Florida State live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 3:45 p.m. ETLocation: Tucker Arena -- Tallahassee, FloridaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    \nDuke vs. Florida State prediction, picks\nMaking a billion 3-pointers (in reality, like 22 treys) feels like Florida State's only hope to spring this upset. Everything else screams Duke in this one. FSU is a poor defensive-rebounding team. Georgia, Florida and UNC all corralled 15+ offensive rebounds. Ngongba, Cameron Boozer and Maliq Brown should be licking their chops to go to war on the glass. Plus, the pivot to playing Cayden Boozer with Caleb Foster in a two-point guard look should pay dividends in this one. Florida State will pressure the basketball relentlessly. Having two point guards who can break that first wave of pressure should unlock a ton of advantages in this one.I also do not think FSU has enough capable ball-handlers outside of McCray to consistently break down this Duke defense. Duke has been so good at grinding teams to a halt with its switches. If that happens, Florida State has to hope McCray goes nuclear because there's not a ton of other true switch-beaters on this FSU roster. If it attacks the paint, does its thing on the glass, blankets the 3-point stripe, controls the tempo and moves the ball without panicking, Duke can run away with this one. Pick: Duke -15\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            Duke -15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 18 will kick off Saturday afternoon from Tampa where the Buccaneers (7-9) and Carolina Panthers (8-8) will square off with the NFC South division title and the conference's No. 4 postseason seed on the line.The host Buccaneers are seeking to become the first NFC team to win (but will still have to wait for Saints-Falcons result on Sunday) five consecutive division titles since the 1990s' Dallas Cowboys dynasty (1992-1996), and in doing so, they would own the longest division title streak by any NFC South team since the 2022 divisional realignment. The visiting Panthers are seeking their first playoff appearance since 2017 and their first division title since 2015 when they won the NFC and played in Super Bowl 50. Both squads enter the final week of the regular season stumbling into their division-deciding matchup. Tampa Bay is on a four-game losing streak and has lost seven of its last eight games after a 6-2 start. Meanwhile, Carolina has been a rollercoaster all season, going 10 consecutive games alternating a win and a loss, which is tied for the fourth-longest such streak of all time. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 18 odds, predictions, expert picks: Who will win the AFC North? Can the Jaguars clinch the AFC South?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's worth noting this game is only a win-and-in situation for the Panthers, who can clinch the division with a win or a tie. The Buccaneers need to win and have the New Orleans Saints beat the Atlanta Falcons in order to clinch the 2025 NFC South title. Even if Tampa Bay wins, should the Falcons win, there would be a three-way tie for the NFC South -- a tie that Carolina would win. \nWhere to watch Buccaneers vs. Panthers liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPanthers vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowWhich Baker Mayfield will show up? \nBaker Mayfield's 2025 season has been a rollercoaster. He was on fire through the first six games of the year, throwing 12 touchdowns to just one interception, and the Buccaneers won five of their first six games as a result. The last 10 weeks, Mayfield underwent an epic collapse with 13 touchdowns to nine interceptions, playing a major role in Tampa Bay losing eight of their last 10 games, including the last four in a row. One of those defeats was a 23-20 loss at the Panthers in Week 16 two weeks ago. He threw for 145 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 18 of 26 passing with the interception sealing the game's outcome with 49 seconds left to play. Carolina only blitzed Mayfield on six of his 12 dropbacks in that game with the two-time Pro Bowler completing one of his three throws for a 1-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans. Perhaps the Panthers opt to break tendency and blitz Mayfield a little more on Saturday. On the season, Carolina possesses a 29.2% blitz rate, right around league average at the 15th-highest rate. Mayfield has been a mess this season against the blitz with the second-lowest completion percentage (50.7%), the lowest yards per pass attempt (5.2) and the second-lowest passer rating (69.4) against it in 2025. \nBaker Mayfield this seasonFirst 6 gamesLast 10 gamesW-L5-12-8Comp Pct66.2%60.7%Pass YPG 256.5195.1TD-INT12-113-9Passer Rating108.579.4Will Bryce Young be able to repeat his Week 16 performance against the Buccaneers? \nTwo weeks ago in a 23-20 home win over the Buccaneers, Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young played one of his best games of the season, completing 21 of his 32 throws for 191 yards and two passing touchdowns. However, Young and his supporting cast melted down against the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks in Charlotte in Week 17: he threw 54 yards, his fewest in any start of his three-year career, and an interception on 14 of 24 passing. Young's 29 career starts with fewer than 200 yards passing are the fourth-most by a quarterback in their first three seasons since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. He thrived against Tampa Bay throwing short, completing 16 of his 18 passes on throws of under 10 air yards for 101 yards passing. Young hit two of his three throws on 20-plus air yards for 56 yards and a score, including a 22-yard touchdown to rookie first-round wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan. He'll need to pull off a couple of those explosive plays to McMillan to keep the Buccaneers' defense honest. Otherwise, he could have a second consecutive long afternoon. Can Jaycee Horn make a game-changing play?\nJaycee Horn, Carolina's two-time Pro Bowl cornerback, is having a career year. His five interceptions are a career-high, and they're tied for the second-most in the NFL with all five coming on deep throws, passes of 20 or more air yards. In the Week 16 matchup against Tampa Bay, Mayfield didn't throw his as Horn wasn't targeted on 29 coverage snaps. That stands as the only game of Horn's career with a minimum of 15 coverage snaps and no targets.  He covered Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans on seven matchups, wide receiver Chris Godwin on five matchups and wide receiver Jalen McMillan on three matchups per NFL Pro. If Horn can make a play to reel in his sixth interception of the season, the Panthers will likely clinch the NFC South title. The Buccaneers are 0-8 in games that Mayfield throws an interception this season. Panthers vs. Buccaneers prediction, pick\nTampa Bay has won five consecutive home games against Carolina with their last loss against the visiting Panthers coming all the way back in 2019. That streak ends on Saturday. Horn will intercept Mayfield to set up Young with advantageous field position to throw a game-winning touchdown pass to McMillan for a one-score win. Pick: Panthers 24, Buccaneers 20 | (Panthers +3, Over 43.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first weekend of 2026 saw most college basketball teams play their first or second conference game of the season. While No. 6 Duke survived a scare against Florida State during a 91-87 win on the road, other blue bloods weren't as fortunate.    Kentucky dropped to 9-5 on the season and began SEC play with a 89-74 loss to No. 14 Alabama on the road. Last year, the Wildcats opened conference play with a statement win over (eventual) national champion Florida in one of the best games of the season. The Wildcats were riding a four-game win streak before falling to the Crimson Tide.     In the Big 12, No. 17 Kansas saw star freshman Darryn Peterson return to the lineup against UCF. However, Peterson logged just five minutes in the second half and his team was on the wrong side of an 81-75 loss to the Knights. Almost two years ago to the day the Knights upset the Jayhawks in their first conference win as a member of the Big 12.    No. 12 North Carolina has been playing like one of the best teams in college basketball lately, but fell flat in its first conference loss to SMU. The 97-83 setback to the Mustangs snapped a seven-game winning streak dating back to a win over Kentucky in the ACC/SEC Challenge.     \nHere's how the AP Top 25 fared Saturday followed by our selected winners and losers.  1Arizona at Utah, W 97-782Michigan \t\t\t\tDid not play3Iowa State \t\t\t\tDid not play4UConn\t\t\t\tDid not play5Purdueat Wisconsin, W 89-736Dukeat Florida State, W 91-877Gonzaga\t\t\t\tDid not play8Houstonat Cincinnati, W 67-609Michigan State\t\t\t\tDid not play10BYUat Kansas State, W 83-7311Vanderbiltat South Carolina, W 83-7112North Carolinaat SMU, L 97-8313Nebraska\t\t\t\tDid not play14Alabamavs. Kentucky, W 89-7415Texas Techvs. Oklahoma State, W 102-8016Louisville\t\t\t\tDid not play17Kansasat UCF, L 81-7518Arkansasvs. No. 19 Tennessee, W 86-7519Tennesseeat No. 18 Arkansas, L 86-7520Illinoisat Penn State, W 73-6521Virginiaat North Carolina State, W 76-6122Floridaat Missouri, L 76-7423Georgiavs. Auburn, W 104-100 OT24USC\t\t\t\tDid not play25Iowavs. UCLA, W 74-61\n    \n                                        \n    Loser: Another slow start dooms Kentucky vs. Alabama  Slow starts sunk Kentucky in early-season losses to Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina and Gonzaga. And a slow start Saturday (surprise!) at Alabama to open its SEC slate – in which it trailed by as many as 21 points in the first half (!!) – again doomed the Wildcats in an 89-74 defeat.     It was a major step back for Kentucky after it closed out the 2025 calendar year with four consecutive wins and seemed to be trending up, with two of those wins coming against St. John's and Indiana. The Wildcats simply never found their groove in this one, and despite a late push, the game's result was never in doubt.     \nTroubling for UK (in addition to the loss, which is not all that troubling in a vacuum) is the way in which it succumbed to the Tide. It lost the rebounding battle to a Bama team that has been soft on the boards much of the season and let Bama assert itself in precisely the way it wanted to: by letting Labaron Philon and Aden Holloway dictate the terms and pick them apart from 3-point range. That's top-of-the-scouting-report priorities Kentucky should've had a better plan for. Instead it's back to the drawing board after a humbling defeat. -- Kyle Boone   \n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Baylor's December free agent makes debut   Sure, Baylor (10-3) lost 69-63 at TCU, but James Nnaji, the newest player on the Bears' roster, pretty clearly had a very good day on a personal level. He made history, for starters. He'll forever be referenced and remembered as the first former NBA Draft pick to play in men's college basketball. Leading up to the game, Scott Drew speculated Nnaji might only play a few minutes in his debut. He overshot the target. Nnaji was playable enough to stay on the court for 16:17 out of 40 minutes of a fairly competitive game that saw Baylor chasing throughout.   Nnaji finished with five points, four rebounds, one assist, two turnovers and four fouls. He's rough around the edges, but that was the expectation; Saturday was Nnaji's first five-on-five action since the summer. He had a back issue that kept him out of competition, and all things considered, he was a plus on the floor. For Drew and Baylor, which only had eight healthy players, the depth was a welcomed update to the team's reinforcements. We'll see how he adapts in the weeks ahead. Whether Nnaji's addition to the roster is worth even one additional win is far from a certainty.     \n\n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Stirtz puts on show in Iowa's win vs. UCLA   Iowa matched its best start to a season since 2020-21 with a 74-61 home victory over UCLA on Saturday to improve to 12-2 overall. The Hawkeyes were stingy defensively in limiting UCLA to 3-of-14 shooting from 3-point range, and their star, Bennett Stirtz, was stupendous on the other end of the floor. He finished with a game-high 27 points and five assists and was 8-of-10 shooting from the field and a perfect 7 for 7 from the free-throw line. -- Boone   \n    \n                                        \n       Winner: BYU, Dybantsa stay hot with 10th straight win   Momentum from nonconference play rolled into conference play for BYU on Saturday as it opened Big 12 action with an 83-73 road win over Kansas State. The Cougars controlled the game throughout with freshman star AJ Dybantsa doing AJ Dybantsa things. He finished with 24 points, eight boards and three assists. -- Boone   \n\n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Smith becomes Big Ten's all-time assists leader   Purdue star Braden Smith set the record for the most all-time career assists among Big Ten players Saturday with 12 dimes in an 89-73 win over Wisconsin to put him at 893. Smith broke the record of 890 previously held by Michigan State star Cassius Winston, and he did so in a game in which he also added 14 points and four boards. -- Boone   \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Arkansas' Acuff shines in SEC debut     Arkansas freshman Darius Acuff turned in a memorable SEC debut, scoring a career-high 29 points to lead the No. 18 Razorbacks to an 86-75 win over No. 19 Tennessee. Acuff produced Arkansas' first seven points, scored a big bucket just before halftime and then popped off for 19 in the second half. In the process, he thoroughly outplayed Tennessee's Nate Ament, who was the only SEC freshman to finish ahead of Acuff in the final 247Sports recruiting rankings.     Acuff has yet to score fewer than 16 points against a high-major opponent and is looking like an early contender for SEC Player of the Year. A year ago, the Razorbacks had to grapple with unmet expectations and injuries surrounding freshman guard Boogie Fland. This time, coach John Calipari appears to have hit the lottery. -- David Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: Peterson returns, but Kansas falls to UCF    The good news: Kansas star freshman Darryn Peterson is back. The bad? Kansas was on the wrong side of an upset loss to UCF. Peterson looked incredible in the first half against the Knights and scored 23 points before halftime. However, Peterson logged just five total minutes in the second half and scored just three points. Peterson subbed out around the 10-minute mark and did not return for the rest of the game. The ceiling of Kansas' roster without Peterson is significantly lower. -- Cameron Salerno    \n\n        \n            \n                UCF upsets No. 17 Kansas in return of Jayhawks star freshman Darrryn Peterson from hamstring injury\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: UNC defense collapses in ugly road loss to SMU    North Carolina entered the weekend with the second-best defense among ACC programs, allowing 96.6 points per 100 possessions, per KenPom data. It left the day searching for answers in an area it has otherwise been brilliant in after surrendering a season-high 97 points in a 97-83 defeat to SMU.    SMU converted 1.426 points per possession in the win – a stunning 142.6 points per 100 possession pace – and found little resistance in its third consecutive outing of 97 or more points. The Mustangs finished 14 of 27 from 3-point range, had 23 assists to only seven turnovers and never trailed in the second half. -- Boone    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Texas Tech is flying high offensively    With premier perimeter marksmen Chance McMillian (43.3% on 5.3 attempts) and Kerwin Walton (39.6% on 4.3 attempts) departing from a team that ranked in the top 50 nationally in made 3-pointers per game (10) and percentage (36.7%), Tech needed some hired guns. It found them in the form of UNC Greensboro transfer Donovan Atwell, freshman Jaylen Petty and Santa Clara transfer Tyeree Bryan. The trio combined to go 12 of 23 from deep in a 102-80 win over Oklahoma State.     \nThe Red Raiders tied a season-high with 17 made 3-pointers against the Cowboys as four TTU players drilled 3+ treys apiece. When you surround an interior star like JT Toppin with that type of shooting, you get an elite offensive team. That's what Texas Tech (11-3, 1-0 Big 12) is on their way to becoming after an uneven start to the season. Toppin led the way with 23 points and 14 rebounds, which left Oklahoma State with no choice but to pick its poison defensively. -- Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: Pitt veers toward rock bottom    An 80-46 win over Penn State on Dec. 21 sent Pitt into Christmas on a high note after a rocky start that included home losses to Quinnipiac and Hofstra. But any hope of the Panthers maintaining that momentum dissipated in a 73-68 loss to Clemson on Saturday. The Panthers are now (7-8, 0-2 ACC) and careening toward irrelevance once again.    This program won 20+ games in consecutive seasons back in 2023 and 2024, finishing 26-14 in the ACC during that span under eighth-year coach Jeff Capel. The Panthers even reached the second round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament and signed a strong freshman class that year, which featured top-100 guards Bub Carrington and Jaland Lowe. But Carrington turned out to be a one-and-done star, and Lowe transferred to Kentucky after last season. With more talent heading out than coming in, this struggle was all-too predictable. -- Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Villanova might be second best in Big East    UConn is the king of the Big East for now, but Villanova looks solidified to be No. 2 after improving to 3-0 in the league with an 85-67 road win over Butler. Balance is everything for Kevin Willard's group. All five starters (Academe Lewis, Matt Hodge, Bryce Lindsay, Tyler Perkins and Duke Brennan) cracked double figures. With lone losses to BYU (very good!) and Michigan (confirmed amazing!), Villanova looks primed to rise above St. John's, Seton Hall and the rest to be UConn's stiffest challenger.  -- Trotter    \n    \n                                        \n        Loser: NC State's 3-point defense goes MIA vs. UVa   NC State's 3-point defense had been flirting with disaster for large chunks of time this season, and Saturday turned out to be judgment day. Entering the day, the Wolfpack had allowed 9.5 unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s per game. That ranked 291st nationally. Virginia capitalized on those clean looks from the jump. Sam Lewis and Malik Thomas combined for seven triples in the first half alone of UVA's runaway 76-61 victory over NC State. Virginia totaled 13 triples and improved to 12-2 overall and 1-1 in ACC play. -- Trotter    \n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Georgia off to historically great start after OT win    On a day in which defense was optional (but, largely, nonexistent) it should come as no surprise that No. 23 Georgia – which has the highest-scoring offense in college basketball – came through down the stretch by relying on its offense in a 104-100 overtime win over Auburn.    \nThe Bulldogs outscored the Tigers 12-8 in the extra period, which included two made 3-pointers and two made free throws in the final 110 seconds to seal the win. UGA finished the day 11 of 29 from 3-point range and 25 of 35 from the free-throw line.    The win moved UGA to 13-1 on the season, marking its second-best start in program history and best start to a season since 1931.  -- Boone    \n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Providence rallies to stun St. John's    Stefan Vaaks erupted for 15 of his 16 points in the second half to spark Providence to a potentially season-turning win over St. John's. The once-slumping Friars trailed 15-3 before they could blink and at one point trailed by as many as 13 points. They had to survive an unbelievable 33-point, 15-rebound Zuby Ejiofor performance. And yet, Providence surged off the mat to erase a 10-point deficit in the final seven minutes of regulation. -- Isaac Trotter    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final week of the NFL season is here, and you better buckle up, because there's a lot on the line. Heading into Sunday, there are still three division titles up for grabs and two playoff spots that haven't been clinched.One thing that's not up for grabs is the No. 1 seed in the NFC and that's because the Seahawks clinched it on Saturday night with a dominant 13-3 win over the 49ers. That means the Seahawks will get a bye in the opening round of the playoffs while the 49ers will be forced to hit the road for the wild card round.The Seahawks' win was part of a Saturday doubleheader that kicked off Week 18. In the early game, the Buccaneers beat the Panthers, 16-14, in an NFC South showdown that didn't end up deciding anything. Due to Tampa Bay's win, the battle for the division title will now be decided by Sunday's game between the Saints and Falcons. That's right, two teams that have already been eliminated from the playoffs will determine the winner of the NFC South.If the Falcons beat the Saints on Sunday, they'll improve to 8-9, which would create a three-way tie atop the NFC South. In that scenario, the Panthers would win the three-way tiebreaker. On the other hand, if the Falcons lose to New Orleans, then the Bucs will clinch the division title.\nThe team that ends up winning the NFC South will get to host a playoff game next week. So who will they face in the opening round? Glad you asked. We're going to break down the entire playoff field here by taking a look at the possible seeds for each team along with each playoff team's possible opponent in the wild-card round. With that in mind, let's check out the current playoff standings along with clinching scenarios.\nAFC playoff standings\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (13-3)Clinched AFC WestPossible playoff seed: 1, 2, or 3Possible wild-card opponents: Texans, Jaguars, Chargers, Bills or first-round byeThe Broncos are in the driver's seat for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. To clinch the top spot, all they have to do is beat a Chargers team that won't be at full strength (the Chargers will be resting multiple starters, including Justin Herbert). If the Broncos slip up against Los Angeles, they could potentially drop all the way down to the three seed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (13-3)Clinched AFC EastPossible playoff seed: 1, 2, or 3Possible wild-card opponents: Texans, Jaguars, Chargers, Bills or first-round bye\nIf the Patriots beat the Dolphins on Sunday, that will clinch them at least the No. 2 seed. If they win and the Broncos also lose, then New England would get the No. 1 overall seed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7Possible wild-card opponents: Chargers, Texans, Bills, Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, Patriots or first-round byeIt doesn't seem possible, but with just one week left to play in the season, the Jaguars (12-4) could still end up with one of six different AFC playoff seeds (the only one they can't clinch is the fourth seed). If the Jags beat the Titans on Sunday, they'll clinch the AFC South. The Jags can still get the No. 1 seed with a win, but they'd also need both the Broncos and Patriots to lose.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)Possible seed: 4 or out of playoffsPossible wild-card opponents: Texans, Jaguars, Chargers or BillsThe Steelers' route to the playoffs is pretty simple: They have to beat (or tie) the Ravens on Sunday night. If the Steelers lose, their season will be over. By the time the Steelers take the field Sunday night, they'll know who their potential playoff opponent would be in the wild-card round if they can get past the Ravens.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Houston Texans (11-5)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 3, 5, 6, 7Possible wild-card opponents: Chargers, Jaguars, Bills, Steelers, Ravens, Broncos or Patriots\nThe Texans can still win the AFC South, but for that to happen, they'll have to beat the Colts and the Jaguars will have to lose to the Titans. Although the Texans don't control their fate, they do control one thing: They'll be guaranteed no worse than the fifth seed if they win Sunday.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 5, 6, 7Possible wild-card opponents: Jaguars, Texans, Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, PatriotsAlthough the Chargers are still alive to earn the fifth seed, that's likely not going to happen. The Chargers will be resting their starters against the Broncos on Sunday, and if they end up losing to Denver, then L.A. will either get a sixth or seventh seed, depending on what Buffalo does.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 5, 6, 7Possible wild-card opponents: Jaguars, Texans, Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, PatriotsIf the Bills lose to the Jets on Sunday, they'll clinch the seventh seed. However, if they beat the Jets, they could move up to as high as the fifth seed if the Texans and Chargers both lose. With the Chargers resting their starters, there's a very real scenario where the Bills could get the sixth seed. For that to happen, the Chargers would have to lose, while the Texans and Bills would both have to win.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    STILL ALIVE: Ravens (8-8)Possible seed: 4 or out of playoffsPossible wild-card opponents: Texans, Jaguars, Chargers or Bills\nThe Ravens will face the Steelers on Sunday night with the AFC North on the line. This is essentially a playoff game because the loser will see their season end. If the Ravens win, they'll be hosting a playoff game in Baltimore next week. AFC wild card games based on current standings(7) Bills at (2) Patriots (6) Chargers at (3) Jaguars (5) Texans at (4) Steelers Bye: BroncosNFC playoff standings\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Clinched NFC WestPlayoff seed: Clinched No. 1Wild-card opponent: Clinched first-round bye\nThe Seahawks officially clinched the NFC West and the top seed in the NFC with their 13-3 win over the 49ers on Saturday night. This is the fourth time in franchise history that the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 overall seed. In each of the three previous instances (2005, 2013, 2014), Seattle made it to the Super Bowl. Thanks to the bye, the Seahawks won't be back on the field until the divisional round (Jan. 10 or 11). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-5)Clinched NFC NorthPossible playoff seed: 2 or 3Possible wild-card opponents: Packers, Rams or 49ersThe Bears can clinch the No. 2 seed with a win over the Lions on Sunday, and if that happens, Chicago will host the Packers in the wild-card round. The only way the Bears can drop to the three seed is if they lose and the Eagles beat the Commanders.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Clinched NFC EastPossible playoff seed: 2 or 3Possible wild-card opponents: Packers, Rams or 49ersThe Eagles will be resting their starters, including Jalen Hurts, against the Commanders on Sunday. If the Eagles lose, they'll be locked into the three seed and an opening-round playoff game against either the 49ers or Rams.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9) Possible playoff seed: 4 or out of playoffsPossible wild-card opponents: Rams or 49ersThe Buccaneers pulled off a huge win over the Panthers on Saturday, but they haven't quite clinched the NFC South yet. To win the division, the Bucs need the Falcons to lose (or tie) the Saints on Sunday, which means everyone on Tampa Bay's roster will be pulling hard for New Orleans to pull out the win. The Bucs would win the common-games tiebreaker over the Panthers if both teams finish 8-9, but Carolina would win a three-way tiebreaker with the Falcons, Bucs and Panthers all tied at 8-9.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 5 or 6Possible wild-card opponents: Buccaneers, Panthers, Eagles, BearsThe 49ers had a chance to clinch the NFC's No. 1 overall seed on Saturday, but they came up short. With the loss, that means they'll either be the fifth-seed or the sixth-seed in the NFC. If the Rams beat the Cardinals on Sunday, then San Francisco will drop to the sixth-seed. If the Rams lose, then the 49ers will be the fifth-seed. The big difference is that the fifth-seed will get to play the winner of the NFC South while the sixth-seed will have to play the Bears or Eagles. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-5)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: 5 or 6Possible wild-card opponents: Buccaneers, Panthers, Bears or EaglesThe Rams will clinch the fifth seed with a win over Arizona on Sunday. If the Rams lose, they'll end up as the sixth-seed. The Rams faced three of their four possible playoff opponents during the regular season, going 1-2. They lost to the Eagles and Panthers while beating the Buccaneers.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Clinched playoff spotPossible playoff seed: Clinched No. 7Possible wild-card opponents: Bears or EaglesHeading into Week 18, the Packers are the only playoff team that has clinched its seed for the postseason, which explains why Matt LaFleur will be resting several starters against the Vikings on Sunday, including Jordan Love.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    STILL ALIVE: Carolina Panthers (8-9) Possible playoff seed: 4 or out of playoffsPossible wild-card opponents: Rams or 49ersThe Panthers had a chance to clinch the NFC South on Saturday, but they came up short. Now, Carolina's playoff hopes are in the hands of the Falcons. If Atlanta beats the Saints on Sunday, then the Panthers will clinch the division title. A win by the Falcons would create a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9, and the Panthers would win that because they have the best head-to-head record among the three tied teams (the Panthers went 3-1 against the Bucs and Falcons. The Bucs went 2-2 against Carolina and Atlanta. The Falcons went 1-3 against the other two).NFC wild card games based on current standings(7) Packers at (2) Bears (6) Rams at (3) Eagles (5) 49ers at (4) Buccaneers Bye: Seahawks\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL hiring -- and firing -- cycle is upon us as the regular season concludes. The Giants and Titans already have openings at head coach while the Dolphins are the lone team without a GM.Recent history tells us there will be six to eight head coach vacancies and two to four GM openings. But in talking with sources around the league, it is definitely harder to get to that total at GM than it is at head coach.The NFL has tried to slow the hiring process down the last few years. Since it's been 12 months since we have gone through this, here's a quick refresher on the upcoming calendar:Teams will start requesting interviews with candidates early this week, and teams can interview candidates on teams who aren't playing in the wild-card round beginning Tuesday (in the case of the four teams playing Saturday night) and Wednesday (for everyone else playing Sunday). In-person interviews can't begin until Jan. 19 unless the coach is not employed by a team, and a second in-person interview can't take place until Jan. 26. And in order to complete the hiring process, teams must comply with the Rooney Rule which dictates interviewing, in person, at least two external candidates who are people of color or women.No matter what, be sure to remember that your favorite team is \"casting a wide net\" looking for \"the right person that fits\" them regardless of background, because your team \"will leave no stone unturned\" to make sure they \"get this right\" with the goal of \"building a sustained winner.\"\nHere's what I'm hearing at head coach\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns, Stefanski headed for splitsville The Cleveland Browns and head coach Kevin Stefanski appeared destined for a breakup after six seasons. A two-time NFL Coach of the Year, Stefanski is 44-56 at the helm in Cleveland with two winning seasons and two playoff appearances. At 43, Stefanski remains a young coach who is well thought of across the league, and few would be surprised if he winds up getting another head-coaching gig this cycle. In consecutive losing seasons Stefanski has handed off play-calling duties to his offensive coordinator, with last year going to Ken Dorsey and this year to Tommy Rees. It will be interesting to see how he handles that at his next stop should the expected take place.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Pete Carroll era will end quickly in VegasThe downward spiral that has been this season for the Las Vegas Raiders can't come quickly enough, and signs point to this being a one-and-done season for legendary head coach Pete Carroll. Put simply, it hasn't worked in Vegas. Carroll wasn't Tom Brady's first choice there, and the end result was a hodgepodge of differing coaching philosophies on top of a different personnel philosophy. Carroll fired two coordinators, including an offensive coordinator who is due $12 million from Mark Davis over the next two years, but kept his two sons who oversee underperforming groups. But his leadership showed through the past few weeks when the decision to place Maxx Crosby on IR could have ignited a powder keg. \nArmed with the No. 1 overall pick, the Raiders are expected to again be led by Brady in the interview process this month. It was curious a year ago when the Raiders did not involve team president Sandra Douglass Morgan in much of the interview process. A recent trend in the league has been involving a diverse set of high-ranking executives in the process to make a sound organizational decision. Perhaps the team could benefit from having her voice -- or even her ear -- be one input in the process of finding the new leader of the team.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jets likely to give Glenn second chanceMight Aaron Glenn be a second one-and-done coach in the league this year? It is highly unlikely. It has been a bad, bad year for Gang Green, but sources don't sense Woody Johnson is inclined to cut bait on Glenn even if the performance on the field was below expectations. Glenn will soon prepare for defensive coordinator interviews, and there's likely to be more staff shakeup after this season. The belief is Johnson wants to see what Glenn can do with a quarterback in Year 2, and the Jets have more ammunition than any other team to go get one.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Morris' fate up in the air in ATLNo one is willing to confidently call Raheem Morris \"safe\" this cycle. The late-season jolt has helped his case for a third season after the team underachieved on the field at nearly every area except pass rush. Atlanta finishes its season Sunday against the Saints. Would a fourth consecutive win -- with a chance to spur a three-way tie in the NFC South that would not include a playoff berth -- be enough to buy Morris a third year?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Might Arizona stand pat? Is Arizona It is not for certain the Cardinals will retain third-year coach Jonathan Gannon, though many have said to me that Michael Bidwill may be unwilling to pay three fired coaches at one time, as well as the fact the offense has been playing \"with a practice squad\" as one source put it. Gannon has handled himself well in press conferences that aren't easy. There are big decisions Arizona has to make about its future, including at QB with Kyler Murray. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    McDaniel expected back in MiamiAs we have been reporting for weeks, it would be a surprise if Mike McDaniel is not back with Miami next season. That's the way things have been shaping up for more than a month, and last week's win with rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers helped reinforce that.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Big Red not going anywhereNo, Andy Reid is not retiring. He is set to make $20 million per year for the rest of the decade and still has Patrick Mahomes at quarterback.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Late skid should not sink BowlesBuccaneers ownership usually waits until the end of the season to evaluate head coaches. It seems unlikely Tampa would part with Todd Bowles after paying him a three-year extension in the offseason. Bowles is 34-33 in Tampa, along with three playoff appearances that he hopes to make four after this weekend. Staff changes, however this season turns out, are likely, at the very least.Coaching implications of Sunday nightJohn Hargbaugh and Mike Tomlin, two institutions of the AFC North, are both likely to return.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The colossal Sunday night game against the Ravens and Steelers is an elimination game for the two teams, but not necessarily for the two coaches. If Mike Tomlin is not the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers next year, it will be his decision, as reported previously. He also has a no-trade clause, and the mechanics of a trade would be difficult to pull off because it would mean the Steelers would have to start a search late in the cycle's calendar. Meanwhile, sources tend to believe John Harbaugh would be back in 2026 regardless of Sunday's result. He signed an extension this past offseason that takes him through the 2028 season.What I'm hearing at general manager\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The type Miami wants in it next GMThe Dolphins appear to be moving forward with Mike McDaniel, as was the case last month. The search for a GM has been underway, and I'm told the Dolphins have been adding and removing names from their internal list recently. \nMiami will look to add a GM who can work in concert with the head coach and Brandon Shore, the team's SVP of football and business administration, to make a sort of football triumvirate. I'm told a person having a prominent role in this decision will be Daniel Sillman, a sports executive who is owner Stephen Ross's son-in-law. Ross will lead the search for the next GM with help from Sillman and team president/CEO Tom Garfinkel, league sources say. (An earlier version of this story said Sillman and Garfinkel would lead the process, and this has been corrected above.)And as reported Thursday night, they will also have with them Troy Aikman in the interview room. Aikman has been in broadcast production meetings for two decades and so he has been asking questions to all 32 teams for years, gaining valuable insight into organizations to be used in an instance just like this. Who knows if it'll work, but the thought process behind it is sound.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    I expect Schoen to hire NYG's new coachBig Blue continues to move as though GM Joe Schoen will remain in 2026, which is the final year of his contract. Last month I reported it remained status quo with ownership and Schoen, and talk of the Giants not getting their top coaching candidate because of Schoen's presence was overblown. The Giants remain a desirable job, especially considering their competition this cycle. \nI also don't believe there are any frontrunners just yet for the gig, though Mike McCarthy and Antonio Pierce are expected to get interviews. I would expect owner John Mara to make an announcement regarding his decision on Schoen's future at some point after Sunday.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Easy to understand why Atlanta may fire FontenotWhen the Falcons dropped to 4-9 a week ago it seemed like Terry Fontenot's fate had been sealed in Atlanta. But now the Falcons have rattled off three straight wins and could wind up with the same record as the division champs. Fontenot's latest draft class could have three players -- Jalon Walker, James Pearce Jr. and Xavier Watts -- finish in the top five of Defensive Rookie of the Year voting (regardless of how many picks it took to get all those guys). The Falcons are working with a consulting firm, but owner Arthur Blank has a large sports portfolio where that firm works with other entities as well. If Fontenot is relieved of his duties, it will be because the Falcons were unable to win the division in his five years there and may have spent a lot of premium capital to still not have the quarterback figured out for Week 1 of 2026. But the current 7-9 record in Atlanta reflects a collective failure there, and from this draft class to the potential Offensive Player of the Year in Bijan Robinson, there is clearly talent on the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Latest in Indy? Your guess is as good as mineIt seems to me that whatever you hear out of Indianapolis regarding GM Chris Ballard is guesswork. Jim Irsay had decades of precedent he had built up. Carlie Irsay-Gordon is now running the place, and she's now faced with a major decision regarding her GM after another late-season collapse. They have made the playoffs twice in his nine years at the helm but have no divisional championships. It is the longest stretch of any general manager currently employed by a team. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers expresses no regrets in NFL return despite Colts 0-3 finish: 'It's been an absolute blast'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEach of the 13 current GMs who have held their post since at least the start of the 2019 season has won his division at least once except for Ballard. They missed on Anthony Richardson and the Sauce Gardner trade was going to be hard for Ballard to win even if he stayed healthy. Still, the Colts had some bad luck and tough breaks this season, and there are plenty around the league who could see Indy running it back again.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Berry drafting well enough to keep his jobWhile indications are the Browns will move on from Stefanski, it seems GM Andrew Berry will remain in his seat. Berry's draft class has produced so far, with likely Defensive Rookie of the Year Carson Schwesinger leading the way, followed by top-five Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate Harold Fannin Jr. and a draft-day trade with the Jaguars that has aged nicely for Cleveland. Berry must shoulder his share of the blame for the failed seasons in Cleveland, but it seems like he will continue captaining the team. It's possible he gets even more job duties now that Paul DePodesta has left the organization. Some around the league have wondered if Berry would actually get a promotion that would create a GM role, similar to the structure in Tennessee.  Candidates from losing teams you should be trackingConsider this my annual reminder to teams with head coach and GM vacancies -- and all positions, for that matter -- to still consider candidates from losing teams. I hear every year how teams eliminate candidates from consideration because of their current team's win-loss record. I have already heard it this year. That is reductive. \nIf teams are truly \"casting wide nets\" to identify \"the best candidate,\" then they would not summarily dismiss someone *just* because his team had a tough year. For head coach candidates who are only below .500 groups, teams would still do well to consider guys like Bengals OC Dan Pitcher, the Chiefs coordinators, Titans DC Dennard Wilson and Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury. The same goes for GM for the likes of Giants AGM Brandon Brown, Browns AGM Glenn Cook, Commanders AGM Lance Newmark, Saints execs Khai Harley and Michael Parenton, Cowboys VP Will McClay, Chiefs execs Mike Bradway and Tim Terry and Cincinnati execs Steve Radicevic and Trey Brown, among many others.Is this the year Cunningham lands GM job?No matter how many open GM gigs there are this cycle, a name you are likely to hear is Chicago Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham.Cunningham had the job in Arizona three years ago but declined the offer. He has been a finalist with the Commanders and Jaguars since, with interviews elsewhere too.Cunningham has the pedigree for a GM gig. His father was a long-time sports agent and executive. He's a cousin of tennis and American sports legend Arthur Ashe. He played football at Virginia and had a cup of coffee with the Chiefs before turning to the personnel side of things. He grew up under Ozzie Newsome in Baltimore where he won one Super Bowl, then hopped to Philadelphia under Howie Roseman where he won another ring. And since 2022 he has been at the right hand of Ryan Poles rebuilding the Chicago Bears into the potential Super Bowl contender.So he's seen old- and new-school approaches to scouting and team building. He's been instrumental introducing new technologies and processes in Chicago. Cunningham has played, scouted colleges and pros, been part of a major draft trade, evaluated a No. 1 quarterback, been part of a head-coaching search, won Super Bowls and led turnarounds.Cunningham has checked just about every box you can for a potential first-time GM. We'll see if this is finally his year.Explaining Tennessee's front office announcement The Titans did more reorganizing this week when they made clearer the roles of Chad Brinker and Mike Borgonzi. The league office had a devil of a time determining if the Titans GM position was a true GM post last year, and there was instruction from the league to delineate titles a bit more. Borgonzi, as GM, will lead the search for the head coach as Brinker remains president of football operations. Owner Amy Adams Strunk has empowered Brinker to run football, and he hired Borgonzi just 12 months ago. It is logical to believe that the two men will see things similarly when it comes to choosing the next head coach.\n            ",

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings in December.

Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+.

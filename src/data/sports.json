    "body": "\n        The Super League project is now officially over. It took almost five years to see it end and this was made official this week when Real Madrid and UEFA (the European governing body) both announced an agreement on Wednesday, ending the possibility of seeing an alternative competition around Europe in the coming years.\"Following months of discussions conducted in the best interests of European football, UEFA, European Football Clubs (EFC), and Real Madrid CF announce that they have reached an agreement of principles for the well-being of European club football, respecting the principle of sporting merit with emphasis on long-term club sustainability and the enhancement of fan experience through the use of technology,\" the announcement said. \"This agreement of principles will also serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League, once such principles are executed and implemented.\"Here's a look back at what the Super League idea was, what it was supposed to look like and more:What was the Super League?The European Super League was a proposed breakaway soccer tournament announced in April 2021 by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs. It was designed to rival (and effectively replace, for its members) the UEFA Champions League, allowing the clubs more control. The founding clubs were:\nReal MadridBarcelonaAtletico MadridManchester UnitedManchester CityLiverpoolChelseaArsenalTottenhamJuventusAC MilanInterThe initial plan, which was received negatively by most of the fans around the world, was to create a closed competition, where the founding members would have permanent spots, and then there would be limited spots available for others based on the domestic league performances, but also threatening the value of the same leagues, something that was worrisome for many, especially smaller clubs. While most of the big clubs initially agreed on the project, some of the coaches and players of the teams linked immediately argued against the proposed project, supporting the backlash of the fans and other teams around Europe. In particular, PSG and Bayern Munich opposed the idea and didn't join the project while other presidents as    Real Madrid's Florentino Perez and former Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli were the leaders of the new project. Agnelli, who stepped down from his roles in 2023, was serving as president of the European Clubs Association (ECA) when he helped launch the Super League project. He resigned from the ECA shortly after the announcement was made.Why it didn't work out?After the initial fear among the fanbases and the clubs not involved, the situation got even more tense. The reaction from fans, players, coaches, and the media was overwhelmingly negative, and within 48 hours of the announcement, all six English clubs had withdrawn from the project, a clear victory for those against it with the intense backlash and the initiative's poor planning and organization taking a quick toll. Manchester City were the first club that announced its decision to back out, two days after the first official statement.\n\"Manchester City Football Club can confirm that it has formally enacted the procedures to withdraw from the group developing plans for a European Super League,\" the club announced. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was also one of the first big figures to speak up publicly about the project, and in typical fashion, he didn't hold back. \"I hope this Super League will never happen. With the way the Champions League is now running, football has a great product, even with the Europa League. For me, the Champions League is the Super League, in which you do not always end up playing against the same teams. Of course, it's economically important, but why should we create a system where Liverpool faces Real Madrid for 10 straight years? Who wants to see that every year?\" \nKlopp was followed by some players, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder posted a caption on his Instagram account that read \"Dreams can't be bought.\"Later, the Super League organizers, A22 Sports Management, a company formed to \"sponsor and assist\" in the creation of the European Super League, announced it would be exploring plans to relaunch the competition while the European Court of Justice ruled in December 2023 that a ban on the Super League could be in conflict with the European Union regulations.\nHowever, the public perception of the Super League, as it was announced, shaped its reputation and led Real Madrid, the last club involved, to forget about the chances of a new competition in the coming years. In February 2026, Barcelona also announced their decision to leave the project a few days before the latest announcement made by Real Madrid and UEFA, putting an end to any small amount of life the project may have had. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pac-12 Conference is back. Oregon State and Washington State will be joined by newcomers Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State, Texas State and Utah State in the eight-team league this fall.

However, Week 13 will feature a home-and-home flex matchup. Four teams (Colorado State, Fresno State, Utah State and Washington State) are set to have home games in Week 13.The Pac-12 will retain the right to adjust matchups based on the best interests of the league -- including College Football Playoff considerations. The Pac-12 Championship Game will take place at the home venue of the highest seed on Dec. 4 on CBS Sports and Paramount+.CBS Sports and the Pac-12 announced last summer an extension of their current agreement to make the network the league's primary long-term media rights partner. The deal runs through the 2030-31 season and will include the Pac-12 title game in football, airing live each season on CBS and Paramount+.After the Pac-12 was disbanded during the summer of 2024, the league rebuilt the \"Conference of Champions\" by adding five schools from the Mountain West.

    "body": "\n        Just when you think the NWSL preseason is settling ahead of the new calendar year, the big moves keep coming. Kansas City Current have acquired midfielder Croix Bethune from Washington Spirit, sources tell CBS Sports. Washington Spirit are set to receive a record-matching fee for Bethune. The deal is finalized though not set to be announced until a later date.North Carolina Courage currently holds the record for intraleague funds ($1.25 million) after trading Jaedyn Shaw to Gotham FC last year. Bethune is coming off a successful two-year stint with the Washington Spirit, where she won the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year. In her first pro season, she tied Tobin Heath's decade-old single-season assist record in just 17 games thanks to a season-ending torn meniscus. She also won the league's inaugural NWSL Midfielder of the Year award. Her impressive rookie season earned her a place on the 2024 Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. women's national team, and she's recorded seven caps so far.Sources also confirmed that the player requested the trade, and her former club worked to complete the deal. Bethune received interest from other teams, though now she'll be joining the league's reigning NWSL Shield winners. \nShe often showcases her vision with short, elegant passes and is a certified playmaker. Her move to Kansas City is a welcome arrival following the departure of recent playmaker and goal scorer Bia Zaneratto. The Brazilian international left the club after her contract expired and returned to Palmeiras in free agency.Bethune's rise to prominence was anything but easy. The player has had to bounce back from a torn meniscus that cut her NWSL rookie season short. In college, the player tore her ACL twice, but was drafted into the NWSL after earning two-time first-team All-American and Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year honors with a career that saw her start at Southern California and finish at Georgia. She's shown she can bounce back and contribute and now joins Kansas City after her recent camps with the U.S. women's national team and a short preseason stint with the Spirit. \nWashington Spirit make it officialFollowing CBS Sports' reporting that Bethune's movement came by way of request, the Spirit announced Bethune's departure on Wednesday. Bethune's move to Kansas City yielded a club-record $100k in allocation funds and $900k in transfer threshold funds, the third-largest return in NWSL history. \"We are grateful to Croix for her contributions over the past two seasons. After conversations about her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment, we were able to structure a deal that honored her request while securing significant value for our club, making it the third-highest intra-league transfer in NWSL history and a top ten mark globally,\" said club president of soccer operations Haley Carter. \"We evaluate every situation on its individual merits, and in this case, the alignment of player goals and organizational value made sense for all parties. That said, our focus is on the talented core we have returning. We're heading into 2026 healthy, deep, and ready to win.\"\nClaire Hutton moves on from Kansas City CurrentKansas City Current also traded midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC on Wednesday. The Midwest club received $1.1 million in intraleague transfer funds for the 2025 NWSL Best XI honoree, who is also a member of the USWNT. \"Claire is an important signing for us. She's a top-quality player who is tight on the ball, and she has the mobility and physical presence to break up play,\" said Bay FC head coach Emma Coates.\"Despite her age she brings experience and a strong mentality, and we believe she has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world. The most exciting part for us is her desire to keep getting better, and we're excited to support her through the next stages of her career and even more excited to see the impact she will have at Bay FC.\" \nThe 20-year-old Hutton was a 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year finalist and leaves Kansas City Current as a rising star in the NWSL and U.S. women's national team. Hutton signed her first professional contract in 2024 at 17 years old with Kansas City, the sixth player signed under the league's Under-18 Entry Mechanism, and she has since become a regular club starter with a bright future for her new club and her country.She has 13 appearances for the USWNT since her debut in 2025, and recently, head coach Emma Hayes discussed a leadership role with the midfielder, who is the youngest player to captain the national team in the Hayes era. When could they make official debuts?The Kansas City Current open up their season hosting the Utah Royals at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 14, while Bay FC host expansion side Denver Summit the same day with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

The Knicks are 9-2 over their last 11 games, which includes a 112-109 win at Philadelphia on Jan. 24. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games. The Knicks are 8-3 over the last three seasons against the 76ers, which doesn't even include a six-game victory over them in the playoffs two years ago. The model projects the Knicks to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Knicks to win at DraftKings here:Hawks (+164) to defeat the HornetsThere's no denying how well the Hornets have been playing lately, as their nine-game winning streak was snapped by the Pistons, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference, on Monday. However, despite a 26-29 record this season, the Hawks are 6-4 over their last 10 games and are currently playing some of their best basketball of the season. The Hawks travel to the Hornets, and ironically enough, both the Hawks and Hornets have better road records than home marks this season. Atlanta is 16-14 away, and Charlotte is 11-14 at home this season. The model projects the Hawks to win in 47% of simulations, compared to the implied odds of 37.9%, making this value too good to pass up on for Wednesday NBA bets. Back the Hawks to win at DraftKings here:Texas A&M (-6.5) vs. Missouri (-112)\"This feels like a good time to buy low on Texas A&M,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"The Aggies fought to the wire against Alabama, but that 100-97 loss appeared to take a lot out of them. A&M had no juice in the first half versus Florida, scoring just 19 points. They did wake up and score 48 in the second half, but it was too little, too late. This is a bad matchup for a Missouri team that struggles with turnovers and guarding the three-point line. I think Texas A&M rebounds from two straight losses with a big win at home here.\" Back Texas A&M to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        While he never played for the coach, former Steelers outside linebacker Joey Porter is going to bat for Mike Tomlin while taking aim at two former teammates who have been outspoken about Tomlin since he decided to step down as Pittsburgh's leader. Fellow former Steelers outside linebacker James Harrison has been extremely vocal in his criticism of Tomlin, going as far as to say he isn't a Hall of Fame-caliber coach. Former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hasn't been as extreme, but he did make headlines when he suggested late in the 2025 season that Tomlin should become Penn State's new coach. Roethlisberger has since said on his podcast that it was probably time for a change regarding the Steelers' coaching post. Porter, who also served on Pittsburgh's coaching staff from 2015-18, was largely diplomatic in terms of his comments regarding Harrison, but things got personal when he discussed Roethlisberger, his teammate from 2004-06. \"Seven definitely broke the brotherhood,\" Porter said on Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward's podcast. \"The shit that Seven did that we don't talk about is crazy. Out of anybody, he should never grab a microphone and really talk Steelers business, because if we're talking Steelers business, his ass is foul of all foul, like the shit that he did is foul of all foul. \n\"He's not a good teammate. Won a Super Bowl with him, but the person, he's just not a good teammate. Like he knows that, anybody in the Steeler building knows that, but we protected him, because I've only won one Super Bowl, and that was my quarterback. So do I love my quarterback? Yeah, but is he a good person? No.\" When asked why he felt Roethlisberger was a bad teammate, Porter mentioned that Roethlisberger did not sign autographs for teammates' family members during his rookie season. Porter, a team captain at the time, decided to have a meeting with Roethlisberger after he specifically declined to sign something for defensive end Aaron Smith. \"Who the hell is too cool to sign for your teammate?\" said Porter, alluding to former teammate and Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis and his constant willingness to do things for teammates and fans. \"I always looked at it like this. Look at the team when Joey was a captain, when Jerome was captain, when Hines Ward was a captain. You heard nothing in the locker room. \n\"Captains have to do captain shit, right? We voted to be captains; you had to be voted in. He came in an era where they just gave you a seat, because if he wasn't a captain, he'd probably have a hissy fit, but nobody's going to vote for him as captain because he don't have no captain qualities.\"Beyond his alleged locker room issues, Roethlisberger was suspended for four games in 2010 amid a violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy, as multiple women accused him of misconduct in 2008 and 2010. \"I got caught up being Big Ben the whole time,\" Roethlisberger said at the time. \"I lost track of who Ben Roethlisberger was. It's not something I'm proud of. \n\"Big Ben just kept building up. It ended up coming off the field. It kept taking over. Superman kept taking over Clark Kent and you just never saw who Ben Roethlisberger was anymore. At the time, I didn't see it. I was gaining everything, but I was losing a lot of who I was raised to be.\"Roethlisberger himself previously acknowledged that he wasn't always the best teammate. He did, however, maintain some close relationships during his early years in Pittsburgh with several teammates, specifically Bettis and former tight end Heath Miller, among others. In later years, he developed a close bond with center Maurkice Pouncey, who was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor this past year alongside Roethlisberger and Porter. In 2019, departing teammates Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown both questioned Roethlisberger's leadership or lack thereof. One of their criticisms of Roethlisberger was that he didn't spend enough time with them outside of the facility. \nRoethlisberger appeared to respond by hosting Pittsburgh's skill players at his lake house that offseason. He also pulled the plug on his local radio show, which often led to public criticisms of teammates, like Martavis Bryant in 2015 and fellow receiver James Washington in 2018. In later years, Roethlisberger publicly vouched for several teammates to get contract extensions, like running back James Conner prior to Conner becoming a free agent after the 2020 season. In 2021, his final season in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger agreed to a contract restructure that cleared $15 million, which helped Pittsburgh re-sign JuJu Smith-Schuster, one of Roethlisberger's favorite receivers. While he at least appeared to be a better teammate during his later seasons, Roethlisberger wasn't perfect. In 2018, for example, he loudly questioned the Steelers' decision to draft fellow quarterback Mason Rudolph, who supported Porter's comments on social media. He recently alluded to the Steelers giving him a \"center that had never played center before\" for his final season (he has since apologized to said center, Kendrick Green). \nRoethlisberger also hasn't been shy as it relates to how his career in Pittsburgh ended. While he ultimately chose to retire instead of playing elsewhere, he acknowledged that at least one of the Steelers' head decision-makers didn't want him back after the 2021 season. It appears that led to the harboring of some negative feelings, at least on Roethlisberger's side. As far as the criticism of Tomlin is concerned, Roethlisberger and Harrison have their own podcasts and have never been afraid to express their opinions. And while both are entitled to their stances, Porter doesn't feel that either is in a position to speak negatively of someone who did so much for their careers, his included. \"What makes it crazy for me to watch them two talk like that and really act like we don't have the real receipts of how this really works,\" Porter said. \"Like, you know what he just did for y'all? ... When they tell their stories, you'll think Mike didn't do shit for them. I don't know how to shit on somebody that looked out for me.\" \n            ",

In 31 starts and one relief appearance for Toronto, he pitched to a 3.96 ERA and a 4.01 FIP with 166 strikeouts in 170 ⅓ innings. For his career, Bassitt owns an ERA+ of 114 across parts of 11 big-league seasons. He's earned one All-Star selection and on three occasions finished in the top 10 in the Cy Young vote. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bassitt as the No. 34 available free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"You won't find many pitchers like Bassitt, who chucks his primary pitch (a sinker) more than 40% of the time and yet still manages to throw seven other offerings at least three out of every 100 tosses. (Those other eight pitches include a cutter, curve, four-seamer, sweeper, splitter, slider, and changeup.) Most of Bassitt's matériel grade out as average, give or take, but he's found success by mixing, matching, and locating. His durability (he's started 30-plus times four years running) and kitchen-sink approach make him a useful pitcher to have on hand during the regular season. It is telling, though, that the Blue Jays left him out of their postseason rotation.\"In Baltimore, Bassitt will join a remade rotation that also includes Shane Baz, who was acquired in trade from the Rays. The Orioles are hoping to rebound from a disappointing 2025 campaign in which they lost 87 games and finished last in the AL East. Last season, Baltimore ranked 24th in MLB in rotation ERA and 25th in rotation FIP. \n            \n    ",

They also conducted interviews with the parties involved and other witnesses.

Due to federal and university privacy laws and practices for students, the university will not be able to provide additional comment.\"Kingston finished the 2025 season as BYU's top pass catcher with 66 catches for 924 yards and five touchdowns. He announced Jan. 2 that he intended to return to BYU for his final college season. \nKingston's arrest comes less than a year after quarterback Jake Retzlaff was accused of sex assault in a civil lawsuit. The case was later dismissed, but Retzlaff left BYU because he was facing a seven-game suspension for violating the university's honor code. He later transferred to Tulane.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of blockbuster trades were announced between a trio of NWSL teams on Wednesday, the separate deals set to add new layers of intrigue to the 2026 season – and perhaps to the U.S. women's national team picture, too.Croix Bethune will join the Kansas City Current from the Washington Spirit in a package worth a total of $1 million, as first reported by CBS Sports, which marks a new chapter in the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year's career as she papers for her first full season after recovering from a meniscus tear. In a separate deal, Bay FC acquired USWNT midfielder Claire Hutton after sending $1.1 million the Current's way for her services. The pair are rising stars in the NWSL and have made their way inside the USWNT's player pool, each of them offering valuable skillsets to their new teams and providing signals of ambition as the start of the 2026 season nears. The moves, though, also add another layer of intrigue in a league that is defined in some ways by its busy offseasons.For both Bethune and Hutton, changing clubs at the start of 2026 will offer ample time to settle in before USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has to lock in roster decisions for November's Concacaf W Championship, the qualification tournament for next year's World Cup. There are a fascinating number of unknowns with each of these deals, though, especially as it pertains to the Current's abilities without Hutton.Here's analysis of the headline-grabbing moves, including an assessment of how well each party stacked up after the big trades.\nBay FCBay FC have yet to light the league up since joining as an expansion team in 2024 but in landing Hutton, they have given themselves a real opportunity to compete. The 20-year-old is easily one of the U.S.' rising stars, settling into the demands of being a professional seamlessly and positioning herself to be one of the game's top talents in her position for years to come. Just about every team in the world would benefit from Hutton's arrival and by acquiring her, Bay have demonstrated serious ambition ahead of head coach Emma Coates' first season in charge. Hutton will not solve all of their problems but she undoubtedly gives them the opportunity to go up a level, an opportunity they would be silly to waste. Grade: AKansas City CurrentBethune is more than capable of being a positive addition to the Current thanks to her attack-minded style of play and the sheer entertainment value she brings every time she's on the field. With nine goals and 15 assists in her two seasons as a professional, she will be a boon to a Current team that boasts plenty of attacking talent and should combine nicely with Temwa Chawinga once the Malawi international returns from a long-term hip adductor injury. Separate from Bethune's attributes, though, Hutton is a huge loss for the Current and how exactly the team fills that void is a big unknown as they chase silverware after a record-breaking regular season in 2025. Grade: B\nWashington SpiritBethune requested the trade in a move the Spirit's president of soccer operations, Haley Carter, described as one motivated by \"her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment.\" She will be missed by the Spirit but in exchange, Bethune's old team will have plenty of money to play with. Like the Current, they are chasing the NWSL Championship that continues to elude them, and the Spirit have a well-documented history of spending wisely. How exactly this money will get used is unclear – NWSL player salaries are not public information, so whether or not Trinity Rodman's new deal impacts their wage bill and plays even a small role in Bethune's move away is uncertain. Even if the funds from the Bethune trade go into the players they already have, though, it will go a long way in keeping a talented group of players happy and motivated ahead of an important campaign. Grade: A-\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NBA season past the halfway point, fantasy managers can no longer afford to wait for roles to sort themselves out. Trades, injuries and shifting team priorities have already reshaped rotations across the league, creating new opportunities for players stepping into expanded workloads. Identifying these changes before they fully register in box scores is often the difference between a playoff berth and an early exit. From young guards like Jaden Ivey and Nolan Traore to veterans such as Brook Lopez, here are several players whose evolving situations make them strong candidates to deliver meaningful fantasy value down the stretch.Jaden Ivey, BullsIvey began the season sidelined with injury trouble but managed to work his way into serviceable form through the last couple of months while he played out of a bench role for the Pistons. However, after being traded to the Bulls in early February, he has started in three straight games, averaging 12.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.7 steals over that span. He should continue to see notable playing time with his new squad and will likely continue to deliver good value as he builds up a rhythm. GG Jackson, GrizzliesSince the departure of Jaren Jackson via trade, GG has benefited by taking on a starting role and a boost in playing time. He is averaging 12.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks in 26.8 minutes per game over four straight starts. He is also shooting an impressive 53.3 percent from the field over that span, with 2.0 three-pointers made per outing. He should continue to handle an expanded role and is likely to increase, or at least maintain, his production as he gets more comfortable. While this is his third NBA season, he has not had too many consistent opportunities but has shown promise when offered the chance. Nique Clifford, KingsClifford has started in six of the last nine games, including the two most recent outings, as he is stepping up while his squad deals with injury trouble. Additionally, the fact that the Kings sit last place in the West with nearly zero chance of making a run at the playoffs suggests that the squad will continue to lean towards allowing more opportunity for their rookie to explore his game. Clifford is averaging 12.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.1 steals, with 1.8 made three-pointers per game over the aforementioned nine-game span. He also dropped a season-high 30 points in the game before last. \nNolan Traore, NetsTraore has started the last seven games and is averaging 11.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists, while shooting 48.4 percent from the field in 27.4 minutes per game over that span. With his squad sitting well out of a play-in spot and showing a clear focus on development, it is likely that the 19-year-old continues to see a substantial amount of playing time the rest of the way. He produced his first career double-double in his most recent outing and topped the 20-point mark twice in his last eight appearances. Gui Santos, WarriorsSantos has started in four straight and six of the last nine games, averaging 13.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks, while shooting a blistering 60.3 percent from the field over that span. Jimmy Butler going down with an injury for the rest of the season is a primary factor in there being more playing time to go around within the Warriors' lineup. So far, Santos has done a great job in identifying himself as a prime candidate to handle a bigger role down the stretch of the season.  Brook Lopez, ClippersIt is surprising to find an 18-year vet on this list, but Lopez is back in the driver's seat at the center position, as his new squad traded away their star center, Ivica Zubac. Despite his relatively advanced age, Lopez has shown that he is still up to the task of filling a key role, as he is averaging 8.0 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.5 blocks over four consecutive starts, while shooting 41.7 percent from long range over that span. His three-point shooting and shot-blocking have been the driving factors in his success for many years now. As long as he can continue to maintain production in those areas, he will likely hang on to the starting job. \nMoussa Diabate, HornetsDiabate began the season in a bench role but earned himself a promotion through his persistent hustle. He has started in 22 consecutive appearances, averaging 8.8 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 blocks over that span and is in line to remain the go-to option at center for his up-and-coming squad. It is noteworthy that he is facing a multi-game suspension for his part in an on-court scuffle in the Hornets' last game, but he will be back in action by February 24, and should pick up where he left off. Dylan Cardwell, KingsCardwell did a fantastic job in proving himself as a strong contributor while Domantas Sabonis was sidelined with injury trouble. Since then, Cardwell has continued to provide strong production off the bench and is averaging 6.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.8 blocks over the last 10 games. He is also up to three double-doubles on the season. The first-year big man should see plenty of opportunity the rest of the way and is more than likely to continue to thrive as a rebounder and shot-blocker. Jalen Smith, BullsSmith is in line for a significant boost after the Bulls parted ways with Nikola Vucevic. Unfortunately, he has missed four of the last six games due to injury trouble, but he has started in eight of his last nine appearances, averaging 13.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 0.8 steals per game over that span. Smith has shown flashes of great potential over the last couple of years but has not had the opportunity to fully spread his wings. However, it is likely that he gets that chance through the rest of this season, once returns to action. \nScoot Henderson, Trail BlazersHenderson made his season debut on February 6, and delivered 11 points, five rebounds, nine assists and one steal in just 21 minutes of action. He sat out the next game but followed up with 12 points, two rebounds, seven assists and a steal in the Trail Blazers' most recent outing. The third-year guard still has a way to go in order to meet the expectations of a top-three draft pick but early indications show that he is ready to provide a notable impact for his squad as they battle to maintain a shot at the playoffs this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Casey Wasserman will remain the chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee despite his appearance in the files on Jeffrey Epstein recently released by the United States government, the LA28 board's executive committee decided after meeting Wednesday.Wasserman, the founder of the major sports marketing and talent management company that bears his last name, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but documents released Jan. 30 by the Justice Department showed Wasserman exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003. Maxwell would later be accused of helping Epstein recruit, traffic and abuse his victims; she is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.The LA28 board said it took \"allegations of misconduct seriously\" and consulted an outside legal firm to help examine Wasserman's interactions with Maxwell, which included the two discussing real estate and massages.\"I think of you all the time,\" Wasserman said in one exchange. \"So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\nIn a statement from its board, LA28 said it \"found Mr. Wasserman's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.\"\"Twenty-three years ago, before Mr. Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes, Mr. Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation. This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell.\"The Executive Committee of the Board has determined that based on these facts, as well as the strong leadership he has exhibited over the past ten years, Mr. Wasserman should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games.\"One day after the Jan. 30 document release, Wasserman released his own statement.\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said. \"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"In the days since Wasserman's name appeared in the files, several high-profile clients, including Grammy Award-winning singer Chappell Roan and former U.S. women's soccer star Abby Wambach have left the Wasserman agency.\"I have left the Wasserman Agency,\" Wambach wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \"... Casey should resign. He should leave, so more people like me don't have to.\"\nThe Wasserman agency represents several stars across the sports world, including Klay Thompson and Evan Mobley of the NBA, Geno Smith, Maxx Crosby and Trey McBride of the NFL, Giancarlo Stanton and Yoshinobu Yamamoto of MLB and Brittney Griner, Paige Bueckers and Breanna Stewart of the WNBA, per Spotrac.Several Los Angeles politicians have called upon Wasserman to resign from his post with the Olympic committee, per the Los Angeles Times.\n            ",

In that post, Vonn said her injury -- a complex tibia fracture -- would require multiple surgeries to repair, and on Wednesday she offered another update following her third surgery with a photo from her hospital bed in Italy. \n\nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn continues to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. \nVonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. As she explained in her first post, she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Few voices in golf carry more weight than that of Rory McIlroy, so when he weighs in on whatever the latest hot topic among golf fans and pundits might be, folks tend to listen. As McIlroy arrived stateside for his first PGA Tour event of the 2026 season at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he was asked about the latest round of debate regarding The Players Championship and where it falls in the hierarchy of golf's biggest events. The Players has established itself as the premier event on the PGA Tour schedule outside of the major championships, leading some to believe it should be considered a \"major\" given its quality of field and the stiff challenge presented by the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy has long been a strong supporter of The Players as an elite event on the calendar -- even noting that he believes it has a better identity than the PGA Championship -- but he does not buy into the idea that it should be elevated alongside that tournament, the Masters, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\"The Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. From a player perspective, it's amazing. From an on-site fan experience, it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue. \"But I don't -- like again, I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them. But it's The Players; it doesn't need to be anything else. \"I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute. So, from an identity standpoint, The Players has got it nailed. ... I don't think it being classified a major or not a major makes it any more or any less [important]. I'm still very proud to have won that tournament twice, as I'm sure all the other champions are. It stands on its own without the label.\" McIlroy is a two-time winner at The Players, a five-time major champion, and as of last April, a career grand slam winner, so his perspective on the matter is valued.What McIlroy said about The Players having a stronger identity than the PGA Championship is from which much of the \"major\" debate stems. To that end, McIlroy suggested the PGA should flip back on the schedule, once again becoming the final major on the calendar.\"I think glory's last shot,\" said McIlroy when asked what identity the tournament should take. \"I think it needs to go back to August.\"The PGA Championship moved from August to May in 2019 with The Players moving from May to March. The PGA is often viewed as the fourth major, largely because it lacks the same unquestioned identity as the other three.\nThe Masters is staged at an iconic location each year at Augusta National Golf Club, kicking off the major season. The U.S. Open stakes its reputation on being golf's toughest test -- for better or worse -- and The Open is the oldest championship, one that shines a light on links golf. The PGA would push back on McIlroy's claim by stating its identity is being the \"strongest field in golf\" as it invites the top 100 players in the world without any amateurs competing. McIlroy believes it was better positioned as the last opportunity for players to capture a major championship each season. As for The Players, adding the \"major\" label could threaten what has made it such a beloved tournament. It stands out as the PGA Tour's flagship event, and it gets the early spotlight to itself in March. If it were to become a major, the Masters would likely insist The Players moves to May (PGA to August) to ensure the green jacket continues to be awarded first.\nThe Players nevertheless feels like a major, especially when it's at its best. It has a purse equivalent to one, too, without the added pressure. If it were to become a \"major,\" it would face similar challenges to the PGA, including the annual discourse about whether the event is worthy based on how exciting it plays.The truth is that The Players doesn't need the label to carry its own weight; in fact, not being attached to the majors works in its favor.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline has passed. The rosters, more or less, are set (we'll see what happens in the buyout market). The All-Star break is nearing, and after that we'll be into the stretch run of the regular season. These playoff races are tight beyond the top spot of each conference. So how do we see it shaking out? Factoring in remaining schedules, roster upgrades, recent play, tanking incentives, tiebreakers and everything else pertinent to positioning, let's take a shot at predicting the final standings in each conference with almost exactly two months to go. West playoff teams1. Oklahoma City Thunder2. San Antonio Spurs3. Denver Nuggets4. Minnesota Timberwolves5. Houston Rockets6. Los Angeles LakersOKC has a 3 ½-game lead over San Antonio. The Spurs in turn has a 3 ½-game lead over Houston. Those two seeds should hold. From No. 3 down it's a free-for-all. Nothing about the Nuggets' case on paper says they should end up at No. 3. Aaron Gordon is out perhaps until mid-March and they've been a break-even team without him. They have the hardest remaining schedule. They've lost four of six since Nikola Jokić's return. This last factor only tells me they're about to go on a run. That's how much I, and you, should, believe in the world's best player. Houston is the team that has the easiest remaining schedule on paper, but the Rockets are also the only team among the West's current top 11 teams that has double-digit losses against sub-.500 teams. They just haven't been consistent enough for me to trust them in games they should win, and I'm especially concerned now with the Steven Adams offensive rebounding advantage removed. \nMinnesota hasn't been great against plus-.500 teams so far and has the league's fourth-toughest remaining schedule, but I love the Ayo Dosunmu addition and I think Anthony Edwards, who has been awesome in the clutch this season, wins them enough tight games down the stretch to land a top-four seed. West play-in teams7. Phoenix Suns8. Golden State Warriors9. Portland Trail Blazers10. Los Angeles ClippersPhoenix is tied in the loss column with No. 6 Minnesota entering play on Wednesday and is just two games back of a top-four seed. The Suns have the league's fifth-toughest remaining schedule, which includes two more dates vs. OKC, San Antonio and Boston, and one more each against Denver and Houston. At the moment the Suns have a 2-1 advantage over the Lakers in head-to-head with one matchup remaining. If the Suns, who are currently just one game back of the Lakers, win that game on Feb. 26 and secure the tiebreaker, I will give Phoenix the edge for the No. 6 seed. But until then, the Lakers have a big chance to increase their lead to two over Phoenix and catch them in division wins (the next tiebreaker) with games against Sacramento and two more against Golden State remaining, and they have the same number of remaining games vs. tanking teams (11) as Phoenix. \nEven after the Harden and Ivica Zubac trades, I'll say the Clippers hold onto a play-in spot because they have every incentive to do so. They don't own their 2026 first-round pick. Darius Garland will likely come back. This remains a talented team.  West lottery teams11. Memphis Grizzlies12. Dallas Mavericks13. New Orleans Pelicans14. Utah Jazz15. Sacramento KingsThe Kings have a three-loss \"lead\" on the league's worst record. The Jazz are seasoned tankers and already putting on a fourth-quarter-concession clinic. New Orleans is the only team here with no reason to tank; the Pelicans don't own their 2026 pick. For that reason I think the Jazz do what it takes to fall below the Pelicans, but the Mavericks and Grizzlies have too much distance to cover with six- and eight-game advantages, respectively. \n        \n            \n                NBA Tank Watch: Ranking nine teams gunning for No. 1 pick after trade deadline\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEast playoff teams1. Detroit Pistons2. Cleveland Cavaliers3. New York Knicks4. Boston Celtics5. Philadelphia 76ers6. Orlando MagicNo team has more remaining games against tanking teams than the Cavs, who have added James Harden as a short-term upgrade over the injured Darius Garland and were finding their stride even before the trade. They are too far back to catch Detroit, but I like them jumping New York and Boston for the No. 2 seed and then we will see if Harden can shake his shaky playoff reputation. \nIn reality, 2-7 is a crapshoot in the East. Boston has been the most consistent team outside of Detroit, but I like the way the Knicks are playing of late (as long as Jose Alvarado can reasonably cover for the troubling loss of Deuce McBride for at least the remainder of the regular season) and Karl-Anthony Towns has to start making 3s at some point.Philly and Toronto are tied 2-2 in head-to-head, but right now Philadelphia has a four-game edge in Atlantic Division record, which would be the next tiebreaker. In a race this close, the tiebreaker matters. Paul George being out for 19 more games is a problem, but the Sixers have fared well enough without post-suspension.I really believe in Tyrese Maxey, and with the Raptors having the sixth-toughest remaining schedule and the Magic having 13 remaining games against taking teams, I'll say Orlando jumps Toronto for the No. 6 seed. East play-in teams7. Toronto Raptors8. Charlotte Hornets9. Miami Heat10. Atlanta HawksThe Hornets the best story in the NBA right now. They've won nine of their last 10 and took Detroit to the wire on Monday. The starting lineup rules. They're too far back of Orlando (five games in the loss column) to realistically catch the Magic or the Raptors, but they're only two back of No. 8 Miami. Plenty of time to catch the Heat and give themselves two play-in games to win one and secure a playoff spot. \nEast lottery teams11. Chicago Bulls12. Milwaukee Bucks13. Brooklyn Nets14. Washington Wizards15. Indiana PacersThe Bulls are one back of Charlotte and Atlanta so a play-in spot is right there. Losing Nikola Vučević hurts and all their point guards are an experiment for the future more than a win-now blueprint. Milwaukee is tied with Chicago in the loss column but is highly motivated to secure as a high a lottery pick as possible to try, however foolish it would probably be, to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo by dangling that pick in a trade. The Wizards traded for Anthony Davis and Trae Young, but do not expect to be seeing much of them as Washington has a top-eight protected pick it owes to the Knicks. Any team with a protected pick is going throttle down to make sure they keep it in a draft class like this one, but I'll still give the edge to Indiana to secure the East's worst record with a two-loss head start as of the writing. \n            ",

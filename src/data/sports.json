    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (2-6) host the Baltimore Ravens (2-5) on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 9 NFL schedule. Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 51.5. Lamar Jackson's over/under for total passing yards is 232.5, and his over/under for total rushing yards is 37.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 51.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams is well behind pace in the quest for a second consecutive 1,000-yard season. The former No. 12 overall pick broke out in style last season with by far the best year of his NFL career but has not found the same success in 2025, and offensive coordinator John Morton took the blame for that slow start to the campaign, saying that he \"failed\" Williams over the first seven games.Morton is in his first year as the Lions' play-caller, and with new roles often come learning curves with regard to personnel and tendencies. The new coordinator said he intends to work at getting Williams open more often and dialing up plays to unlock his capabilities as one of the Lions' top weapons.\"I'm going to do a better job with that,\" Morton said on Thursday. \"But there has been opportunities where it just didn't happen. It's not like we ain't going to try to target him. That was the biggest thing. So I looked at everything. I have failed him. That's what I have told him. I have to do a better job with that. But it's a two-way street. We definitely looked at that.\"Williams last season caught 58 passes for 1,001 yards and seven touchdowns, and he added another score in the playoffs. He was on an extreme upward trajectory under former offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and improved his numbers each of his first three years as a pro. Whether defenses are more dialed into his abilities or the coordinator change stunted his productivity, at the end of the day, he is a more modest part of the Lions' passing attack than anticipated.\nThrough seven games, Williams has just 17 grabs for 289 yards and two touchdowns, putting him on pace to finish the year with just over half of the production he logged a year ago.\"This guy, he's awesome,\" Morton said. \"He doesn't say anything. He just goes and plays. Like I said to him, 'I wouldn't fault you if you're pissed at me.' I've coached that position. I played that position. I know he works too hard. We gotta make sure that we're going out and doing the right thing, the right techniques, this and that. It's not just him. It's everybody.\"The rest of the Lions' receivers picked up some of the slack with Williams uncharacteristically quiet. The teams' 1,565 passing yards through seven games is almost identical to the 1,599 yards the offense racked up at this point a year ago. Amon-Ra St. Brown has been the primary target, as per usual, and leads the NFL with seven touchdowns. Tight end Sam LaPorta and running back Jahmyr Gibbs also have more catches than Williams.\n\"Especially on third down, they're doubling [Amon-Ra St. Brown], they're doubling him,\" Morton said. \"There's a lot of stuff that's going on. I have to be creative. I have to go in the archives and try to get these guys open better.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 calendar year has been one of experimentation and evaluation for the U.S. women's national team. Head coach Emma Hayes is utilizing the time towards the next tournament cycle in ways she wasn't afforded to in the build-up to the 2024 Olympic Games. With just one international window remaining this year, the expanded roster will get narrower with Concacaf World Cup qualifiers just 13 months away. The recent October window had plenty of opportunity for the program after splitting games against Portugal, a 2-1 loss followed by a 3-1 win, and a massive thumping of New Zealand 6-0 on Wednesday.  \"I think the last two games is another step. That's all it is. It's no more than that, but it's starting to look like the team that we are trying to create,\" Hayes said after the New Zealand win.  \"I think such big credit to the whole squad, because they're such a joy to coach. They're so appreciative of the learning, but they give so much to each other, and when I tell you it's such a joy to be around this environment, that's an understatement.\"\n2027 USWNT World Cup roster projectionAfter a three-match international window, there's plenty to consider moving forward. That's exactly the type of scenario Hayes wanted to be in at this point of the year. There's one more window at the beginning of December before the program pauses till 2026. Then it's full speed ahead towards the World Cup qualifiers in November for the Concacaf region. Here's my roster projection based on the recent form and major tournament experience from the Olympics:Goalkeepers (3): Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United), Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals)\nDefenders (7): Naomi Girma (Chelsea), Emily Fox (Arsenal), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Tierna Davidson (Gotham FC)Midfielders (6): Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (KC Current), Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit)Forwards (7): Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea), Catarina Macario (Chelsea), Ally Sentnor (KC Current), Sophia Wilson (Portland Thorns), Mal Swanson (Chicago Stars), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current)\nGoalkeepersOddly enough, the position that many thought would be a more methodical and lengthy process could now be considered one of the more predictable. Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey, and Mandy McGlynn have been mainstays among the goalkeepers' union during 2025.\"I think you can see the consistency of the selection in the three goalkeepers we've brought in. We're starting to get that. There's consistency in that. I think Phallon and her experiences in England have really taken her game up a notch, like I really notice she's playing with a player that has gone through the various levels. There was things she absolutely had to work on post Seattle, that I think she's gone to England and started to add,\" Hayes told media after the roster selection.Unlike other positions that can consider injuries or absences to key players, the spotlight on the major role came due to Alyssa Naeher's retirement. The two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist stepped away from international play last year but has played for club Chicago Stars ever since, though she's yet to make a decision on playing professionally at the moment. \n\"I've said this, like, a lot of times, if you think about when Alyssa Naeher became the U.S. national team number one goalkeeper, it takes a while. But I would also say within that, Phallon is one type of goalkeeper, Claudia [Dickey] is another type of goalkeeper, who I think is also bringing a consistent level of play. I think the difference between them is that one's more experienced than one has lived more experienced situations, not just Champions League, FA Cup finals, maybe various club moves,\" Hayes said.\"But I do think the pool that we are bringing in this camp, that we think that those three are ahead. I think Phallon is ahead at this moment in time, from an experience perspective, but I do expect that I will be providing opportunities for at least two of them in this camp.\"DefendersNext to the attacking core, there are plenty of what-ifs in the defender department. There are multiple defenders out with injury who were mainstays on the Olympic team, namely Tierna Davidson and Naomi Girma. There are also questions about the lack of minutes for Crystal Dunn (PSG) and Jenna Nighswonger (Arsenal) in Europe.\nBut we know that roster projections are make-believe and anything can change from now till next year, and it's hard to ignore what the newer defenders have been doing in and out of training camps. If there's anything else Hayes has come to value, it's player versatility, and Emily Sams' ability to play along the backline will keep her in favor. Washington Spirit defender Tara McKeown has become a national team starting-caliber centerback, and Houston Dash's Avery Patterson has immediately launched herself into the fullback conversation alongside Emily Fox, making things even more complex for others outside looking in. MidfieldersThe boost of youth and new faces to the pool this year has been with purpose, but that doesn't mean experience isn't necessary. The right balance will win games, and Hayes has been clear on needing both. It's why there's no doubt, for now, that Lindsey Heaps and Rose Lavelle will remain key figures among midfielders. \n\"That team has the least amount of caps of any team we put together in 25 years. So have to appreciate that Sonnett had 111 caps, I think last game, and the rest had 100. This time, Rose had 114 and the rest had 77 ... I mean, that's what we want. These players, we're developing real competition in our squad and the expectations have always been here for this team. We understand that. But, internally, the important things for us is that we get to be ourselves, and we get to play the way we want to play.\"Fresh off Olympic gold and clinching an NWSL Playoffs berth with Portland Thorns is Sam Coffey, who has rapidly ascended as a leadership figure among the rosters this year, and was vocal about the group's poor performance during the opening loss to Portugal before the group bounced back in game one. Teenagers Lily Yohannes and Claire Hutton have also received plenty of camp call-ups this year, and as Yohannes develops with OL Lyonnes and Hutton continues to shine with Kansas City Current, the duo will remain part of the midfield core. If Croix Bethune continues her success with the Washington Spirit, the 2024 gold medalist could be back in the mix during the final window of the calendar year or come January.\nOlivia Moultire has five appearances this year, with two starts, and she scored two goals against Portugal on Sunday, but I still think she's just on the fringes, along with Jaedyn Shaw. Both players have split time between U-23 camps and the senior team this year. AttackersThis group is quite possibly the largest core to be determined. There's no doubt that the rise of \"triple espresso\" with Trinity Rodman, Sophia Wilson, and Mallory Swanson during the Olympics was not only a return to the top of the podium but a culture shift. Catarina Macario was also an Olympic selection but removed herself from the roster with a lingering injury. Macario's October window was a success, functioning as a false nine at times, exhibiting hold-up play, and combining with Lavelle. She scored twice against New Zealand and is a player who was once recruited to Chelsea by Emma Hayes.\nRodman's return from a back injury was full of highlight goals and a long-time coming call back into national team camps. But the winger sustained a grade 1 MCL injury and missed the October window. Hayes and the Washington Spirit are hopeful she'll return to the club for the playoffs following an evaluation. Wilson and Swanson are currently on maternity leave, and if in good form closer to qualifiers next year, will absolutely be back in the mix.Under Hayes, there's been a common understanding that there are no more \"locks\" when it comes to roster selections. This was made evident by last year's Olympic roster omission of Alex Morgan. Hayes wants her decisions to be difficult, yet she also isn't shying away from making those types of headline-making choices. Still, if your young, star-studded, Olympic gold medal-winning, attacking line trio is healthy and available, you're selecting them.\nWho ultimately fleshes out the forward core will be of key interest. At this point, is there an actual fourth, fifth, and sixth-best option for attacking rotation? The answer is yes, but the talent is so good that it'll be a competitive coldron if \"triple espresso\" are in camps alongside Alyssa Thompson, Ally Sentnor, and Michelle Cooper. \"I remember watching her in the futures camp, my first impression of her that week -- which was so invaluable that futures camp we have in January is critical for not just their development, but to be seen by the national team staff. And if you think about the seven or so players that have made their way into the national team, she was one that stood out in that moment. If I'm honest, I'm not sure without that camp, I'm not sure she'd have got the look she has,\" Hayes said about Cooper's trajectory in 2025.\"But she's going from strength to strength. I remember talking with Tracy Kevins about what a leader she's been at youth national team level. And so I can see that she has taken everything in her stride. She wants to improve so much, and you can see the growth in her game again. She makes me belly laugh. Honestly, she's hilarious. She's such a joy, I think, for fans to watch, not just because she's explosive and gets into great areas, but she brings a great personality to her play.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays are one win away from winning the 2025 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays possess a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven series, putting them a victory away from claiming their first championship since repeating in 1992-93. The Dodgers, meanwhile, have no margin for error in their own pursuit of consecutive titles. It's to be determined if the World Series will conclude on Friday or Saturday, but this much is clear: the end is near. With that in mind, CBS Sports figured to use this time to sort out who is in the running for the World Series' Most Valuable Player honors.Truthfully, this is a tough World Series to elevate one player above all others. Only one of the games has been decided by fewer than four runs, and that was the 18-inning marathon that the Dodgers won in Game 3. Otherwise, there've been limited opportunities for narrative-stealing performances.Still, scroll with us as we sort through five realistic candidates through Game 5 to claim the hardware.1. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., 1B, Blue Jays\nGuerrero has a lot working in his favor. He's recorded at least one hit in all five games, and has notched multi-hit efforts in three of those. He's homered early in Games 4 (to give the Blue Jays a lead) and 5 (to pad their lead). Guerrero is also an easy choice from a narrative perspective, having started this year by putting pen to paper on a long-term extension rather than entering free agency this offseason. That last part won't show up in the stat sheet, but never doubt a writer's affection for easy copy -- especially as a tiebreaker in a field without a clear frontrunner. \n2. Trey Yesavage, RHP, Blue Jays\nRookies have won the World Series MVP trophy on three prior occasions: Jeremy Peña ('22), Livan Hernandez ('97), and Larry Sherry ('59). Yesavage made his case for becoming the fourth in Game 5, when he broke Don Newcombe's rookie reward for strikeouts by fanning 12 Dodgers. As impressive as that performance was, voters may hold a just-OK Game 1 start against him. Remember, Yesavage exited after surrendering two runs on four hits and three walks in four innings of work. For whatever it's worth: Yesavage has the second highest Championship Win Probability Added among Blue Jays, trailing only Eric Lauer, who worked several scoreless innings in that marathon Game 3 less.\n3. Addison Barger, RF, Blue Jays\nIf voters aren't taken by Guerrero or Yesavage, Barger has a decent candidacy to consider. He's notched multiple hits in four of the first five games of the set. That includes launching a grand slam that broke open Game 1 and either scoring or driving in a run in Games 3, 4, and 5. Barger also 1) recorded an assist in Game 3 and 2) was one of CBS Sports' postseason breakout picks. 4. Shohei Ohtani, TWP, Dodgers\nBobby Richardson (1960) is the only World Series MVP winner in history who played for the losing team. Ohtani probably won't become the second, but if he does it'll be on the strength of his incredible Game 3 performance that saw him record four extra-base hits (two home runs) and reach base a record nine times. Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw a complete game in Game 2, would also enter the equation if he has another brilliant outing as part of his Game 6 start.5. Alejandro Kirk, C, Blue Jays\nKirk has the third highest CWPA among Blue Jays hitters, having plated six runs on six hits, including a pair of home runs. His narrative case would be stronger if the Blue Jays had held on to the 3-2 lead he staked out with a three-run shot during the middle of Game 3. Otherwise, his biggest offensive contributions to this series haven't arrived during pivotal situations -- at least not yet.\n2025 World Series MVP oddsOdds via FanDuel as of Oct. 30Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: -195Shohei Ohtani: +250Yoshinobu Yamamoto: +1300Alejandro Kirk: +2200Addison Barger: +2700Trey Yesavage: +6500\n            ",

He did so in style with this explosive 35-yard run late in the third quarter.\nEvery eligible running back that has rushed for at least 12,000 yards has a gold jacket and bronze bust. The 31-year-old Henry is once again rubbing shoulders with some of the best running backs in NFL history, joining a list that includes Jim Brown, Walter Payton, Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith, among others. NFL's 12,000-yard rushers PlayerYards1.

He recently passed Payton for fifth all-time in touchdown runs (112). He is now one of just eight players in NFL history with at least 100 rushing touchdowns and 12,000 rushing yards. Last year, Henry's 1,921 rushing yards was the most ever for a player over the age of 30. It's also the most yards in league history for a player who did not win the rushing title. A Heisman Trophy winner at Alabama, Henry's other NFL accolades include consecutive rushing titles and becoming the ninth player in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. \nWhile it has been undervalued in recent years, Henry is proof that the running back position is still very much alive and well. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Prior to the 49ers' trip to New York in Week 9, Saleh had some high praise for Dart and the Giants front office, and he even had a little fun with Brian Daboll's injury tent saga.During his Thursday press conference, Saleh discussed what he's seen from Dart on film, and he gushed about the rookie signal-caller. He even went so far as to sympathize with Dabolls' decision to chase Dart into the injury tent a few weeks ago, which resulted in fines for the Giants and Daboll himself.\"He is uber-talented,\" Saleh said. \"I understand why Daboll went into the blue tent. I probably would've went too. The kid is good, man. I think New York hit on this one big-time.\"Saleh added that Daboll and Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka do a good job highlighting Dart's strengths.\n\"He's dynamic,\" Saleh said of Dart. \"He's decisive. He's accurate. He's been a joy to watch just studying his tape over the last five starts. They're doing a really good job with him. There's certain things they're asking of him, but they're doing a good job hiding it in their weekly game plans. ... This kid, he's gonna be special.\"New York traded back into the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft to select Dart at No. 25 overall, and that gamble has paid off so far. In his first five starts, Dart has completed 59.9% of his passes for 984 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. He's also showed off his mobility with 195 yards and four scores on the ground.\nGiven the state of the Giants' quarterback struggles since the Eli Manning era, hearing praise like that from one of the game's best defensive minds has to be music to the ears of New York fans. Now we'll see whether Dart can back up that praise from Saleh when the Giants and 49ers meet on Sunday afternoon.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After missing the past two games with a foot injury, Cardinals' Kyler Murray is preparing to start Monday night's game against the Cowboys, Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said on Thursday. Murray, 28, hasn't played since he injured his foot during Arizona's Week 5 loss to the Titans. That game was the third of three consecutive losses for the Cardinals, who started the year with consecutive wins over the Saints and Panthers. During Murray's absence, the Cardinals' offense was led by veteran Jacoby Brissett. While he put up decent numbers, Brissett lost both of his starts by four points to two of the NFL's best teams: the Indianapolis Colts and the Green Bay Packers. Murray's return should help revive the Cardinals' ground game, which hasn't recovered since losing former Pro Bowl running back James Conner to a season-ending injury in Week 3. Arizona has averaged 118.2 rushing yards with Murray this season and just 91 yards per game without him. Making Murray's return more significant is the fact that the Cowboys are one of the NFL's worst teams against the run. They are currently 29th in the league in rushing yards allowed, 25th in average yards-per-carry allowed and 23rd in touchdown runs permitted. \nThe Cardinals' quarterback change could also lead to more targets for second-year wideout Marvin Harrison Jr., who was targeted just eight games during the Cardinals' last two games after getting 32 targets during Murray's five games under center. \nWhile there are clear upsides to Murray's likely return, one significant downside are the turnovers that sometimes occur with Murray as a result of him either holding the ball too long or trying a low-percentage pass that ends up in the hands of the other team. Murray had two picks during Arizona's Week 4 loss to Seattle and a fumble during the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Titans. Murray aside, Monday is a huge game for two teams who are looking to stay alive in the NFC playoff picture. The Cardinals (2-5) haven't won since Week 2, while the Cowboys (3-4-1) are trying to get back to .500 following last week's blowout loss in Denver.\nAs for intangibles, Murray is 2-2 on Monday night, but he's never lost a game as a starter at AT&T Stadium. His lifetime mark of 9-0 stretches back to his high school days. His last game there -- on Oct. 19, 2020 -- was a 38-10 Cardinals' victory, which happens to be the lone blemish on Dak Prescott's \"Monday Night Football\" record of 5-1.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The way Jonathan Kuminga has been playing, you would never know that his future with the Golden State Warriors was ever in jeopardy. The way Kuminga has been playing, you'd never guess he was a divisive player inside and outside the organization. You'd have no idea that he was benched at the beginning of last year's postseason, nor that he and the front office were in a monthslong standoff this summer during contract extension negotiations that became unusually public.Five games into the 2025-26 season, Kuminga has been everything the Warriors wanted him to be. In a 131-118 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday, he put up 25 points on 9-for-14 shooting, 10 rebounds, four assists and a block in 32 minutes. In a 98-79 win against the Los Angeles Clippers the next night, he played only 26 minutes and finished with nine points on 4-for-11 shooting, five rebounds and one assist ... but look at that one assist!And look at what he said to The San Francisco Standard's Tim Kawakami afterward.\"I wouldn't want to be the problem to mess it up,\" Kuminga told me in the locker room after Tuesday's victory over the Clippers. \"I'm growing. I'm in my fifth year now. I know what winning means. And I know what I want to get — winning a championship.\"There is no bad blood or anything like that. I don't think there was ever bad blood. It's just all the narrative, all the talking around outside. But we're good. We're good.\"This is not the first time that Kuminga has had a strong stretch of games in Golden State. It's not the first time, either, that he and coach Steve Kerr have appeared to be on the same page. In March 2024, Kuminga was so pleased with how things were going that he said he wanted to be a \"Warrior for life.\" The difference is that, now, he's both saying the right things and consistently doing the right things on the court. Until this season, the argument for sticking with Kuminga -- and, for a brief stretch last season, starting him over Draymond Green -- was that, while he wasn't a clean fit, he had too much talent and upside to sit or trade him (and nobody else was putting pressure on the rim or getting to the free throw line). Now, the talent and upside are still obvious, but he's fitting in just fine. Kerr has grown comfortable starting him next to Green and Jimmy Butler, and Kuminga is helping the team even when he's not scoring.\n\"I'm not going out there trying to do much,\" Kuminga told the San Francisco Standard. \"There is nights where they're going to want me to do more and do what I can do. But there's nights like today, just go out there and do what you've gotta do, no matter what's going on, and stay positive and move on.\"This is not to say that Kuminga has made zero mistakes. In the Clippers game, he threw the ball away twice in less than a minute. He's not taking long 2s, though, and, when he doesn't have an open shot or a driving lane, he's moving the ball quickly. Golden State needed him to improve as a decision-maker, and, on the other end, it needed him to pester opposing stars. He has done both of these things, and, in doing so, he has shown that he can be more than just a trade piece.All Kuminga has to do is keep this up, and it sounds like he's determined to do that. \"I'm not sitting here thinking that I'm going to keep those minutes,\" Kuminga told the San Francisco Standard. \"I've gotta go out there and earn those minutes.\" He also said he has told Kerr that, if it's not his night, he \"won't get mad\" and will \"do stuff that will help us win.\"\nIt might sound silly to celebrate a player for making simple passes and deferring to future Hall of Famers. In this case, though, that's the important stuff. The Warriors already knew Kuminga could score 30-plus when given the opportunity. What he needed to prove was that he could score nine points and still have a good game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We spend much of our time in this space looking to identify point spread trends either before they exhaust, or early enough to take advantage of pending streaks. Yet there are so many angles to the weekly point spread puzzle that sometimes it makes sense to look beyond the current streaks to identify trends and patterns.Late spread covers perhaps shouldn't be regarded as flukes; rather, an identifiable pattern. This brings us to Jonathan Smith's Michigan State team, which, despite what looks like another completely unremarkable season in East Lansing, has nonetheless managed unlikely spread wins in four of its last five games ... each of those four through the proverbial \"back door.\" Knowingly or unknowingly, Smith's decision to kick what seemed like a meaningless last-minute 34-yard field goal by Martin Covington two weeks ago at Indiana with 33 seconds left cut the final margin to 25 points and inside of the 26.5-point spread. Last week against Michigan, backup QB Alessio Milivojevic fired a 21-yard TD pass to Michael Masunas with seven seconds left to cut the final margin to 31-20 ... and inside the 13.5-point spread. At Nebraska on Oct. 4, it was Milivojevic again leading a belated 75-yard TD drive that ended with his short sneak for a TD to cut the final margin to 38-27 ... inside the 12.5-point spread. In the preceding game two weeks earlier at USC, it was first-stringer Aidan Chiles firing up a 75-yard TD to Omari Smith with 2:39 left to get the Spartans to within 45-31 ... and inside the 18.5-point spread.Will the Spartans come in the back door again this week at Minnesota? We're not sure, especially since there isn't a double-digit cushion involved. What we won't do, however, is dismiss the Spartans just because they have managed some late spread covers.  For this team, playing the full 60 minutes and getting a late TD or field goal regardless of the score might simply be part of its makeup.As we have throughout October, we note the weekly \"point spread reversal\" listing, wherein we identify teams off a spread result, win or lose, different from at least its two preceding spread results.  Again, this is another potential indicator of teams perhaps ready for a turnaround ... good or bad.Bet college football at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Point spread reversal plus (+)The teams: Akron, Boston College, Jacksonville State, James Madison, Missouri State, Northern Illinois, Ole Miss, Oregon State, Penn State, Rice, Rutgers, South Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, Tulsa, UAB, UTEP, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin*Through games of Oct. 25.  As the season progresses, the challenge with the above listing is to differentiate which teams might have just managed a random spread cover with no real indicator of a pending advance, or perhaps the start of late-season rush into November. For the former? We're reluctant to consider it a buy signal for a team like Oregon State, which hadn't managed a spread cover prior and only got one of those thanks to FCS Lafayette appearing on the October schedule. We might pay more attention to a team like South Alabama, as Major Applewhite's Jags have been competitive all season and might have finally turned a corner in the OT win at Georgia State. We also admit to being impressed by recent Big Ten efforts from Penn State and Wisconsin, both among the major disappointments of the first half of the season but each displaying a sharper edge in recent games. Point spread reversal minus (-)The teams: Arkansas, Clemson, Colorado, Duke, New Mexico State,  SMU, South Florida, Temple, UConn, Western Michigan*Through games of Oct. 25.It's a thinner list for the above grouping this week. We can say off the bat we don't foresee Clemson at the beginning of another downturn as the recent loss to SMU was largely due to the absence of QB Cade Klubnik. There was a big drop off to backup Christopher Vizzina in the SMU game and while there's no official word yet, sources say there's a good chance Klubnik's ankle has healed enough for him to start Saturday's game at Duke. We're also watching Arkansas and interim HC Bobby Petrino, and we wonder where the Hogs go in November after kicking away a late lead against Auburn, a third straight loss since Sam Pittman walked the plank, with distractions and portal decisions mounting. Colorado might also bear watching, as the 53-7 loss at Utah might have been the worst effort of the Deion Sanders regime and regional observers are wondering if the earlier momentum from his tenure is lost.Point spread win streaks5: Miami-Ohio, Notre Dame, San Diego State, Troy4: Hawaii, Kansas State, Kennesaw State, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Wake Forest, Washington State, Maryland and Southern Miss (3-0-1 last four)3: Arkansas State, BYU,  Georgia, Georgia Tech, Houston, Wyoming2: Boise State, Central Michigan, Cincinnati, Coastal Carolina, Marshall, Michigan State, Middle Tennessee, Mississippi State, North Carolina, North Texas, Ohio State, UCF, Vanderbilt*Through games of Oct. 25.As always, we hope we're not too late with some of those above. In Notre Dame's case, it's continued point spread excellence that has been a trademark of Marcus Freeman's time in South Bend.We noted Miami-Ohio as a \"shade\" team last week as HC Chuck Martin looks in the midst of one of his patented late-season surges for the RedHawks. We also keep an eye on both Jake Dickert's new team (Wake Forest) and his former team (Washington State), both of which have proven substantial surprise packages this season. Further down the list, Bill Belichick's North Carolina squad still isn't winning outright, but efforts the past two games (and resultant spread covers at Cal and home vs. Virginia) have been much improved from earlier in the season.Point spread losing streaks6: Baylor5: Nebraska, Texas State 4: Buffalo, Florida State, Fresno State, Navy, Oklahoma State, ULM3: California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia State, Iowa State, La Tech, Liberty, LSU, Old Dominion2: Arizona, Bowling Green, Charlotte, Kansas, Illinois, Liberty, NC State, Purdue, San Jose State, Texas, Syracuse, UL-Lafayette  *Through games of Oct. 25.For the moment, Baylor has overtaken Penn State and some other early-season underachievers as the worse spread team in the country. We admit to some surprise at continuing to see Navy's name included in the list above -- the Midshipmen haven't covered a game since Sept. 13 at Tulsa but they haven't yet lost a game outright either.  We always keep an eye on early stages of a slump for teams that had higher hopes this season now all but dashed. Even though the Jayhawks are likely bowl-bound after missing out on the postseason a year ago, Kansas was thought to have a puncher's chance in the Big 12 race, but instead the defense has leaked profusely in four losses to relegate the Jayhawks to minor bowl consideration at best.  Similarly, Illinois was fancied by some to be a fringe CFP contender this season, but after dropping a third game of the campaign last weekend in a subpar effort at Washington, the Fighting Illini look instead bound for another minor bowl.Away from spread plus (+) past two decisionsKennesaw State +25.00San Diego State +23.00Marshall +21.25Kansas State +21.00Washington State +18.75 Coastal Carolina +18.25North Texas +18.25Central Michigan +17.50 Western Michigan +13.50Hawaii +13.25James Madison +13.25,UCF +13.25 Wake Forest +13.25Texas A&M +13.00Cincinnati +12.75Utah +12.75Wyoming +12.25BYU +11.50 Iowa +11.25 Southern Miss +11.25 Indiana +11.00Stanford +9.75Troy +9.50Pitt +9.25Temple +9.25North Carolina +8.75 Houston +8.25Northwestern +8.00Boise State +7.50Arkansas State +7.25UAB +7.00*Through games of Oct. 25We see various under-the-radar teams sneaking into the two-week \"AFS\" chart each week, and this edition is no different. A lot of 'cappers might have lost the scent on nondescript Sun Belt entries such as Marshall and Coastal Carolina earlier in the season, but suddenly the Thundering Herd and Chantacleers are among the biggest spread overachievers in recent weeks. Similarly, San Diego State and Washington State continue to show up within the \"plus\" list on a weekly basis. We might also take note of Kirk Ferentz and his Iowa side that might be getting lost in the Big Ten hoopla with all of the attention being paid to Indiana and Ohio State, but the Hawkeyes have another roughhouse unit and are capable of pounding some of the loop's also-rans into submission, as was the case last weekend when claiming Floyd of Rosedale yet again over Minnesota.Away from spread minus (-) past two decisionsFresno State -27.00Old Dominion -22.50Florida State -19.25Bowling Green -19.00 Colorado State -16.25ULM -15.75Buffalo -14.50 Rutgers -14.25 Charlotte -13.50Iowa State -13.50LSU -13.50Nebraska -13.00Virginia -12.50UCLA -12.00Delaware -11.0,0Rice -11.00Western Kentucky -11.00Colorado -10.75Memphis -10.75 Texas State -10.75Troy +9.75NC State -9.50Baylor -9.25Liberty -8.00Purdue -8.00Utah State -8.00Florida -8.75Illinois -7.75West Virginia -7.75*Through games of Oct. 25.Keep in mind one big scoreline is always apt to distort a two-week average; take Rutgers, destroyed two weeks ago by Oregon 56-10 before recovering to beat Purdue. Others, however, might represent a developing pattern, such as with Eddie George's Bowling Green, which after some encouraging efforts in the first month of the season and some enduring fanfare with its new mascot cat Pudge, looks to be losing altitude fast. We also think it illuminating, to a degree, that Virginia shows up on the above list despite moving into the rankings with only one loss this season. The Cavaliers, however, have won three games in overtime and their chops as a margin team look quite shaky after barely surviving outright as a significant favorite against Washington State and North Carolina the past two weeks. At the least, the Cavs might not be a team trusted to carry a big number. Shade/Fade alert this weekColorado StateSometimes, we'd just like to call timeout on everything about CSU football, which has long had notions of itself as a big-time program. We have our doubts about a team that, among other things, has three completely different shades of uniforms. Fashion aside, CSU has long considered itself too big for the Mountain West while not really doing much on the field to suggest as much, and it quickly jumped at the offer to join the reconfigured Pac-12 next season. The Rams will not be doing so with much momentum, having just hit the eject button on HC Jay Norvell while hardly rallying for interim Tyson Summers in his debut last week against Wyoming in a 28-0 loss at Laramie. Coming into the season, many Mountain West observers believed QB Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi might be overrated and weren't surprised he was benched in September, but backup Jackson Brousseau hardly seemed a better option. Now, CSU might be ready to turn to pint-sized freshman Darius Curry, but only because there don't seem to be many more alternatives. The offense has been in shambles all season, ranking 113th overall and 119th in scoring (19.1 PPG), and a late-season rally with the roster and staff alike looking at escape routes out of Fort Collins all suggest the next month might not get any better. Next game: Nov. 8 vs. UNLVLean: FadeFresno StateA quick look at the Mountain West standings and you might wonder why we have our doubts about the Bulldogs. After all, they're sitting at 5-3 and are just one win from bowl eligibility.  The last two efforts, however, have been particularly unsightly, a thumping loss to a bad Colorado State team and a listless shutout loss against San Diego State last week. Some cracks are appearing in the foundation, perhaps, for first-year HC Matt Entz, hired off Lincoln Riley's USC staff after some real success as head coach at North Dakota State, including FCS titles in 2019 and 2021. Yet many in the Central Valley, and reportedly many Bulldog players, were hoping that last year's interim, Tim Skipper, would instead get the job on a full-time basis.On the field, Fresno State seems to be unraveling, too, with Entz benching much-traveled and error-prone QB EJ Warner last week against the Aztecs, only to see the offense get blanked behind Sacramento State transfer QB Carson Conklin. The recent trends are cause for concern in Fresno. Next game: Saturday at Boise StateLean: FadeSan Diego StateSometimes, the worst thing to do might be to watch a team play a particularly bad game. Take the Aztecs, who looked mostly awful in a 36-13 loss at Washington State back on Sept. 6, suggesting it might be more of the same for second-year HC Sean Lewis after an especially bumpy ride in his first season a year ago on Montezuma Mesa.It didn't take long, however, for SDSU to forge a turnaround behind what has been one of the nation's most-dominant defenses, harkening to some of the bests top units from the decorated Rocky Long era for the Aztecs. SDSU hasn't lost or failed to cover a spread in five since the debacle in Pullman, and now counts three shutouts to its credit just past midseason. National defense stats show the Aztecs in some rarified air, ninth overall (just 255 YPG allowed) and second in scoring (10.4 PPG, behind only mighty Ohio State). The offense isn't quite a smooth-running machine, but Michigan transfer QB Jayden Denegal has proven a modest upgrade at a position. At 3-0 in the Mountain West, SDSU's win margin in league games is a whopping 26 PPG. Could this be a sleeper team to sneak into the Group of Five at-large spot in the CFP?  Next game: Saturday vs. WyomingLean: ShadeSouthern MissWe're talking about Golden Eagles HC Charles Huff, who steered Marshall to an unexpected Sun Belt title a year ago as well as a 10-1-1 spread record. We'd have thought Herd administrators would have done everything they could to keep Huff in Huntington, but after they dragged their feet on a contract extension after Marshall's win in the Belt title game last December, Huff decided to take the offer (and a reported $200K annual raise) to move to Hattiesburg, where the USM program had fallen into disrepair while Marshall was left without much of a team or coach for its Independence Bowl date against Army, which the Herd eventually had to pull out. Disrepair doesn't need to last long in these days of the portal in college football, however, and Huff, who had worked the transfer market well at Huntington, brought more than 20 Herd players with him to USM, including QB Braylon Braxton. After four TD passes in last week's 49-21 romp past ULM, Braxton's 1.5-year stat line at Marshall and USM now includes 37 TD passes to just six picks.Even in two prior losses to SEC Mississippi State and likely bowl-bound La Tech, Huff's rebuilt Golden Eagles didn't play badly, and now they're on a roll, leading their half (the West) of the Belt along with surprising Troy, and are on a four-game unbeaten run (3-0-1 vs. the spread). It's looking a lot like Huff's Marshall from last season. Next game: Nov. 8 at Arkansas State  Lean: ShadeWashington StateAs noted earlier with the Aztecs, there is always a danger to watching a team play a particularly bad game, or two. Take the Cougars, who in back-to-back weeks in September allowed 59 points each to North Texas and then old rival UW in the Apple Cup. Who could blame anyone for dismissing WSU after those efforts?  The Cougs have looked a different team since, reeling off four spread wins on the spin.  Granted, skeptics remain, claiming the schedule worked against recent foes Ole Miss and Virginia, each in the rankings and in the midst of heated conference races. A non-conference game against WSU, stuck in the middle of the league slate, looked a likely flat spot. Yet both the Rebs and Cavs were lucky to escape with their lives against WSU, with the Ole Miss insiders in particular impressed by the Cougs' speed and execution, which had them on the verge of a huge upset. Virginia might have been more fortunate to escape, trailing almost the whole way and needing a late safety to win.Last week, MAC contender Toledo was taken apart in the Palouse. Schedule breaks? Perhaps. But under first-year HC Jimmy Rogers, who's coming off of a successful run at Big Sky South Dakota State, the Cougs can argue they're the most balanced team in the country while QB Zevi Eckhaus, who impressed in his first real action in the Holiday Bowl against Syracuse last December, has emerged as a capable dual-threat pilot for the offense. Next game: Saturday at Oregon StateLean: Shade\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Late on Tuesday night, after he had led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 121-111 victory over the New York Knicks, and brushed off more questions about trade rumors, Giannis Antetokounmpo said it was \"too early to give compliments\" about the team's new starting point guard, Ryan Rollins. Antetokounmpo then launched into a detailed explanation of Rollins' importance to the team, and the work he's put in to improve on both sides of the ball, which lasted nearly three minutes.\"He's been playing incredible,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Defensively, he's one of the most annoying guards, probably, in the league. He's making the right reads. He's able to play with me, come off the bench, pretty much does everything. I love playing with him. He's been playing incredible with the team.\"Rollins was a second-round pick back in 2022, and has bounced around the league since then, in part due to his own off-court mistakes. (In Jan. 2024, Rollins was arrested and accused of shoplifting from Target. He later plead guilty to one count of petit larceny.) He appears to have found a home with the Bucks, however, and may be the answer to their backcourt questions.\nAfter Damian Lillard tore his Achilles in the playoffs, the team waived him and stretched his contract, which freed up the cap space to sign Myles Turner. While Turner's arrival helped shore up the Bucks' frontcourt, swapping an All-Star guard for a center left the Bucks' backcourt as thin as it has been since the team became a contender back in 2019. In the summer, general manager Jon Horst decided to take a by-committee approach and re-signed Rollins, Kevin Porter Jr. and Gary Trent Jr., signed Cole Anthony and gave AJ Green an extension. All are solid rotation players, but one of the big questions about the Bucks this season was whether any of them could take another step. The answer will not only help determine how far the team can go in the Eastern Conference, but whether Antetokounmpo sticks around beyond this season. The early signs suggest Rollins may be the one to make a leap. Porter rolled his ankle in the Bucks' season-opening win over the Washington Wizards, and hasn't played since. Rollins replaced him in the starting lineup, and it may be difficult to send him back to the bench once Porter is healthy. \nThrough four games, Rollins is averaging 15.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and three steals per game -- tied for first in the league -- on 47.6/35/100 shooting splits. Against the Knicks, he poured in a career-high 25 points to go along with four assists and four steals to help the Bucks improve to 3-1. Thus far, the Bucks are 8.2 points per 100 possessions better with Rollins on the floor than when he sits. His on-off splits with Antetokounmpo are particularly interesting.The Bucks have been awesome with Antetokounmpo and Rollins on the floor together \n                                                                    PBPStats.com\n                                                            When Antetokounmpo called Rollins one of the \"most annoying guards\" in the league, he wasn't lying. Rollins is tied for first in the league in steals per game (three) and third in deflections (5.5). He is willing and able to pick up opposing ball-handlers fullcourt, and if they aren't ready for that pressure, it's going to be a long night. Even when he isn't getting steals or deflections, his pressure disrupts what other teams are trying to do -- either by forcing them to run extra shot clock or have a secondary ball-handler bring up the ball.\nWatch this possession against the Knicks. He picks Brunson up 90 feet from the basket, makes him turn his back and give the ball up, presses Brunson when he gets the ball back, creates a deflection with high hands, stays attached to Brunson as he takes a tough pull-up, then jumps into the passing lane for a steal as the Knicks tried to save the offensive rebound. \nPerhaps it's no surprise that Rajon Rondo, who is working as a coaching associate with the Bucks on a part-time basis, has become a mentor for Rollins. \"Once I fouled out [in the preseason game] I knew my capabilities defensively,\" Rollins said Tuesday. \"I knew that I could stay in front of these guys and make it tough for them. So I'm not surprised at what I can do, it's just learning and being better at it.\"Here's 90 seconds of Rollins being annoying on defense:\nRollins can guard, and the Bucks want him to focus his efforts on that side of the ball. \"If I had my druthers, I'd want him to keep his defensive intensity, that's more important than anything,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. But as long as Porter remains out -- and perhaps even beyond that point, depending on how the rest of the backcourt is performing -- the Bucks will need Rollins to contribute on both ends. \nRollins' pick-and-roll playmaking has been solid, but not spectacular. On his 53 pick-and-roll possessions, including shots and passes, the Bucks are scoring 1.132 points per possession, which ranks in the 76th percentile in the league, per Synergy Sports. He's shooting 35% from 3-point range, but was 3 of 16 in his first three games before going 4 of 4 against the Knicks. Rollins' 3-point shooting will be a key stat to watch. He shot 40.8% last season on 2.1 attempts per game, but did not have a meaningful amount of attempts in the NBA before that. In his two years at Toledo in college, he shot 88 of 278 from behind the arc (31.7%). Playing alongside Antetokounmpo, there will be 3-point opportunities for Rollins. Antetokounmpo was only half-joking when he said it was \"too early to give compliments\" to Rollins. Consistency is major separator in the NBA. Can Rollins keep up this level of play over the course of a full season? If he can, the Bucks will be better than everyone expected prior to the season. \n\"I know my capabilities. I've been saying that for a while now. I just needed the opportunity and the platform to be able to go out there and play through mistakes and play my game,\" Rollins said. \"I feel like I'm doing that now. [But there's] a lot more to do, so [I have to] keep growing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The beauty of college basketball is that it has something for everyone. Fan of the underdog? The NCAA Tournament is your time to shine. Think this could be the year your school goes to the Final Four? It's always a possibility. Are you a fan of a bad NBA team that hopes your franchise gets lucky in the lottery this spring? The 2026 NBA Draft class has some potential franchise-changing players worth tanking for.Even if none of those storylines are up your alley, there's always a reason to watch. If you're a fan of nostalgia, there are several notable names worth keeping an eye on during the 2025-26 season. Look no further than Syracuse's roster, which will feature the son of one of -- if not the most notable -- names in program history: Kiyan Anthony.The son of former NBA superstar Carmelo Anthony, will be suiting up for Syracuse. Anthony, a former top-35 recruit from the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, will have big shoes to fill at his father's alma mater.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: The Top 100 and 1 Players entering the 2025-26 season\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd in Tucson, Arizona, there will be another familiar son of an NBA player on the roster: Bryce James. The youngest son of LeBron James will be the second member of his family to play college basketball. Bronny James, a former second-round pick and a current teammate of his father's on the Lakers, played for USC during the 2023-24 campaign. Bryce is part of a loaded incoming recruiting class that Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd has assembled.\nThe twin brother of CBS Sports' reigning National Player of the Year will also suit up this season. Ace Flagg, a three-star recruit by 247Sports in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, will play for Maine this season. Here are other notable names to keep an eye on this season.\n    \n                                        \n    Bryce James, ArizonaBasketball bloodline: Son of LeBron James, brother of Bronny JamesHaving the son of the NBA's all-time leading scorer will certainly draw attention. James will be the second member of his family to play college basketball, as his older brother, Bronny James, was a key contributor for USC during the 2023-24 campaign.James is joining a loaded roster at Arizona that is expected to compete for the Big 12 title. James was the fourth-highest-ranked commit in Arizona's 2025 recruiting class, per 247Sports, and will likely either come off the bench or not be in the rotation to at least start the season.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Ace Flagg, MaineBasketball bloodline: Twin brother of Cooper FlaggOnce upon a time, Flagg was part of the same high school recruiting class as his twin brother. Cooper, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, reclassified to become eligible to play college basketball one year earlier.As for Ace, he will be suiting up for his home state's team, as he is a native of Newport, Maine. Duke played Maine in its season-opener last year, which gave Cooper a chance to play against a familiar opponent. Now, his brother will be playing for that team.\n    \n                                        \n    Kiyan Anthony, SyracuseBasketball bloodline: Son of Carmelo AnthonyAs a freshman, Carmelo helped Syracuse win a national title. It's still to this day one of the best one-and-done seasons in college basketball history. The Orange face an uphill climb to match that this season, but there is still hope that the younger Anthony can help get the program back on track.\nSyracuse has missed the NCAA Tournament in four consecutive seasons. Anthony is part of a recruiting class that finished No. 20 in the 247Sports team rankings.\n    \n                                        \n    Cameron and Cayden Boozer, DukeBasketball bloodline: Sons of Carlos BoozerThe Boozer brothers were a huge recruiting win for Duke coach Jon Scheyer. They committed to Duke over Miami, giving the Blue Devils another potential No. 1 overall pick. Cameron is a contender to be the No. 1 overall pick this summer, while Cayden is expected to compete for the starting point guard job.Of course, their father, Carlos Boozer, played at Duke from 1999-02, and was a second-round pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. Boozer played 13 seasons in the NBA before retiring. There's a very strong chance that both of his sons could be future first-round picks.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Justin Pippen, CalBasketball bloodline: Son of Scottie PippenPippen will get a fresh start at Cal after spending his freshman season at Michigan.

    "body": "\n        Artificial intelligence has apparently found its way into the National Women's Soccer League. Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey recently revealed that she used ChatGPT out of interest and to test its women's soccer knowledge, while also using a prompt for tactical ideas on how to compete against other teams in the NWSL. Speaking on the \"Soccerish Podcast,\" the most veteran coach in the league spoke about how she engaged with the technology over the course of the offseason, using different questions that ranged from a general standpoint to more specific formative prompts.\"One day in the offseason, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, 'What is Seattle Reign's identity?' And it would spurt it out. And I was like 'I don't know if that's true or not,'\" she said. \"And then I put in, 'What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?' And it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went 'You should play a back five.' So I did. No joke, that's why I did it.\"  \nAI in soccer 101The tactical conversation came about after Harvey was asked how she's evolved on or off the pitch as a coach, and the Reign manager mentioned she'd never coached a back five until this year. \n\"I'd never really done a lot of research on it. I'd never really, like, invested into how it could be played in the women's game. I'd only ever really seen it from afar, you know, watching men's games really,\" Harvey said on the podcast. \"It was always sort of talked about as a way to see games out. You know, [you go ahead] and get into a back five and stop people from scoring, was sort of how, like, a back five had been talked about for me.\"She went on to explain that the unorthodox method came later, while using the AI technology, after delivering questionable information about the club itself. That's Harvey then got more specific in the prompts.So what were the games she referenced?While Harvey didn't give specific details about what the AI's response gave, she did key in on the fact that a back-five formation was suggested for two specific teams. \nA quick search, first round by Kim McCauley, shows that they played with five in the back in a 1-0 loss against Orlando Pride in April. Another significant five back moment against a top squad was an early match in May against Kansas City Current, where the Reign won, 1-0.\"It was early in the season. And I said to the coaching staff, 'I'm not joking, this is what I did.' And they were like, 'Huh, interesting,'\" she recounted. \"We researched it. We did a deep dive on it. We thought about how we could play it, and we went for it, and we liked it. It worked. We won the game.\"\nLater in the season, the Reign lost to Kansas City 2-0, and the Current clinched the 2025 NWSL Shield. In fairness to Harvey, they started the game with three in the back that day.While Harvey may have used the technology out of curiosity and for general brainstorming, there's still the part of actually executing the ideas. With Harvey emphasizing that ChatGPT 'didn't tell you how to play it, what to do in it, or any of that stuff,\" but just the presentation of the idea sparked enough interest in her to bring it to her coaching staff. So what has happened since?The Reign have since used the five-back model in several of their games this season while also implementing a three-back or standard four-back formation. While it hasn't made the team the most threatening in front of goal, it has made them a frustrating side to play against, and their record was enough this year to clinch them a playoff spot. \nWhat final seeding they'll be will depend on the final regular-season match day, as they're currently in fourth place. The irony of the Reign's NWSL Decision Day match is that it is against third-place Orlando Pride, and the two teams are still in contention for the honor to host a playoff match. Whoever is the winner between the two could potentially secure third place, while the loser could end as low as a seventh seed, pending results across the league.Though no matter the playoff position, Harvey is confident in her team's ability to adjust and adapt. It's been their big strength this season despite the lack of goal scoring. \"We've obviously come in and out of it. We played it tons, then we came out of it, and then we went back into it. And now we're quite, like, fluid actually. We can float in and out of it within games. And I love that,\" said Harvey.\n\"When I hear coaches saying, 'We don't know what you're going to do, you're the hardest team to prepare for. Defend. You defend in multiple ways in games.' I'm just like [fist pumping] that, I want everyone to not have a clue what we're going to do. I think that is, like, amazing.\"What does ChatGPT say about Seattle Reign?So now that the regular season is almost over, with just one game remaining with Decision Day on Sunday, what does ChatGPT have to say about Seattle Reign's identity now? For starters, it says a whole lot, including outdated information and multiple references to its old name, OL Reign, under previous ownership, OL Groupe, and that it has attracted some of the best international players, \"such as Megan Rapinoe, Jess Fishlock, and Lydia Williams.\" Former U.S women's national team star Rapinoe retired in 2023. So, has Williams, who also left the club in 2019. It also references the Reign's playing style as \"fast and possession-based,\" which, considering the AI suggested a five-back to Harvey earlier this year, is the complete opposite of how they have played this season.\n            ",

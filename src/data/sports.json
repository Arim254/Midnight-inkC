    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (2-6) host the Baltimore Ravens (2-5) on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 9 NFL schedule. Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 51.5. Lamar Jackson's over/under for total passing yards is 232.5, and his over/under for total rushing yards is 37.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Dolphins vs. Ravens on Thursday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Ravens vs. Dolphins on Thursday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 51.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        As late as Tuesday morning, this year's Breeders' Cup Classic was being touted as the best Classic ever.And, with all due respect to the 1998 and 2004 Classic fields, the argument for 2025 was strong. After all, the race had the top three finishers from last year's Classic. It had 10 horses who combined to win 20 Grade 1 or Group 1 races, including the Kentucky Derby, $20 million Saudi Cup and the last two Travers Stakes. It had horses who had a combined $42.4 million in earnings, led by Japan's Forever Young, who has won more than $15.7 million.But then Sovereignty scratched from the Classic.The reigning Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes winner, who was on his way to one of the best 3-year-old seasons in recent history, spiked a temperature on Monday night and was officially scratched from the race on Wednesday. And, now, the best Classic field ever is something less than that. While there will not be a matchup between Sovereignty and the top older hoses on Saturday, storylines abound in this year's Breeders' Cup Classic at Del Mar just north of San Diego.\nThe talented but mercurial Fierceness will look to capture the Classic one year after he ran his eyeballs out in the same race, only to finish second. Defending champion Sierra Leone looks to become just the second horse to win the Classic twice, joining the great Tiznow. Sierra Leone will get assistance from his stablemate Contrary Thinking, who has been entered as a rabbit for the Classic, to the ire of Fierceness owner Mike Repole. With Sovereignty out, Fierceness has inherited the role of the favorite, listed at 5-2 on the morning line. Sierra Leone (7-2), Forever Young (7-2), Preakness Stakes winner Journalism (5-1) and Mindframe (6-1) round out the top five choices in the nine-horse Classic field. Below, we'll take you through everything to know about this year's Classic from profiles of all the horses involved to info about the race and the road to Del Mar to where to find official betting strategy, including win picks and exotic plays, from a host of SportsLine experts.\nWhat to know about the 42nd Breeders' Cup ClassicWhat: 42nd Breeders' Cup ClassicWhere: Del Mar in Del Mar, Calif.Who: Nine horsesPurse: $7 millionDistance: 1¼ milesPost time: 6:25 p.m. ETNetwork: NBCWeather forecast: Sunny, high of 71Breeders' Cup Classic live odds1 Fierceness (5-2)2 Baeza (10-1)3 Nevada Beach (20-1)4 Contrary Thinking (50-1)5 Forever Young (7-2)6 Sovereignty scratch7 Sierra Leone (7-2)8 Mindframe (6-1)9 Journalism (5-1)10 Antiquarian (10-1)Odds as of Thursday afternoonSportsLine expert picksSportsLine has three great horse racing experts who have locked in their Breeders' Cup Classic picks. Here's a preview of each:Gene Menez, a former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, has been red-hot since last year's Breeders' Cup. Last year he crushed the late Pick 4 on Breeders' Cup Saturday for a $5,303 windfall. He nailed the winner, trifecta and superfecta in the Florida Derby for a $529.60 score and the winner and trifecta in the Blue Grass Stakes for a $761.96 jackpot. Hit the late Pick 4 on Kentucky Oaks day for $915.48. And in the Kentucky Derby, he hammered the exacta and trifecta for a $1,045 payout. Menez's top pick is Forever Young.Jeff Hochman, who is a SportsLine expert in multiple sports as well as a microshare horse owner, is coming off a tremendous a summer racing season at two of the country's premier tracks, Saratoga and Del Mar, winning at an outrageous 65.7% rate. His top Classic pick is a horse who is \"truly elite.\" He also is high on a double-digit longshot who \"enters on an upward trajectory\" and is a \"dangerous outsider.\" Find Hochman's full Breeders' Cup Classic wagering strategy at SportsLine.\nMichelle Yu, a horse racing expert who is on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, has been at the Breeders' Cup all week long and hit the exacta at this year's Kentucky Derby. Her top pick this week is a horse she things has been a \"good horse, and he seems to be rounding into a great one.\" Check out Yu's Breeders' Cup betting strategy at SportsLine.Road to the Breeders' Cup ClassicHere are the most significant races on the road to Del Mar:Feb. 22, Saudi Cup: After a stirring stretch duel, Forever Young surged past the highly regarded Romantic Warrior at the wire to win the $20 million race in a fast time.April 5, Santa Anita Derby: Journalism overcame some traffic trouble to run down Baeza (second) for his fourth straight win.\nMay 3, Kentucky Derby: Race favorite Journalism (second) couldn't hold off Sovereignty down the stretch; Baeza was a fast-closing third.May 17, Preakness Stakes: Blocked by two rivals with nowhere to go, Journalism powered his way through a hole that wasn't there and made up five lengths with a furlong to go to catch a seemingly home-free Gosger in one of the most remarkable finishes in Triple Crown history.June 7, Belmont Stakes: In a virtual replay of the Kentucky Derby, Journalism (second) couldn't hold off Sovereignty down the stretch; Baeza was third.\nJune 28, Stephen Foster Handicap: Mindframe stalked a slow pace to win; Sierra Leone rallied from last two finish a non-threatening second. Aug. 2, Whitney Stakes: Contrary Thinking (ninth) helped ensure a fast pace, setting up stablemate Sierra Leone for the win; Fierceness faded to fifth in the nine-horse field.Aug. 20, Pacific Classic: Fierceness almost jumped the temporary rail at the start and overcame traffic issues for a resounding 3¼-length win over Journalism (second).  \nAug. 31 Jockey Club Gold Cup: Bumping at the start led to Mindframe losing jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. Antiquarian sat midpack and produced his best career effort for his first Grade 1 win. Sierra Leone (second) was slightly bothered by a fallen Ortiz at the start and rallied for second.Breeders' Cup Classic horses (morning-line odds)1 Fierceness (5-2)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: John VelazquezLast race: First in the Pacific Classic by 3¼ lengthsCareer record: 13 starts: 7 wins, 2 seconds, 1 thirdCareer earnings: $5,155,320Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 111 (twice)Sire: City of LightDripping with talent, Fierceness returns to the site of arguably the best two starts of his career. He's back at Del Mar seeking redemption after finishing a game second in last year's Classic to Sierra Leone. With the scratch of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, Fierceness has inherited the role as the race favorite.2 Baeza (10-1)Trainer: John ShirreffsJockey: Hector BerriosLast race: First in the Pennsylvania Derby by 2¼ lengthsCareer record: 8 starts: 2 wins, 3 seconds, 2 thirdsCareer earnings: $1,503,500Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 105 (2025 Pennsylvania Derby)Sire: McKinzieThis 3-year-old had been running behind Sovereignty and Journalism all year but finally earned a breakthrough win in his last start, the Pennsylvania Derby. His speed figures have improved with every performance, and he now enters the Classic on a positive upward trajectory with room to improve. He also will be running out of his backyard for the first time since April.\n3 Nevada Beach (20-1)Trainer: Bob BaffertJockey: Mike SmithLast race: First in the Goodwood Stakes by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 4 starts: 3 wins, 1 secondCareer earnings: $296,500Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 101 (2025 Goodwood)Sire: Omaha BeachHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert usually has a loaded hand for the Classic, but this year he brings a longshot in Nevada Beach. This 3-year-old has started just four times, so he is nowhere near his ceiling, but he will need to get faster in a hurry; his best career Beyer Speed Figure (101) is not remotely competitive in this field.4 Contrary Thinking (50-1)Trainer: Chad BrownJockey: Florent GerouxLast race: Seventh in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 12¾ lengthsCareer record: 7 starts: 2 winsCareer earnings: $140,040Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 95 (2025 allowance)Sire: Into MischiefBeware: This Chad Brown trainee is not in this race to win or even finish in the money. He's in it to serve as a rabbit and ensure a fair pace for Brown's other entrant, the late-running Sierra Leone. That's a role he has served in his last two starts, the Whitney Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup. He lost those two races by more than 80 lengths combined.5 Forever Young (7-2)Trainer: Yoshito YahagiJockey: Ryusei SakaiLast race: First in the Nippon TV Hai by 2½ lengthsCareer record: 12 starts: 9 wins, 3 thirdsCareer earnings: $15,718,590Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 109 (2024 Breeders' Cup Classic)Sire: Real SteelThis Japanese invader has won nine times and earned more than $15.7 million around the world but is still looking for his first victory in the United States. Last year, he finished third in both the Kentucky Derby and the Classic. If he is able to repeat his performance from the Saudi Cup in February, he will have a big chance to finish in the winner's circle.\n6 Sovereignty Scratched.7 Sierra Leone (7-2)Trainer: Chad BrownJockey: Flavien PratLast race: Second in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 13 starts: 5 wins, 5 seconds, 3 thirdsCareer earnings: $7,006,200Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 112 (2024 Breeders' Cup Classic)Sire: Gun RunnerThe defending champ returns to the site of his best career performance. In last year's Classic, he capitalized on a hot early pace and rallied for a resounding 1½-length victory. This late-running colt always comes charging down the stretch but often is at the mercy of the pace. So trainer Chad Brown also has entered stablemate Contrary Thinking to cook things up on the front end. If Sierra Leone gets beaten, the pace shouldn't be an excuse.8 Mindframe (6-1)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: Irad Ortiz Jr.Last race: Did not finish in the Jockey Club Gold CupCareer record: 8 starts: 5 wins, 2 secondsCareer earnings: $1,844,580Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 105 (2025 Stephen Foster Handicap)Sire: ConstitutionTrainer Todd Pletcher says that Mindframe may be the most talented horse in his barn, and the record helps support that: five wins and two seconds in eight career starts. But, because of the rugby scrum at the beginning of the Jockey Club Gold Cup, Mindframe has not finished a race since June 28. That's suboptimal preparation for a race featuring the fastest dirt horses in the world.9 Journalism (5-1)Trainer: Michael McCarthyJockey: Jose OrtizLast race: Second in the Pacific Classic by 3¼ lengthsCareer record: 10 starts: 6 wins, 3 seconds, 1 thirdCareer earnings: $3,998,880Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 108 (2025 San Felipe Stakes)Sire: CurlinThis year has been a long campaign for Journalism, who emerged in the spring as the Kentucky Derby favorite and ran in all of the big races. Though Sovereignty proved better in their two meetings, Journalism showed his class with his victory from an impossible spot in the Preakness Stakes. For the first time since March, he will enter a race fresh, and he gets one of the top jockeys in the world, Jose Ortiz, to hop aboard.\n10 Antiquarian (10-1)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: Luis SaezLast race: First in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 9 starts: 4 wins, 3 secondsCareer earnings: $944,100Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 108 (2025 Jockey Club Gold Cup)Sire: PreservationistHe may be the third of the three Todd Pletcher trainees on the odds board, but he is coming into the Classic the right way: His speed figures have slowly improved with every race, culminating with a career-best effort to win the Jockey Club Gold Cup over Sierra Leone. Antiquarian has had two months off since that race and, with a bit more improvement, has a longshot's chance.\n            ",

He did so in style with this explosive 35-yard run late in the third quarter.\nEvery eligible running back that has rushed for at least 12,000 yards has a gold jacket and bronze bust. The 31-year-old Henry is once again rubbing shoulders with some of the best running backs in NFL history, joining a list that includes Jim Brown, Walter Payton, Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith, among others. NFL's 12,000-yard rushers PlayerYards1.

Derrick Henry 12,052** -- Pro Football Hall of Famers \nHenry's legacy was more than likely already one that was going to be bound for Canton, even prior to his latest milestone. He recently passed Payton for fifth all-time in touchdown runs (112). He is now one of just eight players in NFL history with at least 100 rushing touchdowns and 12,000 rushing yards. Last year, Henry's 1,921 rushing yards was the most ever for a player over the age of 30. It's also the most yards in league history for a player who did not win the rushing title. A Heisman Trophy winner at Alabama, Henry's other NFL accolades include consecutive rushing titles and becoming the ninth player in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. \nWhile it has been undervalued in recent years, Henry is proof that the running back position is still very much alive and well. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA on Wednesday offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement, an opportunity the WNBA accepted Thursday, just hours before the current CBA was set to expire on Friday, according to The Athletic.This is not be the first time the sides needed an extension to complete negotiations on a new CBA. In fact, an extension was utilized to ratify the current CBA. In 2019, the two sides announced a 60-day extension before agreeing to a new deal in January 2020.If the league and the players cannot ultimately agree to terms on a new CBA, the next significant step could be a work stoppage -- most likely via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. At that point, all league business would cease -- players would not even be able to access practice facilities -- but negotiations would continue.However, the two sides could first enter a status quo period, during which the conditions of the current CBA would continue, though not for a set period of time. Per the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoide committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"\nThe key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).The WNBA has never lost games to a work stoppage, but it has come close. In 2003, there was still no deal in place by early April when then-NBA commissioner David Stern issued an ultimatum to come to terms on a new CBA by April 18 or the season would be cancelled. The two sides did just that. As a result, the 2003 WNBA Draft was delayed, as were preseason games. WNBPA senior advisor and legal counsel Erin Drake told The Athletic on Tuesday that the two sides would not agree on a new CBA before Oct. 31. \n\"We have worked hard to be able to say on Friday, we did it. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen,\" Drake said. \"In a dance, it takes two to tango. And it has been difficult to find a beat, to find a rhythm and to find the same sense of urgency [from the league], just to be frank, to get this done.\"The league responded by stating it had made an offer to the players on Oct. 1, which had been ignored until Monday. \"We have been negotiating with the Players Association in good faith and with urgency for several months with the goal of finalizing a new collective bargaining agreement as quickly as possible,\" a WNBA spokesperson told ESPN. \"Throughout this process, we have been clear that our top priority is reaching a new collective bargaining agreement that addresses players' ask for significant increases in pay, benefits and enhancements to their experience, while ensuring the long-term growth and success of the league and its teams.\n\"We urge the Players Association to spend less time disseminating public misinformation and more time joining us in constructive engagement across the table.\"The WNBA and the WNBPA have been embroiled in a bitter labor dispute for over a year. In October 2024, the players announced their intention to opt out of the current CBA. \"This is a defining moment, not just for the WNBA, but for all of us who believe in progress,\" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said in a statement at the time. \"The world has evolved since 2020, and we cannot afford to stand still. If we stay in the current agreement, we fall behind.\n\"Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.\"In recent months, the tension between the players and the league, and specifically commissioner Cathy Engelbert, has heightened. Most notably, WNBPA vice president Napheesa Collier delivered a scathing rebuke of Engelbert during her exit interview following the conclusion of the Minnesota Lynx's season. \"We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world,\" Collier said, while also accusing Engelbert of making disparaging remarks about players, including Caitlin Clark.\nEngelbert later addressed the criticism during her pre-Finals press conference. \"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa and every single player in our league,\" she said. \"They are at the center of everything we do. I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and me personally do not care about them or listen to them, and if the players in the W don't feel appreciated and valued by the league, then we have to do better and I have to do better.\"The main sticking point between the two sides is the revenue sharing model. Under the current CBA, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, reports indicate that players only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive.\nWhile Engelbert and NBA commissioner Adam Silver have both publicly supported raising player salaries, they have pushed back on revenue sharing. \"I think share isn't the right way to look at it because there's so much more revenue in the NBA,\" Silver said earlier this month. \"I think you should look at absolute numbers in terms of what they are making. They are going to get a big increase in this cycle of collective bargaining and they deserve it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The USL Championship kicks off its 2025 playoffs on Saturday. As it starts it will be a celebration of what has been an impressive season, but it's also a chance to look forward to the next stage for the league, which is beginning to take place. In March, the United Soccer League announced that promotion and relegation would be coming, starting in 2028. It's a move that could forever change the landscape of American soccer. Promotion and relegation are standard in European leagues, but that hasn't been the case in America. The closed systems in the United States take out a lot of the jeopardy that comes with owning a soccer club, since every team is guaranteed a place in the league for the coming season. With the closed system, the top tier isn't a dream for everyone, but rather an exclusive group that a team literally buys their way into. Not only does it cap what a grassroots soccer team can do, but it can also have an impact on development. When asked about what American soccer would need to do in order to take the next step forward, Eintracht Frankfurt, who played preseason games in the U.S. over the summer, CEO Axel Hellmann immediately pointed to promotion and relegation.\"The most important thing is for the younger players to make an early step to Europe, because we have a more competitive system. It's tougher because of the relegation,\" Hellmann said. \"That's what I'm always telling our American colleagues all the time, integrate relegation in your whole football system, because it means at the end you have something to lose, and then you go to maximum. Not only if you want to win a title or be successful in the playoffs, it's also that if you can be relegated, it's about life and death. And that is something that really makes you grow in your mind, makes you more successful, makes you more resilient to problems you have in a season or on the pitch, because you know what you can achieve.\"Coming from a club that prepares young players for the next step in their careers, like Frankfurt, Hellmann's words show what could come to American soccer, along with promotion and relegation. With improving infrastructure and a growing place in the global market as player development improves in the USL, this is an opportunity to capitalize on that potential for the USL.\nThere are steps that need to happen first, such as figuring out which teams will be in the top division so that it can launch, USL League One and USL League Two, but these are being worked on behind the scenes. With new clubs joining, such as Atletico Dallas, the volume of teams will be there, while still more are working to meet the league's stadium requirements. There's also the work that needs to happen on exactly how relegation is being implemented, which is part of why, even after the announcement of promotion and relegation coming, there will be years before it can be fully realized.While that's getting sorted, the league is also working on something interesting to improve competition. The Premier League has parachute payments when a team is relegated, so that it can deal with the drops in revenue, but with those drops not being as significant in American soccer, the USL is working almost on a reverse payment to help teams with operating changes if they are to be promoted.\"Our bigger concern is when teams get promoted, the cost of execution, whether player salaries, referees, TV, all those things, travel, those are the bigger requirements that are on the teams that get promoted. Our concern is not where people get relegated, because it is shown over time. If you're a community-based club, you know, we have teams that finish, are finishing towards the bottom of a league, but they're still selling out games, because it's a part of the fabric of the community,\" USL president and CEO Paul McDonough said. \n\"Our bigger concern is how we take care of the teams that get promoted and all of a sudden have an uptick in the cost of running their clubs,\" He added. \"If sustainability matters, which it does, then we have to address that. So we're looking at things, and we're talking with our sporting committee, and we've got owner meetings, and we'll talk to the owners about some of those things.\"In looking at things that way, USL can do something that's almost the opposite of England, where promoted teams usually go back down to the division below, as helping with the transition can create an ecosystem where it doesn't matter what division a team is in, and that they can still be successful where they are. A soccer utopia may not exist, but with the inclusion of promotion and relegation, the stakes will be there with every match.\"Every match needs to matter, and we think that promotion, relegation, we can find a path in the competition structure to try to find out where every match will matter,\" McDonough said.\nWe may be a ways from seeing the fruit of all of this, but if executed properly, the 2026 World Cup will be a celebration of soccer in the United States before 2028, is a new frontier for American soccer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Teams with two wins apiece will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' with a two-time MVP back on the NFL player props market. Ravens vs. Dolphins on TNF will mark the return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after he missed the last three games. He will be a central figure with NFL prop bets but not the only player of high interest with 'Thursday Night Football' props. Big names like Derrick Henry, Tua Tagovailoa, De'Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle all have interesting lines to wager on for the opener of Week 9, as Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points, and the total is 51.5 points.No team has allowed more rushing yards to opposing running backs than the Dolphins, as they're allowing 128.3 yards to running backs alone. However, Miami just held Bijan Robinson to 25 yards on the ground, which makes backing the Over of Henry's NFL prop total of 89.5 rushing yards no sure thing. Additionally, Jackson's return could affect the future Hall of Fame running back's usage.

It's fair to assume that Jackson will be a bit rusty after missing a month of action, and he's played conservatively after missing games previously. He threw for just 165 yards in his first game back after an illness kept him out of a 2021 game, and he had only 107 passing yards in his first game back after being on the COVID-19 list for a 2020 game.Miami's defense will also contribute to Jackson hitting the Under as defending through the air is one of the few strengths of the Dolphins. They allow fewer than 200 passing yards per game as they prevent the big play with just 10.3 yards allowed per completion, which is seventh-fewest in the NFL. Meanwhile, just three teams give up more yards per rush than Miami (5.0), so look for Baltimore to lean on its ground game instead of an aerial attack. Jackson's projected to have 189.8 passing yards in a 4.5-star pick. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Ravens vs. DolphinsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has three additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

    "body": "\n        A pair of AFC division leaders headline the NFL Week 9 schedule when the Indianapolis Colts take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule.  Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off for the 10th time, with Mahomes holding a 5-4 edge. However, Buffalo has won four straight regular season meetings with Kansas City. How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 9?

    "body": "\n        Don't cheat: which two NFL teams currently have the longest active winning streaks headed into Week 9? Hint: both are led by second-year quarterbacks who both wear the number 10. Answer: the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, who are both 6-2 and atop their respective divisions. During New England's winning streak, they've held all five opponents to 20 points or less while averaging nearly 31 points per game.For the Broncos, it's been a different story having trailed at some point during all five wins. This week, the Patriots are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons, while the Broncos are 1.5-point underdogs at Houston in a game where the over/under is just 39.5, as a pair of top-five scoring defenses go head-to-head. Can both the Patriots and Broncos continue their recent hot play and remain atop the AFC East and AFC West divisions respectively?

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point. While Indy is still a playoff team, I will be fading them as a road favorite in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Steelers 26, Colts 24\". See his other Week 9 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 9 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 9 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

    "body": "\n        Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams is well behind pace in the quest for a second consecutive 1,000-yard season. The former No. 12 overall pick broke out in style last season with by far the best year of his NFL career but has not found the same success in 2025, and offensive coordinator John Morton took the blame for that slow start to the campaign, saying that he \"failed\" Williams over the first seven games.Morton is in his first year as the Lions' play-caller, and with new roles often come learning curves with regard to personnel and tendencies. The new coordinator said he intends to work at getting Williams open more often and dialing up plays to unlock his capabilities as one of the Lions' top weapons.\"I'm going to do a better job with that,\" Morton said on Thursday. \"But there has been opportunities where it just didn't happen. It's not like we ain't going to try to target him. That was the biggest thing. So I looked at everything. I have failed him. That's what I have told him. I have to do a better job with that. But it's a two-way street. We definitely looked at that.\"Williams last season caught 58 passes for 1,001 yards and seven touchdowns, and he added another score in the playoffs. He was on an extreme upward trajectory under former offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and improved his numbers each of his first three years as a pro. Whether defenses are more dialed into his abilities or the coordinator change stunted his productivity, at the end of the day, he is a more modest part of the Lions' passing attack than anticipated.\nThrough seven games, Williams has just 17 grabs for 289 yards and two touchdowns, putting him on pace to finish the year with just over half of the production he logged a year ago.\"This guy, he's awesome,\" Morton said. \"He doesn't say anything. He just goes and plays. Like I said to him, 'I wouldn't fault you if you're pissed at me.' I've coached that position. I played that position. I know he works too hard. We gotta make sure that we're going out and doing the right thing, the right techniques, this and that. It's not just him. It's everybody.\"The rest of the Lions' receivers picked up some of the slack with Williams uncharacteristically quiet. The teams' 1,565 passing yards through seven games is almost identical to the 1,599 yards the offense racked up at this point a year ago. Amon-Ra St. Brown has been the primary target, as per usual, and leads the NFL with seven touchdowns. Tight end Sam LaPorta and running back Jahmyr Gibbs also have more catches than Williams.\n\"Especially on third down, they're doubling [Amon-Ra St. Brown], they're doubling him,\" Morton said. \"There's a lot of stuff that's going on. I have to be creative. I have to go in the archives and try to get these guys open better.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nTottenham and Chelsea add another chapter in their rivalry to begin the month of November when the two sides meet Saturday afternoon. Tottenham sit third in the Premier League table but are coming off a midweek EFL Cup loss to Newcastle while Chelsea sit ninth in the EPL table but won a wild 4-3 affair against Wolves in midweek EFL Cup action. Chelsea have dominated this clash of late, winning nine of the last 11 Premier League matches against Tottenham, including the last four.Kickoff from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is set for 1:30 p.m. ET. Tottenham are +170 money line underdogs in the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds while Chelsea are +150 money line favorites. A draw comes in at +260 and the total sits at 2.5 (Over -140, Under +110). The SportsLine Projection Model has Chelsea winning in 40% of simulations to bring value at these odds. Before making wagers on Tottenham vs. Chelsea, be sure to see what SportsLine expert Jon Eimer is betting in this match.Eimer finished 2023 as SportsLine's No. 1 soccer expert, posting a 248-234-12 (+25.93 units) record on SportsLine article picks.

The first is a slow, low-scoring, cagey affair where both sides are too timid to put together a real attack. The second thing and the option I think we see, is an absolute slugfest with both sides swinging for goals and letting the game go off the rails. The last two times we've seen these sides clash with Spurs at home, we've seen BTTS hit, Over 2.5 goals hit, Over 3,5 goals hit and Over 4.5 goals hit. There were seven goals when these teams met last season in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. With Spurs flying high and Chelsea struggling to find consistency, I'm loving goals in this matchup.Chelsea's atrocious defenseI've already stated I like goals in this fixture, but the big reason I like them is due to the underperforming defense by the visitors. Chelsea are loaded with injuries and while that's out of their control, their defense and midfield are non-existent right now. Chelsea just played an EFL match against Wolves earlier this week. Wolves are currently the worst team in the entirety of the Premier League, and they scored three goals on Chelsea. Chelsea have now conceded in four of their last five matches which includes Sunderland, Ajax, Wolves and Liverpool. This team was created on the foundation of certain players that are no longer able to play, and Chelsea is floundering trying to find consistency. They're always good enough for a goal, but it should take multiple to make up for their poor backline.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Halloween is upon us. And there's nothing nearly as scary as predicting the NFL season. Remember when we all had the Baltimore Ravens pegged as Super Bowl favorites? That was cute. Remember when the Washington Commanders were the belle of the ball? Good times. Truth is, nothing and nobody is safe once the games actually get underway -- not even the \"stone-cold locks.\"Speaking of stone cold, Halloween seems like the perfect time to do a proper reassessment of which teams are headed for the grave, or primed to send others there. As the chill of the autumn air nips at your coat and the leaves rustle in anticipation of trick-or-treating across the land, we took stock of the scariest teams across the football landscape. In doing so, we also created our very own rating system to identify the most beastly of the bunch ... the Halloween Scare-o-Meter:🎃 = Frighteningly Bad🎃🎃 = Pleasantly Spooky🎃🎃🎃 = Downright FearsomeDoes your favorite team make the cut, for better or worse?

It sure doesn't seem like it. Dan Campbell was supposed to take his lumps this year, remember? Losing both Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn was supposed to be the wrench that finally broke the perfect marriage of Detroit's glitzy talent and undying aggression. Instead, the Lions are still a juggernaut, overcoming a shuffled O-line to produce one of the NFL's highest-scoring attacks (again). The rival Packers may be a threat, but all those preseason suggestions of the Bears and Vikings also making a play for Motown's throne seem increasingly silly.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Surprisingly scary: The ColtsRecord: 7-1 | Halloween Scare-o-Meter: 🎃🎃Most of us probably didn't even expect the Colts to win seven games all year. Now Indianapolis looks like the locomotive that can't be derailed, with an NFL-best +116 point differential and an MVP-level workhorse in Jonathan Taylor. We can't help but reserve a touch of skepticism regarding Daniel Jones' vault to weekly stability; remember his best Giants campaign, which cruised due to a Saquon Barkley breakout but tumbled apart in the end? Then again, maybe Shane Steichen really has found the perfect battle-refined figurehead for his attack.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Scarily inevitable: The ChiefsRecord: 5-3 | Halloween Scare-o-Meter: 🎃🎃🎃Kansas City fell flat in Super Bowl LIX, then finally looked out of gas to open this year, leaning almost exclusively on Patrick Mahomes' scrambling during an 0-2 start. Since then, Andy Reid's perennial contender has fully returned to form, if not exceeded the Chiefs' offensive state to end 2024. Mahomes is dealing with utter confidence now that Rashee Rice is back in the fold to supplement a basket full of interchangeable toys, including Xavier Worthy and Marquise Brown. Not so unlike the Eagles who beat them for the last trophy, this unit just knows how to win.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Quietly scary: The RamsRecord: 5-2 | Halloween Scare-o-Meter: 🎃🎃The NFC West is responsible for an abundance of storylines: Can the 49ers keep hanging around while basically every one of their big names battles serious bruises? Can Sam Darnold sustain his gunslinging for the Seahawks? Can Arizona ever get out of its own way? Lost in the discourse is a true appreciation for what Sean McVay is doing (again) with Matthew Stafford, who's 37 but somehow also the healthiest and most energetic member of an attack that's missed Puka Nacua for stretches. Coupled with a still-ferocious defense led by young talent, this is a title sleeper.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Scarily volatile: The DolphinsRecord: 2-6 | Halloween Scare-o-Meter: 🎃Is Tua Tagovailoa going to show up dressed as a Pro Bowler with tight spirals, or a dejected captain of a sinking ship? It's the question Miami fans ask themselves each Sunday, as coach Mike McDaniel tries to fend off a potential exit for another week. The back-and-forth is truly whiplash-invoking: Tua can still fire it to his speedy friends like Jaylen Waddle, but he's just as liable to toss three picks (and a head-scratching explanation, for good measure). As long as the stripped-down defense registers as a borderline bottom-five unit, the trouble figures to stick around.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Nightmarishly bad: The TitansRecord: 1-7 | Halloween Scare-o-Meter: 🎃There's \"rebuilding,\" and there's \"listless.\" Tennessee is showing us all what it means to be the latter. Yes, sometimes it takes a teardown to build up. The problem with the Titans is they're on their third coach and fourth general manager in the last four NFL seasons, including interims. That's nasty. Meanwhile, halfway through his rookie year, No. 1 overall draft pick Cam Ward is better known for lambasting his own franchise's ability to play competitive football than, say, completing passes with any regularity. There is surely light at the end of the tunnel. But this tunnel is a labyrinth.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Politics giveth and politics taketh. That might as well be the story of LSU athletic director Scott Woodward's time as the top boss of Tigers athletics. LSU fired Woodward on Thursday, one day after Louisiana governor Jeff Landry went nuclear on the LSU AD saying unequivocally he would not be hiring the next LSU football coach. \"Hell, I'll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it.\" Landry said in a soundbite that both shocked and amused many within college athletics. The decision comes just days after Woodward unilaterally made the call Sunday to fire football coach Brian Kelly, according to sources, in a $54 million decision that infuriated Landry and Board of Supervisors members who weren't consulted beforehand. In just a five-day span, LSU has committed (for now) nearly $60 million to rid itself of its AD and football coach. LSU had been working to negotiate Kelly's buyout down. \n\n        \n            \n                You can't fake 'fam-uh-lee' forever: Brian Kelly's end came fast, but his LSU downfall was years in the making\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is a stunning fall from grace for Woodward, an experienced political operative known for his prowess in maneuvering in the shadows to get what he wanted. A political lobbyist before jumping into college athletics under then-LSU president Mark Emmert, Woodward counted friends on both sides of political ideologies and had a way of working behind-the-scenes to get his way. It was politics, after all, that got him the job in the first place. In a famous backroom political maneuver, Woodward knew he would be the next LSU AD before his future boss and university president F. King Alexander. In fact, he got the LSU AD job despite it not being open. In an April 2019 incident he refers to as the \"Monday Night Massacre,\" Alexander says he was told to go to Jubans Restaurant & Bar, an upscale creole-themed spot that serves shrimp aubergine and redfish adrian. As Alexander was led into the backroom, he was met with the LSU Board of Supervisors. \nThe supervisors, who had all been appointed by then-Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards, told Alexander he had to fire AD Joe Alleva the next morning because they had already hired Woodward, then at Texas A&M, as the school's next AD. Alexander said it just so happened that one of the board members was best friends with Woodward, an LSU alumnus, since they went to Catholic High School in Baton Rouge together. Alleva was not particularly popular at the time with the supervisors or LSU fans for his decision to suspend then-basketball coach Will Wade, but Alexander had preferred to just let the AD ride it out until his contract expired the following year. That wasn't good enough for the board members -- they wanted Alleva out immediately in favor of Woodward. \"They wrote down the salary they had already given him,\" Alexander told CBS Sports on Thursday. \"They wrote it down on a napkin and then slipped me the napkin on what they were going to pay the new AD who I hadn't even interviewed.\"\nFrom that point, it was clear to Alexander, who served as LSU president from 2013-2019, that he would have no oversight over Woodward despite what the university reporting structure demanded. \"He knew all he had to do was call board members,\" Alexander said. \"He did whatever he wanted to.\"That included, according to sources, frequently being out of the office and largely delegating day-to-day responsibilities to subordinates. He had plenty of detractors in SEC circles, but internally at LSU he smartly stayed close to the power players on the Board of Supervisors and largely operated in the shadows without getting his hands dirty. Woodward's decision to fire Kelly following an emotionally-charged meeting that went poorly, according to sources, was a rare political misstep for him that Landry quickly pounced on. \nAs stunning as Landry's public comments and actions have been this week, they are just the latest in a long list of examples of Louisiana governors getting involved in LSU athletics. ****To understand the long-standing relationship between LSU athletics and politics, we need to go back to the days of \"The Kingfish.\"Despite never attending the school, Huey Long loved LSU. He believed that a bigger and better LSU not only benefited his political ambitions but would be good for the state of Louisiana. \nFirst as governor and later as a United States senator before his 1935 assassination, Long was so involved in LSU athletics that if you didn't know any better you might have thought he was the football coach. He tried recruiting football players to LSU. He wrote the fight song \"Touchdown for LSU\" that is still used today. He gave pregame and halftime speeches. Before a game against Arkansas in 1928, Long told the LSU players, \"Hell, you ought to beat 'em. We got better roads in Louisiana, free schoolbooks, and better everything,\" as documented in Robert Mann's book \"Kingfish U: Huey Long and LSU.\" Long was involved in the dismissal of at least two LSU football coaches, one of which because the coach, Captain Lawrence Jones, wouldn't let him give a halftime speech during a game. \n\"It hasn't changed a whole lot,\" Alexander said with a laugh about LSU's current situation.From Long, there have been multiple Louisiana governors who have gotten involved in LSU athletics. With the state capital and flagship university just a few miles away from each other in Baton Rouge, it's ripe for attempted influence over a major financial engine within the state. Bobby Jindal, the state's governor from 2008-16, was a big fan of former LSU coach Les Miles and once directed LSU leaders to keep the football coach \"no matter what it takes\" amid interest from Michigan. This frustrated LSU's president at the time, Michael Martin, who would later tell The Advocate, \"I found it interesting that the governor's office had time to track Les' future when at least I thought there were more important things happening in the state of Louisiana.\" \nBut Jindal was just following the Long playbook that a good LSU football team could be good for him, too. \"The governor can make or break a football coach,\" Jim Engster, a long-time Louisiana media figure, told Sports Illustrated in 2019. \"And a football coach, if he's winning, adds to the cache of the governor.\" Jindal reportedly intervened on Miles' behalf during the 2015 season as reports swirled LSU readied to fire the national championship-winning coach and pursue then-Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher. LSU AD Joe Alleva was prepared to fire Miles, but Jindal encouraged giving him another season. LSU's Board of Supervisors weren't entirely on board with the idea of spending $17 million to dump Miles and his assistants, either. A group of LSU officials, including Alexander, famously met during halftime of LSU's regular-season finale against Texas A&M where it was decided Miles would return for another season. \n(Alexander said Jindal really didn't intervene with Miles and that meeting, which occurred in the president's suite and included multiple members of the Board of Supervisors, was about whether Miles would make changes to an offense that had gone stale). Miles only made it four games into the following season before he was fired following an 18-13 loss to Auburn. A predictable offense that almost got him canned 10 months earlier finally caught up to him. Alexander and Alleva hired native son Ed Orgeron to replace him. And, of course, Jindal's replacement, John Bel Edwards, would develop a close relationship with Miles' replacement. Orgeron even endorsed Edwards in his 2019 gubernatorial campaign. How are Louisiana governors able to have so much influence? They appoint the 14-person Board of Supervisors. With those appointments come perks like football tickets and premium parking, among other benefits. Increasingly it has been used as a reward to political supporters and like-minded donors. Members of the Board of Supervisors are on six-year terms, staggered over the years, which can allow a two-term governor like Edwards to stack the entire board. Of course this isn't done exclusively to gain control over LSU football -- there are plenty of reasons it could be beneficial to have friendly allies on the board.\nThere was no question, though, that being involved with LSU football was a big appeal for board members.\"The most popular board member -- the one who lobbied the hardest -- became chair of the athletic committee of the board,\" Alexander said. \"The most unfortunate board member, the one who nobody liked, became chair of the academic affairs committee of the board.\"  Only one year into his term, Landry has already appointed six members to the board and will get to pick another four next year. Like Long before him, Landry didn't attend LSU. He got his undergraduate degree at Louisiana and a law degree at Loyola before beginning a political career that included becoming the state's attorney general. With a strong Louisiana accent straight out of central casting, Landry has quickly developed a reputation as a firebrand who has been unafraid to go after tenured professors, coaches and, most recently, athletic directors who evoke his ire. Landry may not know all the facts about the current college football environment -- he mistakenly referred to the College Football Playoff as the Bowl Championship Series in a radio interview Thursday -- but that hasn't diminished his self-confidence he's the man to fix LSU football. He can't directly hire a football coach -- he has said this isn't his intent, regardless -- but without a permanent university president, it has created a power vacuum he has gladly stepped into. At minimum, Landry can exert his influence over his board appointees to hire his preferred presidential candidate, which many believe to be McNeese State president Wade Rousse. Rousse is one of three finalists for the job with LSU's Board of Supervisors expected to pick the next university president next week. With the right next LSU president, Landry can then have significant influence over the next athletic director and football coach hires. And if that person resists his desires, Landry can push his Board of Supervisors appointees to oust another major figure. Landry's increased involvement has spooked multiple industry sources CBS Sports has talked to about the upcoming football coaching search with one saying, simply, \"LSU doesn't have a plan.\" His involvement in the firing of Kelly, which included hosting key officials to discuss it at the governor's mansion last Sunday, and of Woodward is highly unusual but not completely without precedent. After all, 42 states have governor involvement in some fashion on the university board members/trustees appointment process. As Brookings Institute noted earlier this year, \"In some ways, the focus on boards is a smart tactical move by governors and legislatures hoping to gain greater influence over institutions.\" \"It seems that, at least in several cases, over the past couple of years, it appears that government officials and university boards have sidestepped their normal governance procedures,\" said Amy Privette Perko, the chief executive officer of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. \"It's hard to imagine circumstances that warrant disregard for following best practices in university governance. That said, given the high stakes with college sports and some of the heightened efforts between college sports leaders and state governments, it's not surprising to see a desire among lawmakers to be more involved.\"That last part is key in understanding what the future could bring. ****Landry inserting himself into the LSU football coaching search has elicited strong reactions across college athletics. Few of them have been positive about what it means for LSU.\"I was neither shocked nor surprised,\" said Dr. B. David Ridpath, professor of sports business at Ohio University. \"It was almost comical.\"But it is, some say, what you get when you court political influence over college athletics. From lobbying state representatives for advantageous Name, Image and Likeness laws to benefit the in-state universities to repeated trips to Washington, D.C. in hopes of federal legislation, college sports leaders have been begging politicians to get involved. The problem is once you invite them in, they may decide to do more than you intended. You can ask for help on an NIL bill, for instance, but in exchange the legislator may want more influence on campus. Or you can look for creative ways to help increase revenue like a Louisiana bill that directs sports gambling tax revenue to the Division I schools in the state, but it may attract the governor to be more involved now that state tax dollars were in play. That has seemed to be the angle for Landry so far. He said Thursday on the Pat McAfee Show that state taxpayers would be on the hook for Kelly's massive buyout if private donors didn't step in.\"That contract binds the state of Louisiana,\" Landry said. \"If someone doesn't step up and pay that bill, the state of Louisiana has to foot that bill.\"Political involvement in college sports seems to be especially prominent down South, says Ridpath, who previously worked at Mississippi State. \"I cannot imagine (Ohio governor) Mike DeWine saying that,\" Ridpath said of Landry's Woodward comments. \"I can't imagine (Governor) Wes Moore in Maryland doing that. But for some reason, I can imagine Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia doing that.\"Bowen Loftin, the former president of Texas A&M, experienced the influence of then-Texas governor Rick Perry when the school was first considering joining the SEC. Perry, a Texas A&M graduate, told both Texas and Texas A&M to stand down in 2010 when they were considering leaving the Big 12. In Texas, Loftin said, the governor stacked the board with people who gave political money and would carry out his vision. He talked to them frequently making sure he knew where everyone stood before he pushed for something.  In many ways, they had more loyalty to the governor than the school they represented. \"It's very difficult to manage that because they, in principle, have the power to hire and fire presidents and control budgets,\" Loftin previously told us. \"They oftentimes aren't donors, they are people who just have a passion or gotten the position because the governor put them there. And that might have happened because of money.\"What's happening at LSU could embolden ambitious governors elsewhere and scare college administrators everywhere. In Baton Rouge, LSU is now without a permanent football coach, athletic director and university president. In their place is a 54-year old Republican governor who has now turned his attention to going after the significant influence of prominent agents such as Jimmy Sexton and Trace Armstrong, promising that LSU won't be giving out another 10-year, $95 million contract the way it did for Kelly. Landry is on a hot streak, no doubt, but even he may be surprised at just how limited a governor's power is against the might of college football's top agents. \n            ",

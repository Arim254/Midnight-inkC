    "body": "\n        At the end of a charge from third to first in the closing laps, Denny Hamlin drove away to a milestone victory that may serve as one of the most important of his entire career, winning the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to earn his sixth win of the 2025 season and the 60th win of his Cup Series career. Hamlin's 60th win ties him with Kevin Harvick for 10th on NASCAR's all-time wins list, and it also secures him a spot in the Championship 4, ensuring him the opportunity to race for the Cup title that has long eluded him in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway.Sunday's race, and the complexion of the championship picture, swung dramatically in a sequence of events that began with 32 laps to go. Only a few laps after losing the lead to Kyle Larson on a bobble in turns 1 and 2, William Byron was running second and trying to run Larson back down for the lead, only to be caught completely unaware of the lapped car of Ty Dillon peeling off to come to pit road in front of him. Byron ended up slamming into the back of DIllon's car at nearly full speed, taking him out in a grinding crash and bringing out the caution.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTwo playoff drivers, Chase Briscoe and Joey Logano, elected to gamble on the ensuing round of pit stops by taking two tires, and a multi-car crash on the restart helped their gambit by creating just a 14-lap run to the finish. But the four tires that Hamlin took would eventually win out: After taking second at the end of several laps battling with Kyle Larson, Hamlin quickly drove down Briscoe and powered around his outside with four laps to go, driving away to earn a win with many different layers to it.Normally a driver who relishes the role of heel and instigator, Hamlin was noticeably emotional over his team radio and then on the frontstretch after the checkered flag. Emotion which came out, in part, given that his father Dennis has been ill.\n\"This is the point where I kind of give the fans some shit, but not today. I appreciate all of you so much,\" Hamlin told the crowd before speaking to USA. \"... [Crew chief Chris Gabehart] did an amazing job on that final stop getting the car just right, and I just held it down. That's all I could do is just go for it. I felt like I had nothing to lose. Just go for it and try to punch the ticket now. And, man, this one feels great.\"Larson and Christopher Bell made it past Briscoe in the final laps to finish second and third, with Briscoe coming home fourth and Tyler Reddick finishing fifth. Logano would parlay his strategy into a sixth place finish, with Alex Bowman seventh, Kyle Busch eighth, Ryan Preece ninth and Brad Keselowski rounding out the top 10.\nThe race, of course, could have been far different: William Byron led three times for 55 laps and looked destined to be a central character in the race for the win, but he was instead left to lament his accident with Ty Dillon, in which Byron said he received no indication that the No. 10 Chevrolet in front of him was coming to pit road.\n\"I never saw him wave. I didn't see any indication that he was pitting, and it was probably 12 to 15 laps after we had pitted, so I thought the cycle [of green flag stops] was fully over,\" Byron told USA. \"Nobody said anything to my spotter from what I know. I had zero idea. ... I was watching him thinking 'okay, he missed the bottom a little bit here' and then he just started slowing, and I had no idea what was going on.\"I'm just devastated. I had no indication, so I obviously wouldn't have just driven full speed into the back of him like that.\"Byron was left with a 36th place finish, just two spots ahead of fellow playoff driver Ryan Blaney, who saw his race end after just 70 laps when he blew a tire and pounded the wall in turns 3 and 4. Chase Elliott also had major problems after his pit crew was penalized for an uncontrolled tire violation, but he was able to eventually get back on the lead lap and salvage an 18th place finish.\nAs Hamlin now automatically advances to the Championship 4, Kyle Larson (+45), Christopher Bell (+20) and Chase Briscoe (+15) now leave Las Vegas on the plus side of the cut line to join him there. Byron (-15), Elliott (-23), Logano (-24) and Blaney (-31) now trail the cut line, but do so entering next weekend's middle race of the Round of 8 at Talladega Superspeedway -- a place where much can change and change quickly.\nSouth Point 400 results#11 - Denny Hamlin#5 - Kyle Larson#20 - Christopher Bell#19 - Chase Briscoe#45 - Tyler Reddick#22 - Joey Logano#48 - Alex Bowman#8 - Kyle Busch#60 - Ryan Preece#6 - Brad Keselowski#2 - Austin Cindric#17 - Chris Buescher#4 - Noah Gragson#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#43 - Erik Jones#71 - Michael McDowell#35 - Riley Herbst (R)#9 - Chase Elliott#16 - A.J.

Instead, the Mariners took Game 1 of the ALCS over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday, a 3-1 win (box score). Cal Raleigh homered and Jorge Polanco drove in the other two runs, while Seattle pitching allowed just a leadoff home run to George Springer.The Blue Jays haven't been to the ALCS since 2016 and haven't been to the World Series since 1993. The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant. They remain the only team of 30 in MLB to have never played in the World Series. They'll have their chance to advance here, but they have to deal with a hungry Blue Jays team.

    "body": "\n        Penn State ultimately gave James Franklin everything he had been asking for.  In just one offseason: The school bankrolled the hiring the nation's highest-paid assistant coach, $3 million defensive coordinator Jim Knowles. PSU's supporters stepped up in big ways in the NIL department to keep talented players like quarterback Drew Allar, running back Nicholas Singleton and defensive end Dani Dennis-Sutton for one more year rather than go on to the NFL. In the spring the Nittany Lions added Syracuse receiver Trebor Pena, one of the pricier receiver options in the portal, to ameliorate what's been a disappointing receivers corp for years.It was all set up for this to be Penn State's \"Last Dance\" title run. Michigan and Ohio State provided the blueprint the last two seasons, and the Nittany Lions had all the resources, on paper, to make the same run. A year after making it to a national semifinal, this was a title-or-bust kind of year.  \n        \n            \n                The failure to develop QB Drew Allar sealed James Franklin's fate at Penn State\n                \n                    Brian Dohn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd yet on Oct. 12, midway through the season, not only is Penn State out of the title race but Franklin is out of a job. It's a stunning development, the most surprising firing in decades potentially given the timing, and also perhaps a sign of things to come across the industry. What Franklin and Penn State taught us is there's a price to going all-in on a season: When you finally have everything you've asked for, with no excuses left, and you still don't perform as expected, then you are the problem.  For years, Franklin complained behind-the-scenes about not having the same resources as Big Ten peers Ohio State and Michigan. In 12 seasons at Penn State, Franklin had considerable success including five top-10 finishes and five New Year's Day Six bowls. But he could always point to not having as much as the truly elite programs as the reason why his program couldn't get over the hump in its ghastly 4-21 record against top-10 opponents. He could argue his results matched the investment.  \nTo Franklin's point, Penn State was behind in a few key areas. Certainly, Penn State wasn't as aggressive -- or have as much of a cash arsenal -- in the NIL department as some of its old Big Ten East rivals. Franklin frequently brought up to Penn State boosters all the resources Ohio State had, which included one of the nation's most expensive rosters a season ago.  \n        \n            \n                James Franklin will be a red-hot candidate despite Penn State firing: 'No way he goes to Florida, right?'\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe complaining and the recent on-field success pushed Penn State boosters to dig deeper to give Franklin everything he needed to win it all this season. Franklin himself admitted before the season that his roster had never been better in his 12 seasons leading Penn State.  \"This is the best combined personnel that I think we've had at Penn State,\" Franklin said at Big Ten Media Days. \"And when I talk about personnel, I'm talking about players and staff, from a depth, from a talent standpoint, and from an experience standpoint.\" \nWhen you have all that, you can no longer play the resources excuse card. The pressure to succeed cranked up, and especially in losses to UCLA and Northwestern, Franklin wilted under it. He couldn't manage the disappointment of failing in spite of a major resource advantage over the Bruins and Wildcats.  This has already been the busiest pre-November coaching carousel in the FBS era and it will only get crazier with big jobs expected to still open up. And at the biggest programs that could come open, faltering despite bundles of resources will be a defining cause.  It could certainly be that case at Florida and Auburn.  At Auburn especially, Hugh Freeze has been given everything he's wanted from a NIL and program resources standpoint. The Tigers paid heavily to add Georgia Tech transfer receiver Eric Singleton and gave Freeze what he needed to go out and get a marquee transfer QB. He picked Oklahoma transfer Jackson Arnold, a decision that multiple industry sources immediately questioned as curious knowing what was at stake for Freeze this season. That skepticism has only gotten worse amidst Auburn's offensive woes in its 3-3 start to the season.  \nWhen you're an offensive guru, you are giving two million-plus dollar receivers in Singleton and Cam Coleman, a pricey quarterback in Arnold and you still aren't succeeding, you run into a problem.  As one industry source put it before the season, \"If they move on from Hugh, someone will take over one of the most loaded rosters in the country that has just not produced.\" In Gainesville, Napier is facing the similar weight of expectations that come with the huge resources to hire an army of analysts and personnel folks, land a top-flight quarterback in DJ Lagway and be competitive about filling the roster with top talent. Napier flourished in excelling with less at Louisiana, but that success hasn't translated at Florida where almost every ask is granted.  \nEventually, even the most ardent well-heeled boosters expect a return on investment. You can convince them for a year or two, perhaps, that you just don't have the right ingredients to meet expectations. But after you persuade them to spend millions to get you exactly what you want and the results don't change, the desire to switch the chef rather than pour more money into groceries gains steam. \n        \n            \n                Penn State coaching candidates: Matt Rhule, Curt Cignetti among options on hot board to replace James Franklin\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA year ago, Ohio State was as all-in as it gets in a title-or-bust year. It was bumpy along the way and Ohio State coach Ryan Day came close to crumbling under the pressure of it. The Michigan loss nearly broke him. In the end, though, Day was hoisting up a national championship trophy and all the investment paid off.  That's what Penn State wanted -- expected, really -- from Franklin this season. It could handle a double-overtime loss to Oregon at home, as back-breaking as it was. It could not, and would not, accept losses to two Big Ten bottom-dwellers that were both more than 20-point underdogs against the Nittany Lions.  \nWith more resources come higher expectations. Franklin learned that the hard way, but he won't be the last.  In the NIL and revenue share era were coaches are constantly cajoling and begging for more, be careful what you wish for.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    If you want all of the latest Penn State coaching search news and info, there's no better place than Lions247.

The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin. Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers for the opportunity to represent the Senior Circuit in this year's World Series.Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers are attempting to become MLB's first repeat World Series champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row in 1998-2000.Dodgers vs. Brewers scheduleDateStart time/scoreTVLive streamGame 1Mon., Oct. 138:08 p.m ETTBSHBO MaxGame 2Tue., Oct. 148:08 p.m ETTBSHBO MaxGame 3Thur., Oct. 166:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 4Fri., Oct. 178:38 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 5 (if nec.)Sat., Oct. 188:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 6 (if nec.)Mon., Oct. 205:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 7 (if nec.)Tue., Oct. 218:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxDodgers vs. Brewers: Game 1 infoTime: 8:08 p.m. ET | Date: Mon., Oct. 13Location: American Family Field -- MilwaukeeTV channel: TBS | Live stream: HBO MaxStarting pitchers: LHP Blake Snell (LAD) vs. TBA (MIL)Odds: Dodgers -151, Brewers +124 (via DraftKings)NLCS storylinesDodgers: As noted in the introduction, the Dodgers are seeking to become MLB's first repeat World Series champion since the Yankees won three in a row back in 1998-2000. The Dodgers' road here included series victories against the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies. During the regular season, the Dodgers went 0-6 against the Brewers and were outscored by a 15-run margin. Of course, the Dodgers would point out that all of those games occurred in a small window in July, Brewers: The Brewers, by virtue of having the best record in all of MLB, earned a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. That means they'll host four games if this goes seven. Additionally, it means that their series against the Cubs represented their first action of the playoffs. The Brewers are looking for their first pennant in either league since 1982.\nSeries predictionThis should be a great series between two of the best managed organizations in sports. I picked the Dodgers to win the World Series, meaning I'm obligated to choose them here. That isn't meant as disrespect to the Brewers -- it wouldn't register as a surprise if MLB's best team during the regular season took this series -- it just means I owe it to everyone to be consistent with these things. Hence: Dodgers in seven.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The injury will necessitate surgery and end Warner's season.Warner's injury occurred when he and teammate, safety Ji'Ayir Brown, converged while defending a running play. As Brown swung round while tackling Buccaneers running back Rachaad White, Brown rolled into Warner's right leg, pinning his foot under and twisting it at a bad angle. Warner remained down after the play before a cart took him off the field with his right leg in an air cast.\nSpeaking to reporters after the 49ers' 30-19 loss, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed that Warner had broken and dislocated his ankle. As a result of the injury and subsequent surgery, Warner will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.Warner's loss marks yet another devastating blow to the 49ers, who have already lost a number of star players including two of their best on defense. Warner's injury comes three weeks after defensive end Nick Bosa, another pillar of San Francisco's defense, was lost for the season with a torn ACL suffered in Week 3. The 49ers are also dealing with injuries to quarterback Brock Purdy, tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk among others.\n\n        \n            \n                Jauan Jennings injury: 49ers WR played through five broken ribs, ankle sprains in Week 6 loss to Buccaneers\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWarner has been one of the best inside linebackers in all of pro football since entering the league in 2018.

At that point, they had time to run one play, so Bengals coach Zac Taylor basically had three options: He could have Joe Flacco throw a Hail Mary, he could send out his punt team or he could have McPherson attempt a 67-yard field goal. Justin Tucker holds the NFL record for longest field goal, which he set back in September 2021 when he kicked a 66-yarder while playing for the Baltimore Ravens. As for McPherson, he drilled a 64-yarder in warmups, so Taylor decided to send out his kicker to try and break Tucker's record. McPherson DRILLED the kick, which ended up bouncing off the crossbar and going in. \nHere's a view from field level and as the kick goes in, you can hear a collective \"whoa\" from the crowd. \nThe only problem for McPherson is that the kick didn't count because Packers coach Matt LaFleur called a timeout just before the Bengals snapped the ball. Most teams won't bother calling a timeout in this situation because the kick is so long, but LaFleur did and it ended up working/ On his second attempt, the Bengals kicker came up short. With McPherson missing, that means Tucker will get to keep his record for at least another week, but it seems like it's only a matter of time before it goes down. \nOne kicking record has already fallen this year and that came in Week 4 when Buccaneers kicker Chase McLaughlin hit the longest outdoor field goal in NFL history with a 65-yarder against the Eagles. McLaughlin's kick is one of the just three field goals in NFL history from 65 yards or long joining Tucker (66) and Brandon Aubrey, who hit a 65-yarder last season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 6 of the Fantasy Football season looked a lot different than anything we saw through the first four weeks of the season. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 6, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 7 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon. Kimani Vidal, RB, ChargersAlthough reports surfaced shortly before the Chargers' Week 6 game suggesting Hasaan Haskins would be the lead back for the Chargers in Omarion Hampton's (IR) absence, it was Vidal who established himself as the new playmaker in Los Angeles' offense. Vidal racked up 124 rushing yards on just 18 carries and added 14 yards on three catches. He also caught a receiving touchdown to jolt his week forward. Hampton is expected to miss more than minimum four weeks after being placed on injured reserve this week. Vidal is a potential short-term RB2 in leagues where you need RB help.Zonovan Knight, RB, CardinalsDespite Michael Carter leading the way for most of Week 5, it was Zonovan Bam Knight who drew the start in Week 6. Unlike Haskins, Knight made the most of it by cashing in on his red zone opportunity. Knight finished with 34 yards rushing but he also saw double digit carries, the red zone role and cashed in with a touchdown. He added a 20-yard reception. Knight will be more of a FLEX play in Trey Benson's absence but could cash in on touchdowns in any given week in this role. Kayshon Boutte, WR, PatriotsBoutte has been up and down in a Patriots offense that likes to spread the wealth in the passing game. Despite not seeing a consistent target share, Boutte has cashed in on some of the biggest splash plays in the New England pass game this year. With Drake Maye at quarterback, splash plays are plenty. With Maye delivering 20-plus throws every week, Boutte is a big play threat in any matchup where injuries have left you thing at FLEX. Therefore, he's worth rostering everywhere. In Week 6, Boutte caught five passes for 93 yards and two touchdowns -- a stat line likely to land him in the top-10 at his position for the week.\nZay Jones, WR, CardinalsWith Kyler Murray sidelined and Marvin Harrison Jr. injured during Arizona's Week 6 game, it was anyone's guess who Jacoby Brissett would lean in on the pass game. That player was former waiver wire add Zay Jones. Jones racked up 79 yards receiving on five catches and was targeted eight times by Brisett. That's a role worth rostering until we get more news on Murray and Harrison Jr. Tyler Higbee, TE, RamsAfter Puka Nacua got hurt, the Rams needed to find other solutions in their pass game. Higbee racked up four receptions for 40 yards and a touchdown. If Nacua is forced to miss action for any extended period of time, Higbee could become of Matt Stafford's leading two options in the red zone and in moving the chains. This could offer him an opportunity to emerge as a TE2.Oronde Gadsen II, TE, Chargers Gadsen flashed his talent earlier this season but his role never grew right after it. In Week 6, with Quentin Johnston out, Gadsen played an expanded role in the Chargers offense. He caught seven passes for 68 yards and played a key role in moving the chains for the Chargers. He was also targeted eight times. Justin Herbert and Gadsen have a clear rapport that's getting stronger, Gadsen was one of the most dominant players at his position and he has one of the most talented throwers in the NFL at quarterback. That's the upside case for a back-end bench stash.\nLil'Jordan Humphrey, WR, Giants The Giants needed to do something about their receiver corps after losing Malik Nabers and Darius Slayton in consecutive weeks to injuries. Those were their top two options, but practice squad call up Lil'Jordan Humphrey was one of Jaxson Dart's top targets in the summer. They even connected on an explosive play touchdown in the preseason,. Their rapport was obvious in Week 6 as Dart connected with Humphrey both downfield and on key third down conversions. He finished with 88 yards on four catches and was targeted a healthy eight times. He is likely to be called up to the active roster again next week. \n            ",

Harrison banged his head on the turf inside Lucas Oil Stadium after a tackle and was slow to get up before being evaluated by team trainers and being taken to the blue injury tent.Playing in his first game at the home of his Pro Football Hall of Fame father who starred in Indianapolis, Harrison walked to the locker room with 6:59 left in the first half after finishing with two catches for 32 yards. This is Harrison's second concussion sustained in the NFL after he suffered his first last season in Week 6, and he'll need to clear the league's mandatory concussion protocol before being cleared to return.With Harrison sidelined for the second half, the Cardinals found the end zone twice on Jacoby Brissett touchdown passes to Trey McBride and Greg Dortch, but it wasn't enough. Jonathan Taylor's 1-yard touchdown run with 4:32 remaining capped a nine-play, 66-yard drive that gave Indianapolis the lead for good at 31-27.\nHarrison, Arizona's top pass-catcher this season with 20 receptions and 306 yards, has been coming on strong after a slow start to the season when he managed only seven catches over his first two games. Harrison said the buzz about his lack of targets was a \"silly conversation\" amid Arizona's unbeaten start, but the Cardinals have since lost four consecutive games.The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft out of Ohio State finished his rookie campaign with 62 catches for 885 yards and eight touchdowns. Arizona's starting quarterback, Kyler Murray, attributed Harrison's lack of involvement in the passing game to simply game plan reasons.\n\"I say it every time, do I wish all of them could get 10 targets a game, of course,\" Murray said last month. \"There's only one ball.  We've been playing this game for a long time. We all understand how it goes. Some days he might get 10, some days he might get three. … You never know.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs (2-3) are set to host the Detroit Lions (4-1) in NFL Week 6 action on 'Sunday Night Football.' Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are off to a bumpy start this season, and are coming off of a disappointing 31-28 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5. Meanwhile, Jared Goff and the Lions have won four straight since falling to the Green Bay Packers in Week 1, most recently topping the Cincinnati Bengals 37-24. Kansas City has a clean injury report, while Detroit has ruled seven players out and lists safety Brian Branch (ankle), safety Kerby Joseph (knee) and receiver Kalif Raymond (neck) as questionable. Kickoff from Arrowhead Stadium is set for 8:20 p.m. ET. After opening at -3, Kansas City is now a 2.5-point favorite in the latest Lions vs. Chiefs odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 51.5, up three points from the opener.

The Lions currently lead the league with 34.8 average points per game thanks to the plethora of offensive weapons Goff has at his disposal. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery are both averaging over 60 rushing yards per game and will face a Chiefs defense that allows 4.9 yards per carry.

Mahomes threw four touchdowns at Arrowhead in Week 4, and will go up against a Lions defense that is dealing with injuries. The Chiefs defense, meanwhile, is only allowing 190.2 passing yards per game, and should be enough to slow a hot Detroit offense that will have Amon-Ra St. Brown (wrist) in the lineup. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Chiefs vs. Lions picksFor Sunday Night Football in NFL Week 6, the model is leaning under the total, and also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Lions vs. Chiefs, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

Apparent dysfunction in the locker room could be partially to blame for the disastrous start to the campaign, as quarterback Tua Tagovailoa brought to light after the loss a disconnect between team leadership and some of the players on the Dolphins roster.Tagovailoa said players have been late to or outright skipped players-only meetings during the miserable six-game stretch. Players-only meetings are already generally hallmarks of a disastrous season, and attendance issues only add another layer to the dysfunction.\"I think it starts with the leadership and helping articulate that for the guys, and then what we're expecting out of the guys,\" Tagovailoa said postgame of preventing the season from going further off the rails. \"We're expecting 'this.' Are we getting that? Are we not getting that? We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late, guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There's a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make this mandatory? Do we not have to make this mandatory? It's a lot of things of that nature that we've gotta get cleaned up, and it starts with the little things like that.\"The Dolphins reportedly held a players-only meeting after their Week 1 blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts. It is unclear how many times the roster convened privately from the coaching staff since then.\nThat initial meeting did not produce immediate results in the win column. The Dolphins proceeded to lose a pair of divisional games to the New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills in the ensuing two weeks. Their lone victory on the year came in Week 4 against the New York Jets.Team leadership has come into question throughout the year. Miami's captain list was a particularly notable one when the team announced it ahead of the season opener because of one specific omission. It is a six-man group including Tagovailoa, fullback Alec Ingold, linebacker Jordyn Brooks, center Aaron Brewer, defensive tackle Zach Sieler and edge rusher Bradley Chubb. Absent from that group is star wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who was excluded from the captaincy role for the first time in his Dolphins career after he made comments indicating a potential desire to leave the team.\nCoach Mike McDaniel is far from immune to scrutiny, too. One month into the season, McDaniel appeared to have one of the hottest seats in the league. He now stands just one game above .500 for his career and is at the helm of what looks like a sinking ship.\n            \n    ",

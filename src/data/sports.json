    "body": "\n        R-Truth became WWE's biggest headline over the summer, nearly three decades into his professional wrestling career. R-Truth left the company, and Ron Killings emerged shortly after. But just as quickly as Killings arrived, R-Truth again took his place. R-Truth has portrayed numerous variations of his character over 28 years. It underscores his longevity. Take \"Ron Cena,\" for example, the John Cena-inspired character that wrestled him at Saturday Night's Main Event, and appears in WWE 2K25's new \"Farewell Edition\" honoring Cena's retirement tour. On June 1, Killings announced that his WWE contract had expired. By all indications, it was true. One week later, amid intense fan backlash and backstage support, he returned, costing Cena and Logan Paul a match against Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso at Money in the Bank. His comeback was met with roaring approval, a sense that the fans' voices were heard. The next week on Raw, R-Truth cut his hair in a symbolic gesture, claiming that \"the truth\" had set him free, and he was now Ron Killings. \"I had the world watching me,\" R-Truth told CBS Sports about cutting his hair. \"That was the perfect moment, dog. I seized a moment in time.\"\nIt was the first time in a long time that he had portrayed a serious character on WWE programming. It was refreshing and exciting, and it quickly disappeared without a trace. Killings disappeared from television not long after, and within two months, he had reverted to his long-time comedic R-Truth gimmick. WWE's creative team received criticism for abandoning the storyline, but R-Truth claims everything played out as it should have.\"It went where it was supposed to,\" R-Truth said when discussing why Killings disappeared from TV. \"Ron Killings created R-Truth. Those hundreds of millions of fans who spoke and up-roared. They wanted R-Truth back. Ron Killings was the rebellious one who spoke up for R-Truth.\"R-Truth argued that Ron \"The Truth\" Killings, an extension of himself that he portrayed before returning to WWE in 2008, never garnered the fandom that R-Truth did.\n\"Ron Killings has been around for years, but people had never come together in lockstep like that. They did that for R-Truth. You feel me?\" R-Truth said. \"I wanted Ron Killings to go where he was supposed to go. He made a statement; he had eyes on him. When John Cena came back, R-Truth came back. Ron Killings was the cavalry.\"R-Truth went one step further, suggesting that pressing forward with Killings would have been a selfish act. After all, according to him, it was R-Truth that fans so feverishly rallied behind after his brief WWE exit in June.\"I think [Ron Killings] was a selfish-type deal, more of a selfish move. I had more than 100 million views that wanted R-Truth. If numbers are real, that was the power of numbers.\"\nOne thing R-Truth can take pride in his how involved he's been in Cena's retirement tour. Though neither match stands out, R-Truth is one of the rare people, along with undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes, who can say he's wrestled Cena twice this year. It's a unique honor considering the treasure trove of rivalries Cena's had in his long career.\"I'm tickled pink, dog. I love it,\" said Truth, whose \"Ron Cena\" character appears as a playable character in the new edition of WWE 2K25. \"It's a humbling thing. I feel honored. I feel appreciated. I feel like a lot of fans know the history we've had. People have paid attention. There are so many things that go around with that. It's hard to pick one good emotion out of it.\" \n            ",

Hendrickson is officially questionable with a hip injury, and he did not practice all week. NFL Media initially reported he was a \"long shot\" to suit up. His situation was made tougher given that Cincy is on a short week. The NFL's reigning sack leader recorded 15 tackles, four sacks and eight quarterback hits in the first six games of the season. Hendrickson recorded 39 sacks over the last three seasons, which are more than any other player. In what is good news for the Bengals, they get back No. 17 overall pick Shemar Stewart on the edge, who hasn't played since Week 2 due to an ankle injury. Joseph Ossai and Myles Murphy are the other pass rushers for the Bengals. The former ranks second among all Bengals players in sacks this season with two. \nThe Bengals enter Week 7 on a four-game losing streak, which is their longest since 2020. They have been outscored 140-55 in those four losses. While the offense lost quarterback Joe Burrow to a turf toe injury in Week 2, and replaced him first with Jake Browning before trading for Joe Flacco, the Cincy defense has again struggled. The Bengals allow 394.2 total yards per game, which ranks second-worst in the league, and 30.5 points per game, which ranks third-worst. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The good times kept rolling for members of the European Ryder Cup team Thursday at Delhi Golf Club with the man who holed the most crucial putt at Bethpage Black holding the solo lead after 18 holes of play. Shane Lowry fired a blemish-free 64 in the opening round of the 2025 India Championship to sit at 8 under for the tournament and one stroke clear of Keita Nakajima of Japan.\"You know, 64 is a really nice score,\" Lowry said. \"It's not that hard when you are out there but when you start missing fairways it becomes quite tricky. When I saw the draw, I was really happy. Being with the lads, we've had some good things happen the last few weeks. I haven't played with Luke [Donald] that much in tournaments but obviously I know him pretty well and we all fed off each other and it was nice.\"Lowry played the opening refrain with good friend Tommy Fleetwood, who signed for a 68 that included a hole-out eagle on the par-5 14th, as well as European skipper Luke Donald, who matched Fleetwood's 68 to occupy a spot inside the top 10. Comfortable groupings were a theme throughout the tee sheet on the par 72 with world No. 2 Rory McIlroy playing alongside Ben Griffin and Viktor Hovland.The American topped the three-ball with a 68 of his own highlighted by a fast finish on the outward side of Delhi GC. The two-time winner on the PGA Tour this season was 1 under before catching fire in his final six holes, playing them in 4 under to surge up the leaderboard.\n\"It's a challenging course. You need to be in the fairway,\" Griffin said. \"If you're in the rough you've got to make sure you have a good angle into the pins. I felt like I did a pretty good job of keeping it in the fairway most of the day. I was in the rough a couple times, but a couple of those holes were par 5s where I was laying up and it all worked out. I was able to post a good number and hopefully can keep the pedal down the rest of the week.\"Hovland never found his stride in the scoring department as he carded just two birdies against one bogey. He played his first nine holes in even par as he strung together nine straight pars to open up his tournament. Meanwhile, the tournament headliner, McIlroy, made more headlines when he chose to keep his driver in the locker room and out of the bag given the narrow, tight fairways Delhi GC is known for.\"Dog was out of the bag, probably asleep in the locker,\" McIlroy said. \"Yeah… I was sort of thinking about it last night before I went to bed. Well, sometimes if you're really conservative off a par 5 today, you might have like a 5-wood into the green, but I'm never going to hit driver, so I just thought I've got to 2-iron, 3-iron, 4-iron all the way through, and then I've got a 5-wood just in case I need to hit it for an approach shot on a par 5. But I just don't see any hole out there that I hit to hit it more than say 260, 270 off the tee.\"\nMcIlroy got off to a precarious start as an opening birdie was quickly offset by bogeys on Nos. 11 and 12 -- his second and third holes of his round. The Northern Irishman started to bounce around the turn as he made his way to the other side of the golf course at 1 under with birdies on both of the par 5s on his first nine.The circles kept on getting penciled onto his scorecard as he rolled in a long distance connection on the par-3 7th to get as deep as 4 under for his round. At the time, only two names topped McIlroy's on the leaderboard, but the grand slam winner would not get out of his initial 18 holes without one last run in with adversity. His tee shot drifted off line and into the brush on the par-5 8th leading to a bogey and an opening 69.\n\"I think it's similar strategy to what I did today, especially off the tee,\" McIlroy said. \"You just have to get the ball in the fairway. The rough is unpredictable. You get a lot of fliers like I did the last two there. Yeah, maybe being a little bit less aggressive with approach shots and getting it on the right side of the pin.\"\nIn addition to Fleetwood, Griffin and Donald, Americans Brian Harman and Michael Kim both enjoyed strong performances in Round 1 and signed for 68s. The two efforts came with unorthodox lead ups to the competition as Harman has his manager, Jeremy Elliott, carrying his bag while Kim came into the tournament blind after posting on social media earlier in the week that he was stuck in Japan due to some visa issues. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With a key ACC game against SMU looming this weekend, Clemson may be without starting quarterback Cade Klubnik. After rolling his ankle late in last week's win over Boston College, coach Dabo Swinney labeled Klubnik as \"hour-to-hour.\"Speaking Wednesday night with reporters, Swinney said Klubnik has been \"limited\" in practice. The Tigers quarterback has been dealing with soreness all week, but Swinney said Klubnik has made good progress.\"Just been limited,\" Swinney said of Klubnik's status. \"We're taking our time with him. Like I said yesterday, he's gone from day-to-day to hour-to-hour. Hopefully tomorrow he'll be minute-to-minute. … Literally getting better every hour. Just being smart with him, and he's been doing what he needed to do.\"Klubnik tweaked his ankle in the second half of the Tigers' 41-10 win over the Eagles, and Swinney said the team elected to hold him out at that point. After the game, Swinney said Klubnik was already dealing with nagging soreness on that ankle.\"He'd been nursing a little bit of a sore ankle anyway,\" Swinney said. \"You've probably seen it taped up.\"\nWith so much uncertainty surrounding Klubnik's status for this game, the spread has shifted quite a bit toward the Mustangs. The Tigers opened as 10-point favorites, but that line dropped to 5.5, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.After a slow start to the season, Klubnik led Clemson to consecutive wins over North Carolina and Boston College. In those two games, he threw for a combined 534 yards and five touchdowns.Clemson will offer a more concrete update on Klubnik's status Thursday night when the first ACC availability report of the week gets released.\nIf Klubnik is unable to play against Boston College, redshirt sophomore Christopher Vizzina would get the start. A four-star recruit in the 2023 signing class, Vizzina has thrown for 227 yards and one interception on 26-of-48 passing in his career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are various reasons why a rookie might have to play, including injuries and simply being the best option. Reflecting upon the first six weeks of the NFL season, some of the post-draft notions about classes have come to fruition. The top three teams in terms of snaps played by rookies, for instance, were all consistently lauded among post-draft grades. It is interesting, but probably not surprising, that the eight teams that have deployed rookies the most are also currently top 10 in the projected 2026 NFL Draft order. As teams start thinking about the future, they are attempting to learn which players on the current roster will remain and which positions may need to be turned over when roster construction resumes next spring.Without further ado, here are the league's teams ranked, from most to least, by rookie snaps played this season: Top five\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Browns (19.8%)Cleveland is the only team in which rookies have played at least 15% of the total snaps on each side of the ball. A total of 13 rookies have taken snaps for the Browns this season, which represents nearly a quarter of the active roster. Defensive tackle Mason Graham, linebacker Carson Schwesinger, running back Quinshon Judkins tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and quarterback Dillon Gabriel are among the notable participants.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Patriots (16.9%)  New England had been discussed as having arguably the best draft class. To this point, the production has met the expectations. Nine players have taken snaps for the Patriots; four of which have played at least 100 snaps. Offensive linemen Will Campbell and Jared Wilson are shouldering the load on offense, while safety Craig Woodson is the key figure on defense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jets (16.2%)The Jets were another team that was widely praised for its draft efforts and the group has delivered to this point. Seven have played for the AFC East franchise and five of those have seen extended playing time, including offensive tackle Armand Membou and tight end Mason Taylor. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. 49ers (15.1%)Only five rookies have taken snaps for San Francisco this season, but each of them has played at least 100 snaps, including undrafted free agent safety Marques Sigle. First-round pick Mykel Williams has gone from a complementary piece opposite Nick Bosa to a focal point of the team's pass rush. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Ravens (15.1%)Baltimore is a unique case because it has received a measly 11 offensive snaps from wide receiver LaJohntay Wester. Injuries on defense have forced the rookie class to play significant snaps, including first-round safety Malaki Starks, edge rusher Mike Green and linebacker Teddye Buchanan.Middle class6. Titans (14.7%)7. Panthers (12.9%)8. Saints (12.9%)9. Dolphins (12.1%)10. Bengals (12.0%)11. Commanders (11.6%)12. Buccaneers (11.5%)13. Giants (10.9%)14. Seahawks (10.4%)15. Falcons (10.2%)16. Texans (10.0%)17. Chargers (9.2%)18. Eagles (9.2%)19. Chiefs (9.0%)20. Raiders (8.7%)21. Lions (8.2%)22. Jaguars (7.7%)23. Cowboys (7.2%)24. Bills (6.9%)25. Cardinals (6.6%)26. Vikings (6.4%)27. Colts (6.3%)Bottom five\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    28. Packers (5.9%)First-round wide receiver Matthew Golden is the only rookie to eclipse 100 snaps played for the Packers this season. Golden is the fourth-leading receiver on Green Bay's roster. They do have one of the most well-rounded rosters in the league, so there might not be many opportunities for young players. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    29. Bears (5.8%)Eight rookies have played for Chicago this season, but none of them have emerged into the starting lineup. The Bears are a team that could play rookies more as the season progresses and they become more integrated into their system. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    30. Steelers (5.2%)First-round pick Derrick Harmon missed some time early in the season, but he is the only starter from this class. In fact, Pittsburgh has gotten 27 total snaps out of its offensive rookies. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    31. Chargers (4.5%)The Chargers embraced several rookies last season, so there may not have been a lot of room for newcomers. Running back Omarion Hampton is now dealing with an injury. Production heavily skews offense as defensive tackle Jamaree Caldwell is essentially the only contributor on that side of the ball. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    32. Rams (3.3%)The other Los Angeles team is also at the bottom of the list. The Rams are the only team with fewer than 5% snaps played by rookies on each side of the ball. Los Angeles already has a really young roster. The Rams have made one first-round pick, edge rusher Jared Verse, since Jared Goff in 2016. \nThey did trade out of the 2025 first round to pick up an additional first-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025-26 NBA season tips off on Tuesday, Oct. 21, with two games. In the first matchup, the Rockets clash with the defending NBA champion Thunder, followed by a Pacific Division matchup between the Warriors and Lakers. That means the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings are taking shape, and the latest Fantasy basketball ADP listing has Denver's Nikola Jokic, Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama as consensus top picks.Before making any drafting decisions, you need to be able to trust your picks at the top of any Fantasy basketball draft. To do that, you need to identify those 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts. That's where the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets are necessary from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr., who is barely being picked in the top 100 picks in many drafts. Despite struggling from deep through the first 45 games of last season with the Los Angeles Clippers, he turned things around in a big way once he was acquired by the Bucks. He finished the regular season connecting on 40.8% of his 3-pointers in his final 30 games with Milwaukee, averaging 11.7 points per game.In the postseason, he continued to light it up from deep, hitting on 46.7% of his 3-pointers, averaging 11.2 points in five games. Porter is expected to be the Bucks' starting point guard, and is just one of two players on the 2025-26 roster to average 2.9 assists or more. For his career, Porter has averaged 4.6 assists per game. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of 137. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was acquired by the New Orleans Pelicans from the Washington Wizards during the offseason. Despite his somewhat lofty numbers, he finds himself in a situation where he needs to be a complementary piece to Zion Williamson. He also may have to take a lesser role behind New Orleans' two lottery picks in Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears. If they emerge in their rookie seasons, Poole could definitely see his production go down.Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but he may not be worth taking. In fact, SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are projected by many to be picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts.

There are also two MLB playoff games in the league championship series on Thursday evening, offering new users a great opportunity to use the latest bet365 bonus code CBSBET365, which offers $200 in bonus bets after placing a first wager of $5 or more. The Steelers are 5.5-point road favorites, while the over/under is 44.5 for Thursday Night Football.SportsLine's proven computer model is backing Pittsburgh to cover the spread, and it is also targeting the Brewers and Mariners in their respective matchups. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB and college football game 10,000 times. It entered the ALCS and NLCS rounds of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. It has excelled making home run prop picks this season, returning nearly 30 units of profit. It's also generated a betting profit of well over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and is a profitable 39-27 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Thursday's top picks, best betsSteelers -5.5 vs. BengalsBrewers +160 vs. DodgersMariners -125 vs. Blue JaysCombining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at bet365 would result in a payout of +793 (risk $100 to win $793). Bet it at bet365 here:Steelers -5.5 vs. BengalsPittsburgh carries a three-game winning streak into this matchup, while Cincinnati has lost four consecutive games. The Bengals can only blame some of their shortcomings on the absence of quarterback Joe Burrow (toe), as their defense has given up at least 27 points in five straight games. They have only covered the spread once during their losing skid, while Pittsburgh has covered in all three of its recent wins. Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a 10-to-3 TD-to-INT ratio after tossing a pair of touchdown passes in a win over Cleveland last week. The model has the Steelers covering the spread in 57% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:Brewers +160 vs. DodgersWhile Los Angeles has taken a commanding 2-0 lead in the NLCS, there are still some things to be concerned about from a Dodgers perspective. Three MVPs in Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman are 4-for-24 (.167) in the series with just one home run and three RBIs, and the Los Angeles bullpen continues to be a major concern. The Brewers won all six of their meetings with the Dodgers in the regular season, defeating Game 3 starter Tyler Glasnow twice. Milwaukee wins in 48% of simulations on Thursday night, providing clear value as a lengthy underdog. Bet it at bet365 now:Mariners -125 vs. Blue JaysToronto got back in the series with a decisive victory on Wednesday night, but it turns to 41-year-old pitcher Max Scherzer on Thursday. The three-time Cy Young Award winner is past his prime, going 5-5 with a 5.19 ERA during the regular season. Additionally, he has not made a start this postseason, so he has not pitched since Sept. 24. Mariners starter Luis Castillo went 11-8 with a 3.54 ERA in the regular season and has not allowed a run across six innings this postseason. He is a big reason why the model has the Mariners winning in 59% of simulations to take a 3-1 series lead. Bet it at bet365 here:Looking for more NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Thursday.

    "body": "\n        Thanks to the Blue Jays bludgeoning of the Mariners on Wednesday in Game 3 of the ALCS, we now know there are at least two days left with multiple baseball games in 2025. Game 3 of the Dodgers vs. Brewers NLCS starts at 6:08 p.m. ET on Thursday with Game 4 of the M's vs. Jays ALCS follows at 8:33 p.m. ET. There will be two games again Friday, now that we know the ALCS has to go at least five gamesHere in this bets column, my hunch for Game 3 of the ALCS was that the Mariners would win a low-scoring game. That was unbelievably far off. Good thing I noted that I felt confident about neither of those things and wanted to avoid them. As the saying goes, sometimes the best bets are the ones you don't make. The ones we did make? Riding with George Springer and Cal Raleigh and both paid off, so in the actual plays, it was a 2-0 day. Let's keep that momentum going, unlike the Mariners in Game 3. Lines courtesy of DraftKings.Shohei Ohtani 3+ H+R+RBI (+118)He's just about to break out. I can feel it coming. I'm sure you can, too. Ohtani was 1 for 20 in the previous five games before Game 2 of the NLCS. He struck out to start the game. But then next time up he hit one of the hardest balls of the game, which just happened to be right at Brewers right fielder Jackson Chourio for a lineout. Later in the game, he came through with a single through a drawn-in infield against a left-hander. \nHe's coming home and while the expectation is that lefty José Quintana will be the bulk guy for the Brewers, he won't pitch all game and Ohtani has already gotten some looks at Aaron Ashby. Plus, Ohtani isn't even actually bad against lefties (.279/.344/.554 during the regular season) and Quintana allowed a higher OPS to lefties than righties this season. Oh, and in five career at-bats against Quintana, Ohtani has a home run. If you have a bonus home run play, you could do worse. I know his odds are always shorter than everyone else's, but I'm feeling a Shohei bomb in this one. George Springer over 1.5 H+R+RBI (-106)I'm riding the hot hand here. OK, so basically every Blue Jays player is \"hot\" after Game 3, but I'm hot with playing this Springer prop so I'm running it back. The Blue Jays' leadoff man has now scored eight runs in seven playoff games this season with three home runs. He's one of the most prolific home run players in playoff history at this point. He looks locked in at the plate and his early count aggression bodes well in T-Mobile Park with the alternative being trying to fend off two-strike pitches in such a (normally) pitcher-friendly venue. \nSpringer in his career against Mariners' starter Luis Castillo is 3 for 15, but he was 2 for 6 with a double this season. Max Scherzer over 1.5 earned runs allowed (-115)Man, what is this? I know that Shane Bieber overall threw the ball well in T-Mobile Park against the Mariners' offense in Game 3, but he allowed two runs in the first inning. He had been much better than Scherzer of late. Scherzer had a 9.00 ERA (25 runs on 37 hits in 25 innings) in his last six regular-season starts. He's 41 years old with an extensive injury history and hasn't pitched since Sept. 24. The only explanation here is the Blue Jays are using Scherzer for just an inning as an opener with lefty Eric Lauer coming in relief. \nIt seems, though, that the Blue Jays are betting on Scherzer being a \"gamer\" here. He's proven that's the case time and again. I'm not doubting his intestinal fortitude. He's a mental badass. Father Time is undefeated against all of sports on a physical level, though, and he's come for Scherzer late this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cincinnati Bengals host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday Night Football for an NFC North showdown to open the Week 7 NFL schedule. Aaron Rodgers, the oldest player in the NFL and turning 42 in December, starts for the Steelers, with Joe Flacco, who turns 41 in January, making his second start at quarterback for the Bengals. Both quarterbacks are at the final stages of their careers, but they look to bring their teams to another postseason run this fall. Kickoff from Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Steelers are 5.5-point favorites, according to the latest Bengals vs. Steelers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 45. The Steelers are -258 money line favorites (risk $258 to win $100), while the Bengals are +209 underdogs. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Steelers vs. Bengals. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Bengals vs. Steelers on Thursday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Steelers vs. Bengals on Thursday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

At Caesars, new users can get 20 100% sportsbook profit boosts with a $1 bet. Bettors can use any of these promotions for Bengals vs. Steelers for Thursday Night Football on Thursday, October 16.Steelers vs. Bengals betting preview, picksSteelers (-5.5) vs. BengalsThe Bengals traded for Joe Flacco in hopes of an offensive spark, but after being shut out in the first half and scoring only seven points over the first three quarters against the Packers, the Cincinnati offense continued to struggle under the veteran. The Bengals made a push in the fourth quarter, but the Packers never trailed and controlled the entire contest in their 27-18 victory. Flacco averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt for the game. Meanwhile, the Steelers enter on a three-game winning streak after a 23-9 win over the Browns last week. Aaron Rodgers completed 21 of 30 passes (70%) for 235 yards and two touchdowns against the Browns, and he's completed 68.8% of his passes with 10 touchdowns compared to three interceptions this season. The Bengals are 30th in scoring defense (30.5 ppg) this season, while allowing the second-most yards (394.2 per game) in the NFL. The model projects the Steelers to cover the spread in 56% of simulations.Over 45 pointsAlthough it took until the fourth quarter, the Bengals did start to move the ball more efficiently late as Flacco and receivers such as Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins formed their on-field chemistry on the fly, and that's something that could bode well for the Over heading into Thursday Night Football. Chase finished with 10 receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets as the veteran quarterback made a point to hyper-target the team's top pass-catcher. Meanwhile, Rodgers' presence has led to offensive stability in Pittsburgh, with the Steelers scoring more than 20 points in four of five games this season. They are 14th in the league in scoring at 23.8 ppg this season after ranking 20th at 21.9 ppg last year. However, the best predictor of this Over is the Bengals having one of the worst defenses in the NFL. Cincinnati has allowed at least 27 points in all five games this season, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 52% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

The over/under signals expectations of a high-scoring game. Historically, Baltimore has had strong success vs. NFC opponents - Lamar Jackson in particular holds a superb record against NFC teams. Meanwhile, Detroit is showing good ATS (against the spread) numbers in road games since 2023, which suggests they might be competitive even as underdogs. Some bettors may believe Detroit could cover the spread based on their recent offensive outburst against Chicago and the idea that Baltimore's defense is vulnerable in certain areas due to injuries to players like LB Kyle Van Noy and DT Nnamdi Madubuike. 55-60% of betting tickets are on the Ravens to cover at sportsbooks with more than 70% of total tickets on the over. More than 70% of moneyline wagers are also on the Ravens. Pro football on Monday night betting sites and promosFootball on Monday night is always one of the most eagerly game broadcasts of the week, so some of the best promos from online sportsbooks often coincide with the matchup.

Bengals vs. Steelers kicks off NFL Week 7 at 8:15 p.m. ET, and we'll also see Game 3 of the NLCS and Game 4 of the ALCS on Thursday, with Dodgers vs. Brewers at 6:08 p.m. ET, followed by Mariners vs. Blue Jays at 8:33 p.m. ET.Picks from all three games are among our Thursday MLB and NFL best bets at BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts. Get the newest BetMGM bonus code and take advantage of one of the best sportsbook promos. Get started now:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 42-25 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also entered the league championship round of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. Anybody following its MLB betting and NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Thursday's best bets at BetMGMBengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)Combining these three picks into a Thursday MLB and NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +780 (risk $100 to win $780). Bet it at BetMGM here:Bengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)\"The Steelers are coming off their most impressive win of the season, but you could blame the awful spot for Cleveland, and I'm still not sure what they do better than most teams. The defense looks a lot better now that it's healthier, but it was healthy in Week 1 when it got gashed by a Jets team that is 50-50 to complete a forward pass most weeks,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The 5.1 yards per play on offense is comparable to the Panthers and Raiders. Basically, this doesn't profile as a team that should be laying this many points on the road, especially in a divisional matchup, even against a bad Bengals team.\" Back Cincinnati at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Payroll disparity is showing a bit with Los Angeles winning seven of its first eight postseason games. Now the Dodgers will trot out Tyler Glasnow as their Game 3 starter and Glasnow has thrown 7 2/3 scoreless innings this postseason. However, he does have a 4.55 career ERA against Milwaukee and the Brewers have only been beaten by two runs or more twice during the 2025 MLB Playoffs. Jose Quintana will likely pitch an extended stretch for Milwaukee tonight and he threw three scoreless innings of his own in his only postseason appearance thus far. Road teams have won every game of the NLCS and ALCS so far, and the model sees value here with the Brewers winning in 48% of simulations. Bet the Brewers at BetMGM here:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)The Blue Jays finally got on the board with a 13-4 win in Game 3 on Wednesday, but Seattle still holds a 2-1 advantage in the series. The Mariners should also feel pretty good sending Luis Castillo to the mound, as he has only given up one hit in six innings of work this postseason. Meanwhile, expected Toronto starter Max Scherzer posted a 10.20 ERA in September and is making his first appearance since Sept. 24 tonight. The model says Seattle wins in 59% of simulations. Bet Seattle at BetMGM:Want more NFL picks for Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets. Now, get against the spread, total and money-line picks for every NFL game on the Week 7 schedule, all from the model that's simulated every game 10,000 times. Also at SportsLine:You can also see weekend MLB picks from legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall, who is 177-165-3 (+2743) over his last 345 MLB picks. See his best bets right here. \n            ",

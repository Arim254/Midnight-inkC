Montero died after being involved in a motor vehicle accident in his native Venezuela, per local media.Montero made his big-league debut in 2011 after a period of being recognized as one of the game's brightest young talents thanks to his potent offensive potential. Baseball America ranked him as one of the six best prospects in three consecutive springs, from 2010-12, and MLB.com's 2011 scouting report noted that \"he might be an offensive-minded Mike Piazza type, whose bat will help people forget about any defensive deficiencies.\" Montero would appear in just 18 games with the Yankees, hitting .328/.406/.590 across 61 at-bats, before being shipped to the Seattle Mariners as part of a blockbuster four-player trade that also involved right-handed starting pitcher Michael Pineda, among others. (Montero had previously, according to rumor, been floated as part of a plausible deal for left-handed ace Cliff Lee, making him no stranger to that side of the business.)Montero recorded nearly 800 plate appearances with the Mariners in 226 games, hitting .247/.285/.383 (88 OPS+) with 24 home runs and 92 runs batted in. He would appear in his final big-league game in October 2015. He would later be claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays in March 2016, though he would never reach the majors with them. Montero would then spend part of the 2017 season as a member of the Baltimore Orioles system, again without reaching the game's highest level.Montero continued to play in the Venezuelan Winter League until the 2020-21 campaign.\n            \n    ",

We have to make plays. Nobody's gonna feel sorry for us.\"The Rams have been bitten by the injury bug this season, including half of the preseason's six team captains sidelined with season-ending ailments. Norvell said before the loss to Hawaii that his mindset hasn't changed despite early struggles.\n\"We haven't had the execution that we've wanted, but we've never quit. That's why I believed that better things are down the road for this group,\" Norvell said. \"I just think this is an example. This is just scratching the surface. We're capable. We have a lot of capable players that played closer to their potential tonight, which is exciting to see, but we'll build on it. A lot of these guys are just getting started.\"Norvell arrived at Colorado State ahead of the 2022 season following five seasons at Nevada, where he went 33-26 (23-17 Mountain West). Colorado State is moving from the Mountain West to the new version of the Pac-12 next season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Week 9 brings the final Saturday of October, as college football's regular season gets deeper into the second half with so much still at stake. The College Football Playoff picture features too many possible scenarios to count, and spots in every Power Four conference championship game remain squarely up for grabs.On the surface, this doesn't appear to be a blockbuster week of games, but those weeks often tend to produce big surprises. A couple of the nation's hottest teams could be particularly vulnerable, as No. 4 Alabama and No. 3 Texas A&M face challenging SEC road trips. The Crimson Tide are taking their six-game winning streak to South Carolina, while unbeaten A&M is traveling for an always tough night game at No. 20 LSU.Elsewhere, No. 2 Indiana will be looking to stay unbeaten as it welcomes a resurgent UCLA club to town. The SEC docket also features two games between pairs of one-loss teams, as No. 8 Ole Miss travels to No. 13 Oklahoma and No. 10 Vanderbilt hosts No. 15 Missouri. The Rebels, Commodores and Tigers have never reached the CFP, but each of them are firmly in the picture entering Week 9 action.Here is an early look at the odds for those games and many of the other Week 9 contests involving ranked teams as we dive deeper in the second half of the season.  Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook.  \nThe big games   \nOle Miss at Oklahoma (-3.5): Oklahoma is welcoming Ole Miss to Norman for the first time ever, as the pair of one-loss SEC teams square off in a high-stakes spot. This is the second leg of a brutal two-game road spurt for the Rebels, who fell 43-35 at Georgia in Week 8. Oklahoma is coming off a defensively dominant 26-7 win at South Carolina. The winner will stay firmly in the SEC title hunt, but the loser's margin for error in the College Football Playoff hunt will vanish.\nNo. 4 Alabama (-13.5) at South Carolina: South Carolina could desperately use the jolt that stunning Alabama would provide. The Gamecocks (3-4, 1-4 SEC) are in the midst of a five-game stretch against top-15 league foes and were offensively lifeless in the first two games. The Crimson Tide are riding a six-game winning streak but can't overlook a trip to Williams-Brice Stadium.\nNo. 15 Missouri at No. 10 Vanderbilt (-2.5): Looking for evidence that parity has arrived in college football? Look no further than a showdown between 6-1 Missouri and 6-1 Vanderbilt that carries significant College Football Playoff implications. The Tigers and Commodores are among the least-storied programs in the SEC, but they are both firmly in the mix for the CFP.\nNo. 3 Texas A&M (-2.5) at No. 20 LSU: LSU is backed into a corner, but playing a Death Valley night game gives the two-loss Tigers a fighting chance as they welcome the SEC's last unbeaten team to town. The Aggies are 0-6 at Tiger Stadium since joining the SEC, but this team might be be built different, as the Aggies have scored 40+ points in road wins over Notre Dame and Arkansas this season.\nUCLA at No. 2 Indiana (-24.5): This is where things start to get pretty scary for UCLA, as its final five games are against some of the Big Ten's best competition. But after three straight league victories, the Bruins must be taken seriously. Their unbeaten run under interim coach Tim Skipper would cross over into legendary status if it grew to include a road win over the Hoosiers.Best of the restNo. 16 Virginia (-9.5) at North CarolinaNo. 18 South Florida (-3.5) at MemphisNo. 25 Michigan (-13.5) at Michigan StateMinnesota at Iowa (-7.5)Syracuse at No. 7 Georgia Tech (-17.5)No. 11 BYU at Iowa State (-2.5)No. 22 Texas (-6.5) at Mississippi StateWisconsin at No. 6 Oregon (-34.5)Oklahoma State at No. 14 Texas Tech (-38.5)Baylor at No. 21 Cincinnati (-4.5)No. 17 Tennessee (-9.5) at KentuckyHouston at No. 24 Arizona State (-7.5)Stanford at No. 9 Miami (-29.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida has fired coach Billy Napier after a 3-4 start to the 2025 season, sources tell CBS Sports, ending a 22-23 tenure that never truly got out of neutral despite high hopes entering his fourth year with the program. The 46-year-old Napier has been on a near perpetual hot seat over the last couple years with only last season's win streak offering a brief reprieve.The Gators have five games remaining on the schedule, including rivalry showdowns with Georgia, Tennessee and Florida State. Napier finishes with a winning percentage of .489 -- the worst by a Florida coach since 1949. Wide receivers coach Billy Gonzales will be Florida's interim coach. \"Today I met with Coach Napier and informed him that a change in leadership of our football program would best serve the interests of the University of Florida,\" Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a statement. \"On behalf of Gator Nation, I want to sincerely thank Billy and his family for their tireless commitment to the Florida Gators. Billy built a tremendous culture of accountability and growth among the young men he led each day. His organized and detailed approach had a meaningful impact across all levels of our program.\nAs Coach Napier has often said, this is a results-driven business, and while his influence was positive, it ultimately did not translate into the level of success we expect on the field.\"Napier's buyout is $19.38 million, 50% of which must be paid out within the next 30 days. He had made $7.4 million annually as part of the original contract he signed with the program in November 2021.The Gators decided to move on from Napier a day after Florida won 23-21 over Mississippi State, a game during which Napier was serenaded by \"Fire Billy!\" chants. Florida intercepted Bulldogs quarterback Blake Shapen in its own territory -- Mississippi State was already in field goal range and could have kicked a 46-yarder to win -- with less than 30 seconds remaining to seal the win. All indications are Napier's fate and the timing of the firing were determined ahead of the game result. \n\n        \n            \n                College football coaching carousel tracker: Grades, analysis on coach changes, 2025-26 firings and hirings\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNapier entered the 2024 season with a seat that was lukewarm, at best, but it immediately heated up when the Gators were blown out at home in Week 1 by Miami and played poor offensively two weeks later at home against Texas A&M. Florida began to show promise throughout the rest of the season, however, when ballyhooed freshman QB DJ Lagway was pressed into starting duty in wake of an injury to Graham Mertz. Florida was competitive against Tennessee and Georgia before ending College Football Playoff hopes for LSU and Ole Miss in consecutive upsets. Florida won its final four games of the season, finishing with an 8-5 record, and optimism was high heading into 2025 where UF started the season ranked in the top 15 with eyes on being a darkhorse CFP contender. However, it became apparent early in the season that would not be the case following a Week 2 loss to South Florida as an 18-point favorite at home. Lagway's development stalled in part due to injuries that forced him to spend spring practice unable to throw and a wide receiver room that lacked chemistry due to its own injury-plagued fall camp. More questions piled up about the offense as Napier refused to relinquish his role as playcaller. His game management continued to be called into question, as was Florida's lacking discipline, highlighted during the USF loss in which Brendon Bett was suspended for spitting on a Bulls player three days after the sports world watched the Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Carter do the same in the NFL's season opener. These problems permeated throughout Napier's four seasons despite the coach's insistence that they were correctable\nNotable records for Billy Napier as Florida coach OpponentRecordvs. SEC12-16 (.429)vs. FBS18-23 (.439)vs. Power Four15-22 (.405)vs. Florida State1-2 (.333)vs. Miami (FL)0-2 (.000)Fresh off a five-year extension, athletic director Scott Stricklin will now oversee the hire of his third football coach while in charge, a somewhat surprising feat for an SEC athletic director. It will be Florida's fourth coach in 11 years and fifth since Urban Meyer stepped down following the 2010 season. The Gators are still attempting to reclaim the glory of the Meyer and Steve Spurrier eras in Gainesville that produced national championships and Heisman Trophy winners. \"Making this decision during the open date provides our team valuable time to regroup, refocus, and prepare for the challenges ahead,\" Stricklin added. \"The timing also allows us to conduct a thoughtful, thorough, and well-informed search for our next head coach. We remain fully committed to utilizing every resource available to identify the right leader to guide Gators Football into the future.I will conduct the search with a high degree of confidentiality to protect the privacy of those involved. The search will focus on the hiring of an elite football coach who will embody the standard we have at the University of Florida, and we will continue to provide all of the necessary resources for that coach, his staff and the players to be successful.\"\nWho will Florida hire next?The object of most Gators' fans desire is Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss head coach. Under Kiffin's leadership, Ole Miss is currently enjoying one of the more successful runs in program history. The Rebels have won 10+ games in three of the last four seasons, and Kiffin continues to show an ability to adapt to the changing environment of college football. Gauging actual interest -- on either side -- will come with time, but Kiffin's got the chops, the track record and SEC experience to be a perfectly sensible hire for the Gators.  \n        \n            \n                Florida coaching candidates: Lane Kiffin, James Franklin among options on hot board to replace Billy Napier\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOther candidates Florida is likely to consider include James Franklin and Jedd Fisch. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Florida Gators are searching for their next football coach following the dismissal of Billy Napier.

    "body": "\n        The winless New York Jets have made a change at quarterback, as coach Aaron Glenn benched Justin Fields in favor of veteran signal-caller Tyrod Taylor to begin the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Carolina Panthers.Fields completed 6 of 12 passes for just 46 yards, and rushed for 22 yards before being benched. New York trailed Carolina 10-3 at the halftime break. This change at quarterback comes one week after Fields registered minus-10 net passing yards in the Jets' London loss to the Denver Broncos. In that matchup, New York's offense recorded just 82 total yards.Glenn admitted to reporters earlier this week that Fields took a \"step back\" during the loss to the Broncos, but was not ready to bench him. \"I thought about this a lot last night. I thought about the question that was asked. When you look at what Justin did the games that he played,\" Glenn said. \"I didn't think he was bad at all. I actually thought he did some pretty good things in those four games, and this fifth game, he took a step back. And I'm with you guys 100%, and we can't have that. We have to get better than that. And he knows that. He knows that better than anyone. I don't think you just try to bench a player after having one true bad game, because I thought the other games he played fairly well.\"\nAfter spending last season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets that included $30 million guaranteed. In the first five games of the season, Fields completed 65% of his passes for 799 yards (159.8 passing yards per game), four touchdowns and zero interceptions. Taylor, who turned 36 in August, is in his second season with the Jets. A sixth-round pick out of Virginia Tech in 2011, Taylor has also played for the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and New York Giants. He owns a 28-29-1 record as a starter.\nThe Jets entered Sunday averaging 279.8 total yards per game, which ranked fourth-worst in the NFL, and 144.2 passing yards per game, which ranked dead last in the NFL. Glenn is the first Jets coach to ever begin his tenure 0-6, and he's clearly looking for a stabilizing force under center that can get this offense on the right track. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Seattle Mariners, who will enter Sunday's Game 6 against the Toronto Blue Jays with a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven American League ",
    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners, who will enter Sunday's Game 6 against the Toronto Blue Jays with a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, are on the cusp of the first World Series appearance in franchise history. This season is, by a certain definition, already the most successful in Mariners history, for they have never before been only five wins away from a World Series title.So far as these things go, the Mariners are the most World Series-deprived franchise in all of Major League Baseball. While the Mariners are one of five franchises to never win a World Series, they're the only member of that club to have never even played in one.That could change in the coming days. First, though, here's a refresher on those five teams and the extent of their title droughts. Do note the teams are listed in ascending order of their first season of play.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. San Diego Padres (first season: 1969)The Padres have reached the World Series twice in their nearly 60 years of existence, first in 1984 and then again in 1998. Alas, they combined for just one win across both trips to the Fall Classic. Overall, the Padres have won five division titles and have enjoyed six 90-plus-win efforts, including in 2024 and 2025. This has been something of a golden era for Padres baseball, albeit without a World Series appearance to show for it yet.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Milwaukee Brewers (first season: 1970)In a slightly different universe, the Brewers would be playing the Mariners in the World Series, with one team guaranteed to claim their first title. That won't be the case, as the Brewers were denied in the NLCS by the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Brewers have appeared in just one World Series, with that coming back in 1982 when the club was still in the American League. They have won eight division titles (including an active streak of three in a row) since relocating from Seattle and rebranding from the \"Pilots\" identity in 1970.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Seattle Mariners (first season: 1977)As noted in the introduction, the Mariners are MLB's only team without a World Series appearance to its credit. In fact, this is only Seattle's fourth LCS appearance, and sixth overall playoff appearance in nearly 50 years of play. The Mariners did tie MLB's single-season record by winning 116 games in 2001, and that has to count for something.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Colorado Rockies (first season: 1993)Yes, even the Rockies have reached the World Series before, losing in a clean sweep against the Boston Red Sox in 2007. The Rockies have four other playoff appearances on top of that miraculous run, most recently in 2018. It may be a while before they notch No. 6.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Tampa Bay Rays (first season: 1998)The Rays may be the youngest franchise on this list, with fewer than 30 seasons to their credit. Nonetheless, they've reached the postseason nine times, including a pair of World Series trips: first in 2008, and then again in 2020. Obviously the Rays came up short both times, but it speaks to how much this franchise has reversed its fortunes since opening up with 10 consecutive losing seasons. \n            ",

The Falcons (3-2) are second in the NFC South, while the 49ers (4-2) are tied for first in the NFC West with Seattle and the Los Angeles Rams.

With the team set to face the Arizona Cardinals in Week 7, the Packers were supposed to take off for Phoenix at 1:30 p.m. CT, but they ended up getting delayed for more than five hours due to a mechanical issue.  The Packers charter two planes each week, and the early flight took off around 1:15 p.m. CT with no issues, according to ESPN. The second flight, which was carrying players and most of the coaching staff, was the one that got delayed. The Packers were flying Delta to Arizona, and although the airline tried to fix the mechanical issue, they weren't able to get it done. Instead, the Packers had to switch planes and take a new flight to Phoenix. According to Flight Aware, the Packers ended up being a delayed a total of five hours and 35 minutes, with the new flight taking off at 7:05 p.m. CT. The team eventually arrived in Phoenix at 8:28 p.m. MST/10:28 p.m. CT after a flight that lasted three hours and 23 minutes. \nIf you consider the fact the team probably started boarding their flight around 1 p.m. CT and didn't finish exiting their flight in Arizona until about 11 p.m. CT, that means their travel day lasted more than 10 hours. Not to mention, they also had to catch a bus from the Sky Harbor International Airport to their hotel in Arizona, so it was definitely a marathon day of traveling for the Packers. The Packers will be facing a Cardinals team that likely won't have Kyler Murray. The Arizona quarterback, who's deaing with a foot injury, isn't expected to play on Sunday, according to ESPN. With Murray out, that means the Cards will be turning to Jacoby Brissett for the second straight week. On Green Bay's end, running back Josh Jacobs (illness) is expected to be a game-time decision. \nThe Packers are currently 7-point favorites going into the game, which will kickoff at 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top jobs in college football is open after Florida fired Billy Napier on Sunday, bringing an end to the questions about his future with the program and kickstarting a high-profile coaching search for his replacement. While Florida will have to wait to make more official in-roads in terms of identifying and interviewing candidates, the internal discussions are ongoing when it comes to sorting through a talented pool of potential coaches. Florida has won three national championships under two different coaches in the last 30 years, but the program has been in an SEC title drought since 2008. After winning eight conference championships in a 17-year span, the sudden absence of additional trophies to the case has resulted in a restless fanbase. Florida can be one of the best jobs in the country, but it has gone through four different coaches looking to reclaim that glory enjoyed during the 1990s and late-2000s. With some help from our CBS Sports college football insiders, we've accumulated a list of potential names for the Florida search. The names listed do not necessarily represent interest from the coach in question, though each of these coaches should expect to receive some attention for their potential candidacy.\n        \n            \n                Florida fires Billy Napier: Gators part with fourth-year coach amid disappointing 3-4 start to 2025 season\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLane Kiffin, Ole Miss coachUnder Kiffin's leadership, Ole Miss is currently enjoying one of the more successful runs in program history. The Rebels have won 10+ games in three of the last four seasons, and Kiffin continues to show an ability to adapt to the changing environment of college football. Gauging actual interest -- on either side -- will come with time, but Kiffin's got the chops, the track record and SEC experience to be a perfectly sensible hire for the Gators.  \nJames Franklin, former Penn State coach The midseason dismissal of Franklin has brought about an immediate market for his future employment, because when it comes to qualified candidates, few have the track record to match the former Nittany Lions coach. Franklin has a 128-60 record as a head coach, including a 24-15 showing during his time in the SEC with Vanderbilt where he guided the Commodores to three bowl appearances in three seasons. If Franklin wants to get right back into coaching for 2026, he should have his pick of the best jobs available, and Florida certainly fits that criteria. Jedd Fisch, Washington coachPersonal ties become a big player here as Fisch is not only a Florida alum but worked as a grad assistant for Steve Spurrier. His head-coaching record is relatively limited compared to his lengthy resume as an assistant in college and the NFL, but after turning around Arizona from a one-win team to a 10-win team in just three seasons, there's a lot of buzz about his current outlook as a coach who can not only lead an offense but command a locker room.  Eli Drinkwitz, Missouri coachAfter back-to-back 10-win seasons and a strong start to 2025, Drinkwitz clearly has Missouri running hot. His candidacy is heavily dependent on interest; he's currently well-compensated by Missouri and has spent 13 seasons of his two-decade coaching career between Missouri and Arkansas. Still, Drinkwitz could see the potential of returning Florida to glory while the Gators could see in him a coach who has found 10-win success without the geographical advantages of being in Sunshine State. \nMarcus Freeman, Notre Dame coach Though currently at one of the best jobs in the sport, Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman is going to be a \"make him say no\" candidate for any top job in this 2025-26 coaching carousel cycle. The 39-year-old Freeman is one of the rising stars in the industry, showcasing his ability to not only maintain but improve on his predecessor's success with 33 wins in his first three full seasons and an appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship last year.Rhett Lashlee, SMU coachStepping up in competition shouldn't be a deterrent for Lashlee, because this is a coach who had SMU going 8-0 in conference play during the program's last year in the American and then followed it up with an 8-0 conference record in Year 1 of ACC membership. In guiding SMU to the College Football Playoff, Lashlee proved that he's one of the top coaches around, and his history of potent offenses provides a nice selling point when it comes to keeping the best young talent on the roster. This is another name that could get interesting as SMU has the resources to participate in a bidding war but could still be fighting the perception battle with a modern SEC blue blood. Brent Key, Georgia Tech coachThough he has less than four full seasons of experience as a head coach, Key has successfully instilled his brand of football in how the Yellow Jackets play on the field. Key's Georgia Tech teams are physical at the line of scrimmage and fearless against top competition, going 7-1 against ranked ACC foes since he took over as coach. He was also an offensive line coach at Alabama for the 2017 national title season and two conference championships, so life in the SEC wouldn't be anything new for Key.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Florida Gators are searching for their next football coach following the dismissal of Billy Napier.

    "body": "\n        UEFA Champions League action returns this week, with 15-time winners Real Madrid once again headlining the schedule as they host Juventus in the most anticipated fixture of Matchday 3.Xabi Alonso's side are off to a near-perfect start this season with just one loss across domestic and continental competition, with Wednesday's clash against an inconsistent Juventus side offering them a chance to keep that streak alive. Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe will take center stage once again as the focal point of Alonso's version of Los Blancos and already has 14 goals to show for it across all competitions, including five in the Champions League.Real Madrid are one of six teams with two wins out of two to start their Champions League campaigns, the group mostly made up of European titans – Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter and Arsenal – who hope to create further distance between them and the rest. The exception in that group, though, are Qarabag, who notched the first win for an Azerbaijani team in the history of the competition against Benfica and then followed that up with a victory over Copenhagen. Their next test will be against Athletic Club, last season's UEFA Europa League semifinalists who are off to a middling start in both domestic and continental play.For more ahead of a jam-packed Champions League week, here's what you need to know before tuning in.\nHow to watchAll of the action on Matchday 3 of the UEFA Champions League can be caught on Paramount+, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select simultaneous coverage. Each day's coverage begins with Champions League Matchday, streaming on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Golazo Network ahead of the early games before the UEFA Champions League Today pre-match show begins on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network. The Golazo Show on Paramount+ also returns for the late slate of matches, while the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network picks things up at the end of the day.

They went toe-to-toe with Liverpool on Matchday 1 of the Champions League before a 3-2 loss at Anfield but booked a 5-2 win against Real Madrid in LaLiga play and a 5-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in Europe since. It's a clear demonstration of their attacking might but how that stacks up against Arteta's rock-solid defense, conceding just three goals in 11 games across all competitions so far this season.Paris Saint-Germain's stars return: The reigning Champions League winners are off to a strong start, booking two wins out of two despite missing a handful of their stars, most notably notching a 2-1 win over Barcelona on Matchday 2. They may not have all of their top-tier players back in time for Tuesday's game at Bayer Leverkusen, but some will be better than none – Desire Doue started their 3-3 draw over the weekend while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia came off the bench, offering enough attacking firepower for Luis Enrique's side to be favored to stay perfect in the Champions League, whether or not Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele can join them.Wednesday's storylinesReal Madrid target another win: Xabi Alonso's first full season in charge of Real Madrid is off to a strong start and things are likely to continue on Wednesday against Juventus, who have two draws to start Champions League play. Kylian Mbappe is expected to lead Los Blancos' offense but Alonso will have a range of options in attack as he looks to fill out the lineup, though the most pressing question of all just might be whether or not Vinicius Junior starts. He got the nod in Real Madrid's 5-0 drubbing of Kairat on Matchday 2 but Alonso lived to regret the decision of leaving him on the bench in their win over Marseille on Matchday 1. The new manager is inclined to rotate through his options so perhaps the fact that Vinicius did not start on Sunday against Getafe means he could be in the lineup against Juventus. \nCan Liverpool turn things around?: Liverpool's strong start to the season is officially a thing of the past, with the Reds becoming the first Premier League champions in 11 years to go on a four game losing streak following their 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. How exactly manager Arne Slot corrects course – and whether or not he can do it in time for their trip to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League – is a big question, especially as it becomes clear that the team's tactical vision for the season is not really working. Their attack has been spotty in recent weeks, either ineffective or wasteful, and the individual players are a bit all over the place – Cody Gakpo has five goals in his last four games for club and country but Florian Wirtz is still struggling to make an impact and Mohamed Salah is off to a poor start. That's without considering the Reds' vulnerable defense, which has been just as costly all season long.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The college football world experienced quite the shakeup in Week 8, and perhaps no loss was more surprising than the one No. 2 Miami took to unranked Louisville. Onetime Heisman Trophy favorite Carson Beck threw four interceptions in the 24-21 defeat, which plummeted Miami seven spots down to No. 9.Miami was one of four top 10 teams to lose, including Ole Miss and Texas Tech -- both of whom were previously unbeaten like the Hurricanes. Ole Miss fell 43-35 to Georgia while Texas Tech lost to Arizona State in Tempe, 26-22. As a result, AP Poll voters dropped Ole Miss to No. 8 and Texas Tech to No. 14.Elsewhere, Vanderbilt Commodores's historic rise continued with its 31-24 win over LSU. With the win, the Commodores surged from No. 17 up to No. 10, marking the first time Vanderbilt is ranked in the top 10 of the AP poll since 1947. Vanderbilt has now registered multiple wins over teams ranked in the top 15 of the AP poll for the first time in school history, and already surpassed its preseason win total, which was 5.5. LSU, meanwhile, dropped 10 spots from No. 10 to No. 20, the largest fall of the week. \nOhio State remained in the No. 1 position after a blowout road win over Wisconsin. The Buckeyes garnered 60 of the 66 first-place votes. Indiana received the other six and moved up a spot to No. 2 -- the highest ranking in program history -- thanks to Miami's loss.Another major move in the poll came from Georgia Tech, which improved to 7-0 with a win over Duke and is now up at No. 7. It's the first time the Yellow Jackets are ranked in the top 10 since 2014. Below is the full AP Top 25 poll for Week 9.

The defense has quietly been one of the most efficient in the NFL, holding opponents to a league-low 12.2 points per game. The Texans run defense has allowed 90.6 yards per game, which should make for an intriguing matchup against Seattle running backs Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet.

Seattle's run defense is only allowing 79.0 yards per game, which could neutralize a tepid Texans ground game and a mobile quarterback like Stroud. Speaking of quarterbacks, Darnold has averaged over 9.0 yards per pass in four straight games and has completed 70.8% of his passes on the season with 11 touchdowns and three interceptions. He has played especially well at home, completing 77.3% while averaging 9.5 yards per pass with six touchdowns and just one pick. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Seahawks vs. Texans picksFor Monday Night Football in NFL Week 7, the model is leaning under the total, and also says one side of the spread has all the value. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Texans vs. Seahawks, and which side of the spread has all the value?

    "body": "\n        Fantasy football players will be closely tuned into Sunday Night Football, with two of the top players going head-to-head in 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey and Falcons RB Bijan Robinson for 49ers vs. Falcons. These two studs are the type of players who can determine matchups by themselves, and many may be looking for huge performances from them in one of the final games of the weekend to determine the result of their matchup. Much of Fantasy football production comes from scoring touchdowns, and these are two of the best at finding the end zone. Despite them having the two shortest odds to score a touchdown in the latest Sunday Night Football odds, the SportsLine model still believes they are underpriced and still serve as two of the best values for Week 7 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorer bets when online sports betting.The model suggests including both Robinson and McCaffrey in Week 7 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets. Robinson has a touchdown in back-to-back games, and McCaffrey has scored in three straight contests. For a longer shot if you plan to build a Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorer parlay or just anytime TD bets in general, the model also projects value in Falcons backup running back Tyler Allgeier (+200) to score in Falcons vs. 49ers on Sunday Night Football. Before making any Falcons vs. 49ers picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at sportsbooks, be sure to see the Week 7 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest NFL odds. They can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest BetMGM promo code, which gives new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

New users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins and three months of NBA League Pass free.Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-179)You may want to knock on wood if you're a Christian McCaffrey Fantasy football owner, or a 49ers fan in general, given all the injuries surrounding the team this season, but McCaffrey appears to be fully healthy after his injury-riddled 2024 campaign. The 49ers running back has always been a top touchdown scorer when on the field, and he's displaying that again this season with a touchdown in four of six games, including each of his last three. In 2023, McCaffrey scored a touchdown in 14 of 17 regular-season games and in all three playoff games in their run to playing in the Super Bowl. McCaffrey has the lowest odds of anyone in the entire Week 7 NFL schedule at scoring a touchdown, but with McCaffrey rushing for a touchdown in over 50% of simulations and having a receiving touchdown in over 30% of simulations, the model still projects value at -179 odds.Click here to bet on McCaffrey as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users 20 100% profit boost tokens with their first $1 bet.Bijan Robinson, Falcons (-170)Robinson had a career-high 170 rushing yards, including an 81-yard touchdown run, in Atlanta's 24-14 win over the Bills on Monday Night Football last week. The No. 8 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft has more than 70 rushing yards in four straight games, including two contests with more than 140 rushing yards. He has more than 100 total yards in each of his last four games, averaging 172 total yards per game during that span with plenty of chances to create and find the end zone. Robinson has scored in back-to-back games and in three of five contests this season. The playmaking running back is integral in both the running and receiving game for Atlanta, making him one of the model's top picks for a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer. Click here to play Robinson in Week 7 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Tyler Allgeier, Falcons (+200)The Falcons RB2 has RB1 talent, and the Falcons don't simply bury him behind Robinson or save him in the event of an injury. The 25-year-old has at least 10 carries in four of five games this season, and he's played more than 30% of snaps in three of his last four games. Allgeier has scored a touchdown in three of those four contests, including on a 21-yard run last week for the first score of the game. He and Robinson are tied for the team lead in touchdowns (three), yet you can find Allgeier as a significantly longer price because of the perception he's a distant No. 2 behind Robinson. However, given his usage, he's a value in the model's projections to score on Sunday Night Football.Click here to play Allgeier at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for 49ers vs. Falcons in Week 7 Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        Sunday's NFL schedule features four games in the 4 p.m. ET window, including the Indianapolis Colts looking to continue their shocking, dominant start to the season on the road against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Colts improved to 5-1 with a 31-27 win over the Cardinals last week, and the Chargers improved to 4-2 with a 29-27 win over the Dolphins. However, the Chargers are 0-4 against the spread in their last four games as the favorite in all four contests. The Chargers (-1.5) are favored once again in the latest Week 7 NFL odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5. The SportsLine model is backing the Colts to continue their winning ways and the Chargers to suffer another ATS loss, with the Colts covering the spread in 54% of simulations, while winning straight-up in 51% of the time.The model is also backing the Broncos (-7) to cover at home against the Giants, while the Over (54.5) hits 65% of the time in Cowboys vs. Commanders. The total has gone Over in 13 of the last 19 meetings between these NFC East rivals, and SportsLine's model is projecting 60 combined points on Sunday.

Bet it now at FanDuel:Broncos (-7) vs. GiantsThe Denver defense dominated in London last week, holding the Jets to 82 total yards while recording nine sacks. The Broncos are second in defensive scoring (15.8 ppg) and yards allowed (254.2 per game), while allowing the fewest yards per play (4.3) in the NFL. That isn't all due to the Jets game or inferior opponents, as Denver also held the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles to 17 points two weeks ago. The Broncos (4-2) have won three straight games, and although the Giants are coming off the high of a 34-17 win over the Eagles on Thursday Night Football at home, Jaxson Dart is 0-1 on the road with a 26-14 loss to the previously winless Saints. The model projects the Broncos to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this 4:05 p.m. ET start.Colts (+1.5) vs. ChargersNot even the biggest Colts fans would have predicted this before the season started, but Indianapolis enters Week 7 with the No. 1 scoring offense at 32.3 ppg in the NFL this season. They've scored at least 29 points in five of six games, while scoring at least 20 points in all six contests, and are coming off a 31-27 win over the Cardinals. The Daniel Jones resurgence continues as the 28-year-old is seventh in passing yards (1,502 yards) this season, while Jonathan Taylor lead in rushing yards (603) and touchdowns (seven). The Chargers have been favored in four straight games but have failed to cover the spread in each contest. The model projects the Colts to cover in 54% of simulations for this 4:05 p.m. ET start.Cowboy vs. Commanders: Over 54.5 pointsCommanders vs. Cowboys has the largest over/under on the Week 7 NFL schedule, but the model doesn't believe the number is nearly enough. The Cowboys have the ideal combination for an Over to hit with the No. 3 scoring offense (29.7 ppg) and No. 31 scoring defense (30.7) in the league this season, with those averages surging past 54.5 points. The Over has hit in three straight Dallas games. The Cowboys have scored 40 points twice this season, and at least one team has scored 30 points in each of the last five Cowboys games. Washington has the No. 7 scoring offense (26.3 ppg) and the model expects plenty of scoring in this Dak Prescott vs. Jayden Daniels matchup, with the Over hitting in 65% of simulations in a 4:25 p.m. ET start.Want more Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 7 NFL best bets for Sunday.

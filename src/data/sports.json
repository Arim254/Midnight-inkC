And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.\nThe undercard is loaded with fun fights to get fans excited in New York. Rising welterweights Sean Brady and Michael Morales collide in a featured bout that could set the winner up for a shot at the title soon. The same could be said for the winner of Carlos Prates vs. former titleholder Leon Edwards in another featured bout at welterweight. Plus, veterans Beneil Dariush and Benoit Saint-Denis link up in a lightweight battle that could produce fireworks.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

Two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua is reportedly finalizing a deal to box Paul to end this year.Paul vs. Joshua is in the works for December, according to reports from Yahoo Sports and Ring Magazine. Netflix will reportedly stream the fight, which would take place in Miami. Paul and Davis' Nov. 14 fight was canceled amid new domestic violence allegations against Davis.There should be much more hype for Paul's fight with Joshua than the canceled \"Tank\" exhibition fight.The biggest criticism of Paul-Davis was the size difference between them. Paul regularly competes at cruiserweight, roughly 65 pounds heavier than WBA lightweight champion Davis' normal weight class. The weight gap was so big that Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission, prevented the fight from being sanctioned in Atlanta.\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) unexpectedly became one of boxing's biggest stars with meticulous matchmaking. He often leverages his size and youth against smaller, older opponents with mainstream name value. The 28-year-old's biggest wins are against \"Iron\" Mike Tyson, former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz and former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley, all of whom are currently in their 40s and 50s, with Tyson pushing 60. Against Joshua, Paul will have no such advantages. Two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has every advantage over Paul on paper. Joshua is bigger, more experienced, technically superior, and hits harder. He's twice mixed it up with the greatest boxer of his generation, reigning undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. While Joshua's best days are behind him -- Hearn suggested Joshua could retire next year -- the 36-year-old is young enough to handle Paul.\nPaul is on a six-fight winning streak, most recently winning a unanimous decision over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Joshua had a four-fight winning streak, which included a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, snapped by Daniel Dubois in September 2024. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        I want to draw your attention to an incredible sequence late in the Golden State Warriors' 125-120 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. The Warriors ran a high pick-and-roll near mid-court to give Stephen Curry a chance to go downhill at Victor Wembanyama with a full head of steam. Curry snaked around the screen, started driving to his left, then crossed over between his legs on a dime to go right instead. Curry's quick change of direction fooled the Frenchman. Wembanyama was still shifting toward the middle of the floor, and Curry attacked his front foot. It was technically perfect from Curry, and at that moment he should have had a major advantage. And against almost every other big man in the league, he would have. Curry briefly had Wembanyama on skates, but still couldn't gain an advantage But Curry didn't even bother to continue his drive and attack the rim, in part because Luke Kornet was already standing under the rim. Instead he darted backward, and tried to slip Wembanyama with another change of pace move. It didn't work, so he gave up the ball and forced Wembanyama to chase him around the perimeter. \nAgain, this should have worked. Seven-foot-four players are not supposed to be able to keep up with Curry's off-ball movement, but that's just what Wembanyama did. He then cut off another Curry drive with the help of Devin Vassell, which left Draymond Green open in the lane. Wembanyama rushed back to stifle Green, who kicked the ball out to Gary Payton II. The lefty guard drove at Kornet's closeout and thought he had a layup, but Wembanyama was there again to force a miss. As Wembanyama sprinted down the other end of the floor, he caught a pass from Stephon Castle, and had a chance to go at Green in the open court. He crossed over, drove into the paint, got stonewalled at the rim by Moses Moody and Green, but simply reached over them to grab the offensive rebound and convert a putback. \nWembanyama also blocked a 3-point attempt from Green by jumping from inside the paint, and finished with 31 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his fourth career triple-double. Together with Castle, who put up 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, they became the first Spurs duo to record triple-doubles in the same game. \nAnd yet, none of that was enough to win. Curry got the last laugh in the end, as he iced the game at the free throw line to finish with a season-high 46 points on 13 of 25 from the field, including 15 of 16 at the line. It was his 12th 40-point game since turning 35, tying him with Michael Jordan. (LeBron James holds the all-time lead with 15 such games.) But of course Curry is never just about scoring. He added five rebounds and five assists Wednesday night to record his 12th career game with at least 45 points, five rebounds and five assists. Only 11 players in NBA history have more such games. Twenty-two of Curry's 46 points came during the third quarter when he led a major Warriors comeback. Curry was unstoppable in the frame. He got to the line at will and made tough shot after tough shot, including two mid-range jumpers -- one from each wing -- that he banked in on purpose. The Spurs had controlled the first half and were up by as many as 16 at one point, but thanks to Curry's barrage, the Warriors won the third quarter 43-28 to take the lead for good. \nWembanyama's flashes of absurd brilliance are the league's hottest new commodity -- and rightfully so -- but there's still nothing like a Curry hot streak. No one knows that better than Wembanyama himself, who has seen what Curry can do firsthand on two continents.\nCurry, now 37, remains one of the faces of the NBA, alongside his two main peers, James (40) and Kevin Durant (37). Their longevity, though impressive, has created a sense of existential angst about who will eventually take their place and carry the league into the future. \"Not much at all,\" Curry said, when asked by The Athletic earlier this season how often he thinks about who the next face of the league will be. \"That stuff takes care of itself.\"\"You got to be more than just a great player,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr added. \"You have to have charisma, you have to have grace, you have to have a connection that the fans feel. And a connection that sort of transcends fandom. Like everybody's a LeBron fan, and everybody's a Steph fan -- everybody was a Michael fan.\"\nWembanyama has the talent and the intangibles to step into the void, and we saw plenty of evidence Wednesday that the league will be in good hands whenever Curry and his peers retire. We also got another reminder that this proud older generation isn't going away without a fight. Wembanyama may be in line for the mantle, but it won't be given to him. He's going to have to take it. \n            ",

He received 26 of 30 first-place votes.\nSkubal, who turns 29 on Nov. 20, also won the award in 2024 and did so in unanimous fashion. This crowning makes Skubal the first repeat winner since Jacob deGrom of the Mets in 2018 and 2019. He's the first AL pitcher to win back-to-back Cy Youngs since Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez with the Red Sox in 1999 and 2000. As well, Skubal is now the 22nd pitcher in MLB history to win multiple Cy Young awards. He's just the second Tiger to win two Cy Youngs, joining Denny McLain, who won the award with Detroit in 1968 and 1969. \n        \n            \n                Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal aren't just the 2025 Cy Young winners; they're the future of baseball\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSkubal prevailed in the balloting, which is conducted by the Baseball Writers Association of America, over his fellow AL finalists, Garrett Crochet of the Red Sox and Hunter Brown of the Astros. Here's a look at the full voting:Pitcher1st2nd3rd4th5thPointsTarik Skubal, Tigers264---198Garrett Crochet, Red Sox426---132Hunter Brown, Astros--243280Max Fried, Yankees--620361Bryan Woo, Mariners---51626Carlos Rodón, Yankees---215Aroldis Chapman, Red Sox----44Jacob deGrom, Rangers--—-22Trevor Rogers, Orioles----11Drew Rasmussen, Rays----11He joins Pirates ace Paul Skenes, who was named the National League Cy Young winner.\nThis past season, Skubal led the American League in ERA and also paced the AL in ERA+ with a mark of 187. He backed it up with an AL-best FIP of 2.45, and his K/BB ratio of 7.30 led all qualifiers in MLB. Skubal also struck out 32.2% of opposing batters, which also led all qualifying pitchers, and his WAR of 6.5 was tops among AL pitchers. He set a career high with 241 strikeouts in 2025 and registered a quality start in 68% of his trips to the mound versus an MLB average of 51%. Any current discussion of Skubal right now must address the trade rumors that have persisted. He's going into his walk year in 2026, and it's possible -- although probably not likely -- that the Tigers will look to deal him this offseason before losing him to free agency. This of course is not the club's only option with regard to their remaining control over Skubal, especially since parting with him likely closes their current contending window. \nFor now, though, the story with Skubal is that he's once again been recognized as the American League's best pitcher.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Crowds usually reserved for the weekend were on site Wednesday at the Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, as The Annika's pro-am featured two of the biggest names in women's sports in lockstep with one another. Playing together for the second straight year, Nelly Korda and Caitlin Clark joined forces for nine holes with Clark's Indiana Fever teammates, Lexi Hull and Sophie Cunningham, serving as caddies for part of the action.\"It's crazy,\" Korda said. \"That first tee was something out of a book, almost. But it's so fun. It's cool to see how many people she brings together to another sport, and it's fun to hang out with her. She's super cool. We saw each other last week at an outing, and it's nice to be alongside greats; even her teammates are super fun. It's been a blast so far.\"\nThis time last year, both players were flying high as they came into the pro-am together. Korda was named LPGA Player of the Year thanks to her six victories up to that point in the season, adding a seventh by winning The Annika later that week. Clark was coming off her WNBA Rookie of the Year campaign for the Fever. While her sophomore season featured injuries that kept her sidelined -- from both the hardwood and golf course -- at various points, the sharpshooter relayed she is back to being 100% healthy and trying to take advantage of the weather before winter arrives.\"I think it just shows how powerful supporting one another can truly be,\" Clark told Golf Channel. \"I've always been a big advocate of that and supporting women's sports. I've always been a big fan, whether it's golf or soccer, volleyball, whatever it is. So, it's really fun to see [Nelly] do her craft up close and how good she is.\n\"Getting to play with her last year, and I've played a few other rounds with her, she just makes the game of golf look really easy. You're almost like, How? She's great, and I am rooting for her to win this week.\"Despite a great run of form in 2025 that has featured eight top-10 finishes in 17 starts, Korda has remained outside the winner's circle since stepping into it at this tournament last year. She comes into The Annika having not played since the first week of October, where she finished T4 at the LOTTE Championship.No matter the time off, the world No. 2 has plenty going for her this week, given her comfort level at this golf course and another stroll around it with a familiar face on Wednesday.\n\"I think she enjoys everything that she does,\" Korda said of Clark. \"There are only so many things that you can juggle. There are so many things we have to do, and for her to be so laid back and relax and have fun and chit-chat with everyone is cool to see.\"\n            ",

It was less than a year ago that these two programs faced off at a neutral site, with St. Joe's notching a 20-point blowout victory. The Hawks have won the last two meetings with the Hokies, both coming away from home, so they will have confidence in going into Blacksburg, Va.Both teams have started this season 2-0, but Virginia Tech has a recent history of letting down after a victory.

He's one of four Hawks averaging at least 11.5 points, while the Hokies' defense is penetrable as it allowed 101 points to Providence on Saturday.SportsLine's model projects this game to be decided by a single possession, as Saint Joseph's (+12.5) covers in almost 70% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Clippers guard Bradley Beal will miss the remainder of the season after suffering a fractured hip, Beal's agent told ESPN. Beal, who will have surgery on the hip, sustained the injury in L.A.'s 114-103 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 8, and missed the following game against the Atlanta Hawks.Beal, 32, was originally listed as out for that game against the Hawks with what the Clippers were calling hip soreness, but after undergoing further imaging the injury was determined to be far worse than that. Clippers coach Ty Lue admitted there was concern about Beal's injury, and that concern proved to be warranted.Mark Bartelstein, Beal's agent, told ESPN that the decision for season-ending surgery was reached after consulting an array of medical opinions.\"We met with numerous doctors and specialists around the country in collaboration with the entire Clippers medical staff over the last few days, and came to the decision unanimously that the surgery will allow Brad to have a full and complete recovery,\" Bartelstein said. \nBradley Beal's career derailed by injuriesBeal, a three-time All-Star, had a rough start to the season in his first year with the Clippers. He's averaged a career-low 8.2 points on just 37.5% from the floor. He appeared in six of L.A.'s 10 games, and hasn't been as productive as the Clippers had hoped when they signed him in the summer. The Clippers signed Beal to a two-year, $10.98 million deal with a player option on the second year after the Suns used the waive and stretch provision to allow him to become a free agent in the offseason. He was coming off a two-year stint in Phoenix where he averaged 17.6 points, but never played more than 53 games each season as injuries limited him -- and the Suns -- from building chemistry with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.Injuries have now followed Beal to the Clippers, though we've never see him play as poorly as he was to start this season. Some of that is due to him still working back from a knee scope he had in May, which limited him in the preseason. Beal has been on a minutes restriction in each of the six games he's played, but hasn't been as efficient as he has been over the majority of his career.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA Power Rankings: Spurs, Pistons making the leap; Eastern Conference earning its keep\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Clippers were hoping Beal would replace the production of Norman Powell, who the team sent to the Miami Heat in a three-team deal that landed them John Collins from the Utah Jazz. That wasn't the case, and now they'll lose Beal for the remainder of the season.Beal, a 13-year veteran, has only played in 70 or more games four times over his career, and hasn't been able to find his footing at either of his two stops since being traded from the Wizards in 2023. He's still only 32 years old, and his player option next summer should ensure he'll remain with the Clippers through next season, but his durability has been a massive concern in the last few years.A major blow for the ClippersThe Beal injury is a massive blow given the Clippers have started the season 2-8 and are also without Kawhi Leonard, who is dealing with an ankle sprain he sustained in a loss to the Miami Heat on Nov. 3. However, ESPN's Shams Charania said on NBA Today Wednesday afternoon that Leonard's absence isn't considered to be \"significant.\" That should be a sigh of relief for the Clippers, and while Leonard can mask a lot of the team's issues, he alone won't solve the fact that L.A. has a bottom-tier offense -- ranked 20th in the league, to be exact -- and an even worse defense (26th).\nBeal already wasn't providing a ton offensively for the Clippers, so they'll have to find that missing offensive production elsewhere. Bogdan Bogdanovic would ideally supply some of that missing production the Clippers hoped Beal would bring, but he's seemingly slid out of the rotation after being held out of back-to-back games. Beal's injury should mean an elevation in role for Bogdanovic, but he'll need to do better than the 6.3 points and 28% from the field he's averaged in four games this season.The Clippers were expected to be a dark horse contender in the Western Conference this season, but injuries have yet again plagued them. It's still early, and perhaps Beal's injury will push the Clippers to look for a trade that could net them some more scoring. But for now, they'll have to look elsewhere on their roster to get them out of this skid with Beal's injury serving as the latest tough pill to swallow for a team that has been continually derailed by injuries.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame star Hannah Hidalgo set a new program scoring record during Wednesday's 85-58 win over Akron with 44 points. In the process, she also set a new NCAA Division I single-game record with 16 steals. Her entire stat line was impressive as she shot an efficient 64% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. She neared a triple-double with nine rebounds, while also sprinkling in four assists. The previous Notre Dame record was 41 points, held by now-WNBA star Jewell Loyd and Ruth Riley, who won a national championship with the Fighting Irish in 2001.\"I mean, it's really special, but I got to give all glory to God that put the power in me to be able to do what I do,\" Hidalgo said during her broadcast postgame interview. \"And especially thanks to my teammates. Without them I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"\nThere are not many players at any level who can do what Hidalgo achieved on Wednesday. No NBA or WNBA player has ever registered 40+ points and 10+ steals in a single game. The last college basketball player to do so was Amy Patton for Northern Arizona in 2012.\nHidalgo is a true two-way player and although her scoring ability is impressive, she says it all starts on the other side of the court.\"Defense first, defense wins championships,\" she said. \"I make sure that I bring the energy from my team defensively so that we can get on transition and get buckets.\"The crowd at Purcell Pavilion cheered loudly for her after the game while her teammates surrounded her. This is a rebuilding year for the program, but Hidalgo has so far led Notre Dame to a 3-0 start. \nShe is one of three returning players from last season's roster, along with Cassandre Prosper and KK Bransford. Although there are a lot of new faces in South Bend, Hidalgo said she is having a lot of fun with this group. \"Oh, my goodness. I love my team, everybody. On the court, off the court,\" she said. \"I love playing with them.  There's nobody else I'd rather play with. It's just been so fun, from summer time till now.\"Hidalgo and the rest of the Fighting Irish can use this win to build confidence ahead of their first ranked opponent of the season. No. 18 Notre Dame will take on No. 16 Michigan on the road on Saturday afternoon. The game is set for 4 p.m. ET on NBC Sports.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys were rocked by the death of 24-year-old edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland last week, the result of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Since then, the team has done everything it can to come together and support one another in the wake of his loss.The Cowboys held a team Zoom call on Nov. 6 that included internal doctors and counselors, among them team psychologist Dr. Heather Twedel. Between Nov. 6 and Monday, staff members made individual calls to players. A full team meeting was held Monday, followed by smaller breakout sessions with players and employees. That same schedule repeated Tuesday, with counseling components and guest speakers, per a team spokesperson.On Tuesday night, the Cowboys held a memorial and candlelight vigil inside Ford Center, their indoor practice facility. The event was organized at the request of Catalina Mancera, Kneeland's girlfriend, who wanted to be surrounded by the team's community. The 90-minute ceremony was followed by a reception with family, friends and team personnel.\"I want to offer my condolences to Marshawn's family, Catalina, his girlfriend, and we had an opportunity last night to celebrate Marshawn's life,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"We told stories, shared, laughed, cried. Marshawn loved the words 'One Love,' so we talked a lot about love as we grieved. \n\"He had the most playful spirit of any young man I've been around. His smile could take you to your knees. No one had a better motor than him. So my heart is heavy, our team's heart is heavy. We don't move on, but we do move forward.\"Jonathan Evans, a pastor at Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship and the Cowboys' team chaplain, opened and closed the vigil. Speakers included Schottenheimer, owner and general manager Jerry Jones, Mancera, Kneeland's high school coach Brandon Kimble, agent Jon Perzley, advisor Jay Bass, uncle Preston Kneeland, and defensive tackles Osa Odighizuwa and Solomon Thomas.\n        \n            \n                Cowboys' Jerry Jones 'devastated' by Marshawn Kneeland's death: 'We all are having to share the sorrow'\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We're always going to be stronger together. We are stronger together. So Monday we set it up where we had a chance to be together and share and talk,\" Schottenheimer said. \"We offered some people that can help us sort through what we're feeling and the emotions of what we're feeling. Yesterday, we had what we call a brotherhood breakfast, just sat down for 45 minutes and ate together. We shared, and we talked and laughed and cried.\"\nThe Cowboys also launched the Marshawn Kneeland Memorial Fund to support Mancera and Kneeland's unborn child.\"We want to make sure she is taken care of and the baby is taken care of for the rest of their lives,\" Schottenheimer said. \"It's very important to our guys and to us.\"Honoring KneelandThe Cowboys will wear a decal on their helmets honoring Kneeland for the remainder of the 2025 season, though the exact design -- whether his initials, jersey number or another symbol -- is still being finalized. They'll also wear memorial T-shirts before their Week 11 \"Monday Night Football\" game at Las Vegas -- their first since Kneeland's death -- and again before their Week 12 home game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nDallas plans to hold a moment of silence and play a tribute video for Kneeland prior to kickoff in Week 12 at AT&T Stadium. Other tribute elements are still being finalized.\"I told the players the other day -- I mean it, and they're probably going to get tired of it -- but I'm always going to tell them how much I love them,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I probably never will be the same, to be honest with you. … Most of our guys were with people they loved and cared about when this happened. I know I hugged my kids and my wife. That helps soothe the pain for a little bit.\"Returning to footballKneeland's death occurred during the Cowboys' Week 10 bye, allowing the team time to begin processing the tragedy before returning to practice Thursday.\n\"One day at a time,\" Schottenheimer said. \"It's going to hit everybody differently. … You lean into one another, you love on one another. … Some guys getting out on the grass will be the best thing in the world for them. Some guys getting out on the grass will be painful, and that's OK. We're going to give each other grace and time. But I promise you this: these guys will be ready to play against the Raiders. We'll honor Marshawn with how we play, not just against the Raiders but for the rest of the season.\"Two Cowboys -- quarterback Dak Prescott and defensive tackle Solomon Thomas -- have both lost siblings to suicide: Prescott's brother, Jace, in 2020, and Thomas' sister, Ella, in 2018.\"It's OK to feel however you're feeling,\" Prescott said Thursday at a ceremony in Haughton, Louisiana, via CBS News Texas. \"Hard to balance my emotions today. … Tough moment for this team. I feel and hurt for everybody that's involved in this and Marshawn's family and loved ones.\" \nBoth Prescott's and Thomas' leadership has been crucial for the Cowboys as they grieve the loss of a beloved teammate.\"Those are two of the best leaders in the league,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, they're able to talk about something that has been very devastating for them. … It was hard to hear the pain that some of these guys are dealing with, but it was also uplifting to hear the strength from other guys. That's the beauty of a team. … I'm hurting, and these guys have picked me up -- and I've picked them up. That's what we're going to continue to do because we love one another. It's what a family does.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Quarterbacks Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield will face off this Sunday when the Buffalo Bills host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. As they get ready for the competition on the field, the two are having some friendly banter off of it.When asked about his friendship with Allen, Mayfield poked fun at his Week 11 opponent and peer from the NFL's 2018 draft class. Mayfield, who is known for his quips and one-liners, said, matter-of-factly, \"I have to walkie-talkie to him because he's so damn tall, so I can't really have a face-to-face conversation with him. But you know in Buffalo, it's cold, it's rainy. Even though he's 6-10, his hands are small, so he better wear his gloves.\"\nIn case it wasn't obvious, Allen isn't actually 6'10\", but he does stand at 6'5\" compared to Mayfield's height of 6'1\". The exaggeration for comedic effect certainly worked. Allen's hand size was listed at just over 10 inches while Mayfield measured 9¼ inches at the combine. \nMayfield may have been slightly off on his measurements, but he did have one set of facts correct -- it will be cold in Buffalo this weekend. The projected temperature range is between 32-42 with a 30% chance of rain, via weather.com. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.A reporter at Allen's press conference later in the day informed the reigning NFL MVP of Mayfield's comments. Allen was quick to offer a retort, offering a quip about Mayfield's golfing accessory.\"Baker wears two gloves golfing,\" Allen said. \"So, he's that type of guy. I love the guy, he's awesome.\"\nThe Bills are the favorite to win on Sunday at -5.5, with the over/under set at 48.5, according to DraftKings.Both the Bills and Bucs are sitting at 6-3 with Buffalo in second place in the AFC East while Tampa Bay is in first place in the NFC South. And both teams are also coming off losses. The Bills lost a stunner to the beleaguered Miami Dolphins while the Buccaneers were defeated by the ascending New England Patriots.Allen and Mayfield have had solid seasons thus far. Allen has a 70.3 completion percentage, 2,139 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, five interceptions, 311 rushing yards on 59 attempts, and seven touchdowns on the ground. Mayfield has a 64.1 completion percentage and has thrown for 2,192 yards with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions, along with 158 yards on the ground on 22 attempts.\nThese two quarterbacks got their start together, as both were drafted in the Class of 2018. Mayfield was the first overall pick by the Cleveland Browns, while Allen was selected by the Bills at No. 7 overall.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After nearly a decade, the Miami Dolphins and general manager Chris Grier are parting ways, the team announced on Friday. Grier had served in that role since the Dolphins promoted him from the director of college scouting in 2016.Coming into the season, Grier was facing pressure with the team coming off an 8-9 season in 2024. Through the first nine games in 2025, things have only gotten worse for the Dolphins. The final game of Grier's tenure came on Thursday night, when the Baltimore Ravens blew out the Dolphins 28-6 in Hard Rock Stadium. Miami fell to 2-7 with the loss. Despite that record, the Dolphins plan to stick with Mike McDaniel as coach for \"at least\" the remainder of the season, according to ESPN.\n        \n            \n                'It sucks': Dolphins' Mike McDaniel responds to fan frustration after team falls to 2-7 with loss to Ravens\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDolphins owner Stephen Ross said he made the decision to move on from Grier on Friday morning. Champ Kelly will serve as the interim general manager.\n\"As I assessed the state of the team and in my discussions with Chris, it became clear to both of us that change could not wait. We must improve -- in 2025, 2026 and beyond -- and it needs to start right now,\" Ross said. \"There is a lot of football left to play and we all need to fight even harder.\"I have always been and remain committed to building a winning team that consistently competes for championships. I am incredibly proud of our leadership as an NFL organization and our continued commitment to the community, but our performance on the field and our team-building process have not been good enough. There are no excuses. \"I want to thank the fans for their continued support and passion for this team. You deserve a championship-caliber team you can be proud of. There's much work ahead to return the Dolphins to sustained success, and that work begins now, finishing the season strong, evaluating all areas of our football operation, and moving forward with a clear vision for the future.\"\nGrier was with the Dolphins organization for 25 years after joining the organization as a scout in 2000. He worked his way up the front office ladder and took on the general manager role in 2016. In his tenure as GM, the Dolphins reached the playoffs three times but lost in the Wild Card round each time.\n            ",

We're expecting the Power Four to take up 11 spots in the College Football Playoff's 12-team bracket, along with the American champion.Conference expansion forced change for most tiebreaker policies in recent years, and we've included those here -- direct from various leagues:Big Ten tiebreakersThe Big Ten race looks to be the simplest heading into the final month of the season. Ohio State and Indiana will meet in Indianapolis if both teams win out against manageable schedules. Michigan is the only team left the Buckeyes play with a winning record while the Hoosiers' lone opponent likely heading to a bowl game is Maryland.Oregon and Iowa, each with one conference loss, play each other on Nov. 8, which will eliminate one from the championship game conversation. USC, also with one current loss in conference play to Illinois, also takes on the Ducks next month. Things would get sticky in the Big Ten if the Wolverines win out and beat Ohio State for a fifth consecutive season. Then, tiebreaker scenarios enter the chat with multiple one-loss teams in play.\nThe Big Ten announced its new tiebreaking procedures ahead of the 2024 season and will follow these guidelines next month.A. The tied teams will be compared based on head-to-head matchups during the regular season.B. The tied teams will be compared based on record against all common conference opponents.C. The tied teams will be compared based on record against common opponents with the best conference record and proceeding through the common conference opponents based on their order of finish within the conference standings. The tied teams will be compared based on the best cumulative conference winning percentage of all conference opponents.D. The representative will be chosen based on the highest ranking by SportSource Analytics (team Rating Score metric) following the regular season.E. The representative will be chosen by random draw among the tied teams conducted by the commissioner or designee.SEC tiebreakersThere are currently six teams separated by one loss or fewer in the SEC, meaning the league's tiebreaker scenarios will likely come into play to decides which two squads play in Atlanta. The following procedures will be used, in order, to determine that game's entries:A. Head-to-head competition among the tied teams B. Record versus all common conference opponents among the tied teams C. Record against highest (best) placed common conference opponent in the conference standings, and proceeding through the conference standings among the tied teams D. Cumulative Conference winning percentage of all conference opponents among the tied teams E. Capped relative total scoring margin (see Appendix A) per SportSource Analytics versus all conference opponents among the tied teamsF. Random draw of the tied teamsIf a tiebreaker produces standings with two teams tied for first place in league play, they are both selected for the championship game. To decide the seeding of the two teams, they will progress through the two-team tiebreaker procedures, which determines the home and away designation for the SEC Championship Game.\nIn the event of a two-team tie for second place, the SEC will use the following procedure:A. Head-to-head competition among the two tied teams B. Record versus all common conference opponents among the two tied teams C. Record against highest (best) placed common conference opponent, proceeding through the Conference standings among the tied teams D. Cumulative conference winning percentage of all conference opponents among the tied teams E. Capped relative total scoring margin per SportSource Analytics versus all conference opponents among the tied teams F. Random draw of the tied teamsIf there's a three-team tie for first place, those aforementioned steps will be used in descending order until two teams who stand alone are determined.ACC tiebreakersGeorgia Tech and Virginia are the only teams with unblemished conference records entering November. They will meet in Charlotte at the end of the year if both  out. However, Miami leads a group of five teams with one conference loss who are mathematically still alive.\nAccording to the ACC's policy, if three or more teams are tied with the highest percentage of wins or two or more teams are tied with the second highest percentage of wins in league play, the following tiebreaker procedure goes into effect:A. For a two-team tie, head-to-head competition between the two tied teams. B. Win-percentage against all common opponents. C. Win-percentage against common opponents based upon their order of finish (overall conference win percentage with ties broken) and proceeding through other common opponents based upon their order of finish. D. Combined win-percentage of conference opponents. E. The tied team with the highest ranking by the Team Rating Score metric provided by SportSource Analytics following the conclusion of regular-season games. F. The participant shall be chosen by a draw as administered by the commissioner or commissioner's designee.If three or more teams are tied atop the league standings, the following procedure will be used:A. Combined head-to-head win-percentage among the tied teams if all tied teams are common opponents. B. If all tied teams are not common opponents, the tied team that defeated each of the other tied teams.C. Win percentage against all common opponents. D. Win percentage against common opponents based upon their order of finish (overall conference win percentage, with ties broken) and proceeding through other common opponents based upon their order of finish. E. Combined win-percentage of conference opponents. F. The tied team with the highestranking by the Team Rating Score metric provided by SportSource Analytics following the conclusion of regular season games. G. The participant shall be chosen by a draw as administered by the Commissioner or Commissioner's designee.Big 12 tiebreakersThe Big 12 race joins the SEC and ACC as chaotic coming down the stretch. Separated by a game in the league standings, BYU, Cincinnati, Texas Tech and Houston look like the four teams best-suited to challenge one another for two spots.\nHere's the Big 12's tiebreaker procedure, enacted in 2024, that will be used in determining the two teams who play at AT&T Stadium in December in the event of a two-team tie for second:A. Head-to-head competition among the two tied teams. B. Win percentage against all common conference opponents among the tied teams. C. Win percentage against the next highest placed common opponent in the standings (based on the record in all games played within the conference), proceeding through the standings. When arriving at another group of tied teams while comparing records, use each team's win percentage against the collective tied teams as a group (prior to that group's own tie-breaking procedure) rather than the performance against individual tied teams. D. Combined win percentage in conference games of conference opponents (i.e., the strength of conference schedule). E. Total number of wins in a 12-game season. The following conditions will apply to the calculation of the total number of wins — only one win against a team from the FCS or lower division will be counted annually. Any games that are exempted from counting against the annual maximum number of football contests per NCAA rules shall not be included. F. Highest ranking by SportSource Analytics (team Rating Score metric) following the last weekend of regular-season games. G. Coin toss If there are multi-team ties in the Big 12, which is a high-probability this season, the following procedure will be followed:A. The records of the three (or more) tied teams will be compared based on winning percentage in games among the tied teams — if all teams involved in the tie did not play each other, but one team defeated all other teams involved in the tie, the team that defeated all other teams in the tie is removed from the tiebreaker, and the remaining teams revert to the beginning of the applicable tiebreaker process (i.e., two team or three or more team tie). Also, if all teams involved in the tie did not play each other and no team defeated all other teams involved in the tie, move to the next step in tiebreaker. B. The records of the three (or more) tied teams will be compared based on winning percentage against all common conference opponents played by all other teams involved in the tie. C. Record of the three (or more) tied teams against the next highest placed common opponent in the standings (based on the record in all games played within the conference), proceeding through the standings. When arriving at another group of tied teams while comparing records, use each team's win percentage against the collective tied teams as a group (prior to that group's own tie-breaking procedure) rather than the performance against individual tied teams. D. Record of the three (or more) tied teams based on combined win percentage in conference games of conference opponents (i.e., strength of conference schedule) E. Total number of wins in a 12-game season. The following conditions will apply to the calculation of the total number of wins: Only one win against a team from the FCS or lower division will be counted.American tiebreakersThere are seven teams separated by a single game  in the American standings. Navy and Tulane are the lone unbeatens against conference competition. The tiebreaker policy in the American is a bit different from its Power Four counterparts. In the event of a multi-team tie, the following procedure will take effect:\nIf there is no head-to-head result, and one of the tied teams was ranked in the latest available CFP Selection Committee rankings and doesn't lose in the final weekend of regular-season conference play, it will be declared a Championship Game participant. If there is no head-to-head result, and one of the tied teams was ranked in the latest available CFP Selection Committee rankings and loses in the final weekend of regular-season Conference play, then a composite average of selected computer metrics (Connolly SP+, SportSource TR116 SOR, ESPN SOR, KPI) will be used to determine the Championship Game participant. If there is no head-to-head result, and both tied teams are ranked in the latest available CFP Selection Committee rankings, the higher-ranked tied team that doesn't lose in the final weekend of the Conference regular season will be a Championship Game participant. If there is no head-to-head result, and neither of the tied ranked teams wins in the final weekend of the conference regular season, a composite average of selected computer metrics (Connolly SP+, SportSource TR116 SOR, ESPN SOR, KPI) after all games concludes the final weekend of the Conference regular season will be used to determine the Championship Game participant.If there is no head-to-head result, and neither of the tied teams is ranked in the latest available CFP Selection Committee rankings going into the final weekend of the conference regular season, a composite average of selected computer metrics (Connolly SP+, SportSource TR116 SOR, ESPN SOR, KPI) after all teams conclude the final weekend of the Conference regular season will be used to determine the Championship Game participant. If still tied, win percentage against all common conference opponents. As noted, the CFP rankings are vital within the American's tiebreaker policy. The selection committee's first top 25 will be released on Nov. 4.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The model says the Over hits in 69% of simulations. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Over 45.5 in Syracuse vs. North Carolina (-110)Bill Belichick made a name for himself first as a defensive coordinator for the Giants and then as a defensive-minded head coach for the Patriots. He's starting to establish that brand at North Carolina, but the Tar Heels did give up 34 points or more against three of the five power conference opponents they've faced.

    "body": "\n        LSU women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey was \"heartbroken\" Thursday after learning that the man who brought her home to Louisiana -- athletic director Scott Woodward -- had been fired by the university. Mulkey found out about the decision during the Tigers' exhibition win against Langston, according to associate head coach Bob Starkey.\"It made its way to the bench,\" Starkey said after the game, filling in for Mulkey's press conference. \"... Scott has a deep love for coaches and student-athletes and the people that work for him. He works incredibly hard to make sure we have the resources. He has a passionate love about this university and about this state. We, and me personally, are a lot better for him.\"LSU announced Thursday night that it had finalized a separation agreement with Woodward, ending his six-year tenure as athletic director. Verge Ausberry, a longtime administrator and Woodward's deputy, was named interim athletic director.\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWoodward's departure came just days after the university fired football coach Brian Kelly, and one day after Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry publicly criticized Woodward for the size of Kelly's 10-year, $95 million contract. Kelly's buyout is estimated at $53 million -- the second-largest in college football history -- after LSU cut ties with him eight games into his fourth season.\nLandry also said this week that Woodward would not be involved in the search for Kelly's replacement, signaling that a change in leadership was likely.Woodward brought Mulkey to LSU, but also faced criticismFor Mulkey, the decision hits close to home. Woodward was responsible for one of LSU's most significant coaching hires when he brought her to Baton Rouge from Baylor in 2021. He later signed her to a 10-year, $32 million contract extension, making her the highest-paid coach in women's college basketball.Under Mulkey, LSU captured its first national championship in 2023 and has quickly become one of the nation's premier programs.\n\"In 40 years of collegiate coaching, I've worked for two phenomenal athletic directors,\" Starkey said. \"One was Skip Bertman. The other one was Scott Woodward.\"Woodward's tenure at LSU was marked by major hires across multiple sports, including Mulkey, baseball coach Jay Johnson and gymnastics coach Jay Clark -- all of whom went on to win national titles. But his big-spending approach also drew scrutiny. The costly buyouts tied to football coaches ultimately overshadowed his successes in other programs.Before joining LSU in 2019, Woodward served as athletic director at Washington and Texas A&M, where he also made headline-grabbing hires, including Jimbo Fisher and Chris Petersen.\nDespite the upheaval at the top of LSU athletics, Mulkey's team showed no signs of distraction Thursday night. The Tigers dominated Langston, 121-41, in their final preseason tune-up.Starkey said Mulkey has made sure her players stay grounded and communicate openly amid the department's leadership changes.\"Kim doesn't sweep anything under the rug,\" he said. \"She makes sure we have conversations about it and I think that really helps.\"\nAs LSU begins its regular season next week, Mulkey and her team will continue forward without the athletic director who brought her back to Louisiana.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NBA Cup begins on Friday. Don't feel ashamed if you didn't know. It's Halloween, after all. You're probably busy, and the tournament has never started this early. The group stage was a November exclusive in 2023. It extended into December last year, and used a Tuesdays and Fridays format in both seasons. This year though? It's all over the map. We begin with four Fridays: Oct. 31, Nov. 7, Nov. 14 and Nov. 21. Then the NBA will attempt to own the week of Thanksgiving with more group stage games on Nov. 25, 26 and 28.If all of that feels arbitrary to you, well, that's sort of how it's felt for the past two years. It's hard to take a tournament seriously when it's broken up in this manner. Sometimes you'll just tune into a game and see a colorful court. It's hard to get fans in tournament mode when that tournament keeps getting flicked on and off like a light switch for more than a month. This thing drags into December once we reached the knockout stage. It's more than twice as long as the NCAA Tournament despite containing none of the inherent stakes. Fans love March Madness. October through December madness? Thus far, the response has been mostly ambivalent.We are entering Year 3 of the event. Building sustained interest was always going to take time. But compare the reception here to the Play-In Tournament. It was introduced in 2020 in the Orlando bubble. In 2021, we got a classic LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry showdown followed by the ascent of the Memphis Grizzlies as they knocked Curry's Golden State Warriors out of the postseason. By the summer of 2022, the NBA moved to make the Play-In Tournament permanent. It had already reached widespread approval among fans.The NBA Cup hasn't reached a similar consensus, and it's not hard to see why. The in-season tournament lacks the one thing that makes the Play-In round so fun: stakes. Fans and critics alike have argued for years about how the NBA could introduce stakes to the tournament. Compensatory picks, guaranteed playoff berths, maybe even seeding advantages, but the league justifiably wants the event to stand on its own. The idea should be to create an event that fans care about winning separate from the NBA Finals in June. That's not going to happen if teams are really just playing for a prize that will make things easier in the spring.\nWhat the NBA can potentially remedy is the format. Every March (in college) and April (In the NBA), we're reminded of how fun single-elimination basketball is. Every November, we watch group play and point-differentials sap these Cup games of any underlying tension. As we've acknowledged, fans love March Madness. That's what makes this format so strange. Why not just copy the existing tournament that is already beloved? Who really prefers the current month-long slog that's a nightmare to actually track over a simple, \"lose and you're out\" format? The NBA Cup is not going to gain meaningful traction among casual sports fans until it switches to a single-elimination format.And that's where this event hits its first significant road block. The NBA only has 30 teams. You can't make an even bracket for 30 teams without byes. You'd need 32 for a five-round, single-elimination event. Sure, you could introduce byes to try to balance the bracket on the fly, but the NBA wants these games to count in the regular-season standings, so they need everyone to play the same number of games. This takes us back to the obvious solution: adding two teams.\nWhen the NBA conceived this event, it may have assumed two new teams were coming. That was the widespread assumption from fans, anyway. But last offseason brought the first reported opposition to expansion since the idea began gaining traction several years ago. The Athletic reported in July that a number of owners, including James Dolan of the New York Knicks, would prefer not to introduce new partners right now that would cut into the massive media rights payout each team currently receives. The NBA is expanding into Europe with an international league, but at the moment, adding a 31st and 32nd team doesn't exactly seem imminent.The tournament format makes sense with 32 teams. Obviously, a clean five-round, single-elimination bracket would work. In order to maintain a stable number of games for each team, the league could subsequently create new loser's brackets with each passing round. Everybody would play five total games, and everybody would place somewhere between No. 1 and No. 32. A compromise to the stakes argument could be to use NBA Cup placement as the universal playoff seeding tiebreaker. Games could continue to count in the regular season standings.Could the NBA try something like this by including two teams from its new European league to get up to 32 tournament slots? Perhaps. It could be effective marketing for that league, after all, though if the NBA teams blow them out, the approach could backfire. The real trouble would be in assigning regular-season stakes to a game that involves teams that aren't playing in the regular season. Should an NBA team really get credit for a victory over what is effectively a minor-league team? Is that fair when the time comes to determine playoff seeding? Probably not.\nAll of this leaves the NBA Cup in a sort of limbo. It's not giving the league the marquee event it hoped for in its current format, yet the format it needs to thrive may or may not ever arrive. So the flawed version continues to exist, and will likely come with tweaks every year until any sort of consensus is achieved. Maybe the clustering of games in late November hits, but it also makes the earlier games seem less significant. Maybe there's a way to rearrange the groups in a more exciting way. But without the established drama of a single-elimination format, we're probably going to keep arriving in late October or early November and having to remind ourselves that a tournament we'd mostly forgotten about over the last 10 months is coming back to try and likely fail to grab the attention of the casual viewer.\n            ",

The league's in-season tournament is entering its third season as part of the NBA schedule, and this year's edition will tip-off Friday, as group play begins on Halloween. The Lakers and Bucks have put up NBA Cup (or, in the Lakers' case, In-Season Tournament) banners and this season we'll see who can get their 2025 season off to a fast start on the colorful courts of the Cup. It usually doesn't take long to find out which teams are taking the Cup seriously, as the point differential tiebreakers mean those with designs on reaching the knockout rounds tend to keep their foot on the gas pedal all the way through the fourth quarter. Here we'll go through all six groups to look at the teams and make picks for who will win each and advance to the knockout rounds. Before those picks, it's time for a quick refresher on the format and rules for the NBA Cup. How does the NBA Cup work?The NBA Cup begins with the group stage, as the league's 30 teams have been divided into six groups of five teams.

The Kings and Suns are off to slow starts and are unsurprisingly long shots to win the group. The Jazz have been one of the surprises of the NBA's first week, and anyone that buys this as being a real leap from Utah can get them at a big price to shock the group. Lauri Markkanen became the latest NBA star to put up a 50-ball and the Jazz could look at the NBA Cup as a chance to test themselves in a competitive environment for the first time after a few years of aggressive tanking. The problem for Utah is they almost assuredly have to beat the Thunder to win the group, and OKC has picked up right where they left off after their first title campaign last year. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looks like an MVP frontrunner again, and while they've been taken to double overtime twice, their depth keeps showing up in helping find ways to win. PICK: Oklahoma City Thunder (-220)West Group BTeamOdds to win groupLos Angeles Clippers+200Los Angeles Lakers+290Memphis Grizzlies+340Dallas Mavericks+400New Orleans Pelicans+1000The most wide open group in the West is Group B, where the team that can get healthy fastest is going to have the advantage. The Clippers are slight favorites over their cross-town rivals, thanks in part to a mostly healthy roster and the best depth of any of the teams in this group. They also have the best homecourt advantage in the NBA, and will host New Orleans and Memphis as their two home games in group play. The inaugural NBA Cup champion Lakers have injury concerns for their two top stars, with Luka Dončić dealing with a finger sprain and LeBron James still yet to get on the court with a sciatica issue. While travel isn't an issue in facing the Clippers, it's still an advantage getting them at home and Dončić should be back in the lineup by then. Dončić also should have plenty of motivation against the Mavs to wrap up group play on Nov. 28. The Grizzlies are banged up themselves and they have struggled against quality opponents in the early going. The Mavs have also had a tough start in Kyrie Irving's absence, as asking rookie forward Cooper Flagg to run the point has produced the expected ups and downs. Then there are the Pelicans bringing up the rear as they've opened the season with three straight losses as they've struggled defensively out of the gates. There is no dominant team in this group (at least right now in the early going), and if any of these teams can lock in for the month of November, they will have a great shot at making the knockout stage. My pick is the Lakers, as they should get Dončić back soon and have the better home schedule by getting the Clippers in Crypto.com instead of the Intuit Dome. PICK: Los Angeles Lakers (+290)West Group CTeamOdds to win groupDenver Nuggets+200Houston Rockets +250Golden State Warriors+300San Antonio Spurs+480Portland Trail Blazers+1400The \"group of death\" in this year's NBA Cup is West Group C. The top four teams all look like legit playoff contenders in the West, and even while Portland is dealing with the fallout of Chauncey Billups' arrest, they've been a solidly competitive team. This is the most star-studded group in the entire competition, with Nikola Jokić, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Victor Wembanyama all operating at an incredibly high level early in the season. Denver is a slight favorite, but the Spurs are the team with the best record coming in as Wembanyama's made himself an MVP candidate with his unbelievable play out of the gate. The Warriors have also been red-hot to start the season, with Curry, Jimmy Butler and company looking the part of a contender early. For all the efforts of the league to create fairly equal pods of teams by using the previous year's standings to group them together, this is about as loaded a group as you could possibly make. The Warriors are my pick for two reasons. One is they won their group last year and know how to run it up to get that point differential advantage. Two is they look like a team on a mission early this season, as they know the more wins they bank now, the more cushion they can give themselves to manage minutes on an old roster before the playoffs.\nPICK: Golden State Warriors (+300)East Group ATeamOdds to win groupCleveland Cavaliers-125Atlanta Hawks+260Toronto Raptors+650Indiana Pacers+900Washington Wizards+3500The Cavs are a big favorite in East Group A for good reason, as Cleveland is the only team in this group with a winning record. After dropping their opener in New York, the Cavs have been dominant and have shown why they're one of the favorites in the East this season. The rest of this group needs to find something quickly to have a chance at reaching the knockout stage. The Hawks were supposed to take a leap this season, but they have struggled in the early going as they try to integrate some new pieces into their rotation. The Raptors have likewise stumbled out of the gates, with a defense that's giving up points in bunches. The Pacers have played a tough schedule that has exacerbated their issues without Tyrese Haliburton, and their center rotation is a major concern. Washington has struggled as expected, and the Wizards' odds reflect the gap between their roster and the rest of this group. I'm not sure how much past NBA Cup success matters, but the Pacers and Hawks have both made it to Las Vegas before, so perhaps they can recapture that magic this November. Still, right now all of these teams outside of Cleveland have been a mess and it's hard for me to trust any of them to top the Cavs. PICK: Cleveland Cavaliers (-125)East Group BTeamOdds to win groupOrlando Magic+210Detroit Pistons+230Philadelphia 76ers+280Boston Celtics+420Brooklyn Nets +4500The Magic were once bigger favorites in this group, but like the Hawks their expected leap this season hasn't materialized in the early going. That stumble out of the gates has created a logjam at the top of this group in the odds, with Detroit and Philadelphia right alongside. The Pistons have been solid, yet unspectacular in the first week of the season, but it's the 76ers that have been one of the East's big surprises. Despite a mediocre start from Joel Embiid playing on a minutes restriction, Tyrese Maxey and rookie VJ Edgecombe have the Sixers off to a red-hot start to the season that's made them a real threat in this group. Then there's Boston, who have been competitive in every game this season, but have taken a couple steps back as predicted with the absence of Jayson Tatum and loss of other key players this offseason. At the very bottom are the Nets, who have looked the part of the NBA's worst team in the first week. I believe in this early Sixers run, as Maxey looks like he's made another leap, Edgecombe is a perfect complement in the backcourt and if Embiid wakes up at all, they could be really good. PICK: Philadelphia 76ers (+280)East Group CTeamOdds to win groupNew York Knicks+125Milwaukee Bucks+360Miami Heat+470Chicago Bulls+550Charlotte Hornets+900The strongest group in the East is Group C, as the Knicks are the favorites, but will have to face a number of the East's hottest teams in the early going to advance. Milwaukee is the biggest apparent threat to New York, as Giannis Antetokounmpo is producing MVP caliber numbers again and just led the Bucks to a win over the Knicks to make an early statement. The Bucks are the defending NBA Cup champions and Giannis would love to cash another $500,000 check in Las Vegas. The Heat and Bulls both come in with winning records themselves, with Miami picking up an early win over New York as well. Even the Hornets have been competitive to start the season and won't be an easy out, with LaMelo Ball playing at an extremely high level to start the season. NBA fans are wondering just how sustainable those three teams' starts are, but for NBA Cup purposes, they just have to keep things rolling for another month to make a surprising run to the knockout rounds. My pick is Milwaukee, even though I don't love their schedule -- Miami and New York over a three-day stretch on the road is tough for a variety of reasons. Giannis is the best player in this group and the Knicks are still going through growing pains with Mike Brown's offense. Their goal is to have that figured out by April, not November. \nPICK: Milwaukee Bucks (+360)Friday's 2025 NBA Cup scheduleAll times EasternPacers vs. Hawks, 7 p.m. 76ers vs. Celtics, 7 p.m. Cavaliers vs. Raptors, 7:30 p.m. Bulls vs. Knicks, 8 p.m. Grizzlies vs. Lakers, 9:30 p.m. Suns vs. Jazz, 10 p.m. Trail Blazers vs. Nuggets, 10 p.m. Clippers vs. Pelicans, 10:30 p.m.2025 NBA Cup datesFriday, Oct. 31: 8 gamesFriday, Nov. 7: 11 gamesFriday, Nov. 14: 9 gamesFriday, Nov. 21: 9 gamesTuesday, Nov. 25: 3 gamesWednesday, Nov. 26: 9 gamesFriday, Nov. 28: 11 gamesDec. 9-10: QuarterfinalsDec. 13: SemifinalsDec. 16: Final\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season kicked off Thursday without any surprises with quarterback Lamar Jackson powering his Baltimore Ravens past the Miami Dolphins in emphatic fashion, 28-6, in his return from a three-game absence because of a hamstring injury.Jackson threw for 204 yards and four touchdowns on 18 of 23 passing to run his ledger against his hometown Dolphins to 18 passing touchdowns and just one interception for a 142.9 passer rating against Miami. That's the most passing touchdowns in a player's first five starts vs. one team since 1950 and the highest passer rating against one team all-time, minimum five starts, per CBS Sports Research. Jackson has more passing touchdowns (nine) than incompletions (eight) in his last two games against the Dolphins.Jackson going off versus Miami, wasn't bold or surprising. Let's get your Week 9 weekend slate of NFL play going the right way with five bold predictions courtesy of yours truly. Happy Halloween!Bet NFL Week 9 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass: Click here to get started:\nFalcons' Bijan Robinson becomes first RB to go over 50 rush yards vs. Patriots by going off for 100-plus on the groundThe Atlanta Falcons were absolutely embarrassed the last time they took the field in Week 8, losing at home 34-10 to the now-2-6 Miami Dolphins. They produced the fewest total yards (213) and rush yards (45) in any game since 2023 with quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and wide receiver Drake London sidelined. Running back Bijan Robinson also produced his fewest scrimmage yards (48) in any game since 2023. That's how down and out Atlanta was in Week 8. That's how rough of an outing it was. That's bad news ahead of a Week 9 matchup against the AFC East-leading New England Patriots: the 2025 Patriots are the first team since 1950 to now allow 50 or more yards rushing to any opposing running back through eight games. Despite averaging just 70.0 scrimmage yards per game in the last two games after a whopping 164.4 scrimmage yards per game across his first five games, Robinson will become the first running back to not only run for over 50 yards on the Patriots this season. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 9 NFL picks: Bills cool off red-hot Chiefs in classic shootout, Texans upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe'll be the first to go for 100 yards on them this season. Robinson leads the NFL in yards per touch (6.9) and tackles avoided (46) this season, and he's just the fifth player since 1950 with 500-plus rushing yards and 400-plus receiving yards through seven team games played. Robinson will overcome Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel's stout defense to deliver a monster, 100-yard performance for Atlanta. \nBears QB Caleb Williams throws multiple TD, no INT and doesn't get sacked at BengalsChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams, the 2024 NFL Draft's first overall pick, is still developing in his second NFL season in 2025. He leads the league in off-target rate (16%) and longest average time to throw (3.21 seconds). He's also had consecutive games with no touchdown passes and an interception, and those games weren't against heavyweight defenses. They were against the New Orleans Saints, the NFL's ninth-worst scoring defense (26.1 points per game), and the Baltimore Ravens, the NFL's third-worst scoring defense (30.0 points per game allowed).However, Williams will throw for multiple touchdowns, no interceptions and not be sacked for just the second game in his career on Sunday. The other such game he accomplished this feat in was Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys and his former head coach Matt Eberflus, who is now the Cowboys' defensive coordinator. How will he accomplish this in Week 9? Fortunately for Williams, the Bengals are the NFL's worst scoring defense (31.6 points per game allowed), and they've allowed at least 27 points in a franchise record seven consecutive games. He'll have one of the best two games of his career on Sunday against the Bengals despite his rough start to 2025. Broncos QB Bo Nix torches Texans No. 1 defenseThe Houston Texans lead the NFL in scoring defense (14.7 points per game allowed) and total defense (266.9 total yards allowed) this season, and both figures are each the fewest through the first seven games of season in franchise history. \nHowever, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix will tie his single-game, career-high with four passing touchdowns against Houston's No. 1 defense on Sunday. Between the fourth quarter of the Broncos' 33-32  Week 7 victory vs. the New York Giants and the entirety of Denver's 44-24 Week 8 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Nix became the first quarterback six or more passing touchdowns multiple rushing touchdowns in a five-quarter span since Charley Johnson in 1962.Yes, the Texans have two Pro Bowl edge rushers in Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, but the Broncos can counter them with the best pass-blocking offensive line in football: Denver allowed the lowest quarterback pressure rate (25.6%) and the fewest amount of sacks (8). Nix and his offensive line win that battle en route to another big day for the second-year sensation. Giants win third consecutive home game for first time since 2022 with upset victory over 49ersThe New York Giants are 2-6, and they're now without both star rookie running back Cam Skattebo (ankle) and Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) because of season-ending injuries. However, first-round rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart will lead New York to their third consecutive home win, a Giants' first since 2022, with an upset victory over the San Francisco 49ers despite his depleted supporting cast. Dart's eight passing touchdowns in his first five career starts are the most by a Giants quarterback in their first five starts since 1950.\nHe'll be able to continue his fast and furious production thanks to facing a 49ers pass rush that ranks fourth-worst in the NFL in quarterback pressure rate (26.7%) since Week 4, their first game after All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa tore his ACL. On a related note, San Francisco's nine team sacks, which are tied for the third-fewest in the NFL this season, are the third-fewest for the 49ers through eight games since 1975. No Skattebo and no Nabers? No problem for Dart in a Week 9 upset victory. Steelers allow 33 or more points in three consecutive games for first time since 1968The Pittsburgh Steelers have traditionally been known for their defense, but that's not the case in 2025. They've allowed 33 or more points in consecutive games. That's probably a key driver in them trading for former New England Patriots safety Kyle Dugger on Tuesday. Pittsburgh hasn't allowed 33 points in three consecutive games since 1968, before \"The Steel Curtain\" defenses of the 1970s. That's going to happen on Sunday despite the defensive upgrade with Dugger because they're facing the AFC's top seed, the 7-1 Indianapolis Colts. The Colts are the league's No. 1 scoring offense, averaging 33.8 points per game, and their 3.46 points per drive average is the highest in the NFL by any team since 2000's. Quarterback Daniel Jones is playing like a top-five passer, and running back Jonathan Taylor leads the league in rushing yards (850). Pittsburgh's defense will do something it hasn't done since the late 1960s and surrender 33 or more points for the third game in a row. \nSteelers defense this seasonFirst 5 gamesLast 2 gamesPPG allowed21.434.0Total YPG allowed355.6462.0Takeaways100Plays of 25 yards or more allowed110\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins fell to 2-7 with a 28-6 home loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday night. It was an especially disappointing result since, just four days prior, it looked as if they may have gotten back on the right track with a dominant victory against the Atlanta Falcons. Miami hung around in the early going but fell behind 14-6 at halftime while letting a few opportunities to score a touchdown slip away. The Ravens, led by the return of quarterback Lamar Jackson and his four touchdown passes, shut out the Dolphins 14-0 in the second half to cruise to victory. Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel showed obvious frustration on the sideline during the game and the home crowd let his team hear it with boos as the offense went cold and Baltimore's run game took over in the second half.\nMcDaniel made no excuses and understands the frustration of the fans. \"It sucks. That sucks. All of that does,\" McDaniel said after the loss. \"But I think it's a pretty consistent formula of fans enjoy winning. Our expectations is we have to do the work and do the right things for fans to enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, we didn't do that tonight so we've got to get back to work to give them something to cheer about.\"\nSpectators in the crowd were caught covering their faces with paper bags or empty popcorn buckets, a sign of a fanbase ready for change. \"Getting six points in the first half with having, I think, two-thirds time of possession if I remember correctly -- that's setting up for failure,\" McDaniel said. \"They were 3-for-3 in the red zone and we didn't score a touchdown. There was elements of the football confidence created last week, but the bottom line is you have to cross your t's and dot your i's in the National Football League or you get made pay. \"It's very, very disappointing and, unfortunately, we're going to have to sit on that disappointment for 10 days.\" \nIs there any path forward for the Dolphins?The Dolphins do have a Week 10 bye to figure things out and rally. After that, though, comes two tough games against the Buffalo Bills -- one of two AFC East teams with just two losses thus far -- and the Washington Commanders. Things ease up after that against the New Orleans Saints and the New York Jets, but three of Miami's final four games come against opponents with winning records. Realistically, Miami is already out of the playoff hunt. Though technically not eliminated yet, the Dolphins are 14th overall in the AFC standings and third in their own division, five games out of first place with just eight games left on the schedule. \n\"Sometimes you have to press forward and put more in, even when you get punched in the stomach,\" McDaniel said. \"I think we'll have a highly motivated team to play football the right way and get back to that momentum we thought we were building with the last game.\"\n            ",

The game kicks off at noon ET on CBS.The Black Knights have controlled the series lately, winning six of the past eight meetings, though this will be their first trip to Colorado Springs since 2019.Army enters with a continued emphasis on its ground attack, led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who has rushed for 10 touchdowns this season -- tied for fourth-most among FBS quarterbacks.

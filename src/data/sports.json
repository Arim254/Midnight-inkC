    "body": "\n        In a rough-and-tumble rivalry matchup against Utah, BYU quarterback Bear Bachmeier faced the biggest test of his young college career. His years of training had led to this moment, a physical game on a national stage.With the game tight in the fourth quarter, offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick put the ball -- and the outcome -- in his quarterback's hands, calling a quarterback draw through the heart of the Utah defense.For a moment, Bachmeier was back in the long hallway of his childhood home, playing indoor football against his older brothers. Bear was always the smallest, but never afraid to take a hit. Picture frames fell, carpets wore thin, but he kept pushing forward.\"It's just a mentality,\" Bachmeier said.Back at LaVell Edwards Stadium, the freshman crossed the goal line on a 22-yard rushing touchdown -- the game-clincher in a 24-21 victory that launched the Cougars into the College Football Playoff race.\n\"Bear was so poised and made sure everyone knew we were going to pull out the win,\" wide receiver Chase Roberts said. \"That's what a great leader does -- you make big plays in big moments.\"The next day, after the game of their lives, Bear and his brother Tiger were at a nursing home in Provo, playing guitar and singing for residents.Now 8-0 and ranked No. 7 in the first College Football Playoff rankings, BYU heads into a top-10 clash with No. 8 Texas Tech -- one of the Big 12's biggest games in years and a potential turning point in the title race. Through it all, the legend of Bear and the Bachmeier family has only grown as they lead the Cougars into what could be the program's finest hour.\nBear's brother Hank was a star quarterback at Boise State, Louisiana Tech and Wake Forest. Another brother, Tiger, transferred with him from Stanford to BYU. Their parents took them out of middle school to train full-time, hoping to raise a family of elite athletes. They were given books on science, literature, business and psychology -- and pushed to create their own paths. Every weekend was chaos, every moment a lesson.In a wide-ranging call, Hank -- now a new father -- reflected on the psychology and parenting philosophy that shaped the Bachmeiers into one of Riverside County's most remarkable athletic families.\"Sorry if I'm rambling,\" Hank said. \"This is how we all are.\"A 'super family' Bear Bachmeier grew up in a large house on acres of land in the foothills off California State Route 74, known as the Ortega Highway. His father, Michael, a former Marine who briefly played basketball at the Naval Academy, was the architect of the family's vision. His mother, April, moved to America from Thailand as a child.\nThe hyper-disciplined Michael dreamed of creating a \"super family\" of athletes in Southern California -- and, somehow, everyone bought in.\"I think my dad got hit in the head or something because he's crazy,\" Tiger Bachmeier said with a laugh. \"He had this huge, crazy vision of everything he wanted to accomplish — and he kind of brought it to life.\"Bear Bachmeier was the fourth of five children. Two of his brothers went on to play Division I college football. \n                                                                    Courtesy Hank Bachmeier\n                                                            Hank, the eldest, was the guinea pig. Enrolled in quarterback training from a young age, he quickly became a blue-chip prospect who signed with Boise State. He was pulled out of middle school to be homeschooled and attend a sports academy to maximize his development — a path his two younger brothers would later follow.\nTiger was the brains of the family. From an early age, he was buried in books, much to his dad's frustration. Michael often had to drag him outside to play, but Tiger's height and athleticism eventually earned him a scholarship to Stanford. He graduated in just two and a half years with a degree in computer science before transferring. His friends in the Bay Area like to joke that dropping out of Stanford is quite an honor.Ella, the second-eldest and only girl, was at least granted a measure of privacy — her own room — while the boys shared one large space. But she could more than hold her own. In one famous episode, the siblings — huge WWE fans — set up a ladder in their room, tied a belt to the ceiling fan and staged a \"ladder match.\" As Tiger reached for the prize, Ella twisted him into a pretzel and left him in tears, raising her hands in triumph. She went on to become an All-American heptathlete at the University of Redlands in California.That left Bear, the tagalong little brother. Tiger had inherited his nickname from their father, passed down from their veteran grandfather, and \"Bear\" felt like a natural follow-up. From a young age, Bear showed exceptional coordination — dribbling a basketball at age 2, swinging a baseball bat with ease and pulling off WWE finishing moves with flair.\nHank, Ella, Tiger and Bear were each two years apart, and Bear quickly realized he had to push himself to keep up. He was a fixture in the dugout at Tiger's baseball games, often acting as the team's unofficial mascot — and occasionally, its most opinionated strategist.\"Really, at that point, he was an annoying little brother who would always be around,\" Tiger said.As Bear got older, he began competing against kids in Tiger's and Ella's age groups. He was always the smallest, but never backed down from a challenge.\n\"It was a special way to grow up,\" Bear said. \"I wouldn't change it for the world.\"Hallway battles In their house off the Ortega Highway, the Bachmeiers had a long, narrow hallway lined with picture frames -- the site of their fiercest football battles.\"I only remember winning, to be honest,\" Tiger said.They practiced onside kicks, punting balls as hard as they could at each other before diving for recoveries. They'd run routes and fight for space as Hank threw passes. When youngest brother Buck got old enough, they turned it into two-on-two matchups.\n\"Someone would always get thrown against the wall and a frame would always break,\" Bear said. \"Somebody would always have a bloody nose and mom would be screaming.\"Tiger's slender frame gave him a natural edge in the tight space -- he could twist past defenders and snag the ball. Bear relied on brute force. Even as a kid, he was built like a tank, with thick legs he strengthened through endless squats. Sometimes he'd fill a wheelbarrow with weights and push it up and down the hills near their home to build strength.Bear Bachmeier planned to follow his brother Tiger to Stanford, but both transferred to BYU over the summer. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            When Bear enrolled in youth football, he primarily played linebacker and running back. His dad chose No. 47 for him -- he always preferred the bigger numbers normally reserved for the most physical players. Bear switched to quarterback at age 10 but kept the number his dad picked out, saying it reflects his mentality. Even as a passer, he wants to hit like a linebacker.\nThanks to years of battling Hank and Tiger in tight spaces, Bear was completely comfortable playing in a phone booth. In fact, his passing developed faster than anyone expected.\"I study all of this stuff and if you study the greats like Patrick Mahomes, the different dimensions of fields and rules, it grows a ton of creativity,\" Hank said. \"You have to solve problems with these different dimensions, right? South American soccer players are the best in the world because they're playing in alleys with coconuts.\"Organized chaosMichael Bachmeier was the visionary, but the logistics fell to April Bachmeier. As her sons got older, every weekend was a new adventure. \nSome weeks, Bear and Tiger had baseball and basketball games. Ella might have had softball, while Hank was dealing with high school obligations. And there was little Buck, still in a stroller. Somehow, she had to get everyone where they needed to go, even when events could have been hours away. \"It was organized chaos,\" Hank said. The Bachmeier family had a big minivan, spacious enough to fit seven people and a boatload of sports equipment. They clocked countless miles, dragging their children across the Southern California landscape in search of the best athletic opportunities. It typically fell to the matriarch to juggle all the pieces. Some nights, one of the boys would sleep over at a friend's house so that they could take them to a game. There was just no way for the big minivan to be in four places at once. But by the final whistle, somehow, the family always showed up. \"I don't remember a time where I didn't have a family member at a game,\" Tiger said. \"Somehow or the other, they would always make it to the game by the last quarter.\" And then there's the food. Nestled up in the mountains, the Bachmeiers had to drive more than 15 minutes into town just to get to a grocery store. With the demands of her family, April was constantly making the trek. In Asian culture, finishing everything on your plate isn't just important -- it's a sign of respect. For the Bachmeiers, with five growing children — three of whom became Division I football players -- it was more a matter of keeping up.April would cook mountains of food to satiate the boys. Bear's favorite meal was what they called a Thai Egg, which was stuffed with meat and potatoes. But for the most part, it was cooking steak, pork, chicken, eggs, any type of protein that could keep up with the boys' ravenous appetites. And rice, a constant stream of rice. Two brothers, separate recruitments Separated by only two years, Bear and Tiger have always been close. The academically inclined Tiger enrolled at Stanford over a laundry list of offers, putting him only a six-hour drive away. After an impressive high school career of his own, Bear followed. In March, Stanford coach Troy Taylor was fired after multiple investigations into his treatment of staff members went public. At that point, the transfer portal opened to players on the roster. Bear (left) and Tiger Bachmeier are separated by only two years. The brothers started their careers at Stanford, but transferred to BYU in 2025. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            BYU recruited Bear out of high school, so the staff had familiarity with the family. However, despite their closeness, Sitake recruited the brothers separately. Tiger has a bright future in computer science waiting on him once his football career is complete, so trying to find educational resources for him was top of mind. Bear also excelled academically, but the staff also wanted to pitch a strong plan to get the most out of his football ability. The Cougars have done a strong job with quarterbacks, sending Zach Wilson and Jaren Hall to the NFL Draft during Sitake's tenure. \"Everyone looks at his body and they see a power running back,\" Sitake said. \"And then they see him throw the ball and it's like, wow. This is unique.\" The brothers wanted to be valued together, but also wanted to be seen differently. BYU did that. And importantly, they found a family atmosphere that echoed so much of what they loved about their childhood. \"Not many brothers can say that they got to play high school football together, let alone college football,\" Bear said. \"It's just special. We do everything together. It's surreal.\" An unexpected opportunityOver the summer, incumbent BYU starting quarterback Jake Retzlaff faced a potential suspension for violating the school's honor code. Rather than sit out a large portion of his senior year, Retzlaff transferred to Tulane.His departure left an unexpected opening in the lineup. The Cougars retained backups McCae Hillstead and Treyson Bourguet -- both of whom had played major snaps at the Group of Six level. However, Bachmeier knew that it created an opening for him too, despite only enrolling in the summer. During camp, Bachmeier was given a two-minute drill opportunity with the first-team offense against the Cougars' first-team defense -- a stacked group filled with future pros. Bear showed no fear. He went up to his older teammates and told them -- eyes blazing -- that they were going to drive down the field and score. They were going to smoke the defense. Bachmeier had only been on campus a few weeks, but he delivered pinpoint passes and drove down the field. \"That's when I was like, okay,\" wide receiver Chase Roberts said. \"Bear can lead this team to victory.\" Bear Bachmeier is known for his powerful legs, which he developed through thousands of squats and working out around the house.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Despite his youth, Bear quickly won his teammates over with his affable, sincere personality. He would crack jokes and play his guitar with teammates. But where Bear really makes his mark is at the dinner table. \"He's friends with all the kids on the team and makes sure they always feel close,\" Roberts said. \"He makes jokes -- singing and dancing with everyone. He's just himself. When you have a guy like that as a quarterback, it makes for a tight-knit group.\" Legends Grille, attached to the football complex, serves all-you-can-eat buffet-style meals. Bear shoveled food like a lineman. Flanked by Tiger, he'd join his teammates for Korean BBQ or ramen -- and always held his own.Bear was no longer the little brother of the team. He was the leader, and everyone embraced it. \"He would surprise me in a lot of ways because he's really mature,\" Sitake said. \"He's an amazing leader. To have a freshman do that is unique and different.\" Ramping up Bear's first college football game came against Portland State, a struggling FCS program. Sitake and his staff wanted to get his feet wet, but also just wanted to see how he would react to the moment. Portland State coach Bruce Barnum saw Bachmeier on the depth chart and was bamboozled. He has a solid young quarterback in sophomore John-Keawe Sagapolutele, brother of California star Jaren. Despite being two years younger, Bachmeier was an inch taller and 15 pounds heavier. \"I watched him during pregame because I was hoping his height wasn't right, or his weight wasn't right,\" Portland State coach Bruce Barnum joked postgame. \"Then I looked at his ass and his legs and he looked like a got damn centaur.\" BYU didn't ask much of its young quarterback, he only threw the ball 11 times. Still, he finished with 97 yards passing, 32 yards rushing and five touchdowns. With a soft early schedule, BYU tried to ease him into college football. Passes went from shorter to longer, and reads got more complex over the weeks. The little hallway turned into a vast football field, and Bachmeier grew with it. \"The idea was, how do we put this together so that we can gradually bring him into the offense and not just expect to do the entire playbook from Day 1?\" Sitake said. \"Everything was deliberate and intentional. What we weren't ready for was the fact that he was actually hungry for more.\" Arizona was the first moment that the plan was put to the test. The Wildcats scored 24 unanswered points to take a 10-point fourth quarter lead. The training wheels had to come off, even after he threw two interceptions. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In the game's tight moments, Bachmeier led an 11-play touchdown drive that ended with a QB keeper for a touchdown to tie the game. The matchup went to double overtime with Bachmeier scoring what proved to be a game-winning 7-yard run for a score. \"He hasn't been fixated on the mistakes,\" Sitake said. \"He's more concerned about learning and getting better. We talk about next-play mentality -- he has it.\" Heading into Game 9, Bachmeier has thrown for 1,693 yards, rushed for 408 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. Eight of his scores have come in highly competitive wins over Arizona, Utah and Iowa State. Even bigger stages ahead?\nBYU entered the 2025 season unranked, but an 8-0 start has captured the nation's attention. On Tuesday, the Cougars came in at No. 7 in the first College Football Playoff Rankings, marking one of the program's highest rankings of the 21st Century. This Saturday, BYU plays perhaps its biggest game since joining the Big 12, a road tilt against No. 8 Texas Tech. The winner will be in the driver's seat to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and maybe even clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. BYU vanquished Utah in its first big test, one that carries major resonance as the Utes rank No. 13 in the CFP Rankings. Texas Tech is a different challenge. The Red Raiders invested handsomely in their defense, which has been one of the nation's best units. Pass rusher David Bailey is a potential first-round pick, while defensive tackle Lee Hunter and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez have garnered All-America consideration. Eyes will shift to the freshman Bachmeier as he tries to navigate the challenge. But for Bear, a national-caliber matchup at Jones AT&T Stadium is just another day fighting with his brothers in the long hallway of Ortega Highway. The field has widened -- as have the possibilities -- but all of the bumps and bruises have unleashed a transformative moment in BYU history. \"You dream about being a starting quarterback, and being that leader,\" Bear said. \"We've just got a great team. If I just do my job, we will be successful.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gio Reyna was named to the U.S. men's national team roster for the first time since March, the midfielder just one of several fresh faces on the November squad as head coach Mauricio Pochettino once again goes with an experimental approach.This month's roster features 11 players who did not participate in the October friendlies, a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia, some of the turnover explained by player availability. Tyler Adams returns after missing last month's matches while awaiting the birth of his second child, while Sergino Dest and Ricardo Pepi are back in the fold after recovering from some injuries. A handful of the notable exclusions are down to injury, too – Christian Pulisic picked up a hamstring issue against Australia, while Antonee Robinson has been dealing with a knee injury for several months now.Even then, some of the absences – and inclusions – are more notable than others. Goalkeeper Matt Turner, the 2022 World Cup starter who has not played for the USMNT since June, was left off, as were fellow World Cup veterans Weston McKennie and Tim Weah after playing in the October games. Reyna, meanwhile, is back in the mix for the first time since his summertime move to Borussia Monchengladbach in a desperate need for playing time and is joined by club and country teammate Joe Scally in his first call-up in months.The USMNT continue their preparation for the 2026 World Cup with a friendly against Paraguay on Nov. 15 and one against Uruguay on Nov. 18. Both of this month's opponents have already qualified for next summer's tournament, with Uruguay serving as the latest opponent in FIFA's top 30 to face the U.S. en route to the World Cup.\nUSMNT November rosterGOALKEEPERS (4): Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew)DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Sergino Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse FC), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel), Auston Trusty (Celtic)MIDFIELDERS (7): Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Tanner Tessmann (Olympique Lyon), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew)\nFORWARDS (5): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Folarin Balogun (AS Monaco), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Haji Wright (Coventry City)Gio Reyna returnsOn skill alone, Reyna is easily one of the most notable players in the USMNT's talent pool but things have rarely gone according to plan for a player with plenty of promise. The 22-year-old is injury-plagued but even at full fitness, he has struggled for regular playing time at the club level. Reyna has only 10-plus league games in a season once in his entire career – the 2020-21 season with Borussia Dortmund – and has not played a 90-minute league match since 2022. That level of inactivity meant he slid down the national team's depth chart, even if the years-old family feud with ex-USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter was removed from the equation.Even as Reyna said he would not \"take all the blame\" for the drama that ensued after the 2022 World Cup, rooted in reports that he was nearly kicked off the team for \"not meeting expectations on and off the field,\" the player did admit that his USMNT destiny was in his own hands. Playing time at the club level is a must for Pochettino and though Reyna has started just once for Monchengladbach, injuries again hampering his ability to play, he is steadily building some match fitness. It was enough to earn at least one more look from Pochettino, who seems intent on learning as much about everyone in the player pool as possible before locking in his World Cup roster.\nForward race heats upThe USMNT's results have trended upward in recent months, in large part because the team now boasts a handful of forwards who are in impressive form. After an injury-plagued year, Folarin Balogun has two goals and one assist in his last four games for the national team, while Haji Wright bagged a brace against Australia in his first start under Pochettino. The pair have coupled that with strong performances for their club teams and for November, another in-form player will join them – Ricardo Pepi.The PSV striker is back with the national team for the first time in a year, spending much of that time dealing with a knee injury. He has picked up from where he left off at the club level, though – he has five goals in 12 games across all competitions, most recently a stoppage-time equalizer in PSV's 1-1 draw at Olympiacos on Tuesday. For the first time in a long time, the U.S. may have an embarrassment of riches in that position, fostering a sense of competition that should benefit the national team in their build-up to the World Cup.Matt Freese, the new No. 1?Even as Pochettino opts for experimentation, a trend seems to be emerging in the goalkeeper position. The job now feels like Matt Freese's to lose, the New York City FC shot-stopper going from relative obscurity to starting 11 of their last 12 matches. Those 11 caps make him the most experienced 'keeper on the roster, with 2022 World Cup starter Turner nowhere to be seen. He was named to the October roster but did not play a single minute. Freese is now flanked by goalkeepers with little experience. It is too early to suggest Turner might not crack the World Cup roster, but his days as the team's go-to in goal may be over with Pochettino perhaps focusing on giving Freese as much experience as possible before the big event.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout the offseason the CBS Sports MLB   experts will bring you a                             weekly Batting Around roundtable, breaking       down      pretty       much           anything.    The latest news, a      historical      question,         thoughts    about       the future  of         baseball,   all   sorts of   stuff. This week we're going to tackle the Dodgers and whether this year's World Series title makes them a dynasty.  Are the Dodgers a dynasty? R.J. Anderson: If they aren't, then it's time to retire the concept  because I don't see many, if any, teams clearing the bar anymore. This  isn't the 1950s; the playoffs are too bloated and tricky to expect any  club to do much better than what the Dodgers have done over the last 13 seasons.  We're talking about three World Series titles; five pennants; 12  division titles; 90-plus win pace each year. They're not done, either.Matt Snyder: My initial thought was that a dynasty has to have at  least three championships within a small period of time and I was  reluctant to loop in 2020 since there were three titles between that and  2024. But really, that's not too big of a gap. This is three  championships in six seasons with two of them being back-to-back titles.  If we figure what a juggernaut the Dodgers have been in the regular  season for so long and point out that they've won five pennants in the  last nine seasons, I think the answer is pretty clear that, yes, this is  a dynasty. Dayn Perry: I think the standard has to be different for MLB relative  to other leagues. It's just too hard to make it through all the rounds  of the postseason, with that baseball-style randomness baked in. So,  yes, the Dodgers are a dynasty, and honestly I would still consider them  one regardless of how Game 7 played out. Regular-season achievements  impress me more than deep playoff runs, but the Dodgers have both going  for them. Their last decade has been something to behold. They're an  obvious dynasty.  \nMike Axisa: I'm a bit of a stickler with this stuff. I don't think winning pennants outside the championship years extends a dynasty (is the Yankees' dynasty 1996-2000 or 1998-2003?) nor do I think regular-season success matters. A dynasty is about winning titles, period. I would say three titles in six years is on the lower end of what I would call a dynasty, but winning back-to-back titles helps, plus there's a good amount of overlap between the 2020 and 2025 Dodgers. They had six players appear in both in the 2020 and 2025 World Series: Mookie Betts, Enrique Hernández, Clayton Kershaw, Max Muncy, Will Smith, and Blake Treinen. So yes, the Dodgers are a dynasty. \n            ",

Denver has won six straight games despite trailing entering the fourth quarter in four of those contests. However, the majority of their slow starts have come on the road this season, as the Broncos are 4-0 playing in Denver with an average victory of 13.5 points in the mile-high altitude. The Broncos defeated the Cowboys, 44-24, in their last game in Denver. Meanwhile, the Raiders traded wide receiver Jakobi Meyers for draft picks on Tuesday as they are in the midst of another lost season with a 2-6 record at the bottom of the AFC West. The model projects the Broncos to cover the spread in 62% of simulations.Over 42.5 pointsThe Broncos were held to 18 points last week against the Texans, but Houston has the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL. In the two prior weeks, Denver scored 44 points against Dallas and 33 points against the Giants, and the Raiders' defense is more similar to those units than Houston's defense. The Raiders are 23rd in scoring defense, allowing 26.3 ppg this season, and they've allowed at least 30 points in back-to-back games. Las Vegas has also allowed at least 25 points in five of its last six games. Meanwhile, the Raiders scored 29 points against the Jaguars, which is the third-most Jacksonville has allowed this season, so that may create offensive momentum going into a short week for TNF. The model projects the Over to hit in 62% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        The newest DraftKings promo code offers new users $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass, perfect for Thursday Night Football between the Broncos and Raiders. The Broncos are tied for the best record in the NFL at 7-2 entering their Thursday Night Football matchup against the Raiders, but they've trailed in the fourth quarter in four of those six games, including twice by double-digits. However, the SportsLine model doesn't expect that trend to continue on Thursday Night Football, projecting the Broncos to win handily and making Denver -9.5 one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.SportsLine's advanced computer model has also identified value in college football and NBA games. The model likes the Suns to cover as 2.5-point favorites and projects UTSA to keep pace with South Florida and cover as 13.5-point underdogs. The Suns play the Clippers, who are without James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. The model enters Week 3 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 26-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. It also enters Week 10 on a sizzling 47-29 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024 for the NFL. Anyone following its college football betting picks, NBA betting advice or NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookUTSA (+13.5) vs. South Florida (-108)Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-112)Combining the model's three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +595 (risk $100 to win $596). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nUTSA (+13.5) vs. South Florida (-108)Owen McCown is the son of an NFL quarterback, but he was playing like a professional the last time he was on the field. The junior was near flawless, completing 31 of 33 passes (93.9%) for 370 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-26 win over Tulane when playing on Thursday last week. McCown, the son of former NFL cornerback Josh McCown, has 10 touchdowns compared to two interceptions over his last four games, and he's averaging 210 passing yards per game on the season. Outside of its opening matchup against Texas A&M, which is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, UTSA has covered a 13.5-point spread in six of seven games this season. South Florida is a quality team at 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the conference, but the model views this as too many points for a capable offense led by McCown. The model projects UTSA to cover in 63% of simulations. Back UTSA at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Pete Carroll's return to an NFL sideline has been a tough one the majority of the season, as the Raiders are 2-6 in his first year as Las Vegas head coach, with four of those losses coming by double digits. The Raiders' last four results include a 31-0 loss to the Chiefs and a 40-6 loss to the Colts, and with the Broncos having a 7-2 record entering Thursday Night Football, they are approaching that elite AFC status of teams like the Chiefs and Colts. The Raiders are 29th in scoring (16.5 ppg) and 30th in total yards (283.3 per game), and they traded arguably their most talented wide receiver in Jacobi Meyers at the trade deadline. The Broncos have won six straight gam=ames, and the model expects that to continue convincingly, projecting Denver to cover the spread in 62% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Clippers will be without their two superstars on Thursday with James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle) both out. Having one of them out is a significant loss for Los Angeles, but both being out is a situation the model doesn't project the Clippers will overcome. Devin Booker is averaging 31 points and seven assists as the clear alpha for the Suns this season, and he's coming off scoring 38 points against the Warriors on Tuesday. The Suns are home on Thursday, and they are 3-1 at home this season, with their only loss in Phoenix coming in a 114-113 final against the Grizzlies. The model projects the Sun to cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Suns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Thursday NFL, NBA and college football picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Las Vegas' defense was on the field for a whopping 77 plays. Bo Nix has played well against the NFL's softer defenses, and this matchup qualifies,\" SportsLine NFL handicapper Larry Hartstein said. \"Especially with the Raiders, on a short week, traveling to altitude. Geno Smith has Brock Bowers back, but he struggles when pressured. Now he has to deal with the league's top pass rush. I would lay anything less than 10.\" Back Denver at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 224.5 points in Suns vs. Clippers (-110)\"The Clippers have had an uneven start to the new season and now have some other concerns for tonight, specifically James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, both ruled out. The Clips could probably live without Harden, but not Kawhi, whose added dimensions are difficult to replace,\" SportsLine NBA handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Add Norman Powell's offseason departure to Miami and can see Ty Lue's short-term dilemma. We're hardly sure perimeter-oriented Phoenix takes advantage, and totals-wise, this one doesn't seem to have shootout written all over it, with the Suns hoping that G Jalen Green finally makes his debut tonight (we'll sse), while the Clips have performed somewhat erratically.  \" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:UTSA money line vs. USF (+400)The model predicts that USF wins this game 59% of the time, but you're getting incredible value here with UTSA winning in 41% of simulations.

USF lost to Memphis to effectively end its chances of making the College Football Playoff and has had a bye week to stew in it.

    "body": "\n        There's something about playing together that just feels right for Tommy Fleetwood and Shane Lowry. After sharing a tee time through 36 holes at the 2025 India Championship a couple of weeks ago, playing beautifully alongside one another, the Europeans were at it again Thursday at Yas Links Abu Dhabi, where they signed for matching 64s to share the lead in the opening leg of the DP World Tour playoffs.Lowry and Fleetwood were not the only two players to reach 8 under in the first round of the 2025 Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, as the two Ryder Cup teammates join Richard Sterne, Adrien Saddier and Kazuma Kobori at that number. Alex Noren of Sweden and American Michael Kim sit just one off the pace as Englishmen Tyrrell Hatton and Aaron Rai stand among those at 6 under.\"Was very, very good off the tee, and I think I made some good decisions off the tee,\" Fleetwood said. \"Felt very comfortable with the shots that I chose and I hit. You know, putted well. I think I made a big par save on 12 and followed that with a birdie, which was, I think, a crucial part of the round if it's going to be a very, very good round. Very happy. It's Thursday. You can obviously play your way out of it. You can't win it, but 8 under is a really nice way to start.\"Entering the week No. 26 in the Race to Dubai, Fleetwood started with a flurry. A kick-in birdie on the first hole was followed by another on the par-5 2nd. He made most of his noise around the turn, however, as the FedEx Cup winner added five circles onto his scorecard across Nos. 7-13. \nWhile Fleetwood credited his play off the tee, his putter should not go overlooked. Continuing the best season of his career on the greens, the 34-year-old made five putts from outside 8 feet, including a crucial par save on the par-4 12th, followed by a birdie from 23 feet on the next.Fleetwood's inability to birdie the par-5 finisher, coupled with Lowry's last birdie of the day, meant the two stood tied at 8 under. All four of Lowry's front-nine birdies came from inside of 3 feet before his putter started to cooperate a bit more on the back nine. His lone blemish on the scorecard came via a three-putt from 70 feet away on No. 12.\"I was paired with him in India the first two days, and I shot 64, as well,\" Lowry said. \"So yeah, something about me and Tommy. But no, I just like playing with him, your friend and really good player, too, and you kind of feed off each other. It was nice.\"\nWhile Fleetwood and Lowry top the tournament leaderboard, the Race to Dubai standings still belong to Rory McIlroy. Putting a new TaylorMade Qi4D driver in the bag, the grand slam champion's week started precariously as he was forced to play a provisional off the first tee. However, once he found his initial tee shot and saved par, McIlroy was on his way and settled for a 4-under 68. \"I felt like the driver was good,\" McIlroy said. \"Obviously, a new driver in the bag this week. Felt like that worked well. Hit some good iron shots. Felt like I controlled my ball in the wind pretty well when the wind got up there a little bit for the last few holes. Just need to hole a few more putts. I think that was the difference between what I shot today and being up there around the lead.\"\nMcIlroy's closest competitor in the season-long race got a front-row seat on Thursday as Marco Penge shared a tee time with the Northern Irishman for the first time in his career. The Englishman clipped McIlroy by a single stroke after a topsy-turvy start that read: birdie, eagle, bogey, bogey, birdie.\nPenge settled down as the day progressed and ultimately signed for a 67 to eke his way inside the top 20 and potentially eke closer to McIlroy before next week's DP World Tour Championship. At 5 under, the three-time DP World Tour winner this season finds himself alongside his fellow countryman Matt Fitzpatrick on the leaderboard.\"It was great,\" Penge said. \"I mean, obviously, what I think of my game compared to obviously playing with him today, probably keep to myself, but it was good. It was good. Rory maybe wasn't firing on all cylinders, but yeah, it was cool to play with like a Grand Slam winner and a legend of European golf.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NBA players are masters at finding motivation wherever they can. Donovan Mitchell reminded us of this fact on Wednesday when he credited a kid who was heckling him during an online game of NBA 2K26 for inspiring his brilliant 46-point, eight-assist outing in the Cleveland Cavaliers' 132-121 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Cavaliers turned back the clock on Wednesday by wearing their \"Classic Edition\" jerseys, which were made famous by LeBron James during his first stint with the team from 2005-2010. They also brought back the mid-2000s style court and the intro video, all of which Mitchell said was \"really cool.\" However, he said his big performance had nothing to do with the theatrics. Here's Mitchell's full story:\"You have moments where it's like -- obviously you play this game and you're trying to win, but his was just a cool day as a whole for me. And obviously to have the night I had was definitely special as well. But I wouldn't put the game I had based on the court. \"This kid pissed me off today, I was playing 2K. I had been playing 2K for like two hours and I told him, too, I said 'just wait.' He called me 'washed up,' he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn't seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, 'alright, we'll see.' He told me to 'go to sleep.' He was going in. So this game was for that kid or grown man or whoever that was. So I appreciate you. I told him I'd give him a shoutout, too. So that's what tonight was.\"There are some Michael Jordan vs. LaBradford Smith vibes to this story. Smith poured in a career-high 37 points against Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in March of 1993. After the game, Jordan claimed that Smith taunted him by saying, \"nice game, Mike.\" Jordan promised that he would return the favor to Smith, and sure enough, Jordan poured in 47 points when the two teams met again the very next day. Years later, Jordan admitted he made the whole story up to motivate himself. \nWas a small child actually calling Mitchell \"washed up\" on NBA 2K voice chat? Who knows. But much like the LaBradford Smith legend, it doesn't really matter. It's a funny story and Mitchell delivered a huge game to get the Cavaliers one of their biggest wins of the season. \nFittingly, Mitchell joined Jordan as the only players in NBA history to have at least 45 points and eight assists on 70% shooting or better and 10-plus made free throws without a miss. Mitchell (13) also passed James (12) for the most games with 40 points and five 3s in Cavaliers history. Mitchell and the Cavaliers have gotten off to a somewhat frustrating start this season. They fell to the New York Knicks on opening night in a battle of Eastern Conference favorites, and Mitchell has been dealing with a hamstring issue that forced him to miss their loss to the Toronto Raptors on Halloween. When Mitchell has been on the floor, however, he's largely been awesome. This was his fifth game with at least 30 points in seven appearances, and he's averaging 31.9 points per game -- good for fifth in the league -- on 57.6/45.5/82 shooting splits. \nThe Cavaliers, meanwhile, are now 5-3, which has them in a tie for third place in the Eastern Conference. If kids keep heckling Mitchell while he's playing video games, the Cavs will be in first place in no time. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Manchester City's resounding 4-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, Erling Haaland may have stolen the show with City's second goal in the 29th minute of play, but it was a good moment to get him the ball by Jermie Doku as well. The Belgian floated the ball into space, and it seemed like he had a telepathic connection to pick out Haaland's run, but as he opened up to CBS Sports following the match, that wasn't the case.It's a bit of why Haaland is great because Doku explained that he saw the space and trusted that someone would find their way into it.\n\"I saw the defenders going to the post, and I saw a gap, and I said, 'Someone has to be there,'\" Doku said on the UEFA Champions League post-match show. \"I just play in the gap. I didn't have the time to see Erling. I just saw the gap, and I played in the gap, and he was there.\"That level of trust in the team's style is part of why the City attack is able to be so good. Doku has been finding his own footing with the team, already having two goals and four assists in all competitions as the 23-year-old is combining his devastating pace with his improving vision and ability to be able to pick out a pass. That's something that he was able to improve during his time with the Belgian national team, where he worked with Thierry Henry, who was an assistant coach with the squad.\n\"I just play free. I come to the ball and I don't care if I lose the ball or not, I play free and purely out of instinct. I go where the ball is, and I don't think about the consequences. If I think too much about the statistics, then I'm not going to do it. So it comes naturally, and I also speak with a legend that sometimes helps me as well.Doku is referring to what he's learned from Henry, which is something that he expanded on how Henry's guidance has helped him with his take ons.\"Nobody really talks to me about my 1v1s, but he was the first person ever that talked to me about my 1v1s and how, how I can be better and effective in the last phase,\" Doku said. \"Because a lot of people say Jeremy, have to be more statistics, more statistics, but how? They don't tell me how. Just do it, do it, do it, but how? And he really talks to me about how, and that's the first time, and I appreciate that.\"\nIn response, Henry went into what he talked to Doku about and it's clear how it came into his assist for Manchester City.\n\"He has zero limits but he needs guidance. When you explain something to someone, if there is no thought process behind it, they're not going to comprehend what needs to happen,\" Henry said. \"We all know that he can finish, but sometimes you need to slow down and re-accelerate to see the big picture. \"Do you see the solution or do you see the problem? When you put your head up, your eyes can be pretty deceiving. What do you see? Do you see the problem? We see the solution; the brain will make you see the solution. Sometimes eyes can be deceiving, and you see the problem; that's the difference.\"\nIn an age where analytics are growing, this feels like a throwback to where wingers got chalk on their boots and fired crosses into the box. A Guardiola system can be criticized for turning players into robots, but Doku is showing that there is individuality left at Manchester City, which can help push the team forward as they look to win another Champions League title. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're halfway through the 2025 NFL season, which means it's time to once again check in on where things stand, in a big picture sense. We have almost as much information as is necessary to truly separate the contenders from the pretenders this season, so that's what we're going to try to do. Just as we did a few weeks ago, we're splitting the league into four buckets: the inner and outer circles of contenders, fringe playoff teams and those that should be making draft preparations. Those tiers are listed below, with the teams in each tier listed in alphabetical order.Tier 4: Draft preparationsBrowns, Cardinals, Commanders, Dolphins, Giants, Jets, Raiders, Saints, TitansWe'll see you all in Pittsburgh. Given your record and/or your injury situation, you're likely playing for draft positioning at this point.Tier 3: The fringeBears, Bengals, Cowboys, Falcons, Jaguars, Panthers, Steelers, Texans, VikingsThese teams are not yet eliminated from playoff contention, but they also seem fairly unlikely to make much noise if they do make it to the postseason because of their various flaws. \nFor the Bears, Bengals, Cowboys and Steelers, that flaw is just their defense. Those teams all rank inside the bottom seven in yards allowed and three of them are in the bottom four in points allowed. They check in 24th, 32nd, 31st and 21st, respectively, in EPA per play allowed, via Tru Media, with all of them ranking in the bottom eight against the pass and only the Bears checking in as above-average against the run. I don't care how good your offense is; you can't expect to win playoff games when the other team can consistently light you up on the opposite side of the ball. For the Falcons, Panthers, Texans and Vikings, the questions are mainly on the offensive side. Atlanta can run it, but Michael Penix Jr. has been highly inconsistent. Rico Dowdle can run it, but Bryce Young and the passing offense are not nearly consistent enough. The Texans have been plodding their way through the season offensively all year. And we've only seen three games of the Vikings' offense with J.J. McCarthy under center, and that offense has looked decent or better for maybe five quarters.Packers DE Micah Parsons. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Tier 2: The outer circle49ers, Buccaneers, Broncos, Chargers, Colts, Packers, Patriots, RavensThis is probably the most interesting tier, given that it includes teams with records ranging from 7-2 to just 3-5. These are the teams that are contenders, but have ... something missing that is holding us back from declaring them to be among the best of the best. \nFor the 49ers, that something is the massive wave of injuries. They're still without Brandon Aiyuk and Ricky Pearsall. Fred Warner and Nick Bosa are out for the year. We don't know if or when Brock Purdy will be fully healthy. It's just a lot to deal with. The Bucs have injuries of their own with Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Bucky Irving and more still sidelined. And their offense unsurprisingly hasn't been as consistent or explosive as it was last year. The Broncos have an elite defense, but their offense is ... suspect and can look terrible for multiple quarters at a time. We've seen that it also has the capability to go off at any moment, but those lulls are concerning to say the least. The Chargers may or may not have any healthy offensive linemen remaining on their roster at the moment. The Colts are still quarterbacked by Daniel Jones, who can turn back into a pumpkin at any moment. We saw what it looks like when that team has to play from behind instead of ahead last week against the Steelers. There are still question marks on defense as well -- even after the acquisition of Sauce Gardner. The Packers, too, consistently play down to the level of their competition, which puts them in the inner circle right now. They've lost to the Browns and Panthers, tied the Cowboys and barely beat the Cardinals. Let's see them perform at a consistently high level. \nThe Patriots are almost entirely dependent on Drake Maye bailing out the rest of their offense. He's mostly done it so far, but there are mild concerns that they don't have enough explosive skill-position talent to compete with the other best offenses. And the Ravens are still only 3-5. They're in this tier because Lamar Jackson still exists and could easily take them on a massive run to win the AFC North. Of these eight teams, the Packers (+1000) and Colts (+1200) have the best odds of winning the Super Bowl, according to BetMGM.Bills QB Josh Allen. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Tier 1: The inner circleBills, Chiefs, Eagles, Lions, Rams, SeahawksFive of these six teams comprise the top five in Super Bowl odds at FanDuel. (It's the Chiefs, Bills, Eagles, Lions and Rams, in that order.) The sixth is a team that keeps proving that it belongs in this discussion and actually checks in eighth in those odds. \nThe Bills don't have the best record in the conference or even their own division. However, they do have Josh Allen, and their defense has just put together its best performance of the season, which suggests it may be rounding into shape. They're going to be in the mix down to the end. Are the Chiefs currently 5-4 and technically in position to miss the playoffs? Yep. Do I care in the least bit when it comes to considering them a true contender? I do not. They win the AFC just about every year and they still have Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. They're a contender until somebody knocks them out. The Eagles haven't looked like themselves for much of this year, but they seemingly got back on track in their game prior to the bye week. We'll see if that carries over against Green Bay on Monday night, but even if it doesn't, we know the type of ceiling this team has, and it's as high as that of any team in football. We can say the same about the Lions. Especially when they get ahead in a game and get to play their preferred style, they are very tough to beat. They have flaws, but their offense and defense can hit a level that few other teams can reach. The Rams and Seahawks are very similar. Their quarterbacks are playing extraordinarily efficient football while throwing to one of the best wide receivers in the game. They are committed to running the ball and defenses respect that commitment despite the fact that they haven't been all that good at it so far. And their defenses are playing at an extremely high level, albeit in very different systems. \n            ",

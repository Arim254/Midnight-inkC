    "body": "\n        John Cena vs. AJ Styles was the pinnacle of Cena's retirement tour  for many fans. Their showdown at WWE Crown Jewel is regarded as one of  the best matches of the year. However, the original plan for Crown Jewel  was for Cena to face Drew McIntyre.Cena recently told the \"No-Contest\" podcast that Cena vs. McIntyre was slated for WWE's  October pay-per-view. However, the promotion pivoted to Styles after  Cena tweeted out \"The Phenomenal\" one's name. The fan response to Cena's tweet seemed to spur a different outcome than what was originally planned for McIntyre.\"I knew enough,\"  McIntyre told CBS Sports of the original plan at the WWE 2K26 hands-on event in Stamford. \"I keep my head down and  keep working no matter what happens. I can't take his phone and say,  'Just tweet my name.'\"\nIt was another blow for McIntyre, who  spent the last few years putting on acclaimed performances but consistently losing big matches. He had campaigned for a  coveted spot on Cena's retirement tour, seeking to prove once more that  he was on par with the top stars who kept beating him. \n\"I can't  change the creative direction,\" McIntyre said. \"I talked about getting a match  with Cena.  Getting a situation on the microphone with Cena to prove what  I'm  capable of because I want to compete with the best. He was the  best on  the microphone. I heard the quote John gave. \"Whatever people  weren't  feeling or going on, they decided to pivot. He outright asked  if the  people wanted AJ. The match was incredible. I could sit there  and go,  'Damn, what if he tweeted my name?' But the reality is he's  retired, and  I'm world champion, so it worked out fine for Drew  McIntyre.\"To his point, McIntyre conducted the interview with the undisputed WWE championship slung around his shoulder. It's not McIntyre's first world title reign, but it's his most validating. His first world title reign played out in front of empty seats during the pandemic. His second barely lasted five minutes. Now, McIntyre heads into WrestleMania 42 -- where tens of thousands will pack Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on April 18 and 19 -- as the defending WWE champion.\nHe's worlds apart from the boy band cosplayer who was released from WWE in 2014. The Cena setback was another reminder of a lesson he learned many times: control the controllable and keep moving.\"Things happen the way they're supposed to,\" McIntyre said. \"Many times I've been frustrated. I knew something was the right thing to do. But you have someone like Triple H leading the charge.\"WWE 2K26 is available worldwide on March 13. Fans who purchase any of  the three special editions -- King of Kings, Attitude Era, or Monday  Night Wars -- can access the game on March 6.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown led all scorers in Sunday's 111-89 road rout of the Los Angeles Lakers with 32 points, and his performance prompted LeBron James to speak up for him as an NBA MVP candidate. While Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring and is the face of a surprisingly successful Celtics squad, he stands behind numerous stars in the award race, and that is a reality that James cannot get behind.This has been a career year for Brown, whose 29.2 points per game are by far a personal high and who leads the league in field goal attempts per game.\"JB is playing great basketball, man,\" James said after the rivalry game. \"This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"The only knock against Brown's production is that he is less efficient than some of his elite counterparts. His usage rate has spiked this year as he flourished into the Celtics' ringleader with Jayson Tatum out with a torn Achilles. Because his increased workload is such a large catalyst behind his elevated play, he ranks No. 12 in the NBA's efficiency metric, well behind the premier MVP contenders.That, and Brown's lack of superstar pedigree, are likely the most to blame for his sixth-place standing in the MVP race, per FanDuel odds.\nNBA MVP oddsShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder (-145)Nikola Jokić, Nuggets (+270)Cade Cunningham, Pistons (+650)Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (+2500)Luka Dončić, Lakers (+4000)Jaylen Brown, Celtics (+5000)Jaylen Brown's value goes beyond career-best scoring outputWhile Brown cannot compete with the likes of Jokić, Dončić and Gilgeous-Alexander from an efficiency standpoint, the value he brings to the Celtics is undeniably important for a team that seeks to contend in what was supposed to be a down year.In past years he was a prominent wingman to Tatum, but this season, Brown has proven an ability to put a franchise on his shoulders and lead it to championship contention. The Celtics are second in the Eastern Conference, while preseason projected win totals suggested they should have been in firm danger of missing the playoffs.\"I think he's just using motivation of a lot of people saying that they're going to have a down year because of JT being out, them losing Jrue [Holiday],\" James said. \"Al [Horford] leaves. [Kristaps] Porziņģis leaves. Their whole championship team pretty much is revamped. He uses that as motivation to keep them afloat. They're playing great basketball, and it's because of him and the rest of those guys. He's taken that next step.\"\nWhat's more, Brown has been highly available, playing 51 of the Celtics' 56 games. That is more than any of the MVP candidates who stand ahead of him on the odds board.\n            ",

Veteran pass rusher Michael Danna is now available after the Kansas City Chiefs decided to release him. Like every team, the Chiefs need to be in compliance with the NFL salary cap prior to 4 p.m. on Wednesday, March 11, which is the start of the new league year. The release of Danna is slated to free up $8.94 million of cap space, which leaves Kansas City $6.5 million over the cap. Danna, 28, spent each of his first six seasons with the Chiefs, who drafted him in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In 87 regular season games, Danna has recorded 21.5 sacks, 194 tackles (25 for loss), six forced fumbles and one interception. He has two sacks and one forced fumble in seven playoff games. \nDanna's two best seasons with the Chiefs took place during Kansas City's back-to-back championship run during the 2022-23 seasons. In 2022, he recorded a then-career-high 5.0 sacks despite playing in just 13 games and not receiving a single start. The following season, Danna started in each of his 16 regular season games and recorded a career-high 6.5 sacks. \nThe last two seasons haven't been as productive, however. Specifically, this past season was Danna's least productive so far as he had just one sack and 25 tackles in 15 games. He did record his first career interception during Kansas City's Week 8 win over the Washington Commanders. \nExpect Danna to have a pretty active market in free agency. Among the teams that are most in need of help at pass rusher include the Cincinnati Bengals, Tennessee Titans, Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers, Las Vegas Raiders and Detroit Lions. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        North Carolina passed a significant test without star forward Caleb Wilson on Monday night, as the No. 18 Tar Heels toppled No. 24 Louisville 77-74. The win improved the Tar Heels (22-6, 10-5 ACC) to 3-1 since Wilson suffered a fractured hand in a Feb. 10 loss at Miami. Between the uncertainty around Wilson's potential return and a subsequent injury to starting center Henri Veesaar, UNC's trajectory seemed uncertain less than a week ago. Those concerns were laid bare in blowout loss at NC State on Feb. 17.But Veessar's return in Saturday's win at Syracuse, Monday night's victory over a quality ACC foe and Wilson's apparent progression have steadied the waters in Chapel Hill. North Carolina hopes to have Wilson back for its regular-season finale against Duke on March 7, ESPN reported during the broadcast of the game .The Tar Heels are squarely in the hunt for a double-bye at the ACC Tournament and expected to remain a No. 6 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology on Tuesday following their sixth Quad 1 win.\nSeth Trimble paced North Carolina with a career-high 30 points as UNC kept Louisville at arm's length for most of the second half. The Cardinals closed within a possession on two occasions in the final minute, but a pair of Trimble free throws with nine seconds left helped UNC escape.\nIn his second game back since a two-game absence due to a lower-extremity Veesaar added 12 points for North Carolina. Mikel Brown Jr. paced Louisville (20-8, 9-6) with 24 points for the Cardinals.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Houston's Monday night showdown at Kansas is critical for Cougars' No. 1 seed aspirations\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLight at the end of the tunnelGames against Virginia Tech and Clemson still await before Wilson's expected return. But the light is now at the end of the tunnel, and the Tar Heels are proving they can manage without their leading scorer and rebounder. Wilson, who is a potential top-five pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, averages 19.8 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.4 blocks.\nIn his absence, UNC has leaned more on junior forward Jarin Stevenson and Montenegrin import Luka Bogavac. Both carried their weight against Louisville by combining for 21 points on 4 of 9 shooting from 3-point range.Seth Trimble's star gearWhile having Veesaar back and getting Wilson healthy are pivotal for North Carolina's aspirations, UNC's ceiling may ultimately be determined by the sort of guard play it gets in March. Trimble showed he can put UNC on his back, if needed, by turning in the best offensive game of his four-year Tar Heels career.His steal and breakaway dunk at the 13:38 mark gave North Carolina its biggest lead at 56-40. Trimble outplayed Louisville's formidable star tandem of Brown and Ryan Conwell, which was an accomplishment considering those two combined for 47 points. Once Wilson is back, less will be required of Trimble offensively. But this game was a reminder of his capabilities and could be a confidence booster for the team's third-leading scorer.\n            ",

He joined the Chargers ahead of the 2024 season on a two-year deal and was set to become a free agent this offseason. Bozeman started in 33 of the Chargers' 34 regular-season games over the past two years but struggled in 2025, finishing last in Pro Football Focus' center grades.\nChargers set to overhaul offensive lineWith Bozeman retiring, left guard Zion Johnson hitting free agency and right guard Mekhi Becton coming off a disappointing first season in Los Angeles, the Chargers are in line to make major moves among their offensive line, which was among the NFL's worst in 2025.Chargers OL who played at least 500 snaps in 2025PFF position rankOT Jamaree SalyerT-55th out of 70OT Trey Pipkins67th out of 70OT Bobby Hart68th out of 70OT Austin Deculus70th out of 70OG Zion Johnson47th out of 66OG Trevor Penning56th out of 66OG Mekhi Becton65th out of 66C Bradley Bozeman34th out of 34The Chargers finished 31st in pass blocking and 32nd in run blocking in Pro Football Focus' grades.\n        \n            \n                Justin Herbert still hasn't won a playoff game.

    "body": "\n        The Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's best stories this season, and Dillon Brooks has been at the heart of it. He's scoring at a rate (and in ways) we've never seen from him before on any kind of a consistent basis. He's defending, as always. His competitive prints are all over one of the grittiest teams in the league. And now he has a broken hand.There are bummers and there are bummers. This is the latter. Here's to hoping Brooks can get back in time for the playoffs/Play-In tournament (ESPN reports he'll be out 4-6 weeks), but in the meantime the Suns, who are also without Devin Booker (hip strain) for at least the next week, need to find a way to replace at least some of Brooks' 21 points per game. The natural next man for that job would be Jalen Green, who also came over from Houston with Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade. You're forgiven if you forgot Green even played for the Suns. He's missed most of the season with a hamstring issue that has refused to fully repair. But he's back and healthy (for) now. He had 26 points and four 3-pointers against San Antonio coming out of the All-Star break. On Saturday, he made up for a miserable shooting night by knocking down a fading corner 3 at the buzzer to beat the Magic in overtime. \nGreen is an electric athlete who had a legitimate superstar stretch last season in Houston, but he's never been a consistent shooter or anything close to an efficient scorer on the whole. He's only 24, but he's making $33.5 million. Next year that number rises to $36.2 million, and the year after that he has a $36 million player option as the first player to ever sign a 2+1 rookie extension on a nine-figure contract. It's a lot of money if Green doesn't pan out. But if he does, it has a chance to become a team-friendly deal. He's not going to defend like Brooks, if at all. He's not going to go to work in the post. But he'll never have a better opportunity to prove his value than right now, with the Suns badly in need of anyone who can contribute to the cause of recreating Brooks' production in the aggregate, particularly as a self creator. One of the notable strides Brooks has made this year is as a guy who can get buckets on his own; over 55% of his field goals have been unassisted. For better or worse, this is what Green does. Last season 63% of his non-garbage-time buckets were unassisted (that was the highest percentage for any wing in the league, per Cleaning the Glass). \nAgain, it's never been efficient. And so far it hasn't been with the Suns. On Sunday, Green cooked up a donut in the first half of Phoenix's loss to Portland and finished 1 of 7 from 3. So far this season he's averaging 13.3 points and shooting 38% from the field over 10 games. Small and randomized sample notwithstanding, that's obviously not going to cut it. \nBut don't be fooled, there is a big-time-scorer version of Jalen Green that is going to come out, and the Suns need it to be sooner than later. The dream of him turning into the actual superstar his talent theoretically suggests he could be is almost surely dead, but the question remains whether he can be winning player on a winning team. We've seen in in stretches, but the Rockets, all told, were more than eight points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor last season, per CTG. He's probably regarded as a negative asset at this point with $70 million in guaranteed money still on the books, but winning looks good on everyone. He's playing for another contract, be it in Phoenix or elsewhere. \nThese next six weeks aren't do-or-die for Green; he'll have a big opportunity next season, as well. But it has to start now. NBA perceptions can become sort of irreversible at some point, and Green is toeing that line as the dreaded empty-stats scorer. It just so happens that the Suns -- who are just two games back of the No. 6 Timberwolves with one head-to-head remaining and the tiebreaker already secured, but are also just two games up on the No. 8 Warriors -- are not in a position to consider any scoring stat empty without Brooks. They scored 77 points on Sunday. They need every bucket they can get. And if there's one thing Green can do, it's get buckets. \n            ",

It is unclear whether the team will attend. \n\"I must tell you, we're gonna have to bring the women's team,\" he said. \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Team USA made history at the 2026 Olympics by completing a sweep of hockey gold medals for the first time. The women's team won the gold for the first time in eight years after recording a 2-1 overtime win over Canada. Two days later, the men's team followed suit in nearly identical fashion after posting a 2-1 overtime win over Canada. The men's team captured their first gold medal since the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice.\" While the women's team trailed for most of regulation before tying the score in the third period, the men's team took an early lead before Canada tied things up in the second period. It remained tied throughout the third period before Zach Werenski fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal less than two minutes into overtime. \nThe women's golden goal was scored by Megan Keller, who had assisted on Hilary Knight's game-tying goal in the third period. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather are set to run back one of the biggest fights in boxing history. Mayweather and Pacquiao will rematch in a Sept. 19 clash from The Sphere in Las Vegas, as announced by Netflix, with the streaming service set to air the event.The first meeting between Pacquiao and Mayweather took years of negotiation to come together, as both fighters were on top of the boxing world. The fight eventually happened in May 2015. Mayweather won the fight by clear unanimous decision, with the fight reportedly drawing more than 4.5 million pay-per-view buys, making it a massive success, though the fight itself disappointed many due to a general lack of action.\nNegotiations for the first meeting began in early 2010, though those plans fell apart when the two sides could not come to an agreement on drug testing for the fight.Drug testing would continue to be a sticking point as negotiations would continue as time passed. Between the type of drug testing, with Mayweather wanting \"Olympic-style\" testing, or timing, with Pacquiao refusing testing that went beyond 14 days prior to the bout, testing remained an ongoing sticking point as the negotiations dragged on for years.\nOver the past few years, the idea of a rematch has popped up repeatedly, though it never seemed to gain much momentum until recent months, when interest was ignited once again.After a controversial semifinal loss in the 1996 Olympics that ultimately led to winning a bronze medal, Mayweather turned professional, going on to hold world championships across five weight classes. Mayweather's championship accomplishments are slightly eclipsed by Pacquiao, who remains the only boxer to have won world championships in eight different divisions.Pacquiao, 47, ended his retirement in July 2025, facing Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title. That fight, Pacquiao's first professional bout since a WBA welterweight title loss to Yordenis Ugas in August 2021, ended in a majority draw but showed Pacquiao to still have some of his signature speed and power.\nMayweather, 48, has not fought professionally since a TKO win over UFC superstar Conor McGregor in August 2017. The win over McGregor allowed Mayweather to enter retirement with a sparkling 50-0 record.Both Mayweather and Pacquiao have participated in various exhibition bouts in the years since entering retirement. Mayweather is currently planning another exhibition, this time against Mike Tyson, in an event that was recently announced as a final tune-up before returning to the professional ranks.Likewise, Pacquiao recently announced an April exhibition against Ruslan Provodnikov in what will be his own tune-up ahead of the clash with his former rival.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Amid an otherwise quiet period in the NFL calendar, the combine breaks the ice (often literally and figuratively) and shakes up draft boards two months ahead of the draft.The National Invitational Camp began in 1982, and by 1985 it served as the one central location to assess prospects. By 1987, it moved to Indianapolis, where it's been ever since.It's an intensive job interview. In addition to the physical testing, players interview with teams and media, undergo medical examinations and participate in a variety of other tests.\n        \n            \n                Biggest need for every NFL team entering the combine: DL in the NFC North, priorities for new head coaches\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the on-field portion is sometimes derisively referred to as the \"underwear Olympics,\" it's also a key chance for players to show off their skills and potentially boost their stock. Though it's far from the only thing -- and, in many cases, far from the most important thing -- that goes on at the combine, it is the most transparent portion for the viewing public; over five million people watched across the four days last year. And let's not forget: speed, strength, agility and explosiveness still make up a huge part of the sport. While strong performances can boost draft stock, poor performances can no only lower draft stock but also potentially show major flaws in a player's game.\nHere's a look at the best performances in all of the events going back to 2006, when the most widely available and comprehensive data is available. The NFL does not keep official combine records.40-yard dashXavier Worthy (2024) -- 4.21 secondsJohn Ross (2017) -- 4.22 secondsKalon Barnes (2022) -- 4.23 secondsChris Johnson (2008) -- 4.24 secondsDJ Turner II (2023), Riq Woolen (2022), Dri Archer (2014) -- 4.26 secondsWorthy thrilled the crowd two years ago when he blazed to the fastest 40-yard dash in combine history. Unofficially ruled a 4.22 initially, the official time was one one-hundredth of a second faster. The Texas product ended up going to the Chiefs in the first round two months later.\nVertical jump1. Chris Conley (2015), Donald Washington (2009): 45\"3. Donovan Peoples-Jones (2020), Byron Jones (2015): 44.5\"5. Quan Martin (2023), Juan Thornhill (2019), Obi Melifonwu (2017), A.J. Jefferson (2010): 44\"\nJones had an all-time combine in 2015, and his 44.5\" vertical was only part of it. Still, he wasn't even the best jumper that year, with Conley's 45\" leap tying Washington's record from six years earlier. Gerald Sensabaugh jumped 46\" in 2005, just outside our range.Broad jumpByron Jones (2015): 12'3\"Tyler Owens (2024): 12'2\"Emanuel Hall (2019), Juan Thornhill (2019), Obi Melifonwu (2017): 11'9\"Jones' 12'3\" broad jump was not just a combine record, but a world record.\nJones ended up being a first-round pick of the Cowboys, and he played seven years in the NFL.3-cone drillJordan Thomas (2018): 6.28 secondsSedrick Curry (2000): 6.34 secondsJeff Maehl (2011): 6.42 secondsBuster Skrine (2011): 6.44 secondsDavid Long Jr. (2019), Scott Long (2010): 6.45 secondsThe 3-cone drill has been less and less popular of late, and the fastest player last year was Tez Johnson at 6.65 seconds. Thomas never played in the NFL.\n20-yard shuttle1. Brandin Cooks (2014), Jason Allen (2006): 3.81 seconds3. Bobby McCain (2015): 3.82 seconds4. B.W. Webb (2013): 3.84 seconds5. Justin Simmons (2016), Desmond Trufant (2013): 3.85 secondsAnother agility drill that has largely gone by the wayside, the 20-yard shuttle didn't feature a single player under 4.03 seconds last year. Cooks' and Allen's shared mark appears safe for now -- and maybe forever. In 2004, Dunta Robinson ran a 3.75, which is the all-time record per ESPN.Bench press1. Stephen Paea (2011): 49 reps2. Mitch Petrus (2010), Mike Kudla (2006): 45 reps4. Netane Muti (2020), Dontari Poe (2012), Jeff Owens (2010), Brodrick Bunkley (2006): 44 reps\nGive it up for the big guys in the trenches. On a week where speed, agility and explosiveness draw the most headlines, the bench press is the one place for the linemen to shine, and Paea certainly did so in 2011.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The WNBA made enough money in 2025 to trigger revenue sharing for the first time in league history, the Women's National Basketball Players A",
    "body": "\n        The WNBA made enough money in 2025 to trigger revenue sharing for the first time in league history, the Women's National Basketball Players Association told ESPN on Monday. The 13 teams that played last season will receive a total of $8 million to disperse to players. It's unclear how much revenue the league made last season or the amount needed to generate revenue sharing. The WNBPA did not disclose bank statements to ESPN, and the league declined to comment. In addition, the WNBPA is set to disperse $9.25 million to players from revenue generated from licensing agreements for jersey sales, trading cards and video games, among other items, since 2020. Payments will be determined based on years played from 2020-2025, with a maximum of $50,000 for each player. The news comes amid the ongoing labor battle between the league and the players, which has lasted for more than a year and is threatening to shorten or, in a worst-case scenario, cancel the 2026 WNBA season. With less than three months until the 2026 campaign is set to tip off on May 8, the two sides have still not agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. \n\"This shows our value and how what we're fighting for makes sense and how we should keep fighting,\" WNBPA treasurer Brianna Turner told ESPN.Later on Monday, ESPN reported that the WNBA has set a key deadline in negotiations. The league has reportedly told players that terms for a new CBA should be agreed to by March 10 (15 days from Monday) in order to avoid impacting the schedule for the 2026 season. This is the first time either side has mentioned a date as a potential negotiating deadline.\"I've been through so many cycles of collective bargaining, and often things tend to get done at the 11th hour,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said a press conference on Feb. 14. \"We're getting awfully close to the 11th hour now when it comes to bargaining. We need to now move towards the next-level sense of urgency and not lose momentum in terms of the amazing amount of progress we've seen in women's basketball.\"\nThe revenue targets in the 2020 CBA (which officially expired in January) were based on numbers for the 2019 season and compounded 20% across the subsequent seasons, but the COVID-19 pandemic shortened the 2020 season to 22 games and the 2021 season to 32 games. As a result, revenue sharing was thought to be extremely under the most recent CBA. Per the 2020 CBA, players would receive 50% of shared revenue (amount of revenue over a pre-determeined threshold, minus 30% for expenses). In 2025, the players' portion of the shared revenue was $16 million, the WNBPA told ESPN. Of that $16 million, $8 million will go to players who were active in 2025 and $8 million will be used for league marketing agreements. Revenue sharing remains the biggest obstacle to a new CBA. The WNBPA is fighting for a share of gross revenue, while the league is still offering a share of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.\nThe WNBPA's most recent proposal would see the players receive an average of 27.5% of the gross revenue over the course of the agreement (with a $9.5 million salary cap in 2026), sources familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. The league's most recent prosposal would offer the players 70% of net revenue over the course of the deal (with a $5.65 million salary cap in 2026). Last month, the WNBA announced the full schedule for the 2026 season. Training camps are scheduled to begin on April 19, with preseason games to begin on April 25 and opening night set for May 8. With just over two months until training camps are supposed to open, the two sides not only have to come to terms on a new CBA, but hold a double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, and conduct the busiest free agency period in league history.\n\"Time is of the essence,\" WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told CBS Sports earlier this month. \"I think that both sides are very aware that this has gone on way longer than it needed to. But hopefully we can really start to be hearing each other and they hear us on things that are non-negotiables.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Team USA's World Baseball Classic roster looks like the best they've ever put together, but it just took a hit.Two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal will pitch just once for USA and it'll happen in pool play (March 7 vs. Great Britain). If the USA advances to the championship round, as expected, Skubal won't pitch.\"If they go to the finals, I think I'm going to try and lobby to just go watch and be with the guys,\" he told reporters, including The Athletic, Monday.That's too bad. Those of us who had already started looking ahead figured Skubal could be the USA starter in either the semifinals or finals, giving a nice edge to the squad. After all, he's won two straight Cy Young awards, two straight AL ERA titles and has a 2.04 ERA in six career playoff starts. Instead, if the USA advances, it'll be without Skubal. \nThat gives the mantle of ace to Paul Skenes alone, instead of Skenes just being a \"co-ace.\" The USA isn't hurting for starters after Skubal or Skenes, either, as All-Stars Logan Webb and Matthew Boyd are also on the team. Fellow All-Star Joe Ryan is on the roster, though he's currently dealing with a back injury, as is youngster Nolan McLean and his veteran Mets teammate Clay Holmes. The offense is headed up by Aaron Judge, Cal Raleigh, Bobby Witt Jr., Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber. This is to say that, yes, the USA is still plenty talented and could well win the finals. Not having Skubal for the championship round is still a bit of a bummer.\nPool play kicks off next week in Tokyo, San Juan, Houston, and Miami, and the tournament will conclude with the championship game at Miami's LoanDepot Park on March 17. Team USA won the 2017 WBC, but fell to Japan in the finals in 2023. The Americans are the favorite to win this year (-115, per Caesars), ahead of Japan (+350) and the Dominican Republic (+425).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dynasty ranking changes from January to February are generally pretty minimal. They are mostly influenced by the smattering of news we get and my first run at 2026 Fantasy Football projections. This year, at quarterback, the changes in the rankings are almost completely nonexistent. Just don't get used to this static situation because before I release my March rankings, there are at least eight quarterbacks who could change uniforms and their Dynasty outlook radically altered.My way-too-early 2026 quarterback projections are here.The first two obvious names are Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa. Both of their respective teams have new coaches and have expressed at least some interest in moving on from their very expensive quarterbacks. The risk of them not finding starting jobs has already been factored in to some degree, but it could be worse. For either of these quarterbacks, if their situations are unresolved a month from now, I will be more nervous. At the same time, if they find a new home as a starter in March, they could be risers. I am more optimistic both about Murray's chances of finding a starting job and his Fantasy upside if he does, which is why he is ranked considerably higher than Tagovailoa.Earlier in February, I had Jay Felicio from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the quarterback position. Check it out:\nThe free agent I am most interested in monitoring in the next month is Malik Willis. From my view, those two teams we just talked about, the Dolphins and the Cardinals, are the two most likely to give Willis a starter's contract in 2026. The path to him being a riser in the next month is if Willis receives a contract that offers him more long-term security than what Justin Fields received last year. These two coaching staffs have close connections to the Packers, so if anyone is willing to take that risk, it should be them. Over the past two seasons, Willis has thrown 89 passes and averaged 10.9 yards per attempt with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. Combine that with his rushing upside, and if Willis gets a three-year deal, he could vault into the top 20 in the rankings below.Other quarterbacks who could see the biggest gains or losses in the next month are Jacoby Brissett, Aaron Rodgers, Daniel Jones, and Geno Smith. Of course, we have no reason to expect Rodgers to make a decision that fast, and we'll have to wait until August at least to see how Jones' rehab is coming. One thing is for sure: We should expect far more changes in the Dynasty QB rankings next month than we got this month. We may even get to add Derek Carr back in if he decides to return to the NFL.I don't rank rookies until they are drafted, but I have already started to think about where I will put them. Assuming Fernando Mendoza is taken first overall by the Raiders, I anticipate he will rank somewhere between QB15 and QB18 in the rankings below. I would be surprised if any other rookie cracks the top 25.\nHere are my updated Dynasty QB rankings:\n            ",

The four-star recruit and No. 42 overall prospect in the 2027 class is one of the 20 highest-rated commits in Wolfpack history.Rivers, a junior at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael, has been tied closely to NC State since last season. He completed a visit during the final week of the regular season when the Wolfpack thumped rival North Carolina in a 42-19 blowout and progressed through his recruitment in the months since, leading to his commitment nearly a year in advance of the 2027 class' National Signing Day.While Rivers also held offers from Auburn, Boston College, Miami and South Carolina, his familial link to NC State made the Wolfpack difficult to beat. Dave Doeren offered him a scholarship in May 2024, getting a head start on his recruitment after a strong freshman year of high school.Rivers plays for his father, who is the coach at St. Michael. He earned the starting job as a freshman and increased his production over the ensuing seasons, leading to a 2025 campaign in which he completed 237 of 343 passes for 3,176 yards and 46 touchdowns with five interceptions. He also ran 33 times for 196 yards and a touchdown. Rivers has yet to pass for fewer than 3,000 yards in a season.\nThe terrific junior season led Rivers to secure an ASWA Super All-State selection, and he was a finalist for the 4A Back of the Year award. He guided St. Michael to a 13-1 record and a semifinal berth in the state 4A playoffs for the second consecutive season.247Sports director of scouting Andrew Ivins evaluated Rivers last week and described him as a \"skilled passer with elite pedigree that has a chance to be a high-end distributor in college and beyond.\" Like his father, Rivers is described as having a \"shot put-like release\" and puts prolific touch on his passes. He is the No. 6-ranked quarterback in his class and has a chance to contend for five-star status during his senior year of high school.\nRivers will not suit up for NC State until the 2027 season but could be in line to contend for the starting job as a true freshman. Incumbent starter CJ Bailey has two more years of eligibility but could be a candidate to depart early for the NFL Draft, potentially opening the door for Rivers to contribute straight away.\n            \n",

The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.Pitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. \nPitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts is the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The 2028 Summer Olympics are still two years away, but athletes are already confirming that they intend to compete when Los Angeles serves as host. Four-time Olympic gold medalist Kevin Durant is one of those athletes, as he told ESPN that he has every intention to compete at the 2028 Games.\"Hell yeah, I want to play,\" Durant said. \"I would love to, but I've got to stay on top of my game. I'm not expecting, I want to produce on the floor and make Grant [Hill] and whoever is making the decisions, want to put me on the team. I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"Durant will be just two months shy of turning 40 when the 2028 Summer Olympics happen, but if he maintains the level of play that we've seen this season over the next two years, there would be no reason to not include him on the Olympic roster.Health will certainly be a major factor in the matter, but Durant's been durable in each of the last three seasons including the current one, and if that trend keeps, he should be a no-brainer to make the roster. The way Durant plays lends itself to aging well in the NBA, and we've seen that in the years since he tore his Achilles in 2019. He's been an All-Star in six of the seven years since that injury cost him a full season in the NBA, and the outlier year was because he was limited to 39 games due to injury.\nDurant earning a roster spot on Team USA isn't the surprising part, it's that he still wants to compete in the Olympics. There was an assumption that the 2024 Paris Games would be the final year he, LeBron James and Stephen Curry would all compete with Team USA. James has already said publicly that he doesn't plan on suiting up for the 2028 Games. Curry hasn't said if he'll play, but he'll also be 40 by then.But Durant is letting us know that we were all wrong with that line of thinking.\"You guys, the media, have projected that,\" Durant said. \"That narrative, where did the last dance thing come from? I didn't say I wasn't playing. LeBron said he wasn't. You didn't hear that from me or Steph.\"For now we can pencil Durant's name in for the 2028 Olympic roster, which will certainly see some turnover with all the aging stars likely not participating. Cade Cunningham stated his desire to play in the 2028 Olympics in a recent GQ profile, while making the bold statement that he thinks he's the best American player. And will get some holdovers like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, as well as several of the younger players who are just starting out like Rookie of the Year frontrunners Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel.\nTeam USA certainly won't be short on talent to pick from, but there's already this narrative that other countries are starting to catch up with them. The men's basketball team has won a gold medal in each of the last five Olympic Games, as they've been the far superior team in most cases in Olympic history. There's only been three times the U.S. men's basketball team hasn't won gold since 1936, so it's been an incredibly dominant run for them in the sport for a very long time.However, at the 2024 Games, teams like Serbia and France did put up a good fight against Team USA, and Canada's talent pool just continues to deepen with each passing year. The talent gap isn't as wide as it once was, but Durant thinks it's being overblown.\"I just don't like the talk around the USA versus European style of how you approach the game,\" Durant said. \"All I hear is, 'AAU is destroying the game; the Euros do it right while the Americans do it wrong.'\" \nDurant went on to talk about how he feels the conversation feels a bit racially charged in the way its discussed.\"It's a lot of bullshit with that,\" Durant said. \"I can read between the lines on that. It's a shot at Black Americans. We're controlling the sport. They're tired of us controlling the sport. 'France is coming for you.' Really? We smacked them boys.\"\n            ",

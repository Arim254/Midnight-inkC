Rozier, a guard for the Miami Heat, and Billups, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, were both placed on leave by the NBA, and on Wednesday it was reported that they were not being paid during their leave amid the investigation and their pay was being held in escrow until the charges against them were resolved. \n        \n            \n                Terry Rozier faced $8 million tax lien amid alleged involvement in sports betting ring\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NBA Players Association took issue with Rozier being placed on unpaid leave and issued a statement acknowledging their intent to appeal that decision, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. \n\"While we are in agreement with the league that upholding the integrity of the game is of the utmost importance, their decision to place Terry on leave without pay is counter to the presumption of innocence and inconsistent with the terms of our Collective Bargaining Agreement,\" the statement says. \"We plan to challenge their decision via the proper channels.\"The players association's job is to advocate for the players and it won't want a precedent in this instance of players being put on unpaid leave in this kind of situation. The NBA will defend its decision by claiming it's to protect the Heat, by putting the money in escrow it ensures that money returns to the team if he is found guilty, but also allows Rozier to get paid out all of his salary if he is indeed innocent. \nThe ultimate determination will come from an arbiter, who will need to determine if the NBA's plan to have Rozier's pay put in escrow is within the boundaries of the CBA. \n            \n    ",

With the Pirates, Shelton went 306-440 (.410) with two last-place finishes and two fourth-place finishes in his four full seasons on the job. He previously served as the bench coach for the Twins under Paul Molitor in 2018 and Rocco Baldelli in 2019.Shelton took over a team deep in a rebuilding phase -- a phase that still hasn't yielded much in the way of wins at the big-league level -- and the team showed incremental improvement on his watch until they stalled out in 2024 and for the early weeks of this season. As a player, Shelton spent two minor league seasons as a catcher and first baseman in the New York Yankees system but never rose above Single-A. \nAs for the Twins, they're coming off a 2025 season in which they went 70-92 and placed fourth in the American League Central. That plus an 82-80 record and another fourth-place finish in 2024 cost Badelli his job in late September of this year. In all, Baldelli guided the Twins to three playoff berths in his seven seasons on the job. While there is some talent in place in Minnesota, Shelton walks into an uncertain ownership situation, especially when it comes to a top-down willingness to invest in payroll.\nWith Shelton's hiring in Minnesota, four MLB teams remain in need of a manager for the 2026 season: the Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, and Atlanta Braves. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (2-6) host the Baltimore Ravens (2-5) on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 9 NFL schedule. Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 50.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Dolphins vs. Ravens on Thursday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Ravens vs. Dolphins on Thursday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 50.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday that LeBron James (sciatica) has a timeline to return either the second or third week of November, while Luka Dončić (finger sprain/leg contusion) could return in the \"next couple of games.\"James, who is entering his 23rd season in the league, hasn't played this season. The Lakers originally announced on Oct. 9 that James would be out at least 3-4 weeks because of the nerve irritation in his glute that caused him to miss the entire NBA preseason. However, his timeline to return to the lineup appears to be longer than that.\n        \n            \n                How scorching starts from Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić could redefine LeBron James' role on new-look Lakers\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf James is out until the second or third week of November, it means James would miss at least the first 10 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz. That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season.As for Dončić, the Lakers star got off to an incredible start to the 2025-26 season before being sidelined. Dončić finished with 43 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in the Lakers' first game of the season against the Golden State Warriors and followed it up with another near-triple double (49 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists).\nDespite James not playing at all to start the season and Dončić missing the last two games, the Lakers are off to a 2-2 start. Lakers star Austin Reaves has scored at least 25 points in each of his team's first four games -- which includes a 51-point outburst against the Sacramento Kings last weekend. Reaves also finished with 41 points in the Lakers' loss to the Portland Trail Blazers earlier this week.\n            \n    ",

Lamar Jackson, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury that caused him to miss three games, was listed as a full participant in Wednesday's walkthrough practice. This marks the third straight practice he was listed as a full participant.Earlier in the week, coach John Harbaugh expressed confidence that the two-time MVP would be back for their Week 9 game.\"I feel very confident about it. We'll expect him to be out there Thursday night,\" Harbaugh said on Tuesday.\nJackson initially suffered the hamstring injury suffered against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sept. 28 and has not played since. \n\n        \n            \n                Season-changing win? Ravens now improbable favorites in AFC North after win over Bears\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere was some hope Jackson would be able to start their Week 8 game after he was listed as a full participant and had a game designation of \"questionable\" on the Friday before their game against the Chicago Bears. One day before the game, the Ravens made a correction, saying Jackson was actually a limited participant and was \"out\" for the game. Harbaugh called the situation an honest mistake.Without Jackson last week, the Ravens started Tyler Huntley over Cooper Rush, who started two games in No. 8's absence, and Baltimore went on to win 30-16 at home.In his first four starts this year, Jackson had a career-high 71.6% completion percentage for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception. He also had 166 yards and a touchdown on the ground.\nOverall, the Ravens have struggled without Jackson at the helm. They sit at 2-5, third place in the AFC North.\n            \n    ",

Quarterback Jayden Daniels is expected to be a full participant in practice all week, which means if all goes according to plan, he will return for this Sunday's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. However, star wide receiver Terry McLaurin re-injured his quad, and has already been ruled out for Week 9. Daniels missed Monday night's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs after injuring his hamstring in the Week 7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He did not practice all week, and Marcus Mariota started in his place. Daniels has already missed three games this season, leading his mother to ask fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son. In five starts this season, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year has completed 61% of his passes for 1,031 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 9 NFL picks: Bills cool off red-hot Chiefs in classic shootout, Texans upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for McLaurin, he tweaked his already-injured quad in the second half of Monday night's loss to Kansas City. Sunday will mark the fifth game he's missed this season. The 30-year-old held out of training camp while he fought for a contract extension, and was victorious in doing so. In late August, McLaurin signed what was reported to be a three-year, $96 million deal. However, he's on track to have his worst NFL season since being selected in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, as McLaurin has caught just 13 passes for 203 yards and one touchdown in four games.\nTight end Zach Ertz said following the loss to the Chiefs that the \"clock is ticking\" for the 3-5 Commanders, and things don't get much easier with Washington's next two games coming against NFC contenders in the Seahawks and Detroit Lions. FanDuel Sportsbook currently considers the Commanders a long shot to make the playoffs at +430 -- the same odds as the rival Cowboys. \n            \n    ",

The former Alabama standout signed with the Ravens in 2024 and delivered a massive output in his first season in Baltimore, carrying the ball 325 times for 1,921 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. His physical style and durability remained elite even after turning 30, showcasing several long runs and a dominance after contact that reinforced his Hall of Fame trajectory. In 2025, Henry continues to be a major factor in Baltimore's offense, though his workload has slightly decreased. Through six games, he has totaled 88 carries for 439 yards (5.0 yards per carry) and four rushing touchdowns. While those numbers are below his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most respected and productive power backs in the league. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Dolphins running back De'Von Achane. The former third-round pick out of Texas A&M emerged as a dynamic dual-threat back for the Dolphins in 2024, rushing 203 times for 907 yards and six touchdowns while adding 78 receptions for 592 yards and six more scores. His average of 4.5 yards per carry showcased his balance of power and burst, while his impact as a receiver made him one of the NFL's most versatile backs. Through the early part of the 2025 season, Achane has maintained that explosiveness, totaling 107 carries for 539 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Although his touchdown pace has dipped slightly, his overall efficiency and big-play potential remain strong. Achane's combination of elite speed and pass-catching ability continues to make him a key weapon in Miami's high-octane offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Ravens vs. DolphinsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

Game 6 is back in Toronto Friday.The Blue Jays got to Shohei Ohtani in Game 4 Tuesday and he was on the hook for four runs, including a two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shane Bieber, on the other hand, held the Dodgers hitters to just one run, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kiké Hernández. The Game 4 win ties the series at 2 and guarantees at least one more game in Toronto on Halloween.The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.\nThe Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners. This marks their first World Series appearance since 1993.

The Irish have the rest advantage in coming off a bye, and they're 10-2 against the spread (ATS) over their last 12 post-bye games. The Irish also have the momentum advantage with a five-game win streak, compared to BC dropping its last seven contests.

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks' majority owners filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Dallas Stars, accusing the NHL team of blocking long-planned upgrades to the American Airlines Center and breaching their lease agreements. The legal action signals a deepening rift between the two franchises that share the downtown arena.Dallas Sports Group (DSG), which owns the Mavericks and is led by billionaire Miriam Adelson and her son-in-law Patrick Dumont, said in the lawsuit that \"the Stars are holding the American Airlines Center hostage.\" The ownership group claims the NHL team has blocked efforts to improve the 24-year-old arena and is seeking court confirmation of its lease rights, along with injunctive relief to move forward with planned renovations. DSG acquired a 69% majority stake in the Mavericks in December 2023 for roughly $3.5 billion.The Stars, led by owner Tom Gaglardi, quickly responded with a countersuit seeking to restore normal operations at the arena. Team officials called the Mavericks' lawsuit \"nothing short of an attempted hostile takeover of the management of the AAC,\" saying it attempts to reduce the Stars to \"a mere tenant\" and could ultimately push the franchise out of Dallas. The NHL team also highlighted recent investments, including $30 million in renovations, aimed at enhancing the fan experience.Could Mavericks or Stars leave Dallas?Both teams share a joint operating company that manages the American Airlines Center, which is owned by the city of Dallas. DSG alleges that the Stars have resisted improvements and violated a long-standing agreement to maintain their corporate headquarters in Dallas through 2031 by moving offices to Frisco. The Stars counter that the Frisco facility is used in conjunction with their principal downtown office.\nDallas City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert weighed in on the dispute, urging both franchises to maintain their commitment to the city. \"That would be the best outcome for the two teams and their fans,\" she said, via CBS News Texas.The legal battle comes amid separate plans by both teams to explore new venues. Front Office Sports reported earlier in October that relocating the Stars to suburban Plano by 2031 is a leading option, potentially allowing for a mixed-use development around a new arena. Meanwhile, the Mavericks have begun planning a new arena independent of the hockey team, a project led by CEO and Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Welts, per the report.\nThe dispute echoes past co-tenant conflicts in other cities, such as Philadelphia, where NBA and NHL team owners debated arena development. Unlike that situation, however, the Dallas case has already moved into Texas Business Court.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- If Arsenal are going to hang around in the EFL Cup, this is the way to do it. No key men were risked, squad players got much-needed reps and Hale End's finest made the right impression. That all this came with a berth in the quarterfinals of this competition makes it that fraction better.Only a fraction, it should be said. While no team should turn their nose up at silverware, certainly not one who've been waiting more than half a decade to add to their sizeable cabinet, Arsenal's ambitions must be greater. Put it this way, if at the end of the season Mikel Arteta had lifted the EFL Cup and nothing else, would the commentariat be rushing to praise him? Almost certainly not and he himself would feel like he had frittered away the advantageous situation his team find themselves in at the top of the Premier League table.Four points clear and playing by far the most effective football in England, what Arsenal need from every other competition is that it does no harm to the biggest prizes. The last thing they want is the decimating of their attack that came about in the two-legged semifinal exit at Newcastle's hands last season, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Martinelli suffering the sort of major injuries that killed off what little hope they had for 2024-25. They probably would not have won the title then but they might have in the spring of 2023 if only William Saliba and Takehiro Tomiyasu had made it through the Europa League exit at Sporting's hands.So much of what Arsenal have done since the end of last season has been about mitigating those sorts of moments. They are now two deep in every position and doesn't it show? The XI that took the field tonight bore 10 changes from the side who had ground their way past Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon. When they're in Burnley this weekend, it would be no surprise if everyone bar Eberechi Eze drops out of the side. Even without the likes of Havertz, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli, this was still a team with a Bundesliga title-winning debutant, a captain who is a mainstay of Spain's midfield and England's starting left back.\nAll were mere supporting characters to the undisputed star. The roar before kickoff made clear how many were here for Max Dowman, at 15 years and 302 days, the youngest starter in the 138-year history of this club. Eight years old when Bukayo Saka made his debut, six when his manager called time on his playing career, a year and change when Arsenal lost to Birmingham in the final of this competition: every tidbit about Dowman is a dagger to the heart of anyone old enough to still be engaging with written media like this. Worst of all? He probably knows what six-seven means.At least you didn't have to play against him. That cannot have been a pleasant experience for Maxime De Cuyper, chasing shadows that should really be revising for their GCSEs. In true Hale End fashion, his shuffles sent him sliding through gaps that shouldn't exist, his eye for a pass evidently preternatural. There was to be no goal or assist yet but there's no rush, he'll still be younger than current record holder Cesc Fabregas at the end of this season. On Wednesday's evidence, there's no reason not to aspire to that sort of career.If you think that is placing too much on young shoulders, he seems to holding the burden quite comfortably. Asked how Dowman had reacted to being given his first start, Arteta said: \"A tiny smile. That's what you get from him. For him, everything is natural, everything is ok. It's the way he plays, that's the secret. He doesn't make a big fuss, he just does what he does best, which is to play football with a lot of courage and determination. Today, he showed some incredible skill, some capacity to run past Premier League players at 15. It's something special.\"\nThe man whose record Dowman broke certainly did not look like yesterday's man either. Ethan Nwaneri, 18, took time to get going but come the second half, he was doing what he does best: pushing play upfield and sweeping into dangerous positions. A smart flick by Mikel Merino, a well-placed pass by Myles Lewis-Skelly and Arsenal were cruising into the quarters. Saka would make certain of that, one of a string of established starters brought off the bench with a view to keeping the rhythm up.By then, the players that needed minutes had gotten them. Christian Norgaard was rusty, but of course, he would be. Ben White was not, playing like someone who knows he has to be one of the best right backs in the world to have a chance of dislodging Jurrien Timber. Piero Hincapie was aggressive without the ball, precise with it: exactly what you'd expect from anyone in the Gabriel Magalhaes spot. Even Andre Harriman-Annous, a less heralded teenager, will feel he did his future prospects no harm with an energetic shift leading the line.Arsenal have bigger fish to fry, and in reality, an exit at this stage of the competition would hardly be anything to disappoint Arteta. Winning, however, is never a bad thing, particularly when it can be done in a way that does no harm to the prospects of future victories when they really, really count.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe U.S. women's national team will close out the October international window, and it's a final chance for players to leave their mark with World Cup qualifiers just 13 months away. After splitting two games against Portugal, the USWNT will host New Zealand on Wednesday at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. Follow along for live updates here.For the group, it will be an opportunity to end on a winning streak. The team suffered a disjointed, 2-1 loss against Portugal to open their three-game series and bounced back on Sunday with a 3-1 victory. Now they have to prepare for a new opponent before saying farewell till the next international window beginning Nov. 28. U.S. national team head coach Emma Hayes initially named a 26-player roster to have flexibility over three games and has utilized the roster through two games, including the goalkeeper position. Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey split the first two games in goal, and players across the bench have featured in substitution windows. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:How to watch USWNT vs. New ZealandDate: Wednesday, Oct. 29 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: CPKC Stadium -- Kansas City, Mo.TV: TNT and TruTV | Live stream: HBO MaxA different opponent and a chance to change things upWhile the USWNT settled for a series split against Portugal, they'll now face non-European opposition. New Zealand are on top of the Oceania Football Confederation, but their record against the USWNT has gaps. Wednesday's match will be the 22nd game between the teams, and the USWNT lead the all-time series (19W-1L-1D) with a lone loss in 1987 -- the first game ever between the two sides.The most recent meetings occurred in Jan. 2023, as part of 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup prep, when the USWNT visited New Zealand before the global tournament. The Stars and Stripes dominated the Football Ferns over two games, a 4-0 win in Wellington and a 5-0 victory in Auckland.The two national teams also have a history of playing each other during the Olympic Games in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, where the United States were victorious. Rose Lavelle is the only player on the current roster who participated in the 2023 friendlies, and now there is a different USWNT head coach and roster preparing for New Zealand in 2025. Having two games against Portugal, and one of them being a bounce-back game, is helpful, according to Emma Hayes. \"I always say when you're the losing team, sometimes it's a lot easier when you win and you dominate the first game, then the opponent adapts to things, and sometimes it can be harder the second game,\" Hayes said after the Portugal win. \"But I think we took the learnings. We had a lot of small group meetings. I really have to do a lot of work tactically with the team. They love it, the players, because they keep learning about all of the little details you need at the highest level. And I think the difference is the application of that learning.\"Players try to leave an impressionAnother chance for players to force difficult decisions on USWNT manager Emma Hayes. It's 13 months till the squad enters World Cup qualifiers, and time is expiring on player evaluations. With a penultimate game against New Zealand before the final window of the year, players will have to make their mark on the game, as well as on Hayes and the technical staff. Despite the opening loss, the response was already immediate, whether it was from younger players or 2024 Olympic gold medalist Sam Coffey.\"I think it's like such a credit to our younger players, because that's such a hard position to be in coming off of an uncharacteristic loss that was way below our standard, to come out and to take the lessons in two days time and to reapply it in a way where we come back and can beat them, 3-1,\" Coffey said on Sunday. \"[Portugal's] a really good team, and there is not a lot of [USWNT] experience on the field, [and] I think they did an amazing job. So, I'm super proud of the girls.\"There will be games and training camps for more difficult roster decisions, but it's not far-fetched to anticipate a more specific pool of players moving forward. Hayes has been vocal about this period being a time of narrowing the roster selections, especially with 2026 being a year with potential reintegration of other 2024 Olympic gold medalists not in camp due to injury or on maternity leave. As others return, others may rotate out, especially if not within the U-23 specific age group.Rust is kicked off for nowNo matter who finds themselves in and out of training camps, the program is practicing patience and eventual execution within its principles. If the opening loss to Portugal was an example of time away and combined experience, then the follow-up win was the exact response the group needed in quick succession. It serves as another example of how, even with fewer capped players, the messaging, principles, and coaching are reaching across the roster. \"Let's start with the fact that 10 players have 100 caps [collectively]. Emily Sonnett has 111. So, when you're looking at experience amongst 10 players, there's not a lot there. And I knew that there would come situations that show some of the dynamic qualities they have as less experienced players,\" Hayes said.\"I thought positionally, attacking-wise, we were much, much better in all phases of the field. I think it's a good lesson. The goal we conceded was an exact moment of not jumping out in the wrong moment. Didn't quite get a detail right. And as we keep telling the players at the highest level, those details matter. So, I have a coaching opportunity in and around the goal, but it's all of it leading up to that. But I thought we responded well from that, kept playing, kept showing our principles, showed the control element that I felt was lacking in the last game, and it was overall a much better performance.\"A key adjustment was making sure that one loss didn't define a team. Hayes joked with reporters in the post-game, \"How are you when you've had a month off over the Christmas break?\" \"I think we've never had a 113-day break between international games, and for us, it just felt like we just couldn't get rhythm going. So, what I did is return the team to basics, and those basics look like small pictures, high volume repetitions, creating connections between them, so that we were coming out the session with hundreds of passes between us. So, we got used to the distances, we got used to the relationships, all of those really little things.\"I think that's why the performance looked like that, because [it] just reminded us of our play again. Each player had to go from their club to like, 'Oh, alright, these are our principles.' It just took us a bit of time, but it's not a disaster.\"Game Prediction If part of the USWNT's current strength is the ability to respond and adjust when needed, it might be a long day for New Zealand on Wednesday. Look for more player rotations and efforts to close out the window on a strong note. Pick: USA 2, New Zealand 0 \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU will conduct its second coaching search in four years after firing Brian Kelly last weekend. Don't expect the person who helped poach Kelly from Notre Dame in 2021 to make the next hire. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry told reporters Wednesday that the LSU Board of Supervisors will form a committee to find the school's next coach, rather than leaving the decision to athletic director Scott Woodward.\"We are not going down a failed path,\" Landry said. \"And I wanted to tell you something. This is a pattern. The guy that wrote [Kelly's] contract cost Texas A&M $70-something million. We have a $53 million liability. I believe that we are going to find a great coach … the board of supervisors are going to come up with a committee and they're going to find us a coach.\"While taking decision-making power away from Woodward makes sense given his recent track record, there was one issue with Landry's proclamation that the Board of Supervisors would be running the search. Scott Ballard, the board's chairman, was unaware of that plan.\"No, I didn't know that,\" Ballard told WBRZ.\"The next steps are we're gonna hire the best coach for Louisiana State University,\" Ballard continued. \"I promise you. Go Tigers.\"\nWoodward has been responsible for two of the largest buyouts in college football history. Before arriving at LSU in 2019, he orchestrated one of the sport's most stunning hires as Texas A&M's athletic director, landing Jimbo Fisher from Florida State.The Fisher era at Texas A&M fell short of expectations, and the school fired him before the conclusion of the 2023 season. Fisher had signed a 10-year, $95 million extension in 2021, leaving Texas A&M on the hook for a buyout exceeding $76 million.Kelly is also due a massive payout following last weekend's loss to Texas A&M. His 10-year contract, signed in 2021, paid him $9.4 million this season and still had six years and $58.2 million remaining. His buyout calls for 90% of the remaining salary, totaling $52.38 million.\nThe upcoming coaching carousel is expected to be full of movement, with LSU likely at the center. SportsLine oddsmakers list Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin, Tulane's Jon Sumrall, and Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady -- who held the same role at LSU during its 2019 national title season -- as names to watch in the search.\n            ",

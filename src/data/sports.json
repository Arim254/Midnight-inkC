    "body": "\nThe last chance to join NFL DFS contests for Week 15 comes on 'Monday Night Football' when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins at 8:15 p.m. ET. While those in the passing game like Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Waddle will garner lots of interest as NFL DFS picks, both teams rank in the bottom 10 in pass offense. Thus, if you still want to utilize pass catchers from the MNF DFS player pool, perhaps, it would be a better daily Fantasy football strategy to target lower cost receivers as they would be less risky options. Miami tight end Greg Dulcich is averaging 30.8 receiving yards over his last five games, while Pittsburgh's Darnell Washington is averaging 36.5 yards over his last four. In terms of the running game, De'Von Achane (ribs) is cleared to play for the Dolphins, while Pittsburgh has more uncertainty with Jaylen Warren (illness) being added to the injury report on Monday as questionable. Before making any Dolphins vs. Steelers DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. SteelersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Waddle. The fifth-year receiver has upped his production since Tyreek Hill was injured as he's averaged over 70 total yards since Week 5. Waddle had 50 receiving yards, 21 rushing yards and a touchdown a week ago and now gets to face a porous secondary in Pittsburgh. The Steelers have allowed the most catches of any team to opposing wideouts while giving up the second-most receiving yards to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Waddle to go Over 63.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell. The former Eagle has become a bigger part of Pittsburgh's offense as of late, averaging 12.3 touches over his last four, after averaging just 5.3 touches over his prior four games. He might see even more work in this one if Warren's illness keeps him out or limits him. Gainwell's made the most of these opportunities as he ranks as the RB9 in Fantasy over the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Miami has the No. 25 run defense, and just four teams are allowing more yards per carry than the Dolphins. Thus, Gainwell has the potential to supply lots of value to your MNF DFS lineups and he won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Gainwell to go Over 28.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Steelers vs. Dolphins DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work. The Spurs-Thunder semifinals matchup felt like a playoff game, and we should be in store for another high-intensity matchup between the Knicks and Spurs Tuesday night. Tip off is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET on Prime.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 was disastrous for the Kansas City Chiefs. Not only were the reigning AFC champions officially eliminated from playoff contention, but star quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL. This is the first major injury of Mahomes' NFL career, and he faces a rehab that will take up the entire offseason.Mahomes is hardly the first quarterback to tear his ACL. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray tore his ACL in 2022, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow tore his as a rookie back in 2020, and Tom Brady tore his in the 2008 season opener. In fact, Mahomes and Brady both tore the ACL in their left knee during their ninth NFL season. During a recent taping of the \"Let's Go!\" podcast, Brady spoke about the rehab process and why it's \"a hard psychological thing to battle.\"\"It's a tough rehab,\" Brady said. \"It's one of the toughest rehabs. I just remember every day pushing myself. And it's always the same amount of pain and discomfort except you're making progress through that pain and discomfort, which is a hard psychological thing to battle. You feel like, God, every day, it doesn't feel right. Except you're gaining range of motion and you're gaining strength and you are on the road to recovery. So I wish him the very best.\"\nThe host of the podcast, Jim Gray, then asked Brady what he would tell Mahomes if he could offer any advice about coming back from a torn ACL. The NFL legend said it's all about attacking the process.\"The only thing you can do is focus on what's ahead of you and not look back,\" Brady said. \"And just say, 'OK, this is part of what my career is going to be and a lot of people have gone through it and a lot of people have overcome it.' You've just got to put as much diligence into the rehab process. And I always feel like the faster you rehab, the faster you can get back to practicing the sport that you love.\"I think sometimes people will pace themselves. Instead of training mode, they're in rehab mode. I think you gotta get through rehab mode as fast as possible and then you get back to training mode. But that requires an all-out commitment and it's the same commitment that the great professional athletes make to be great at their profession. When you go through the rehab process, you need that same level of focus and determination.\"\nWhen Brady returned to the field in 2009, he led the New England Patriots to the playoffs with a 10-6 record, and won Comeback Player of the Year. It's safe to say the 2008 knee injury didn't hold him back, as Brady would go on to win four more Super Bowls and play until he was 45 years old.As two of the best quarterbacks of this generation, Mahomes and Brady have been compared every which way over the last nine years, and how both successfully recovered from torn ACLs could be another bullet point in the conversation. Mahomes has already publicly vowed to attack each day \"over and over again.\"\"Don't know why this had to happen,\" Mahomes said on social media. \"And not going to lie, it's hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 in the NFL was certainly a consequential week. The Buffalo Bills made up ground in the AFC East by defeating the New England Patriots, while the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were eliminated from playoff contention. It was also an unfortunate week for injuries, as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons suffered torn ACLs.The playoff picture is becoming clearer. The Los Angeles Rams look to be the team to beat in the NFL, Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars may be hitting their stride at the right time and Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans breathed a huge sigh of relief when their NFC South rivals, the Carolina Panthers, were upset by the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. There is still plenty of football left to be played, but which teams are the favorites to win it all in what has been a wonky season? Below, we will break down the latest Super Bowl LX odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Super Bowl LX oddsTeamOddsLos Angeles Rams+310Seattle Seahawks+650Denver Broncos+800Buffalo Bills+800Philadelphia Eagles+1100Houston Texans+1100Green Bay Packers+1500New England Patriots+1500Jacksonville Jaguars+1700San Francisco 49ers+2200Los Angeles Chargers+2200Baltimore Ravens+2200Chicago Bears+3000Detroit Lions+3000Tampa Bay Buccaneers+5000Pittsburgh Steelers+7000Carolina Panthers+30000Indianapolis Colts+40000Dallas Cowboys+60000\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Steelers remain atop AFC North by eliminating Dolphins on 'MNF'\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC West: The division to beat?The Rams should top everyone's power rankings entering Week 16, as they defeated the Lions on Sunday, 41-34. Matthew Stafford and company have put up back-to-back games with 500 total yards and 40 points and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Speaking of Stafford, this man is a monster. He leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (37) and passer rating (112.2). However, it is worth noting that Davante Adams, who leads the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions, left the Lions game with a hamstring injury.It's fairly fascinating that the Seahawks currently have the second-shortest odds to win the Super Bowl. Yes, they have won four straight games, but needed a game-winning field goal to beat a 44-year-old grandfather on Sunday. The issues -- or maybe let's call them inconsistencies -- run deeper.In its eventual 37-9 win over the Atlanta Falcons, Seattle was tied at the halftime break, 6-6. In the 26-0 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 13, the Seahawks offense recorded just 219 total yards. Seattle played the lowly Tennessee Titans close in Week 12, and then of course lost to the Rams in Week 11. Seattle has a chance to change the narrative Thursday against the rival Rams, but it's fair to have questions about this team as legitimate contenders. The Buckin' BroncosHow about this Broncos squad? They are now the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a 12-2 record following the 34-26 win over the Packers, and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Those 12 wins are the most victories Denver has earned since 2015, when it won Super Bowl 50.Bo Nix has caught plenty of flak for his ups and downs this season, but he balled out Sunday with 302 passing yards and four touchdowns. We already know how good this Broncos defense is, as they rank top five in both total defense (287.7 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (18.6 points allowed per game). With the Chiefs out of the running, are the Broncos the legitimate favorite in the AFC? Vegas believes it's them, or Josh Allen and the Bills. What about the NFC North?Sportsbooks do not trust the NFC North, as Vegas believes a whopping 12 NFL teams have a better chance to win the Super Bowl than the current No. 2-seeded Bears. That includes the No. 7 seed Packers. Chicago has a tough stretch to end the season, as the Bears host the Packers Saturday night, play at the 49ers in Week 17 and then finish the season at home against the desperate Lions. The Bears have recorded double-digit wins for the first time since 2018 and boast the most opportunistic defense in the NFL, which leads the league with 30 takeaways. However, Chicago missed an opportunity to beat the Packers last week. As we mentioned, the Bears get a chance at revenge at home Saturday night. Don't rule out the Lions, sitting at the No. 8 seed with an 8-6 record. They close out the season with the Steelers, Vikings and Bears.SportsLine projections for the NFC NorthTeamChances to win divisionChances to make playoffsBears46.0%80.8%Packers47.7%89.0%Lions6.3%34.6%\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders hoped star quarterback Jayden Daniels would return this season after he re-aggravated his elbow injury in Week 14, but they since shifted course. Washington will shut down the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, and allow Marcus Mariota to finish out the season at quarterback, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Washington's medical staff re-evaluated Daniels today, but he did not receive clearance to return, NFL Media reports. If he was not cleared for the Week 16 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, Daniels' next opportunity to play would have come on a short week against the Dallas Cowboys. Ultimately, the Commanders just shut him down.Less than one month ago, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said he wanted Daniels to play when healthy in order to develop -- no matter if Washington was in playoff contention or not. \"I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,\" Quinn said.. \"It's a skill, just like throwing and processing. And so, all those things are important.\"\nThe 4-10 Commanders have not had their starting quarterback for half of the season. Daniels suffered through knee and hamstring injuries before dislocating his left elbow during the Week 9 loss against the Seattle Seahawks. He returned for the Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, but landed hard on the injured elbow while trying to chase down Andrew Van Ginkel following an interception.The No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft took the league by storm as a rookie, throwing for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions, and added 891 yards and six touchdowns as a rusher. Washington went from 4-13 to 12-5, and made it all the way to the NFC Championship game.  Daniels' 37 total touchdowns and 5,416 total yards (including playoffs), were the most by a rookie in NFL history. This season, Daniels lost five of his seven starts, and threw for 1,262 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. \nThe 2025 season was an abject disaster for Washington. Daniels missed more than half of the campaign due to injury. Star wideout Terry McLaurin, who signed a three-year, $96 million deal with the Commanders after a training-camp holdout, missed half of the season due to a quad injury, while the defense suffered notable injuries as well. Marshon Lattimore, Trey Amos, Dorance Armstrong and Deatrich Wise Jr. all reside on injured reserve, which left Washington with what is statistically the second-worst defense in the NFL. Perhaps regression from 2024 was expected, but not to this extent. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers came out of retirement to help the Indianapolis Colts reach the postseason, and he held his own in the 18-16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. While CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that Anthony Richardson is medically cleared to return to the field, the Colts will not make a change at quarterback.Coach Shane Steichen told reporters that Rivers will start again on Monday night, when the Colts host Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in prime time. The 44-year-old grandfather gets another shot under center. Rivers completed 18 of 27 passes for 120 yards Sunday with one touchdown and one interception. It marked Rivers' fewest passing yards since 2009, but it had been 1,800 days since he last played in an NFL game. All things considered, it was not a bad outing. \"Very encouraged, there's no question about it,\" Steichen said of Rivers' play after the game, via the Colts' official website. \"For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it, get a game-winning field goal -- close to it -- with 40 seconds left in a hostile environment against a top defense. Just shows his commitment to coming back and playing the way he did and fighting like crazy for his teammates. I thought that was pretty awesome.\"Rivers came in, not to push the ball down the field and create explosive plays, but to run the offense and be consistent from the pocket. He did just that on Sunday. Rivers didn't have too many misfires, and more importantly did not make any horrific errors. \n\"This isn't the motivation, but I do think that maybe there will be -- I think about my own boys, my own two sons, but certainly the high school team I'm coaching, but this isn't why I'm doing it,\" Rivers said in his postgame press conference. \"I know it comes with it and I know it is a story and I know it is rare and all those things, but I didn't do that. I was enjoying myself down there being coach in south Alabama.\"Obviously this doesn't come up every day. But I think maybe it will inspire or teach not to be run or be scared of what may or may not happen. Hopefully, certainly I think of my sons and those ballplayers that I'm in charge of at the school, that they'll say crap, coach wasn't scared. Like, shoot, sometimes there is doubt and it's real, and again, the guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is shoot, we'll see what happens. And so yeah, I hope in that sense it can be a positive to some young boys or young people, doesn't have to be boys. But again, that's not the motivation. But whatever God's will, I'm happy with.\"It will be interesting to see how Rivers looks with another week of preparation. The Colts' running backs predictably were a major part of the offensive game plan, as Jonathan Taylor rushed 25 times for 87 yards, while Ameer Abdullah led the Colts with five catches for 32 yards. \nThe 10-4 49ers represent another tough test for Indy as winners of four straight games, and in the hunt for the No. 1 seed. As for the Colts, they have a 13.8% chance to rebound and make the playoffs, according to SportsLine's projections. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football, their first game back at home since \"fire Mike Tomlin\" chants erupted in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. Numerous players have come to Tomlin's defense since, the latest remarks coming from former Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who kept his opinion blunt and to the point over the weekend.\"Me, personally, I thought the chants were bullshit,\" Ramsey said Saturday. \"That's comical in my mind. That's all I'll say about that.\"The Steelers (7-6) face what amounts to a pivotal matchup against the Dolphins to stay in the NFL playoff conversation after a 4-1 start since deteriorated. Pittsburgh traded for Ramsey in July from Miami as part of a multi-player deal that included Minkah Fitzpatrick. Ramsey amassed 41 tackles and an interception for the Steelers so far.The Steelers took sole possession of the AFC North lead after their Week 14 win over the Ravens after Baltimore had caught up with its divisional rival despite a 1-5 start this season.\n\"It's tough, it's the NFL ... any type of success you get, you hang onto it,\" Ramsey said, referencing his seven postseason games in his eight-year career.Tomlin, the NFL's longest-tenured coach, said he understands the frustrations felt by the Pittsburgh faithful.\"In general, I agree with them, from this perspective: Football is our game, we're in a sport entertainment business,\" Tomlin said. \"And so if you root for the Steelers, entertaining them is winning. And so when you're not winning, it's not entertaining.\"\n\"If you've been in this business, you understand that, and so I respect it,\" Tomlin said previously. \"I share frustrations, I understand what makes this thing go, and winning is what makes this thing go.\"Pittsburgh lost its last five playoff games under Tomlin with the Steelers' most recent postseason win coming in the divisional round of the 2016 playoffs. Tomlin is 8-11 overall in the playoffs during his 19-year tenure, a career highlighted the  Super Bowl XLIII victory.Tomlin has yet to deliver a losing season in Pittsburgh.\"I'm a firm believer that if you choose the right people to lead, and you have the right process, you don't have to make changes,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \"Because for the most part, it leads to rebuilding or dysfunction that can kind of break some of the foundational characteristics of winning organizations like the Steelers are.\"\n            ",

They continue to do that. But I also knew yesterday and today was pretty important. I wasn't going to see (media) until today to address it, so that's why I put that out there.

Just as he is committed to this team, we are committed to him, and we look forward to taking the field Friday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\"DeBoer's statement came after Ryan Williams and other players mentioned rumors on social media being difficult to avoid.\"Yeah, of course we see it on TV, but I mean, he's gave his best effort here,\" Williams said Friday. \"Focused on playing against Oklahoma, we're not really worried about it. ... I mean, at the end of the day, he serves us 100% and that's our coach, so we're going to play for him. External noise is external noise, so we just focus on the internal.\"\nThis isn't the first job opening this cycle where DeBoer's name immediately emerged. DeBoer denied previous speculation about the Penn State vacancy prior to the Nittany Lions' hiring of Matt Campbell, but had not addressed the Michigan situation until Sunday.DeBoer and the Crimson Tide's chief focus can now be on the Sooners after a previous loss to Oklahoma last month put Alabama in several playoff elimination games down the stretch. The Crimson Tide suffered three giveaways during that 23-21 setback in Tuscaloosa despite doubling Oklahoma in total yardage and largely dominating the contest.The Alabama-Oklahoma winner plays unbeaten and top-seeded Indiana at the Rose Bowl in the quarterfinals.\n            ",

The Steelers had lost three of their previous four games and five of their previous seven after starting the season with a 4-1 record, so it was massive for them to get back in the win column ahead of the stretch run.Miami has won four in a row since losing to Baltimore back in Week 9, and is now on the fringes of the playoff race in a season that started off in disastrous fashion. The Dolphins have been running the ball like crazy during their winning streak, while also turning over the opposing team multiple times in each of those games. Will the Steelers make it two in a row, or will the Dolphins pull off the upset to stay alive in the AFC playoff race? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Steelers vs. DolphinsDate: Monday, Dec. 15 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key storylinesAFC North race. Pittsburgh currently holds a half-game lead in the division over the Ravens. The Steelers will maintain their AFC North lead no matter the result of this game by virtue of having defeated Baltimore last week, but it would obviously be beneficial to hold onto the one-game cushion heading into the stretch run. After this game against Miami, the Steelers close out the season with games in Detroit, in Cleveland and then at home against the Ravens. Baltimore closes by hosting New England and then traveling to Green Bay and Pittsburgh.AFC wild card race. The Dolphins are 2.5 games back of the Texans for the No. 7 seed in the AFC and technically still alive in the wild card chase. They're going to need to win out and they'll need to get a whole lot of help from other teams along the way. Following this game against the Steelers, they close the season by hosting the Bengals and Buccaneers and then traveling to New England to take on the Patriots. The Steelers are obviously still alive for a wild card spot as well with their 7-6 record, but they're far more likely to make it by holding off the Ravens in the division race than by sneaking in as a wild card, which by contrast is Miami's only path to the postseason.Revenge games for star DBs. Minkah Fitzpatrick and Jalen Ramsey will each be playing against their former teams in these games after they were involved in a trade for each other this offseason. Fitzpatrick spent five-plus seasons in Pittsburgh after being traded there (by Miami) early in the second year of his NFL career, only to be sent back to the Dolphins this past offseason. Ramsey played two years in Miami before being traded to Pittsburgh. Steelers vs. Dolphins pick, prediction\nDid you know that the Dolphins are 5-1 in their last six games since dropping to 1-6 and looking like their season was done? Mike McDaniel has this team playing really well! They can run on anybody, and we've seen that you can run on the Steelers. (Look at what the Bills did a couple weeks ago.) If they can control the game on the ground, I like their chances to pull off an upset here, considering that the Pittsburgh offense still isn't explosive enough to put an opponent away. \nPick: Miami 21, Pittsburgh 17 | Dolphins +3, Under 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola plans to enter the transfer portal when it opens on January 2, sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Husker fans have been bracing for Raiola's possible departure for weeks. Raiola's brother, Dayton, decommitted from the Huskers at the end of November and Matt Rhule fired offensive line coach Donovan Raiola, Dylan's uncle, shortly after the season ended. Raiola was once a 5-star prospect coming out of high school, and in his time at Nebraska there were glimpses of the brilliant talent that earned him that rating. However, the consistency in production never quite matched up, and now we'll see how he's viewed around the country as he looks to find a new team for his junior season. Raiola was a starter at Nebraska from Day 1 as a true freshman, and in his two years in Lincoln he's started 22 games, completing 69.1% of his passes for 4,819 yards, 31 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. In nine games played in 2025 before suffering a season-ending broken fibula, Raiola showed improvement as a passer, bumping his completion percentage up to 72.4% and cutting down on turnovers with just six interceptions after 11 as a freshman. \nNow he will explore his options and figures to be among the most coveted quarterbacks on the transfer market, which will include other big names like Florida's DJ Lagway, Michigan State's Aidan Chiles, ECU's Katin Houser and Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who all indicated their intention to enter the portal on Monday as well.Raiola figures to be looking for somewhere he can raise his profile and seeking a supporting cast around him to help showcase his full talents on a contender. According to Chris Hummer, Oregon is a school expected to show interest in Raiola, which would certainly fit the bill as a place where he can contend and play with a strong supporting cast on offense. The Ducks will likely see Dante Moore head off to the NFL whenever their College Football Playoff run concludes, and Dan Lanning could bring Raiola in as the new starter in Eugene to try and keep Oregon rolling right along. \nRaiola would be a different archetype than we've seen in Lanning's tenure at Oregon. Bo Nix, Dillon Gabriel and Dante Moore have all had slighter frames but were tremendously accurate, allowing the Ducks to stay on schedule and get their playmakers the ball on time and in space. Raiola showed growth in that area with his jump in completion percentage this year at Nebraska, but he also possesses a big frame and strong arm that could provide Oregon with a different dynamic attacking down the field. We'll find out in January whether the Ducks do in fact end up landing Raiola or if he finds a different landing spot, but he figures to be among the most coveted targets for teams in need of a new starter. Nebraska, meanwhile, will have to shift their focus to finding a new quarterback after the Raiola era produced back-to-back 7-win seasons, but the Huskers never quite hit the heights they hoped to when he flipped to Rhule's program from being committed to Georgia. \n            ",

    "body": "\nIf history is any indication, then the Pittsburgh Steelers are a lock to beat the Miami Dolphins in the Monday Night Football game at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.The Steelers have won 22 straight home games on Monday night, the longest such streak in NFL history. They have not lost a Monday night home game since 1991.In addition, the Dolphins have lost 13 straight games with game-time temperatures under 40 degrees. And, barring an unexpected heat wave suddenly descending upon Pittsburgh (the forecasted game-time temperature is 20 degrees), then Miami will have to overcome the cold as well as the Steelers. Against that backdrop, Monday's matchup serves as a key game in the AFC playoff race. Pittsburgh (7-6) is back atop the AFC North after knocking off the Ravens last week in Baltimore. Meanwhile, after starting the season 2-7, the Dolphins (6-7) have won four in a row to give their fans a glimmer of postseason hope, but Miami needs a win on Monday night to keep its playoff dreams alive. The Steelers are 3-point favorites over the Dolphins on Monday night.While Miami vs. Pittsburgh is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes a five-game NBA slate and a five-game NHL schedule.

The team has allowed 17 points or fewer in each of those games. In addition, Miami has found a running game. The Dolphins have rushed for 164 yards or more in each of the last four games, even with running back De'Von Achane leaving early last week. He is expected to play on Monday. The Dolphins have a plus matchup against a Pittsburgh defense that has surrendered 466 rushing yards combined over the last two weeks. \"Pittsburgh will probably be a popular pick coming off their upset win over the Ravens, but this feels like a letdown spot,\" Vithlani says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says Miami has a 42% chance to win and assigns a \"C\" grade to Dolphins money line (+146).More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for Dolphins-SteelersModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's Tua Tagovailoa, Aaron Rodgers player propsModel's Jaylen Waddle, DK Metcalf player propsSportsLine AI's same-game parlay picksWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchPistons at CelticsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Boston | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics -130\nTwo of the top three teams in the Eastern Conference standings collide when the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics square off at TD Garden. The Pistons (20-5) own the best record in the East and have won three in a row and five of their last six and are coming off a 142-115 victory over the Hawks in which 12 Pistons scored at least seven points. Meanwhile, the Celtics (15-10) sit in third place in the East, five games behind Detroit. Boston enters off a 116-101 loss to the Bucks, which ended a five-game winning streak. Over their last nine games, the Celtics are scoring 128.5 points per 100 possessions, which ranks second in the league over that time, behind only the Nuggets. The SportsLine Projection Model says Boston has a 70% chance to win and gives a strong \"A\" grade to Celtics money line (-130).Rockets at NuggetsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Rockets -104\nTwo challengers to the Thunder's reign atop the league will battle when the Denver Nuggets host the Houston Rockets in a scintillating matchup at Ball Arena.

Denver has the No. 1 offense in the NBA (124.4 points per 100 possessions), while Houston has the No. 2 defense (111.0). In the teams' only previous matchup this season, the Nuggets beat the Rockets 112-109 in Houston. But strangely, Denver has lost four straight games at home. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Rockets have a 62% chance to win and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to Houston money line (-104).NHL best bets, where to watchPanthers at LightningTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Tampa Bay, Fla. | TV: NHL Net | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Panthers +105\nThe Tampa Bay Lighting and Florida Panthers renew one of the best rivalries in the NHL when the teams face off in the latest Battle of Florida at Benchmark International Arena.

This year, Tampa Bay ranks fourth in the East with 39 points while Florida is 12th with 34. Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, who has missed the last six games because of injury, participated in Monday's game-day skate but still isn't ready to play.

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams left Sunday's 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions with a non contact hamstring injury and did not return. The injury represents a potentially critical setback for Matthew Stafford's second-leading target in the passing game.Adams, who had been playing through a mild hamstring issue, appeared to worsen the injury on a deep route with 12:42 remaining in the game. Adams pulled up near the end of his route and crashed to the ground, lying on his stomach helmet down knowing the injury was significant.On Monday evening, NFL insider Ian Rapoport provided a somewhat positive update, stating that Adams was considered week-to-week. That likely means Adams will miss the Rams' Week 16 game with the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night, but Adams could be available for the regular season stretch run, as well as the playoffs for the NFC leaders.\nAdams, who walked off the field on his own power, registered 71 yards on four receptions before the injury and leads the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season. The veteran pass-catcher entered the Rams' Week 15 victory with 56 catches and 718 yards, second on the team in both categories behind Puka Nacua.\n\"He was optimistic. He knows his body really well,\" Rams coach Sean McVay said of Adams. \"We'll see what that means. I can't imagine that's good for Thursday with just the short amount of time, but I certainly wouldn't rule him out quite yet. But it didn't look good.\"  Adams was questionable to return following the hamstring pull, but did not make it back into the game. Adams' availability to play for the Rams (11-3) in Thursday night's matchup with the Seattle Seahawks is unknown.\"That'll be a tough one,\" Stafford said. \"I don't know the extent of it. Didn't look like it was a good one, so I feel so tough for him. He's been a warrior for us all year, really, to be honest with you. Playing out there for us. So we'll see. I got a lot of faith and trust in the other guys that we have in our locker room and our coaching staff to put us in a great position to go out there, let our play do the talking and just go play.\"\nLeading the NFC West, the Rams are the top playoff seed. Los Angeles plays the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals to finish out the regular season following Thursday's game at Seattle.    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        You wouldn't think the Super Bowl race could get any more wide open than it already was … then Week 15 happened.The Chiefs and Bengals were both eliminated, meaning the AFC won't have to go through Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow. That was looking like a formality but I'm sure the rest of the conference is still relieved and believing that anyone can make the Super Bowl now.Then, just when it looked like two teams (Rams and Packers) were starting to separate themselves in the NFC, they lose two of their star players. Micah Parsons' season is over with a torn ACL, while Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring injury that puts his status in doubt for a crucial matchup vs. the Seahawks on Thursday that could ultimately decide the No. 1 seed in the NFC.Rams still the favorite, but NFC just got really interestingI still like the Rams to win the NFC but if anything was going to throw them off it'd be an injury to one of their stars on offense. Adams' injury doesn't look to be season ending and he was optimistic after the game, but the severity is still unknown. Even missing one game could be detrimental to the Rams' Super Bowl hopes, and it's hard to imagine him being ready on a short week after how he went down on Sunday. \nThe Rams face the Seahawks on Thursday in Seattle and the winner of that game will be in the driver's seat for the top seed in the NFC. The Rams may have beaten the Seahawks earlier this season, but Adams scored a touchdown in that game and they only won by two despite Sam Darnold's horrific four-interception performance.Adams may not be a WR1 anymore but he's helped elevate Matthew Stafford to an MVP level and he's been a major nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive efficiency (+8.4 offensive EPA per game) and are third in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage this season (67%) after ranking 13th and 25th, respectively, in those categories last season.Adams deserves a lot of credit. He has 11 touchdown catches since Week 7, and nine of them have been on plays inside the opponent's five yard line. He's caught nine of 12 targets for nine touchdowns inside the five in that span. Somehow Stafford to Adams has become as reliable as the Tush Push in short-yardage spots. No other NFL player has more than four catches in that area since Week 7. \nWith Stafford's ball placement and Adam's combination of size and footwork he's helped the Rams cash in on their scoring opportunities. He put Riq Woolen on skates with this slant route for a 1-yard score vs. Seattle earlier this year. \nHe caught a fade here vs. the Buccaneers. Adams' nine touchdowns in goal-to-go situations are only surpassed by one other player since 2000. It was Adams in 2020 when he had 12.\nWhile Adams could miss an extended period of time and the injury is obviously not ideal, there's several reasons to believe they could weather the storm. The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 in Week 7, their only game without Puka Nacua this season. They are extremely balanced and the only team that ranks top five in the NFL in offensive and defensive efficiency. \nThe Rams have used 13 personnel (one running, three tight ends) more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL since Nacua was hurt in Week 7 (41%). The recent switch to this personnel is another reason to believe they can manage without Adams for now. The Rams are averaging an NFL-high 35.0 PPG since they started using this heavy personnel in Week 7. They are still averaging a ridiculous 6.3 yards per play in those groups. They rank second in the NFL pass success rate (63%) and rush success rate (50%) vs. base defenses in that span so that personnel is allowing Stafford to pick apart mismatches while they are still running the ball effectively.The Rams run game looks poised to carry more of that burden, too. They rank top four in the NFL in rushing (186.7 yards per game) and yards per rush (6.5) in the past three weeks with the emergence of Blake Corum in the backfield with Kyren Williams. They are the only duo in at least the last 90 seasons with 70+ rushing yards and a rushing touchdown a piece in three straight games.Of course, the door is more open for almost everyone else in the NFC should this slow the Rams down. The Seahawks are the biggest beneficiary. They control their own destiny in the NFC and they'll take any edge they can get when they host the Rams in three days. \nThe Eagles, Bears and 49ers have to feel like they have a chance, too. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 overreactions: Micah Parsons injury ends Packers' Super Bowl hopes? Josh Allen for MVP?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nParsons injury crushes Packers' Super Bowl hopes; NFC North up for grabsThose teams all benefit from the Packers' misfortune, too. I would argue they were the second best team in the NFC, until they weren't. Everything was looking up for the Packers midway through Sunday's game until all of the air came out of the balloon and a potential dream season turned to a nightmare. The Packers were up 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love's interception cost Green Bay the ball and his top weapon as Christian Watson left the game with a chest injury and did not return. Later in the quarter Parsons suffered his season-ending torn ACL. The Packers got dominated the rest of the way and fell from the No. 2 seed to the No. 7 seed in the NFC. They were on the verge of beating a playoff-caliber team in three straight games (Lions, Bears, Broncos) and looking like they had as good of a case as anyone to win Super Bowl LX. Now, Green Bay looks destined to go one-and-done again. This was a team that was 0-7 vs. 11+ win teams in 2024 when they did not have Parsons. They made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history and traded two first-round picks for the generational talent to put them over the top in the postseason and in games like Sunday's. Then, in the blink of an eye, those hopes evaporated. You could argue they could bounce back from this. The 49ers have grinded out wins without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, after all. That's also a highly motivated team coming off a Super Bowl hangover season with an easy schedule. The 49ers have also gone from 13th to last in the NFL in pressure rate since Bosa's injury. I don't see how the Packers rebound from this crushing loss in the stretch run of the season.\nThat's the task though and they'll barely have time to lick their wounds as they play the Bears at Soldier Field on Saturday night with the NFC North on the line. The Bears now have the edge in the division given these injuries and how they just played the Packers in Green Bay. Parsons may have gotten off a slow start with the Packers after his contract dispute with Dallas and a back injury this offseason but he was still having a dominant season. He became the first player in NFL history with 12+ sacks in each of his first five seasons. He ranks second in the NFL in pressure rate this year (20%)  and he led the NFL in that category since Week 10 (23%), which included a game with seven pressures vs. the Bears in Week 14. His absence could help put Chicago over the top. Caleb Williams has the lowest completion percentage (38%) in the NFL vs. pressure this season. Just as the Cowboys defense has struggled all season without Parsons, it's hard to imagine Green Bay won't take a step back here, too. Don't overlook Watson's injury, either. The Packers reportedly got some good news on his injury but it's unclear whether he will miss time. His reemergence elevated Green Bay to a top-flight offense as he ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per route (2.64) in the past five weeks behind Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins (minimum 100 routes). He's added an element of explosiveness back into the passing game evidenced by two touchdowns vs. the Bears in Week 14. All of a sudden, Green Bay could be without two of its most important players in a game that will probably decide the division in Week 16.The 49ers have a path to the one seed in the NFCThe biggest winner in the NFC besides the Seahawks is the 49ers. Besides finally having another NFC contender share in their injury misery, San Francisco's surprising path to the top seed in the NFC just got intriguing. The 49ers are 10-4 and will be the top seed in the conference if they win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday.\nThe 49ers final three games are at the Colts and then at home vs. the Bears and Seahawks. If they win out they'll finish the year 13-4 with a 5-1 division record, including 3-1 vs. the Rams and Seahawks. That would give them any tiebreaker over their NFC West rivals if Seattle beats Los Angeles on Thursday. A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.The 49ers have been flying under the radar all season as they've played the second-easiest schedule in the NFC (only the Bears is easier). I've written them of myself after Brock Purdy threw three interceptions on Monday night vs. the Panthers. Especially since they already have a defense that's last in the NFL in sacks and without Bosa and Warner. But, this is a very well coached team with Robert Saleh back in the fold and Christian McCaffrey is having a spectacular season. If they can beat the odds and steal the top seed after Rams and Packers losses, who's to say they couldn't ride home-field advantage to Super Bowl LX, which will be at their home stadium. That would be an incredible story that went from impossible to improbable after these injuries. There's also speculation that Warner could be aiming to make a return should the 49ers make a deep playoff run, although that still seems unlikely.\nAdd to the list of many intriguing storylines in a wide-open Super Bowl race that just got even more interesting among NFC contenders of injuries to superstars around the league.\n            ",

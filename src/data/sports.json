The game will be played at the Marlins' loanDepot Park, but regardless of the venue, the Rangers have been an elite squad on the road this year. New York has the most road victories (14) this season and is 14-8-2 away for one of the best road winning percentages in the league. The Panthers have won back-to-back Stanley Cups, but they are 21-15-3 for 45 points, which is ninth in the Eastern Conference this year. The Rangers are 19-18-5 for 43 points, and given their strong play on the road, the model projects them to win in 52% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Bucks (-5.5) vs. Hornets (-110)The Bucks defeated the Hornets, 123-113, in Charlotte on Monday, and they'll have the homecourt advantage for tonight's matchup. Giannis Antetokounmpo has played the last three games since missing three weeks with a calf injury, and he had 33 points and 15 rebounds in just 28 minutes on Wednesday against the Wizards, showcasing he's back as his dominant self. The Bucks are 2-1 in his return. The two-time NBA MVP is averaging 28.9 points and 10 rebounds per game this season, and he had 24 points in just 25 minutes against the Hornets on Monday. He's off the injury report for Monday. The Hornets are 11-22 this season and coming off back-to-back losses. The model projects the Bucks to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Arizona (+1.5) vs. SMU (-115)\"On the plus side, both of these star QBs (Arizona's Noah Fifta & SMU's Kevin Jennings) will play at the Holiday Bowl,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"As the campaign progressed, however, we began looking harder at the Cats, who started to resemble their 2023 entry under Jedd Fisch that had turned into a juggernaut at the end of the season and beat Oklahoma in the Alamo Bowl...with Fifita at QB. Fifita (26 TD passes, just 5 picks in 2025) was doing many of the same things this season as Brent Brennan got his regime back on course after a difficult 2024.

    "body": "\nThe AP Offensive Rookie of the Year won't be announced until Feb. 5, but the leading candidates will make their final cases this weekend. According to current odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, the award is seemingly down to two candidates: Carolina Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan and New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough.At DraftKings, McMillan is the -175 favorite entering the final week of the regular season, while Shough is the +150 second choice. Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson (+1200), Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart (+1400) and Buccaneers receiver Emeka Egbuka (+1600) round out the top five choices in the wagering but are considerable longshots.The case for McMillan to be the Offensive Rookie of the Year is strong. He leads all rookies in receiving touchdowns (seven), while ranking second in receiving yards (929) and third in receptions (66) for an 8-8 Panthers team that leads the division and can clinch a spot in the playoffs with either a win or tie against Tampa Bay (7-9) on Saturday or a Saints loss to the Falcons on Sunday. McMillan and Carolina are three-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings to the Buccaneers.\nMeanwhile, Shough also has an argument to win the award. Since taking over the starting job for New Orleans in Week 9, the strong-armed quarterback has completed 69.6% of his passes for 1,997 yards and nine touchdowns against four interceptions. Most importantly, he has the Saints on a four-game winning streak, which is the franchise's longest in a single season since 2020. Shough and New Orleans are 3.5-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings against Atlanta.\nBut there are two reasons why the betting value may still be on McMillan even though he's the favorite. First, he has a plus matchup against the Tampa Bay defense. Against this same defense just two weeks ago, he had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown. The Buccaneers have one of the worst pass defenses in the league, allowing 236.4 yards per game through the air (26th in the league), and will be without cornerback Jamel Dean, who's out for Saturday with a shoulder injury.In addition, the structure of the voting could help McMillan. Voters are required to rank their top five Offensive Rookie of the Year candidates, and the players earn points on a 10-5-3-2-1 basis (10 points for a first-place vote, five for a second and so on). Past results show that voters favor players who play a full schedule versus those who play a shortened one. That could very well put McMillan, who has every game, on more ballots than Shough, who has played just 10 games and started eight of those.The -175 odds on McMillan to win the award translates to a 63.6% chance of winning, which means there's value to a bettor who believes McMillan's chance to win is roughly two-thirds or more.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Roadkills are gold in the chase for conference titles, and they might be everything in a Big 12 that has six teams with legitimate shots to hang a banner. No. 10 BYU is one of those Scary Six, and the Cougars are getting thrown right into the fire by the Big 12's schedule-makers with Saturday's opening tilt on the road against a Kansas State club that could desperately use a signature win.AJ Dybantsa and PJ Haggerty are the two titans in this one. Dybantsa sits second in America in scoring, averaging over 23 points per game. Haggerty (22.9 ppg), meanwhile, checks in third nationally. These two are destined to go toe-to-toe for the Big 12 scoring title.Dybantsa might be the only person who was hesitant to celebrate New Year's Day because he had December to remember. The ballyhooed freshman had one of the best months in basketball history. He became the first Division I or NBA player in the last 30 seasons to have a calendar month averaging at least 25.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists while shooting over 65% from the field for an undefeated team, according to OptaSTATS. Legitimately ludicrous stuff from the mean-muggin' stud.He can't be quite as dominant in Big 12 play ... right? We're about to find out.BYU vs. Kansas State: Need to knowCan Kansas State check AJ Dybantsa? Defense has been a major red flag for Kansas State all year, but especially against big wings. California's Chris Bell (27 points), Creighton's Josh Dix (18), Nebraska's Pryce Sandfort (21) and Bowling Green's Sam Towns (27) have all had eye-popping days against this K-State defense. It checks out on tape. With Mobi Ikegwuruka sidelined with a leg injury, Kansas State really has no true wing stopper on the roster. That's a scary thought ahead of a matchup against Dybantsa, who is the best pure wing in all of college basketball. I'd expect Nate Johnson and CJ Jones to get cracks at trying to slow down the BYU star, but the 6-9 Dybantsa is so much bigger than both Johnson (6-3) and Jones (6-5). If Kansas State isn't careful, Dybantsa could get to his patented midrange fadeaway whenever he wants over smaller defenders. Dybantsa is averaging a sparkling 1.4 points per possession on post-ups. Kansas State better have a sound defensive plan because it doesn't have the personnel to handle Dybantsa one-on-one without sending help.\nCan PJ Haggerty get Keba Keita in foul trouble? BYU has been a top-three (!) defense in America this year when Keba Keita is on the floor, per hoop-explorer. The chiseled big man is a true difference-maker on that end, but BYU's defense drops off significantly (allowing 13 more points per 100 possessions) when Keita is off the floor. Kansas State's PJ Haggerty is one of the elite foul-drawing guards in the country going up against a BYU defense that has been excellent at defending without fouling (11th-best rate, per KenPom). What gives? If he can get Keita a couple early fouls, the scales start tipping in K-State's direction in a hurry. Keep a close eye on Kennard Davis' impact as well. The big, strong wing has been an outstanding defender for BYU. He should get the first crack at Haggerty. If he can chest up and keep Haggerty out of the paint, that could keep Keita out of harm's way, too.Second-half Cougs: BYU has been the best second-half team in the country. Its +43.9 net rating in the second half is simply overwhelming and rates in the 100th percentile nationally, per CBB Analytics. Miami, Dayton and Clemson all learned just how hard it is to hold a lead against BYU, and the Cougars nearly erased a 20-point deficit in their lone loss to UConn back in mid-November. I wouldn't expect this stat to stick all year, but there's proof of concept that this club believes it can claw out of every hole. However, Kevin Young would likely prefer to quit digging said holes ... starting Saturday against Kansas State, because if K-State jumps out to an early advantage, Bramlage can feel overwhelming in a jiffy. Where to watch BYU vs. Kansas State live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 1:30 p.m. ETLocation: Bramlage Coliseum -- Manhattan, KansasTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    \nBYU vs. Kansas State prediction, picks\nBYU has had 12 days off to enjoy Christmas break and sink its teeth into this matchup. If it wins, time off will be dubbed a good thing for rest and relaxation. If it loses, I'm sure the long layoff will be blamed by a few. Ultimately, this game will be decided by transition defense. Kansas State loves to push the pace in transition for quick buckets. BYU hasn't been one to run away from a track meet, so it better build a wall against Haggerty and recover to the shooters.But the worst unit in this game is easily Kansas State's defense. Dybantsa has too many guys he can pick at to find mismatches. BYU's offense is so good at finding the hot spots with Richie Saunders or Rob Wright, too. Even on the road, I think BYU has four of the best five players on the floor at all times. Kansas State can hang around because of the quick-strike transition scoring and Haggerty's individual brilliance, but BYU has too many edges schematically, coaching-wise and talent-wise to ignore. Pick: Kansas State +7.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            BYU -7.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

And depending on what happens in Week 18, still have a chance at winning a third straight AFC South title. Standing in their way is an Indianapolis Colts team playing for pride after an injury to Daniel Jones sent a once promising season into a tailspin. Houston (11-5) claims the AFC South with a win and a Jaguars loss to the Titans. As it stands, the Texans would enter the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and to face the AFC North champion (either the Ravens or Steelers) in the wild card round. If they win the AFC South, the Texans become the No. 3 seed and host either the Bills or Chargers next weekend. The Jaguars eliminated Indianapolis (8-8) last week from playoff contention. After an 8-2 start, the Colts lost six straight games, becoming the first team in 30 years to hold such a dubious distinction.\nWhere to watch Colts vs. Texans liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -10.5, O/U 38.5 (via DraftKings)Colts vs. Texans: Need to know New QB for Colts. After starting 44-year-old Philip Rivers for the past three games, the Colts turn the offense over to rookie Riley Leonard, who attempted 33 passes over four games. Leonard helped lead Notre Dame to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game last season, throwing for 21 touchdown passes while running for 17 more scores. Taylor in pursuit of rushing title. Colts running back Jonathan Taylor is 47 yards behind James Cook in the race to win the rushing title. Taylor faces a Texans defense Sunday that is fourth in the NFL in rushing. He had 21 carries for 85 yards in the Colts' 20-16 loss to Houston back in Week 13. Money in the red zone. Despite their recent slide, the Colts remain one of the NFL's best red zone teams on both sides of the ball. The Colts rank third and ninth in the NFL in red zone offense and defense, respectively. Taylor has been a key to the Colts' offensive red zone success as his 18 rushing touchdowns leads the NFL. Steady C.J. One of the NFL's most overlooked players, C.J. Stroud has once again been solid for the Texans. He is completing a career-high 64.8% of his passes with 18 touchdowns against just eight picks. Stroud received solid protection this season with just 23 sacks taken.Emerging skill players. Stroud's success can also be attributed to the Texans' young but emerging group of skill players. While Nico Collins continues to be the Texans' primary weapon, rookies Jayden Higgins, Jaylin Noel and Woody Marks add to the skill arsenal. No. 1 defense. Houston's defense may be the primary reason why it is playoff bound after an 0-3 start. The unit allows an average of just 16.5 points per game, featuring a ferocious pass rush led by Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr.. They have a combined 26 sacks. The secondary features four players with at least four interceptions.Colts vs. Texans prediction, pick \nThe Colts would be better off starting Rivers if they're serious about winning this game. Instead, they gave Leonard his first career start against the league's top defense. Good luck, kid. Pick: Texans -10.5, Under 38.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

That's not to say the entire schedule is identical, though. The Presidents Day tripleheader that made headlines a year ago will not be held, and the showdown between Woods' Jupiter Links Golf Club and McIlroy's Boston Common Golf is set for Sunday, March 1 -- following the conclusion fo the PGA Tour's Congizant Classic hosted in the same city.The postseason is set for the weeks following The Tour Championship with TGL ultimately ceding way to the PGA Tour as major championship season kicks into high gear.Let's take a look at what's ahead for TGL in 2026 along with the rules of play and how the teams are comprised.\n 2026 TGL schedule All times Eastern MatchDateTimeTVMatch / Results1 \t\t\t\tSun., Dec. 28 \t\t\t\t3 p.m. \t\t\t\tABC \t\t\t\tAtlanta Drive 6, New York 42 \t\t\t\tFri., Jan. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston 7, Los Angeles 53 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 6 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 13 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. New York \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 20 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tMon., Jan. 26 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 2 \t\t\t\t5 p.m.  \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Jupiter Links \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 9 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Boston \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t11 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tNew York vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t12 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tBoston vs. New York \t\t\t\t13 \t\t\t\tSun., Mar. 1 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter vs. Boston \t\t\t\t14 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. New York \t\t\t\t15 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 3 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Jupiter \t\t\t\tSemi 1Semi 2 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 17 \t\t\t\t6:30 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\tFinals 1Finals 2Finals 3 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 23Tues., Mar. 24Tues., Mar. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m.7 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2ESPNESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\t TGL format TGL matches take place across 15 holes and two sessions. Players hit full-swing shots off grass, rough or sand platforms into a simulator screen. Short-game shots under 50 yards and putts take place inside the SoFi Center on a rotating, adjustable green.Holes Nos. 1-9 -- Triples (3 vs. 3 alternate shot): Two teams of three face off with a three-man rotation hitting one shot at a time for each team. That rotation continues, in order, until the hole is completed.Holes Nos. 10-15 -- Singles (head-to-head play): A golfer from one team will play a hole against a golfer from the other team. All three players will play a hole, one by one, before the cycle begins again on hole Nos. 13-15.Overtime: 3 vs. 3 closet-to-the-pin competition Scoring: Each hole is worth one point. Ties are worth zero points. There are no carryovers. The Hammer: Each hole in a TGL match is worth one point unless a team decides to throw the \"hammer\" (not an actual hammer), a yellow weighted flag that doubles the point value of that hole. A team can either accept the hammer and play that hole for two points or deny it and concede the hole. Each team has three hammers to use throughout the match. Shot clock: Players will have 40 seconds to hit their shots or face a one-stroke penalty. Timeouts: Each team has four timeouts per match -- two in Triples and two in Singles. There are no carryovers from session to session.

    "body": "\n        No. 6 Duke is 12-1 with wins over NCAA Tournament teams like Kansas, Arkansas, Florida and Michigan State, and yet it enters 2026 with questions aplenty after a second-half collapse to Texas Tech, followed up by Wednesday's sweaty, six-point win over Georgia Tech as a gargantuan 27.5-point favorite.Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Perhaps, but even Jon Scheyer seems to be searching for the right combinations. Duke shifted the starting lineup for the third time against Georgia Tech, inserting freshman point guard Cayden Boozer into the fray and diverting wing Nik Khamenia to the second unit.We'll learn about the mental fortitude of this Duke team because even though a date with ACC frontrunner Louisville looms on Tuesday, it has to get past 7-7 Florida State before it can get started on the Cardinals' scout. First-year 'Noles coach Luke Loucks is 0-5 against high-major teams, but if Florida State can push Florida, it can get up for Duke.Let's dive into the ins and outs of this ACC matchup.Duke vs. Florida State: Need to knowHigh-variance tilt: Florida State zooms up and down the floor at a breakneck pace and tries to shoot as many 3-pointers as possible. FSU's offense has the fifth-fastest average possession length, and 54% of its shots come from downtown. Loucks doesn't have Alabama's star power yet, but he is using Nate Oats' game plan on offense. Shooting this many 3s opens up the door for some wild outcomes ... good and bad. So far for Florida State, it's been mostly bad. They shot just 9-for-41 (22%) from downtown against Texas A&M and got smoked by 36 against an Aggies club that is in a similar tier from a talent perspective. We have yet to see FSU get it rolling from downtown against a high-major team. Duke surely doesn't want to become the first team that lets FSU's barrage of snipers get hot, or a dogfight could emerge.\nWill FSU keep Duke from hanging on rims? North Carolina threw down 12 dunks against Florida State on Tuesday. That was the most UNC had in a single game since 2011. Now, FSU has to face off against Cameron Boozer and Patrick Ngongba? That's no fun. There are easy buckets to be had in the paint against this Florida State defense that is vulnerable when it cannot generate takeaways.Will Duke's leaky pick-and-roll defense get shored up? Texas Tech's Christian Anderson took a blowtorch to Duke's pick-and-roll defense, and Scheyer had to pivot to a zone defense in the second half to find some answers after Georgia Tech's ball-handlers were creating far too many advantages. Duke will have its hands full with FSU point guard Robert McCray V, who ranks sixth in the country in assists (7.1). Caleb Foster will get the first turn, but Duke's switch-heavy defense means anyone on the floor better be ready to sit down and try to guard McCray.  Where to watch Duke vs. Florida State live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 3:45 p.m. ETLocation: Tucker Arena -- Tallahassee, FloridaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    \nDuke vs. Florida State prediction, picks\nMaking a billion 3-pointers (in reality, like 22 treys) feels like Florida State's only hope to spring this upset. Everything else screams Duke in this one. FSU is a poor defensive-rebounding team. Georgia, Florida and UNC all corralled 15+ offensive rebounds. Ngongba, Cameron Boozer and Maliq Brown should be licking their chops to go to war on the glass. Plus, the pivot to playing Cayden Boozer with Caleb Foster in a two-point guard look should pay dividends in this one. Florida State will pressure the basketball relentlessly. Having two point guards who can break that first wave of pressure should unlock a ton of advantages in this one.I also do not think FSU has enough capable ball-handlers outside of McCray to consistently break down this Duke defense. Duke has been so good at grinding teams to a halt with its switches. If that happens, Florida State has to hope McCray goes nuclear because there's not a ton of other true switch-beaters on this FSU roster. If it attacks the paint, does its thing on the glass, blankets the 3-point stripe, controls the tempo and moves the ball without panicking, Duke can run away with this one. Pick: Duke -15\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            Duke -15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook has gone offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook which consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there's season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt's Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season, which means it's the last time we'll see all 32 teams in action until September. Most of the postseason field is set as far as the teams are concerned, but divisions and seeding are up for grabs across the 16 games on Saturday and Sunday. Week 18 can be a tricky one for bettors due to varying motivation factors and whatnot, and injuries also play a big role. Here's a look at the most notable NFL injuries of Week 18 as well as a quick snapshot of which teams are expected to rest key starters. We'll also look at NFL betting lines per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Panthers at Buccaneers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)No major injuries of note\nThe Panthers can win their first NFC South title since 2015 with a win over the Buccaneers on Saturday, while Tampa Bay needs a win and a loss by the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday to win the franchise's fifth division title in a row. The good news is, both teams enter the final week of the season in pretty good shape health-wise.Tampa Bay is a 3-point favorite. The total is 43.5.Seahawks at 49ers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)SEA OT Charles Cross (hamstring, out)SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)  SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee and ankle, questionable)  \nThe winner of this matchup will take home both the NFC West and secure the No. 1 seed in the conference. The 49ers won this matchup back in Week 1 by a final score of 17-13 in Seattle. Both teams enter Week 18 on six-game win streaks. The Seahawks will again be without starting left tackle Charles Cross, this time against a tough San Francisco defensive front. The 49ers' main injuries are on offense, with George Kittle, Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall all questionable to suit up in this pivotal matchup.Seattle is favored by 2.5 points on the road. The total is 47.5.Packers at Vikings (1 p.m. ET)GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, doubtful)MIN TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder, out)MIN RB Aaron Jones (hip, out)\nThe Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC, so expect to see many key contributors on the sideline for Green Bay against a Vikings team that is hoping J.J. McCarthy's solid end to the season can be a building block for 2026. McCarthy is back after missing last week with yet another injury, but he won't have his top running back in Aaron Jones or tight end T.J. Hockenson. With the Packers set to rest many key starters, Minnesota is favored by 9.5. The total is 37.5.Cowboys at Giants (1 p.m. ET)DAL RB Javonte Williams (shoulder and neck, out)DAL RB Malik Davis (calf and eye, out)NY TE Theo Johnson (illness, out)NY WR Wan'Dale Robinson (rib, out)\nBoth offenses are shorthanded here with both of Dallas top running backs out, including 1,000-yard rusher Javonte Williams, while two of New York's top receiving options are out for Week 18. Dallas enters Week 18 favored by 3.5. The total is 49.5.Colts at Texans (1 p.m. ET)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)\nThe Texans are hoping to get a win and some help in order to win the AFC South this weekend, and they're in good shape on the injury front. Injuries have played a part in the Colts' epic collapse after they started 2025 as one of the best teams in the NFL. They'll again be without top cornerback Sauce Gardner, and the team will turn to rookie Riley Leonard in Week 18, ending Philip Rivers' shocking NFL return at three weeks. The Texans are 10-point favorites. The total is 38.5.Browns at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, out)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)\nTwo teams that struggle in very different  ways meet in Week 18. The Browns' scuffling offense is down two top playmakers in tight ends Harold Fannin Jr. and David Njoku, meaning two fewer weapons for Shedeur Sanders against a Bengals defense that's horrific at defending tight ends.  Cincinnati is a 7.5-point favorite while the total sits at 44.5.Saints at Falcons (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)NO WR Chris Olave (blood clot, out)ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)ATL TE Kyle Pitts (knee, questionable)\nTop playmakers for both offenses are out or questionable here, as the Saints are down top receiver Chris Olave due to a blood clot scare while running back Alvin Kamara remains out with multiple injuries. Two of Atlanta's top pass catchers are questionable here in Drake London and Kyle Pitts. If the Bucs win Saturday, they need the Falcons to lose in order to win the NFC South.Atlanta is favored by 3.5, and the total is 43.5.Titans at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThe Jaguars have plenty to play for this week, as a win clinches them the AFC South, while a win and some help could net them the No. 1 seed in the conference. The good news for Jacksonville is the team is in good shape health-wise against a Titans team that's just trying to get across the finish line and find its next head coach.The Jaguars are 13.5-point favorites here, and the total is 47.5.Cardinals at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (foot, injured reserve)LA WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)LA RB Kyren Williams (ankle, questionable)LA RB Blake Corum (ankle, questionable)\nThe Cardinals are just looking to finish what's been a dreadful 2025 campaign, while the Rams are licking their wounds after consecutive close losses that cost them the NFC West and a shot at the No. 1 seed. Arizona is down Marvin Harrison Jr. for this season finale, while Davante Adams, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum are all questionable to suit up for L.A. Los Angeles is favored by 8.5. The total is 46.5.Commanders at Eagles (4:25 p.m. ET)WASH QB Marcus Mariota (hand and quad, out)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)PHI DT Jalen Carter (shoulders, out)PHI TE Dallas Goedert (knee) \nThe Eagles are expected to take things easy in Week 18 by resting key players ahead of the postseason, a strategy that worked well last year ahead of a Super Bowl run. Tanner McKee is expected to start at quarterback for Philly. The Commanders, meanwhile, are down to their third quarterback as Marcus Mariota, who has been starting in place of the injured Jayden Daniels, is out for Week 18, setting up a start for journeyman Josh Johnson.The Eagles are favored by 4.5, and the total is 38.5.Chargers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)LA RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out)LA RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)\nThe Chargers will rest many key players in Week 18, including quarterback Justin Herbert, who had surgery on his left hand a few weeks ago. For this matchup with Denver, which can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win, the Chargers will be without rookie running back Omarion Hampton, who has over 700 scrimmage yards in nine games this year. No. 2 back Kimani Vidal is questionable to suit up.Denver is a massive 12.5-point favorite, and the total is 37.5.Jets at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)NY RB Breece Hall (knee, questionable)NY TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)\nThe Bills are just trying to improve their playoff seeding in Week 18, and they face a Jets team that has really struggled and will be without most of its top weapons on offense. Garrett Wilson has been out for some time, rookie tight end Mason Taylor is out once again and star running back Breece Hall is questionable. Tight end Dalton Kincaid is questionable for Buffalo due to a nagging knee injury.Buffalo is a 7.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.Dolphins at Patriots (4:25 p.m. ET)MIA RB De'Von Achane (shoulder, doubtful)MIA WR Jaylen Waddle (ribs, questionable)MIA TE Darren Waller (groin, injured reserve)\nThe Patriots can clinch the top seed in the AFC with a win and a Broncos loss on Sunday, and they will face a rather depleted Dolphins offense in Week 18. Star running back De'Von Achane is doubtful, while No. 1 receiver Jaylen Waddle is questionable. Tight end Darren Waller was also placed on injured reserve this week.The Patriots are favored by 11.5, and the total sits at 45.5.Lions at Bears (4:25 p.m. ET)DET WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee and ankle, questionable)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)\nThe Lions have nothing to play for but pride in Week 18, while the Bears can secure the No. 7 seed in the NFC with a win. Detroit may be without star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been hobbled by various ailments the last few weeks. Rome Odunze is aiming to return for the Bears after missing time with a nagging foot injury. Chicago is a 3-point favorite. The total is the highest of the entire Week 18 slate at 50.5. Chiefs at Raiders (4:25 p.m. ET)KC RB Isiah Pacheco (rest, questionable)KC WR Xavier Worthy (illness, doubtful)LV QB Geno Smith (ankle, out)\nThe Raiders are playing for pride at this point as their 10-game losing streak has them in line for the No. 1 pick in April's NFL Draft. They will be down quarterback Geno Smith, who is out with an ankle injury. Both Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell are expected to see the field. The Chiefs usually have nothing to play for in Week 18, but that's because they've often clinched a postseason berth and a high seed. Instead, the Chiefs are just playing things out in a lost season that sees third-string QB Chris Oladokun starts once again. The Chiefs are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 36.5.Ravens at Steelers (8:20 p.m. ET)BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, will play)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, will play)\nThe AFC North will be decided in the final game of the 2025 regular season. The Ravens are 8-8 while the Steelers are 9-7, and the winner will secure the No. 4 seed in the AFC. Both teams will get their best player back for Week 18 as Lamar Jackson returns from a back injury that cost him last week while T.J. Watt returns to the Steelers' defense after he suffered a collapsed lung during a dry needling session.Baltimore is a 3.5-point road favorite. The total is 41.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- There isn't much at stake in Week 18 for either the Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) or the New York Giants (3-13) when the two NFC East rivals square off at MetLife Stadium in the 2025 season finale for both squads.For Dallas, Dak Prescott is looking to become the first Cowboys quarterback to lead the NFL in passing yards in a single season. He has 4,482 yards passing through 17 weeks, which is 34 yards ahead of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and his total of 4,448. \"It'd be cool to stamp that, just lead the league in passing. I think Matt Stafford probably needs to rest this week, get ready for the playoffs. That would help,\" Prescott said with a grin on Thursday. \"It'd be cool, but I'm just playing the game. I'm not going to try to chase it. I'm not going out there like 'let me throw it every time. It may be the opposite of that right? Just trying to play a smart game, a clean game. Most importantly, get a win. The record will come if they come.\"Meanwhile, the Giants could be somewhat incentivized to lose on Sunday because a New York loss plus a Las Vegas Raiders win against the Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City Chiefs would grant them the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Tanking is nearly impossible to implement in the NFL with so many players playing for their football lives on a week-to-week basis given the non-guaranteed nature of most of the league's contracts. \nBoth teams will be playing with the skeleton crew versions of their roster on Sunday. Dallas will be without the following players: running back Javonte Williams (shoulder/neck), running back Malik Davis (calf/eye), guard T.J. Bass (knee), linebacker DeMarvion Overshown (concussion) and cornerback Shavon Revel (concussion/neck). New York will be without the following players: defensive back Cor'Dale Flott (knee), safety Jevon Holland (knee/concussion), tight end Theo Johnson (illness), offensive lineman Evan Neal (neck), defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches (ankle/toe) and defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris (knee). Where to watch Giants vs. Cowboys liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford, New Jersey)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -3.5, O/U 49.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nCowboys vs. Giants: Need to knowHow much will Dak Prescott play and how much will Joe Milton play? \nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer's approach to playing Prescott at the tail end of another playoff-less season in Dallas the last two weeks has been along the lines of \"we're playing to win, so Dak is playing the whole game.\" Now that it's Week 18, and the Cowboys are playing in a 1 p.m. ET game on Sunday afternoon, Schottenheimer admitted he's open to giving strong-armed backup Joe Milton some time at quarterback this week against the Giants. \"We'll look at that. The biggest thing for me is to put the game plan together and hopefully have another great week of practice and focus on getting our prep. You know how much respect I have for this team, this defense we're getting ready to play, an elite front seven,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"But yeah, we'll see how the week goes. But right now the plan is to play Dak.\"\nEven Prescott acknowledged there's a chance he may not finish the game on Sunday, which leads to the 32-year-old, four-time Pro Bowl quarterback having a slightly different process entering Week 18. \"To some extent, yeah. I'd be lying if I said 'it's exactly the same,'\" Prescott said when talking about playing in a game but knowing he'll likely not finish the game. \"No, there's a little bit to it. It's more of just like 'when [when will I be pulled]?' So for me, it's about going out there and planning to play the whole game. Just stick to the way that I play the game. I'm not going to do too much early and make some big plays so I can get out of the game. ... Not knowing when it is [the time he will be pulled] and if it is [going to happen], just go in, play my game and be smart.\"The 25-year-old Milton has four games of NFL experience in two seasons, including a Week 18 start in the New England Patriots 2024 regular season finale a year ago. He feels much more advanced in terms of both his experience and his football IQ entering his likely opportunity to play on Sunday. \n\"Just be ready,\" Milton said Friday. \"I think that was the plan every week. Coming here was a different status for me. When I say status, I mean it's a different gameplan. I get more reps than I did when I was at the Patriots last year. I moved up in the NFL level as far as the quarterback positions and as far as my knowledge.\"  Could Week 18 be a turning point for Cowboys RB Jaydon Blue? \nWith both Williams and Davis ruled out with injuries, rookie fifth-round pick running back Jaydon Blue could have a chance to have his biggest volume game of the season. The speedster out of the University of Texas has played in four games this season and amassed 65 yards rushing on 22 carries. A fumble in Dallas' 44-24 Week 8 road loss at the Denver Broncos spelled a stop in his play time with Blue not touching the field since. Cowboys vice president of player personnel Will McClay banged the table for Blue in the draft, and he used the adjective \"explosive\" five times to describe him on draft day. \n\"I'd love to get eyes on Jaydon. I think the last couple of weeks have been good weeks for him,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"He's practicing harder and better. I think if he continues on that path, there's definitely a chance.\"  Will three-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns put on a show vs. depleted Cowboys offensive line? \nCleveland Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett's 22.0 sacks this season are so far away from the rest of his competition that there was no real race for who was going to lead the NFL in sacks in 2025. However, New York Giants three-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns is No. 2 in the league in that statistic with a career-high 16.5 this season, a figure that is tied for the fourth-most in a season in Giants history. \nDallas facing him right now could lead to Burns having a monster game and making a push for 20 sacks. The Cowboys allowed a season-high six sacks against the Washington Commanders in Week 17, and their offensive line is even more depleted this week. Left tackle Tyler Guyton (ankle) remains on injured reserve. In response to that injury, Dallas moved three-time Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith out to left tackle for the last three games of the season and put undrafted veteran T.J. Bass at left guard. Bass (knee) didn't practice all week, and he was ruled out on Friday. Cowboys right tackle Terence Steele's 44 quarterback pressures allowed this season are tied for the second-most in the NFL, just one behind Las Vegas Raiders offensive tackle DJ Glaze's 45, according to TruMedia.Sunday could be a massive day for Burns, especially if Milton plays the majority of the afternoon in place of Prescott.Giants vs. Cowboys prediction\nPrescott plays just long enough for the Cowboys to jump out to a multi-possession lead, and Dallas hangs on to avoid a losing record and finish the season at 8-8-1 while New York secures a top 2 draft pick in 2026 at 3-14. \nPick: Cowboys 24, Giants 21 | (Giants +3.5, Under 49.5)\n            ",

Adenyi Mobalaji Kayode has been charged with \"reckless\" and \"dangerous driving causing death,\" driving without a valid driver's license and driving \"without due care and attention, causing bodily harm and damage to property,\" according to police in Lagos. He was arraigned in Sagamu Magistrate Court Friday.The Federal Road Safety Corps previously said the findings of their preliminary investigation indicated the SUV carrying Joshua was speeding and lost control before crashing into a stationary truck. Joshua and Kayode suffered minor injuries, but Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele -- both of whom were members of Joshua's team -- were killed. Joshua was taken to a local hospital to be treated for his injuries, and was released on Wednesday. Joshua was in Nigeria visiting the homeland of his parents. Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu posted a statement on Monday offering his condolences. \"I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami in the recent accident,\" Tinubu posted. \"I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care.\"\nThe former heavyweight champion had just knocked out Jake Paul on Dec. 19. Paul also posted a statement on social media, saying \"Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The final week of the 2025 NFL regular season is finally here. There are two games on Saturday and a full slate of 14 games the following afternoon and evening.    Because it's the final week of the season, there is more to detail than usual when it comes to injury reporting. Teams that have either clinched the playoffs or locked in their draft positioning will often rest key players for the last game of the year, and this year appears to be no different.   With that and more in mind, in the space below, we'll dive into the final injury reports across the league and detail who is in, out, and whose status is up in the air.      Panthers at Buccaneers (Saturday)   \nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPanthers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRobert RochellCBConcussionOut\t\t\t\t   Claudin CherelusLBCalf/AnkleOut\t\t\t\t   Krys BarnesILBBackQuestionable\t\t\t\t   Tershawn WhartonDTHamstringQuestionable\t\t\t\t   Robert HuntGBicepsQuestionable\t\t\t\t   David MooreWRElbowQuestionableBuccaneers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJamel DeanCBShoulderOut\t\t\t\t   Anthony NelsonLBKneeOut\t\t\t\t   Calijah KanceyDTPectoralQuestionableThe Panthers have some issues to contend with defensively, especially if Wharton is out in addition to Cherelus. Hunt's potential absence would hurt the running game as well.    Dean's absence could affect Tampa's efforts to cover Tetairoa McMillan. Kancey could be on the verge of a return from his pectoral injury after upgrading to a full practice on Thursday.      Seahawks at 49ers (Saturday)   \nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawks \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCharles CrossTHamstringOut\t\t\t\t   Coby BryantSKneeDoubtful\t\t\t\t   Josh JonesG/TAnkle/KneeQuestionable49ers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRicky PearsallWRKnee/AnkleQuestionable\t\t\t\t   Keion WhiteDEKneeQuestionableCross' absence will affect the protection in front of Sam Darnold, while Bryant potentially missing the game would affect the coverage on the back end of the defense.   \nGeorge Kittle seems on the verge of a return for San Francisco. Pearsall played last week despite his injuries. White is one of San Francisco's top pass rushers in the wake of all the injuries the Niners have been dealing with and his potential absence could be a blow on that front.      Saints at Falcons\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSaints \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBryan BreseeDT\t\t\t\tKnee\t\t\t\tOutAlvin KamaraRBKnee/AnkleOutChris OlaveWRIllnessOutNathan ShepherdDTAnkle/KneeOutDillon RadunzGKneeQuestionableSpencer RattlerQBRight FingerQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tDemario Davis\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tCalf\t\t\t\tQuestionableFalcons \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClark Phillips III\t\t\t\tCB\t\t\t\tTriceps/Illness\t\t\t\tOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tBrandon Dorlus\t\t\t\tDE\t\t\t\tHamstring\t\t\t\tOutDrake LondonWRKneeQuestionableKyle PittsTEKneeQuestionableDeMarco HellamsSHamstringQuestionableSam RobertsDEKnee/AnkleQuestionableDarnell MooneyWRKneeQuestionableThe Saints will be without their top two offensive playmakers for the regular season finale. They could also be without one of their top defenders in Davis, who was limited throughout the week. Kirk Cousins could be without each of his top three passing game weapons if if none of London, Pitts or Mooney can suit up. They were all limited in practice throughout the week.

Gardner's absence will be felt against Nico Collins on the outside. Houston's defense will be without one of its two starting cornerbacks. Brown got in limited practices on Thursday and Friday after not practicing Wednesday.    Titans at Jaguars\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusTitans \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJalyn Armour-DavisCB\t\t\t\tAchilles\t\t\t\tOutGunnar HelmTEToeOutVan JeffersonWRForearmOutArden KeyOLBHipOutOluwafemi OladejoOLBFibulaOutAmani HookerSAnkle/ToeDoubtfulAli GayeOLBKneeQuestionableBryce OliverWRKneeQuestionableJaguars \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPatrick Mekari\t\t\t\tOT\t\t\t\tBack\t\t\t\tOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJalen McLeod\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tOutTennessee will be down a few of Cam Ward's key targets here, as well as two of its top pass rushers and potentially one of its key pieces on the back end of the defense. The Jaguars are mostly healthy but Mekari's offense could be felt along the offensive interior.    Packers at Vikings\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPackers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonovan Jennings\t\t\t\tG/T\t\t\t\tThroat\t\t\t\tOutNick NiemannLBPectoralOutJohn WilliamsGBackOutSavion WilliamsWRFoot/IllnessOutDontayvion WicksWRConcussionDoubtfulZach TomOLBack/KneeQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tMalik Willis\t\t\t\tQB\t\t\t\tShoulder/Hamstring\t\t\t\tQuestionableVikings \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.J.

The Cowboys will also be down starters at cornerback and linebacker thanks to concussions. \nThe Giants are down a pair of starters in the secondary, as well as two of Jaxon Dart's top options in the passing game.    Jets at Bills \nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusJets \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Clemons\t\t\t\tDL\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tOutIsaiah DavisRBConcussionOutXavier Newman-JohnsonOLKneeOutQwan'tez StiggersCBKneeOutMason TaylorTENeckOutJelani WoodsTEHamstringOutBreece HallRBKneeQuestionableJoe TippmanCHipQuestionableBrandon StephensCBNeckQuestionable\t\t\t\t   Tyrod Taylor\t\t\t\tQB\t\t\t\tKnee\t\t\t\tQuestionableBills \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTerrel Bernard\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tCalf\t\t\t\tOutDaQuan JonesDTCalfOutJordan PoyerFSHamstringOutJoey BosaDEHamstringQuestionableDalton KincaidTEKneeQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJordan Phillips\t\t\t\tDT\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tQuestionableThe Jets could be without their top two running backs here if Hall has to miss the game. They'll also be down a pass rusher and a pair of tight ends and could be without their center. The Bills took Josh Allen off the injury report, but we don't yet know if he'll actually play. They will be down three key defenders and could be without two more players up front. Kincaid missed last week and has been playing through injuries all year.    Lions at Bears \nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusLions \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Anzalone\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tConcussion/Personal\t\t\t\tOutTrystan ColonOLWristOutThomas HarperSConcussionOutAlim McNeillDLAbdomenOutPenei SewellTAnkleOutKayode AwosikaGIllnessQuestionableTaylor DeckerTShoulder/Illness/RestQuestionableChristian MahoganyOLIllnessQuestionableGiovanni ManuOLKneeQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tAmon-Ra St. Brown\t\t\t\tWR\t\t\t\tKnee/Ankle\t\t\t\tQuestionableBears \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Tryon-Shoyinka\t\t\t\tDE\t\t\t\tConcussion\t\t\t\tOutJaquan BriskerSAFIllnessQuestionableNick McCloudCBIllnessQuestionableRome OdunzeWRFootQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tOzzy Trapilo\t\t\t\tOT\t\t\t\tKnee/Quad\t\t\t\tQuestionableThe Lions are eliminated from the playoffs, and their entire offensive line is banged up entering this game. They also may not have Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been battling injuries in recent weeks. The Bears are mostly healthy, though Odunze still seems unlikely to go considering he has just one limited practice under his belt. Trapilo's potential absence could be important at tackle. \n   Chargers at Broncos\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChargers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOmarion Hampton\t\t\t\tRB\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tBradley Bozeman\t\t\t\tC   \t\t\t\tConcussion\t\t\t\tQuestionableHassan HaskinsRBConcussionQuestionableBroncos \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKarene Reid\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tHamstring\t\t\t\tOutDre GreenlawLBHamstringOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJohn Franklin-Meyers\t\t\t\tDL\t\t\t\tHip\t\t\t\tQuestionableWe already know that Trey Lance will start in place of Justin Herbert, but now Hampton is out for the Chargers as well.

Worthy didn't practice all week. Karlaftis and Pacheco were limited throughout the week. The Raiders won't have their starting quarterback on Sunday but have not yet announced whether Kenny Pickett or Aidan O'Connell will start in his place.    Cardinals at Rams\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusCardinals \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvan Brown\t\t\t\tOL\t\t\t\tPersonal\t\t\t\tOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJosh Sweat\t\t\t\tOLB\t\t\t\tAnkle/Knee\t\t\t\tQuestionableRams \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJosh Wallace\t\t\t\tCB\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tOutKevin DotsonOLAnkleOutQuentin LakeSElbowOutBlake CorumRBAnkleQuestionableDavante AdamsWRHamstringQuestionableAlaric JacksonOLKneeQuestionableOmar SpeightsILBAnkleQuestionableKyren WilliamsRBAnkleQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tTyler Higbee\t\t\t\tTE\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tQuestionableThe Cardinals are pretty healthy but Sweat's potential absence would obviously affect their pass rush. The Rams have said that they'll play their healthy starters no matter what happens in the Seahawks-49ers game on Saturday, but here we see that they have listed a bunch of those players as questionable after getting in limited practices during the week, so they could just be inactive for the game depending on the result the night before.    Dolphins at Patriots\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusDolphins \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinkah Fitzpatrick\t\t\t\tS   \t\t\t\tCalf\t\t\t\tOutDe'Von AchaneRBShoulderDoubtfulQuinton BellLBIllnessQuestionableAaron BrewerOLNeckQuestionableJordyn BrooksLBHamstringQuestionableAustin JacksonOLBack/GroinQuestionableChop RobinsonLBConcussionQuestionableJason SandersKRight HipQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJaylen Waddle\t\t\t\tWRRibs\t\t\t\tQuestionablePatriots \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarold Landry III\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tKnee\t\t\t\tOutRobert SpillaneLBAnkleOutKhyiris TongaDTFootOutJared WilsonGConcussionOutJack WestoverTEAnkleQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tCharles Woods\t\t\t\tCB\t\t\t\tFoot\t\t\t\tQuestionableFitzpatrick's absence will be felt on the back end of the defense. Mike McDaniel said that players who don't practice are unlikely to play, so that applies to Achane. The Dolphins could also be without a pair of starting offensive lineman, their best linebacker, a pass rusher, their kicker and then their No. 1 wide receiver. \nThe Patriots are missing a few key defenders here but Milton Williams and Will Campbell are off the injury report after upgrading to full practices late in the week. Demario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte will be in action as well.    Commanders at Eagles\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusCommanders \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJayden Daniels\t\t\t\tQBLeft Elbow\t\t\t\tOutMarcus MariotaQBRight Hand/QuadOutLaremy TunsilTObliqueOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tBrandon Coleman\t\t\t\tT/G\t\t\t\tKnee\t\t\t\tQuestionableEagles \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJalen Carter\t\t\t\tDT\t\t\t\tHipOutNakobe DeanLBHamstringOutMarcus EppsSAFConcussionOutDallas GoedertTEKneeOutLane JohnsonOTFootOut\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tJaelan Phillips\t\t\t\tLB\t\t\t\tAnkle\t\t\t\tOutThe Commanders will be without their top two quarterbacks and once again using Josh Johnson behind center. With Tunsil and potentially Coleman out as well, his protection will be compromised up front. Philadelphia can still be the No. 2 or 3 seed in the NFC but is still holding several key players out of this game against Washington. The front seven on defense is particularly impacted but obviously the offensive line is much weaker without Johnson and Goedert's absence could be felt in the passing game as well.    Ravens at Steelers\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRavens \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRashod Bateman\t\t\t\tWR\t\t\t\tIllness\t\t\t\tQuestionableTaven BryanDTKneeQuestionable\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tMarlon Humphrey\t\t\t\tCB\t\t\t\tIllness\t\t\t\tDNPSteelers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t   Neither Bateman nor Humphrey practiced on Friday, which isn't the best sign, and Bateman didn't practice at all during the week. T.J.

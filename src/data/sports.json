    "body": "\n        It's important to draw a distinction between resume metrics and predictive metrics when talking about a team like Miami (Ohio) and the NCAA Tournament bubble. Selection decisions are closely tied to your resume and what you've accomplished, which is a good thing for Miami. The cries are already coming: \"but Miami hasn't even played a Quad 1 game.\"Despite the fact that it has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of an unbeaten start for Miami, which improved to 26-0 with an 86-77 win at UMass on Tuesday night.It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of approximately 2.15 after Tuesday's win, the No. 22 RedHawks are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.Up next for MiamiThe remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season.\nFeb. 20vs. Bowling Green8:30 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkFeb. 24at Eastern Michigan6:30 pm ESPN+Feb. 27at Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 3vs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBDIf Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. The RedHawks were ranked No. 34 in WAB entering the clash with UMass, which appeared to be the most challenging regular season game left on their slate. That's within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.\n        \n            \n                How more marquee matchups in college basketball will impact NCAA Tournament bracketing process, seeding\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament) Record: Between 29-5 and 34-0 Confidence level: It's a partyLikely WAB range: Doesn't matter\nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 5-0 to close the regular season, 0-5 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14. Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.\nThe MAC Madness scenarioSelection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1Confidence level: Feeling optimisticLikely WAB range: 35-43Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from No. 34 in the metric to No. 42.\nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks  in the upper 30s or lower 40s of WAB, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.Double-defeat scenarioSelection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2Confidence level: Feeling nervousLikely WAB range: 43-52\nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game. This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally. \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.Three-loss scenarioSelection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3Confidence level: Better brace for disappointmentLikely WAB range: 50-60A 3-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make. \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Monaco couldn't have asked for a better start against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League playoffs than American striker Folarin Balogun scoring less than a minute into the first leg with a well-timed header. After the cross from Aleksandr Golovin, Balogun just had to divert the ball on target and wasted no time putting his side ahead in the match. He wasn't done there, getting his second goal in the 18th minute of play. It wouldn't be enough to secure victory with Monaco losing 3-2 at home, but it sets up a competitive second leg at the Parc de Princes on Wednesday, Feb. 26 (catch all the action on Paramount+).Here's a look at Balogun's second goal:\nThese are the fourth and fifth Champions League goals for Balogun this season and his ninth and 10th for the club in all competitions as he has gained confidence leading the line. They may have been Balogun's first goals of 2026, but they couldn't have come at a better time, leading his side in a home leg of the knockout phase with a chance to make the round of 16.An 18-minute brace wasn't enoughDespite Monaco's strong start, they then conceded three unanswered goals to end the match on a sour note ultimately losing to PSG. Three unanswered goals and a red card to Golovin, who assisted Balogun's opener were too much to come back. After Ousmane Dembele needed to leave the pitch due to an injury, it was Desire Doue, who sparked change, scoring with his first touch of the ball, before adding another goal and an assist to his tally. But Balogun's hot start to the match will still provide Monaco with a chance to advance in the second leg, as the deficit is only one goal, but it could've been worse.Balogun with ice in his veinsNow with more Champions League goals than Ligue 1 goals, the 24-year-old is establishing himself as a big-game player for Monaco with his performances in the league phase and now the knockouts. After a strong November camp for the United States men's national team, this is also something that USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino will love to see as the clock ticks closer to the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nJust like Monaco will need as much as they can get from Balogun to make it past a tough PSG side, the USMNT will look toward the striker to advance as far as possible at the World Cup. Already performing with pressure on his shoulders, this is a good start. If he can follow this up with another brace in the second leg, who knows, Monaco could shock the world and book a place in the round of 16.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Michigan is a machine.On Tuesday, the newly ranked No. 1 team in the country brandished its brawn and might in an authoritative 91-80 road win over No. 7 Purdue to improve to 25-1, marking the first Big Ten team to reach that record since Ohio State in 2011 and the best start in Michigan history.The victory reinforced what college basketball's most respected advanced metrics have been claiming for more than half the season: Michigan is the best team. How it's doing this is incredible, though. Almost every win is either a knockout or convincing vanquishing.And yet: This team found itself a little surprised by the ease in which it trounced Purdue.That's because almost 13 months ago, on Jan. 24, 2025, Michigan came into this same building and got dropped 91-64. The Wolverines were down 44-15 with more than five minutes to go in the first half.\n\"It felt like it was impossible to win here,\" Michigan assistant Mike Boynton told CBS Sports.On Tuesday, a script flipped in one of the loudest basketball environments you'll ever find. Michigan point guard Elliott Cadeau, who's been involved in many riotous arenas, compared Mackey Arena to Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium. Then he offered the highest possible compliment.\"This place is louder,\" he said.'Paint Crew' was primed and ready for Lendeborg Mackey is always loud, but the student section — dubbed the \"Paint Crew\" — was especially deafening at the start. They let Michigan star Yaxel Lendeborg have it early and often with profanity-laced chants. Why? A video surfaced on social media over the weekend that dates back to last summer, when Lendeborg was approached at a bar and dropped an F-bomb-laced promise that Michigan would... um, yeah: it was definitive. Michigan was going to beat Purdue.\n\"I didn't think it was going to end up like this,\" Lendeborg told CBS Sports. \"I forgot about the video. But it resurfaced and I was like, what?\"Oh, it went viral and Purdue's students were ready.They were equal parts eager and angry.And then Michigan blitzed a 24-4 run in the early part of the game to take a 26-11 lead — which it would never give back. Lendeborg finished with 13 points (including some spirit-crushing 3-pointers in the second half, which were tagged with some joyous gestures right back to the Purdue crowd) to go with seven assists. \"He doesn't want to be the big storyline, he just wants to be one of the guys,\" Michigan coach Dusty May told CBS Sports.\nMichigan's players had well-rounded effort: six players scored between 10 and 17 points and seven sank at least one 3-pointer, leading to a season-high 13 triples en route to the program's sixth consecutive road win in the conference by at least 10 points.That ties the Big Ten record, which dates back to an Illinois streak in the 1950s.\"There were some holes on our roster last year that we had to work around,\" May said. \"This year, we don't feel like there's any holes across the board. There's no style of play we can't play well. Are we going to win every game? Hopefully, but probably not. But we do feel like we're equipped to play any style, any way, shape or form.\"\nFor more than half the season, Michigan has rated No. 1 at KenPom.com and EvanMiya.com. But the AP voters couldn't get the Wolverines there in the previous three-plus months because Purdue, Houston and Arizona (which finally took its first loss just eight days ago) held the top spot due to how the schedule broke and Michigan's unexpected home loss to Wisconsin (91-88) on Jan. 10.The team's won 11 in a row since, including road victories vs. top-10 competition: No. 5 Nebraska (75-72 on Jan. 27) and No. 7 Michigan State (83-71 on Jan. 30). Arizona's back-to-back losses paved the way on Monday for the Wolverines to return to the top of the AP poll, a perch they hadn't occupied in 4,765 days (last ranked No. 1 in early February 2013). Tuesday night brought an allegedly compelling matchup.It marked the seventh time Purdue had hosted a No. 1 team and the first since Jan. 8, 2005, when No. 1 Illinois beat the Boilers 68-59 in Gene Keady's final season. (Keady was on hand tonight to watch courtside, as was Zach Edey, who had the time to fly in near the end of the NBA's All-Star break.)\nPutting polls in perspectiveMay told me he approached his staff about the No. 1 ranking and whether they'd bring it up with the team. They decided against it. \"I haven't heard one thing about the No. 1 ranking, except in the media,\" May said. \"Haven't heard it in the locker room, on the plane, in passing. Our guys don't really care about that.\"Purdue did. It had no choice. This spot was its last chance to salvage a shot at a Big Ten title. That 1 next to a team's name is all the motivation any opponent ever needs to bring that much more to a battle. Michigan has faced some really good teams in some hostile environments, with more to come, but nothing will match the ferocity of the lead-up and opening minutes of Tuesday.\nMackey Arena had the clamor of a jet engine as the game tipped.But U-M rendered it meaningless. The Wolverines handled the harassment on the way to doing what they've done 21 times this season: win a game by double-digits. Purdue lost for a third time at home this season; that hasn't happened in six years. Tuesday was also the first time since 1994 that Michigan won at Mackey when Purdue was ranked in the top 10.\"This is the best team we've played,\" Purdue coach Matt Painter told CBS Sports. \"It's the problems they cause. They're not a team that forces a lot of turnovers, either, they're just going to get you to take tougher shots. They've got guys that can carve you.\"Michigan stifled All-American Braden Smith to zero points in the first half (he finished with 20) and flustered Purdue to just 8-of-26 shooting from beyond the arc.\nThe win all but clamps the Big Ten regular-season title in Michigan's favor. May's team is 15-1 in the conference with four regular-season contests remaining and a two-game lead in the loss column. \"Our biggest strength is we don't have a best player,\" Lendeborg, who, by the way, is Michigan's best player, said. \"We've been having a little joke in the locker room, like we feel we're the best team ever assembled. It's a joke but also something we want to accomplish.\"The tongue-in-cheek (that's not so tongue-in-cheek) motto originated in Las Vegas after Michigan won the Players Era by 110 points in three games, punctuated with a 40-point beatdown of Gonzaga. Whatever the tenor of that locker room, the team is nearly indestructible. It took Wisconsin making 15 3-pointers to steal a game last month. On Tuesday, every time Purdue got within 10, 11, 12 points in the second half, Michigan had an answer (often a 3-pointer) that Painter admitted to me was so demoralizing. \n\"We showcased we're the No. 1 team in the nation for a reason,\" Lendeborg said.He's right, and they are. The Wolverines shot 53% from the field, 57% from 3-point range, grabbed 57% of the rebounds and scored 1.31 points per possession on the road against a projected No. 2 seed. And it was maybe their sixth-most impressive win of the season.This team is laughably good.Showdown with Duke a de facto No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchupMichigan is 10-0 in Quad 1. It's won 10 games by 30-plus points, the most by any school since Duke in 1998-99, one of the best teams ever to not win the national title.Speaking of Duke, it's next.Yep, it's one down and one to go for arguably the toughest two-game week any team will face this regular season. With the road tilt against Purdue now conquered, the neutral-site biggie on Saturday against the No. 3 Blue Devils in Washington, D.C. It will be hyped as the biggest game of the regular season, and rightfully so.\nBefore that game, when the NCAA's top 16 seeds are revealed Saturday at 12:30 p.m ET on CBS, Michigan will be the No. 1 overall seed. The Wolverines have been operating as the best team in college basketball for more than half this season. They look thoroughly uninterested in giving up that title after Arizona's two straight losses, understandable as they were, cracked an opening for Michigan to rise to its earned spot at No. 1.The Wolverines and their top-ranked defense have done enough to prove they should be the deepest, most dangerous team in the NCAA Tournament. And if Michigan beats Duke on Saturday, it will be on a shelf to itself, looking down at the rest of college basketball, heading into March.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire on Dec. 1, the MLB Players Association is suddenly looking for a new executive director. Tony Clark, the union's leader since 2013, resigned Tuesday after an internal investigation reportedly revealed he had been having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been hired by the union in 2023.Bruce Meyer, the union's deputy director and lead negotiator, remains with the MLBPA. CBA negotiations typically begin in the spring and really heat up around Opening Day. It is unclear who could replace Clark, though the union will want a new executive director in place soon. Clark's replacement must of course be voted on and approved by the players. Subcommittee member Brent Suter told The Athletic that there will be an interim leader to \"keep everything as stable as we can this year.\"The timing of Clark's resignation is definitely not great. CBA negotiations are always contentious and that will again be the case come December. The 2022-23 lockout lasted a record 99 days and commissioner Rob Manfred has made it pretty clear another lockout is coming. \"In a bizarre way, it's actually a positive,\" Manfred said last year about a lockout.Clark, 53, joined the union in 2010 and was unanimously approved as executive director following Michael Weiner's death in December 2013. He oversaw two CBA negotiations and had three years to prepare for his first negotiation in 2016. His replacement will not have that luxury. The next executive director will jump right into CBA talks.\nHere are six major issues Clark's eventual replacement will have to tackle once CBA talks begin with MLB.Salary capLong story short, CBA negotiations are about money. Everything else is secondary. There is a giant pile of money and the two sides haggle because they each want a bigger piece. MLB has done a good job selling a salary cap as necessary to improve competitive balance, but make no mistake, it is about money. Above all, a salary cap restricts player salaries and boosts franchise values.MLB has pursued a salary cap since the 1880s. They seek one every CBA negotiation. The question this time is how dug in are the 30 owners? They could see Clark's abrupt resignation as a moment of weakness for the union, and push harder for a salary cap than ever. (Remember, very few current owners were around to experience how much the 1994-95 strike damaged the game.)\nThe union has resisted a salary cap -- MLB is the only non-capped league in North America -- and figures to do so again this CBA negotiation. It is easy to be a doomer about these things and expect games to be missed in 2027, and maybe they will be, but it is way too early to say that for certain. MLB's national television deals are up in 2028. Losing games would be terrible for business.Also, a salary cap is not a simple yes or no item. Even if the MLBPA relents and agrees to a salary cap, the two sides have to agree on how the whole thing would work. What counts as baseball-related revenue and what percentage do the players receive? What's the cap? What's the floor? How do you implement it? The yes/no is the easy part. Figuring out the system is the real fight.Revenue sharingWith or without a salary cap, the revenue sharing system is likely to be adjusted in the next CBA. Currently, every team puts 48% of its local revenue (local television deal, tickets, concessions, etc.) into the pot, then each team takes out an equal 1/30th share. Big-market teams pay more into revenue sharing than they take out. Small-market teams take out more than they pay in.\nBaseball has always had a revenue disparity problem but it has never been this extreme. Between payroll and competitive balance tax, the Dodgers fielded a $516 million roster in 2025, or more than the bottom five payroll teams combined. Adjusting the revenue sharing program will pit the owners against each other. After that, they have to take it to the MLBPA and get the union's approval too.ArbitrationMLB has sought to eliminate the arbitration process and replace it with a pay-for-play formula, where player salary is determined strictly by their performance. Tarik Skubal's recent record $32 million arbitration win is likely to ramp up those efforts. Arbitration is a key item for the MLBPA. They're against anything that takes away a player's ability to negotiate his salary. They'll fight to keep arbitration.Postseason expansionThe postseason only grows larger -- it never shrinks -- and playoff expansion has really ramped up in recent years. Here are how many teams qualified for the postseason throughout baseball history (ignoring the 2020 pandemic season):\n1903-68: 2 teams (World Series only)1969-93: 4 teams (Championship Series added)1994-2011: 8 teams (Division Series added)2012-21: 10 teams (Wild Card Game added)2022-present: 12 teams (Wild Card Series added)MLB pushed for a 14-team postseason field during the last CBA negotiation and the MLBPA held the line at 12 teams. That gives the union a negotiating chip this time around. The players want playoff expansion too. It means more players get a chance at a World Series and (more importantly) there's more postseason revenue to go around. They will use it as a bargaining chip though.I have no idea what the next CBA will bring (no one does right now), but I am more confident in it bringing a 14-team postseason field than I am anything else.International draftAmateur players in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico are subject to the draft every summer. Amateur players everywhere else in the world are free agents who can sign with any team. Once upon a time, teams could pay international free agents whatever they wanted. Nowadays it is still a free agent system, though there is a hard cap on spending in place each summer.\nDuring the last CBA negotiation, MLB offered to eliminate the qualifying offer system in exchange for an international draft. The MLBPA said no. MLB will try again for an international draft because it will keep costs down. The union could use it as a bargaining chip -- \"We'll give you an international draft for this, this, and that\" -- though they have opposed an international draft to date.ExpansionMLB is in the middle of its longest expansion drought since the league first expanded in 1961. Manfred has said he wants to put the wheels in motion for expansion before he retires in January 2029. That does not mean there will be 32 teams for the 2029 season. It just means Manfred wants the process to begin. Soliciting expansion bids, reviewing proposals, that kind of thing.The union will surely be on board with expansion because it means more roster spots and more jobs. I'm not sure baseball is ready for expansion (there's barely enough pitching for 30 teams as it is), but it's coming either way. Expansion is unlikely to be a sticking point during CBA talks. It's just something that has to get put on the table and agreed to along the way.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Real Madrid's victory over Benfica overshadowed by a stoppage of play with Vinicus Junior walking off the pitch following an incident of alleged racial abuse. After scoring a goal and celebrating during Real Madrid's 1-0 victory, the match had to be delayed for 10 minutes after Vinicius sprinted over to referee Francois Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni.The Benfica player covered his face with his shirt when he said something to Vinicius Junior, and Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe said that the word used was \"mono,\" which is Spanish for monkey. CBS Sports analyst Thierry Henry reflected on the scenario and opened up, saying he had gone through similar situations during his own storied career.\"People did fight, way before my time, for us to be able to perform and to entertain people. And to still be in 2026 dealing with the same thing, it's tiring,\" Henry said. \"Obviously, I can relate, not only I can relate by the color of my skin, I can relate because I've been there. I've been lonely.\"\n\"I really don't know anymore ... Don't go there, don't do this. They are booing him. There's no way that if people understood what was happening on the field and that they've been told because they still were booing him. \"That happened to me. So at times you feel lonely because it's going to be your word against his word. And so, because we don't know what was said, because [Prestianni] was very courageous and put his shirt over his mouth to make sure we were not going to see what he said, so clearly, already, you look suspicious. Because you don't want people to see or read what you said.\"Then you have the reaction of Vinicius telling me that something was not right ... Vinicius can tell us his side, and Prestianni, I'm sure, will not tell us what was actually said. I saw him when Kylian Mbappe confronted him, and he said to Kylian, 'I didn't say anything.' But he must've said something. What I go back to is that sometimes it's lonely, you feel like you don't know what to do anymore, because I've been in that situation, Vinicius has been in that situation. So many players have been in that situation.\" \n\"Regardless of whatever happened, you don't want to see anyone throwing a bottle at anyone anywhere. I can relate because at times you feel lonely, this is why I like the reaction of the Real Madrid players, as you would expect that when you see a teammate in this type of situation, you're going to believe him straight away. Yes, Vinicius scored, but it's not something that you want to see. I've been in this situation; it's horrible. And not being able to prove it. He's going to say no, obviously.\" When Prestianni was substituted from the match in the 81st minute of play, he was applauded by the Benfica supporters. Benfica's manager Jose Mourinho claimed that Vini's goal wasn't celebrated in a respectful way, despite the Brazilian dancing in the corner, for which he was yellow carded for. Henry asked the question that many are wondering in response. \"I answered by scoring goals, I answered by being cocky, I answered by being silent, I answered by fighting. So what, are we just here to entertain?\"\nUEFA guidelines In UEFA competitions, there are official guidelines to halt a match if a referee becomes aware of racial behavior but the guidelines are geared to incidents coming from fans rather than from players on the pitch itself. Step one is for the game to be stopped with an announcement being made to cease any racist behavior. If it doesn't cease after the game has been restarted, it will then be suspended with teams going to the dressing rooms before potentially being abandoned if issues continue after a second restart. After a match, the case is referred to UEFA's disciplinary authorities.This match was only stopped as the referee attempted to sort out what was said, but since there wasn't clear proof of what happened, after things calmed down, the match restarted. Vinicius Junior released a statement on social media calling for more action.\n\"Racists are, above all, cowards,\" the Brazilian said. \"They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, in theory, have the obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new to me or my family. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like to be involved in situations like this, especially after a great victory and when the headlines should be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\" \nRight back Trent Alexander-Arnold called the event \"a disgrace to football,\" following the match, while Mbappe encouraged Vinicius to keep dancing.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tony Clark, executive director of the MLB Players Association, resigned from his position Tuesday, the union announced, just months before the current collective bargaining agreement is set to expire on Dec. 1. The stunning news comes after an internal investigation revealed an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law, ESPN reported. The relative had reportedly been hired by the union in 2023.\"The strength of this union is -- and will always be -- the solidarity of our membership,\" the MLBPA said in a statement late Tuesday. \"We have a long history of fighting for the rights of every player and we're committed to making sure we can continue that fight successfully.\"Marcus Semien, a member of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee, told reporters Tuesday that Clark did not discuss his resignation with union leadership ahead of time.It's unclear who will take over Clark's role in the players' union, but subcommittee member Brent Suter told The Athletic that the MLBPA will use an interim leader, citing the desire to \"keep everything as stable as we can this year.\" The full executive board of player representatives met Tuesday afternoon, but no replacement was immediately named.\n\"I feel we have made mistakes in the past by making rushed decisions. The executive subcommittee and all the reps agreed we want to get this right. We don't want to get it done just because there's a void,\" Chris Bassitt, a member of the executive subcommittee, told The Athletic. \"I would think we would have this wrapped up within 24 hours, but at the end of the day I believe that making sure all 1,200-plus players have a true opinion on this and a true understanding of everything we know is more important than filling it as soon as possible.\"Clark and the MLBPA are under federal investigation by the Eastern District of New York. Prosecutors are looking into whether a licensing company co-founded by the MLBPA and the NFL players union, OneTeam Partners, was being used to financially enrich the union leaders. The full scope of the investigation into the company is unclear, but members of the executive subcommittee have been in contact with federal officials, according to The Athletic.An MLBPA-owned youth baseball company, Players Way, is also under investigation for alleged financial impropriety. The company is said to have held few live events for kids even though the MLBPA put $3.9 million into the company. Players Way executives and consultants reportedly received six-figure salaries despite the company's lack of events.\n\n        \n            \n                Six major issues for Tony Clark's MLBPA replacement: Salary cap, international draft, more negotiating tasks\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThree former members of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee -- Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito, and Ian Happ -- attempted to remove Meyer as the union's deputy director in December 2024. Flaherty, Giolito, and Happ were then voted out of the subcommittee. There are eight players on the subcommittee: Semien, Bassitt, Suter, Jake Cronenworth, Pete Fairbanks, Cedric Mullins, Paul Skenes, and Tarik Skubal.CBA negotiations typically begin during the spring and get serious in April and throughout the summer. Clark's expected resignation comes at a precarious time for MLB, as the upcoming labor negotiations are expected to get ugly. Both sides, in fact, have warned of the likelihood of a labor stoppage, though each blames the other, of course. \"In a bizarre way, it's actually a positive,\" commissioner Rob Manfred said last year of a lockout. \"There is leverage associated with an offseason lockout and the process of collective bargaining under the (National Labor Relations Act) works based on leverage. The great thing about offseason lockouts is the leverage that exists gets applied between the bargaining parties.\"\nThe salary cap -- proposed by the owners -- is again the biggest sticking point, as the league presents the idea of teamwide payroll minimums and maximums under the guise of parity. The union has always held that it will never accept a salary cap. Other issues expected to come up for debate include playoff expansion and an international draft.Clark, 53, joined the MLBPA in 2010 following a 15-year playing career. He was unanimously approved as the union's executive director in December 2013, following the death of Michael Weiner. Clark has overseen the last two CBA negotiations.\n            ",

Punk defends his world heavyweight title against Finn Balor, plus two superstars will punch their tickets to WrestleMania 42.Punk has his hands full as the world heavyweight champion. He'll rematch Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber, the last major stop before WrestleMania. If he leaves Chicago with his champion status intact, Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns awaits him in Las Vegas.Elimination Chamber's two titular matches will also take place. The superstars who emerge from their respective steel structures victorious will earn world title matches at WrestleMania. Randy Orton, LA Knight and Cody Rhodes are among those who've qualified for a shot at the undisputed WWE title. Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka will compete with two other women for a shot at one of the two women's world titles as Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan has still yet to make her decision on who she will face.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Feb. 28 with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. TBA vs. TBA: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Cody Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Je'Evon Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. TBA vs. TBA: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Alexa Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Jacob Fatu: WWE subverted expectations by booking Rhodes and Fatu in the same Elimination Chamber qualifying match. All signs pointed to an eventual triple threat match between them and McIntyre. Rhodes is still the favorite to challenge McIntyre at WrestleMania. Maybe Fatu loses his qualifying match and earns a separate title shot against McIntyre. It seems odd to reward Fatu with a title opportunity if he loses his upcoming qualifier match. Whatever direction WWE takes, expect Fatu to orbit McIntyre in the next few months.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eli Manning was among the Super Bowl MVPs who were acknowledged prior to Super Bowl LX. But unlike the others in attendance, the former New York Giants quarterback was the only eligible one who is not currently a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Despite a decorated career that includes being a two-time Super Bowl MVP, Manning missed the cut again this year, his second year of eligibility for enshrinement in Canton, Ohio. Despite the snub, Manning doesn't seem concerned about his place in history.\"It doesn't keep me up at night,\" Manning said in an interview with Jon Gruden. \"I'm not gonna be bitter at it. I'm not bitter at the game of football. I loved my teammates. I love the relationships, the friendships, the championships, the parades. \"When I think about football, I think about touchdowns and my buddies and wins and plane rides home. I don't think about the interceptions. I don't think about the bad stuff. I think about the positive things. And so if I ever get in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, I'll take it as a positive and I'm not gonna think about the years I had to wait to get in.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Eli Manning got omitted from Pro Football Hall of Fame again: Inside the most complex HOF case ever\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning perhaps has the most complicated Hall of Fame case in history. He is one of just six players to have multiple Super Bowl MVPs (the other five are Hall of Famers Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, and future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes). He authored two of the most legendary playoff runs in NFL history that culminated in memorable upset wins over the New England Patriots in two Super Bowls, including preventing the 2007 Patriots from joining the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the NFL's only perfect teams. On top of that, Manning was top-10 all-time in career passing yards and touchdown passes at the time of his retirement. He also had the third-most consecutive starts (210) by a quarterback in league history behind only Hall of Famer Brett Favre and 2004 draft classmate Philip Rivers. While those are certainly Hall of Fame worthy bonafides, Manning's less flattering numbers are undoubtedly the reasons why he is not a Hall of Famer yet. He led the league in interceptions on three different occasions, completed just 60.3% of his regular season passes and won as many regular season games (117) as a starter as he lost. \nManning hasn't made it yet, but it's a safe to assume that he ultimately will be selected for the Hall of Fame at some point. The same can also be said of Bill Belichick, who shockingly was not selected in his first year of eligibility. Belichick didn't get selected despite winning eight total Super Bowls and 333 games as a head coach, and Manning has his theory as to why. \"I think he pissed off so many people because he was beating them for so long and didn't give great interviews that they held a grudge against him,\" he said. \"But that shouldn't take away from what he did on the field and winning football games.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Juventus' trip to Galatasaray for the first leg of the UEFA Champions League's knockout phase playoffs had all the makings of an entertaining affair, even if the focus was solely on the Italian side. Things have trended upward for Juventus since they hired Luciano Spalletti last fall – they remain in the midst of a top four battle in Serie A thanks to a rebooted attack defined by the new coach's unique tactical fixes, which included a start for U.S. international Weston McKennie as a central striker. It was all going according to plan for the most part in Istanbul as Juventus took a 2-1 lead into the halftime break, Teun Koopmeiners the unlikely scorer of a brace to get his side off to a strong start.Then it all unraveled.Noa Lang scored in the 49th minute and Davinson Sanchez restored Galatasaray's lead 60 minutes in, though those goals were merely the latest contributions to an entertaining match rather than a signal that the scales were genuinely about to tip in the other direction. The hosts only waited a few more minutes for their eventual reprieve in Juan Cabal's second yellow card just seven minutes later, marking a quick exit for the halftime substitute.\nFrom there, any semblance of Juventus' stability faded and floodgates well and truly opened for Galatasaray. They were off to the races and scored two more to close out the match, first with Lang completing a brace in the 75th minute and Sacha Boey capping things off with a goal of his own in the 86th minute. The hosts had no issue carving up Juventus' defense but quite frankly, they had already been in the habit – the visitors' back line had not covered itself in glory before Canal's red card, digging themselves into a hole long before they were down a player.\nJuventus' mess was a rarity in their own history, only conceding five-plus goals in a European knockout game once before during a match against Austria's Wiener SC during the 1958-59 season. It was a mess of their own creation, though – though Spalletti's Juventus have improved considerably from an attacking standpoint, they have been vulnerable defensively the whole time. They have held their own in Italy but over the course of their Champions League campaign, Juventus have been average in that department – they conceded 10 goals in eight league phase matches from 11.64 expected goals against, ranking 16th in the Champions League in the latter category. They may have closed out the league phase with three clean sheets but they had the fortune of playing against Pafos, Benfica and Monaco, none of which ranked higher than 23rd in the league phase for goals scored. Galatasaray, then, were poised to take full advantage – Victor Osimhen may not have gotten on the scoresheet but several others did, the Turkish club now halfway to their deepest Champions League run since the 2013-14 season.Spalletti's tactical innovations in attack have been beyond helpful to Juventus – they averaged 1.5 goals scored from 1.4 expected goals across all competitions before he was hired, the numbers up to 1.8 and 1.9 in the respective categories since his arrival. It is a noticeable uptick for a team that does not exactly boast of the game's top attackers and a real signal of Spalletti's ability to get the best out players who have otherwise flown under the radar. A brace from Koopmeiners came as a pleasant surprise for Juventus at the start of the game while McKennie, who assisted the second goal, is a prime example of Spalletti's impact. The U.S. men's national team player has long been a utility player for the team but has transitioned into one of Juventus' most impactful players – he has seven goals and five assists across all competitions this season, making it a career-best goalscoring campaign with months left on the clock.An attack punching above their weight, though, is only so much cover for a defense as vulnerable as this one. By the time Cabal was sent off, Galatasaray were already in charge of the game, generating 2.28 expected goals from 17 shots while Juventus had 1.11 expected goals from seven total attempts. The work only got easier after the fact – the visitors did not take a single shot after being reduced to 10 men, sloppy play at the back allowing Galatasaray to score twice despite mustering just 0.64 expected goals.\nSimply put, Juventus were not built to succeed in a tie like this one, even if the scale of the loss was hard to predict. It made them uniquely vulnerable in a tie against a team like Galatasaray and is par for the course for one of Italy's former giants – since finishing as the runners-up in the Champions League in the 2016-17 season, they have only reached the quarterfinals twice and not once since the 2018-19 campaign. Juventus have also not been in the round of 16 since the 2021-22 season and may miss out for a fifth successive year at this rate. Tuesday's result in Istanbul, if anything, may just be the official death knell on Juventus' glory days, which may be long behind them at this point.\n            ",

I cherished every moment my cleats touched the grass. Every time I stepped onto the field, I was determined to leave a piece of myself in every snap.\" Woods signed a one-day contract Tuesday to retire as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. \nWoods had not appeared in a regular season game since 2024, his second year with the Houston Texans. He was initially drafted out of USC by the Buffalo Bills, where he played his first four seasons. \nWoods signed with the Rams in March 2017 ahead of coach Sean McVay's first season with the franchise. He appeared in just 12 games but posted a career-high (to that point) 56 catches for 781 yards with five touchdowns. He was the Rams' top wide receiver in 2018 when they made a run to the Super Bowl, where he had five catches for 70 yards. He finished the 2018 campaign with 1,219 yards and six touchdowns. Woods was also on the roster when the Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56, though he missed the game itself due to a torn ACL. Woods signed with the Tennessee Titans in 2022 and spent one season in Nashville before he signed his two-year contract with the Texans. \nWoods finished his career with 683 catches for 8,233 yards and 38 touchdowns.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nPrior to the start of the college basketball season, the Purdue Boilermakers were picked to win the Big Ten, with the Michigan Wolverines second. And with just 20 days remaining in the regular season, the top two Big Ten teams in the AP Top 25 poll are the Wolverines (No. 1) and the Boilermakers (No. 7).On Tuesday, the two teams long thought to be the class of the conference collide when Michigan and Purdue square off at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Ind., in what may end up being the game of the year in the Big Ten.The Wolverines (24-1, 14-1 in Big Ten) have won 10 in a row since a loss to Wisconsin on Jan. 10 and own a two-game lead over Illinois in the conference. They have dominated opponents all season by outrebounding opponents and generating extra shots.Meanwhile, the Boilermakers (21-4, 11-3) are tied for third in the Big Ten, with Nebraska. They have won four in a row since a three-game skid threatened to derail their season. Michigan is a 2.5-point favorite over Purdue on Tuesday night.While Wolverines-Boilermakers is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on Tuesday, Feb. 17. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 1 Michigan at No. 7 PurdueTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: West Lafayette, Ind. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Purdue +2.5 | Expert: Over 152.5 (Chip Patterson)\nWhile the Wolverines have excelled on the boards this season (ranking 10th in the country in rebound margin, 9.8 per game), the Boilermakers are capable of hanging with Michigan on the glass. Purdue ranks 20th in the nation in rebound margin (7.6). On the other end of the court, the Boilermakers are No. 2 in the country in offensive efficiency (128.2 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says Purdue has a 69.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Boilermakers +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"The key to the Over will be Braden Smith's playmaking in a huge game on a Tuesday night in Mackey Arena,\" he says. \"The bet here is that the four-year starter has a big night and Purdue is ready to run it up into the 80s as well.\"No. 16 North Carolina at NC StateTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Raleigh, N.C.| TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: North Carolina +6.5\nNot only is star freshman Caleb Wilson (19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game) out for the North Carolina Tar Heels, but second-leading scorer Henri Veesaar (16.4) is questionable for Tuesday's game with an Illness. The good news for the Tar Heels (20-5, 8-4 in ACC)? They'll be facing a NC State Wolfpack team (18-8, 9-4) that is struggling right now, having lost two in a row. After the Wolfpack's most recent loss, to Miami, coach Will Wade ripped his team publicly, calling his players \"soft.\" The SportsLine Projection Model says North Carolina has a 58.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Tar Heels +6.5. But make sure to check closer to opening tip for changes due to injury updates.No. 21 Louisville at SMUTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: SMU +3.5\nThere are not many teams in the country with a backcourt like the SMU Mustangs'. Boopie Miller (18.9 points per game), Jaron Pierre Jr. (17.4) and B.J. Edwards (13.2) combine to score 56.5% of the team's points. The Mustangs (17-8, 6-6 in ACC) also shoot 76.2% from the free throw line, which ranks 48th in the nation. That figures to benefit them against the Louisville Cardinals (19-6, 8-4), who are a high-fouling team (18.8 per game, 284th in the country). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance SMU covers and assigns a B grade to Mustangs +3.5. No. 9 Nebraska at IowaTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Iowa City | TV: Big Ten Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa -1.5 | Expert: Nebraska +1.5 (Micah Roberts)\nThe Nebraska Cornhuskers (22-3, 11-3 in Big Ten) are the definition of three and D. They are 11th in Division I in 3-pointers made per game (11.0) and eighth in the nation in defensive efficiency (92.5 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom). On Tuesday, they will face an Iowa Hawkeyes team (18-7, 8-6) that has lost back-to-back games and is coming off a 21-point blowout loss at home to Purdue. \"Nebraska has proved that it is worthy of being a first-class tiered Big Ten squad,\" Roberts says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says that the Hawkeyes have a 65.0% chance to cover and gives a strong A grade to Iowa -1.5.Looking aheadChampions League: Newcastle United at QarabagTime: 12:45 p.m. Wednesday | Location: Baku, Azerbaijan | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Newcastle United -253 | Expert: Qarabag +1.5 (Jon Eimer)\nQarabag will look to continue their historic run through the Champions League when they host Newcastle United in the first leg of the knockout round playoffs. Thanks to wins over Frankfurt and Copenhagen and a draw against Chelsea — all at home — Qarabag are the first team from the Azerbaijan Premier League to reach the knockout round of the Champions League. The teams will play the second leg in the United Kingdom on Feb. 24. \"Newcastle know if they just keep this close they can bring the second leg back home and dominate. I expect Qarabag to do what they did against Copenhagen, Chelsea and Frankfurt at home already, and cover this spread,\" Eimer says. However, the SportsLine Projection Model likes Newcastle to win and assigns a strong A grade to the Newcastle money line (-253).\n            ",

Former Nuggets players Bill Hanzlik posted on X that Moe \"passed away peacefully holding the hand of his wife.\"\"Coach Moe was a one of a kind leader and person who spearheaded one of the most successful and exciting decades in Nuggets history,\" the Nuggets said as part of a statement. \"He will forever be loved and remembered by Nuggets fans and his banner commemorating his 432 career victories as head coach will hang in the rafters to forever honor his incredible legacy.\"\nMoe started his coaching career as an assistant in the ABA before becoming the San Antonio Spurs coach in 1976-77, the franchise's inaugural NBA season. The Spurs made the playoffs in each of Moe's first three seasons before he was fired late in the 1979-80 season.After starting the 1980-81 season as a Denver assistant, he got elevated to head coach, and stayed in that role until 1990. Moe's fast-paced, run-and-gun teams led the league scoring six times across his 10 seasons. His 432 wins were a franchise record until Michael Malone passed him in 2024.\nMoe then moved to the Philadelphia 76ers, but he was fired after a 19-37 start to his first season. He returned to Denver in the 2000s as an assistant coach. Former Nuggets coach George Karl, whom Moe worked under, also took to X following Moe's death.\nA two-time All-ACC selection at North Carolina, Moe's college career ended due to his association with a point shaving scandal; there was no evidence he was involved in fixing games, but he did admit to taking money from a conspirator. Moe was selected in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons and in 1961 by the Chicago Packers, but due to the scandal, his NBA career was delayed.\nHe eventually began his professional basketball career in Italy in 1965 and joined the ABA's New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967. He was an ABA All-Star his first year as well as the next two years with the Oakland Oaks -- who won the 1968-69 ABA title -- and the Carolina Cougars, respectively. He also finished in the top 10 in MVP voting all three years. He spent his last two years as a player with the Virginia Squires before beginning his coaching career.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Mike Evans will be back in 2026. Whether it's with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or not remains to be seen. The longtime star wide receiver plans to play next season and will explore his options in free agency, according to ESPN's Kimberley A. Martin.Evans, 32, had an injury-derailed 2025. He played in just eight games, missing time early in the year with a hamstring injury, and shortly after returning from that, he suffered a concussion and broken collarbone. Overall, he finished with 30 catches for 368 yards and three touchdowns.That meant Evans' streak of 11 straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons came to an end; it was the longest streak ever to begin a career, and it tied Jerry Rice for the longest streak in NFL history.\nAt his best, Evans remains a strong deep threat; in his first game back from the broken collarbone, Evans exploded for six catches for 132 yards. Plus, at 6-foot-5 and 231 pounds, Evans has the size and strength to win contested catches and dominate in the red zone. From 2014-24, Evans had an NFL-best 105 receiving touchdowns, and that included 13 in 2023 and 11 in 2024.A six-time Pro Bowler, Evans is set to hit free agency this offseason. Though he has spent his entire career with Tampa Bay and is one of the franchise's most iconic players, he could have plenty of suitors on the open market.\nCBS Sports' Garrett Podell ranked Evans as the No. 17 free agent in this class. The free agency negotiating period begins March 9.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tyreek Hill has no hard feelings following his release from the Miami Dolphins and wants the rest of the NFL to know he's anxious to get back on the field for the 2026 season. Grateful for the opportunity in Miami after four seasons with the franchise, the five-time All-Pro broke his silence this week after the roster move and said he is focused on a return to playing at an elite level.Hill's release comes ahead of contract guarantees that would've taken effect during the 2026 season. Hill suffered a devastating, season-ending knee injury in September and is expected to miss much of the offseason in recovery.\"Every chapter in life has taught me something. This one taught me leadership, resilience and mostly gratitude,\" Hill wrote Monday on Instagram. \"The love I have for this game is unexplainable. And right now, this offseason, for the first time ever, The Cheetah is all the way turned up and locked in. Focused. The Cheetah don't slow down, ever.\"Hill recorded 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown last season prior to injury, this coming after his production totals in 2024 marked the lowest of his career. By cutting Hill and three others on Monday in a series of cost-cutting decisions, the Dolphins saved nearly $70 million in cap space ahead of next season.\nHill said he felt \"loved\" in Miami and singled out Dolphins fans.\"Y'all are different man,\" Hill wrote. \"The way you showed up for us week after week, no matter the outcome — that love was real. I feel it thru out the city and every time I stepped into Hard Rock. Miami, you have became my home.\"Hill's first two seasons with the Dolphins were arguably the best of his career, at least individually altering a pair of 119-catch, 1,700-yard campaigns. His 13 touchdown catches in 2023 were the second-most in a single season during his career.Hill spent his first six years with the Kansas City Chiefs, one of the teams who could pursue him as an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career. Hill is an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and won a Super Bowl in Kansas City to end the 2019 season.\nHill's 11,363 career receiving yards rank ninth-most by a player in his first 10 seasons in NFL history, and his 28 touchdowns of 50 yards or longer are the fourth-most all time. Despite last season's injury, Hill should command considerable interest from a list of playoff-anxious suitors in need of a reliable target in the passing game.Potential landing spots could include the Bills, Chargers, 49ers and Patriots — teams who could all use assistance from a premier wideout who already have a franchise quarterback in tow for next season.Hill's medical evaluations during the court process will be vital to his future signings. After his knee dislocation in Week 4 last season, Hill underwent successful surgery for an ACL tear and is already walking without a brace.\n            ",

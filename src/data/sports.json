Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>Media outlets often publish a list of the best coaches in college basketball that's shaped largely by publicly available information like wins and championships. Those are always subjective but also pretty easy to do with more or less the same names slotted near the top each time.</p><p>But who are the good guys?</p><p>Not just good <em>coaches </em>but also good <em>men</em>, you know, the type of people you wouldn't mind your son playing for someday, and spending four years with someday, if he developed into a legitimate basketball prospect. A random person probably has no grasp for how to answer that question without real relationships throughout the sport. But do you know who has real relationships throughout the sport?</p><p> Coaches!</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind, Matt Norlander and I asked more than 100 college coaches the following question:</p><h2>If your son were a player, which college coach would you want him to spend four years with?</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Matt Painter (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>)</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Tom Izzo (Michigan State)</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Kelvin Sampson (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>)</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Rick Barnes (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>)</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Few (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/GONZAG/gonzaga-bulldogs/\">Gonzaga</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dusty May (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Pope (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Lloyd (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Shaka Smart (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MARQET/marquette-golden-eagles/\">Marquette</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Scott Drew (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Todd Golden (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>(</em><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>A list of more than a dozen coaches accounted for the other 21% of the vote.)</em></p><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><h3>On Matt Painter:</h3><ul><li>\"He's like a brother to me. [He's] one of the most genuine, well-spoken, compassionate, empathetic [people]. Elite thinker [and] elite coach who has produced with less and ... his player-development, and how he gets these kids to stay, is amazing to me. He's a really, really good human being.\"</li><li>\"Excellent coach. Better person. Man of integrity. Tells his players what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Genuinely cares about his program and the game of college basketball. Players have a great understanding of their job.\"</li><li>\"His program is at the highest level and has shown that they are doing the right things to retain players. So they are having a great experience, will develop and get better, and will always hear the truth.\"\t</li></ul><h3>On Tom Izzo:</h3><ul><li>\"Izzo embraces old school and new school. He teaches the game the right way -- and I think he has the ultimate respect of his players. You get coach Izzo for life if you play for him.\"</li><li>\"If he wants to coach four more years, and God only knows why he would want to, the answer for me is Izzo. While I genuinely think the \"leader of men\" thing is bullcrap when it comes to coaches raising players, Izzo is close to it, and his players tend to love him and always return to the program.</li><li>\"Tom Izzo is 'old school' in a good way, a way most college kids need/want. His players develop on the court, they win and, more importantly, they become a member of a family for life. At least from my perspective, that seems real. And if it were my son, I would want that for him.</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>Now that the 2025 Candid Coaches series has concluded it's fair to suggest that nobody had a better few weeks in it than Matt Painter and Purdue. While polling coaches, we learned that they believe the Boilermakers will be the best team this season and that Purdue point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a> will be <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">the best player</a></span>. Coaches also described Painter as the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">best Xs and Os coach</a></span> in the sport and among the favorites to next become a first-time national champion. And now they've told us that, if they had a son heading off to play college basketball, the person they'd most trust to provide a great and valuable experience is Painter.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/dca6c3fa-b537-44e9-924c-e610b7e128cb/thumbnail/270x152/f825ae894924dfd9112258855c191310/cc-sept26-v1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>None of this is surprising.</p>\n<p>The truth is that there are a lot of excellent coaches running great programs who double as good dudes -- but it was not surprising to see Painter lead all vote-getters when this question was asked. For lack of a better way to put it, people just really like and enjoy him. I don't mean to paint him as a saint, if only because I don't personally know any saints (and that seems like a weird place to set the bar). But what I can tell you is that in 20-plus years of covering college basketball, I don't think I've ever heard another coach say anything derogatory about Painter. He's both broadly respected as a coach and generally liked as a man. Not everybody in this sport checks those boxes while also being on track to someday become a Naismith Memorial Hall of Famer. But Painter clearly does, and the results of this final Candid Coaches question of 2025 illustrates as much.</p><h2>Previous 2025 Candid Coaches questions</h2><ul><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</a></span></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-what-percentage-of-your-schools-revenue-sharing-should-go-to-mens-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">What percentage of your school's revenue sharing should go to men's basketball?</a></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best college basketball player this season?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Who is the best X's and O's coach in college basketball?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-college-basketball-coaching-hire-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-do-you-trust-that-your-competitors-will-follow-new-recruiting-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Do you trust that your competitors will follow the new recruiting rules?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-college-basketball-coach-will-be-next-to-win-their-first-ncaa-tournament-title/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the next coach to win his first national championship?</a></span></li></ul>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

Will a decision by a player end up sending his team into a downward spiral or spark it to new heights?</p><p>What about the coaches? Is it necessary to fire a coach in the midst of a bad season or be patient? Same with a quarterback who is trying to retain his starting job week to week? That's the beauty of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, the instant reaction to a result, then having time to think about said reaction. </p><p>Overreactions are a hot topic in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> these days, but can we will them into existence? Perhaps, based on the results of the upcoming slate and how we predict that game this week is going to go.</p><p>These overreaction predictions are a result of what we think will happen this week, rather than the actual result.</p>\n<h2>Time for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> to give <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a> a shot as QB1</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> is earning his second start as quarterback of the Browns, a week after he played well in his first career start. Gabriel went 19 of 33 for 190 yards with two touchdowns for the Browns (94.3 rating) in a loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>, a good defense that can test any young quarterback. </p><p>Cleveland plays Pittsburgh this week on the road. Even though the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> defense isn't as strong as the Vikings, the first sign of trouble for Gabriel could signal the outside noise for Sanders -- especially since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> was traded to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> and Sanders was promoted to QB2. </p><p>There will be some clamors for Sanders all year, and it may start on Sunday. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> will miss the playoffs</h2><p>Monday's loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> put the Chiefs at 2-3 for the season, a rare hole for Andy Reid and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> at this time of the year. The path doesn't get any easier for the Chiefs, who face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> on \"Sunday Night Football.\" If the Chiefs lose at home, they'll fall to 2-4 on the season, which could put them in a hole in the AFC West race with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> facing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> facing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a>.</p>\n<p>Sunday isn't a must win for the Chiefs, but it's close to being one.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-6-buy-or-sell-cowboys-making-the-playoffs-ravens-not-jonathan-taylor-nfls-best-rb/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NFL Week 6 buy or sell: Cowboys making the playoffs?

Take away the rare shutout of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> and the Panthers are 25th in passer rating allowed (106.7) and opponents completion rate (70%). </p><p>Prescott could have a huge game against a pass defense where the overall statistics are deceiving. A win would put the Cowboys at 3-2-1 through six weeks, and the bandwagon will start rolling how Dallas will make the playoffs -- along with Prescott being an MVP favorite. </p><h2>Winner of 49ers-Buccaneers will be a top two seed in NFC</h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> are in the best matchup of the week, as both teams sport 4-1 records -- and have gotten there in very different ways. This is the third straight big game for Tampa Bay, which lost to Philadelphia at home and defeated Seattle on the road. </p>\n<p>A win for the Buccaneers would be massive, but the gauntlet doesn't get any easier with the Lions next week and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> in November. The schedule gets much easier for Tampa Bay after that.</p><p>The 49ers have a very favorable schedule after the Buccaneers, as six of their next seven opponents are .500 or worse before their bye week. The 49ers could actually have 10 wins by the bye week, and set themselves up for a run at home-field advantage in the NFC. </p><p>The only question remains. Will Brock Purdy be back? </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> are best team in NFC with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a></h2><p>Daniels returned for the Commanders last week and played very well in a win over the Chargers, a game which the Commanders were down 10-0 and scored 27 unanswered points to finish the game. The game was buried in the regional window, but Daniels was 15 of 26 for 231 yards and a touchdown (100.0 rating) in his first game back from injury. </p>\n<p>Daniels is healthy now and the Commanders have an opportunity to showcase how significantly better they are with him at quarterback. A win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> on \"Monday Night Football\" would put the Commanders at 4-2 and in the hunt for the NFC East -- and much more in the conference. </p><p>The Commanders have a brutal stretch of games coming up, but the game changes with Daniels at quarterback. The hype train will be rolling if they win on Monday -- and the following week against the Cowboys. </p>\n            </div>",

Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times.</p>\n<p>There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. </p><p>But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26646084/alperen-sengun/\">Alperen Sengun</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005049/amen-thompson/\">Amen Thompson</a>. </p>\n<p>Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1779901/kyrie-irving/\">Kyrie Irving</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685255/james-harden/\">James Harden</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152529/devin-booker/\">Devin Booker</a>, where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. </p><p>Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202822/ben-simmons/\">Ben Simmons</a>, is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-amen-thompson-is-in-prime-position-to-turn-into-the-player-ben-simmons-could-have-become/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Amen Thompson is in prime position to turn into the player Ben Simmons could have become</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Botkin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Amen Thompson is in prime position to turn into the player Ben Simmons could have become\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/04/fe2eaa84-6033-41ed-8198-466d9cddbdfa/thumbnail/270x152/a700b18e33649ef0d94220cd690ce00f/100325-amenthompson.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. </p>\n<p>More Durant and Sengun:</p>\n<p>And one more:</p>\n<p>Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. </p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. </p>\n<p>So, get ready Rockets fans. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2252663/fred-vanvleet/\">Fred VanVleet</a> injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday.</p>\n            </div>",

USC's expecting a raucous environment inside the Coliseum, to which Wolverines coach Sherrone Moore said this week \"it's sold out because Michigan's coming.\" </p><p>We're picking winners and against the spread plays for those two games and several others across a loaded docket on Saturday. </p><p><strong>Last week's results</strong>: Brad Crawford (9-1 straight, 4-6 ATS); Chris Hummer (9-1, 7-3 ATS). Not a good week for yours truly while Hummer cashed several tickets with a great card. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama's</a> backdoor cover on fourth down was disheartening for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> bettors and taking Michigan to cover against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> was a whiff over this way. It's time to bounce back in Week 7. </p>\n<p><strong>Season results</strong>: Crawford (45-15 straight, 34-26 ATS); Hummer (45-15; 27-33). </p><p><em>For clarity, these lines were taken from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a> on Oct. 5.

Though, few secondaries Pitt will see this season are as bad as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BC/boston-college-eagles/\">Boston College's</a>. But I do think Pitt has the pieces on defense to at least limit Florida State's run game. The Panthers have one of the better run defenses in the ACC (6th nationally in rushing success rate) and should be able to keep contain on Thomas Castellanos. Florida State is the better team and roster. But I don't think the gap is double digits. … <em>Florida State 31, Pitt 24.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Florida State -9.5)</strong>: Mike Norvell's not worried about his team hanging their heads after back-to-back ACC losses and neither should you as a bettor in this spot. Pitt freshman quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29272350/mason-heintschel/\">Mason Heintschel</a> was terrific in his first college start last week against Boston College with 323 yards passing and four touchdowns, but going into Doak Campbell Stadium and doing that against Seminoles is a steep mountain to climb. This is my favorite play of the week. ...<em> Florida State 38, Pitt 17.</em> </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> at No. 12 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Arkansas +13.5)</strong>: I don't know what Arkansas' defense will look like with a new defensive coordinator. But I do know these two teams are going to score with an over/under of 69.5. We're going to find out a lot about how hard Arkansas' players will play for Bobby Petrino. If Arkansas can even manage an average defensive effort, it can stay in this game. The problem is that unit has been an absolute disaster. But I think Petrino is in his bag, and the Razorbacks keep this game close enough coming out of a bye. … <em>Tennessee 38, Arkansas 31.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Tennessee -13.5)</strong>: The Fighting Bobby Petrinos. That's what I'm calling the Razorbacks the rest of the season following their firing of Sam Pittman. This is the first test for Petrino, who hopes to become the full-time coach by season's end, with several more coming. Scoring points hasn't been the problem for Arkansas, however. It's keeping the opposition out of the end zone and limiting explosive plays. Tennessee should have plenty of opportunities in Week 7. ... <em>Tennessee 42, Arkansas 24.</em> </p><h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> at No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (LSU -9.5)</strong>: If you look at the advanced metrics like success rate, South Carolina really hasn't done much this season. The Gamecocks rank 123rd in offensive success rate and 84th in defensive success rate. I would expect South Carolina to look better coming out of the bye week, but I just don't see the Gamecocks finding much success against LSU's defense, which is going to throw a lot of looks at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122116/lanorris-sellers/\">LaNorris Sellers</a>. Give me the Tigers to make a statement coming out of the bye week. … <em>LSU 31, South Carolina 20.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (LSU -9.5)</strong>: Is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701706/garrett-nussmeier/\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> 70%, 80%? What's the likelihood LSU's offense finally finds its footing this weekend after an open date and manages a few explosives against the Gamecocks? South Carolina bounced back from consecutive SEC losses with a win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a> and leads the country in non-offensive touchdowns. Got a feeling this one's going to be ugly Saturday night in Baton Rouge. ... <em>LSU 20, South Carolina 10.</em> </p><h2> No. 15 Michigan at USC </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (USC -2.5)</strong>: Can USC stop the run? That's what will decide this game. The Trojans have been solid against the run this season ranking 38th nationally in rushing yards allowed per carry. But Michigan and its rushing attack, which ranks sixth nationally in yards per carry, is a much different test. Still, the Trojans have been efficient offensively this season and present an intriguing test for Michigan, which has only been okay with its secondary play this season. This is a big moment for Lincoln Riley and USC. I think the Trojans get it done at home. … <em>USC 27, Michigan 24.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (USC -2.5)</strong>: Classic set up for the Trojans here. Michigan's making a cross-country trip with USC coming off an open date with a signature win opportunity for Lincoln Riley. Michigan's offense doesn't exactly strike fear in the opposition either, not when its slotted 11th in the Big Ten in explosive plays and near the middle of the pack in yards per game. If USC can limit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a> in this spot, the Trojans will win. ... <em>USC 27, Michigan 24.</em> </p>\n<h2> \t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> at No. 5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Florida +7.5)</strong>: Texas A&M is a much different team than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a>. The Aggies have one of the best O-lines in the SEC, explosive receivers and a run game that's starting to really emerge. If Florida wins this game, it'll take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> and the Florida offense playing by far its best game of the season. Expect Texas A&M to load the box against the run and force Lagway to push the ball downfield. Can he do so consistently? I frankly wouldn't bet on it right now. But Florida does enough to cover. … <em>Texas A&M 27, Florida 20.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Texas A&M -7.5)</strong>: I'd fade the Aggies against the spread if this game were being played in Gainesville, but Billy Napier's 0-9 at Florida against nationally-ranked competition away from home and Texas A&M is hitting its stride. Napier's hoping to extend his tenure as long as he can after the win over Texas, but the momentum will be short-lived unless the Gators can pressure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29173876/marcel-reed/\">Marcel Reed</a> the way they harassed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a> and forced multiple turnovers. ... <em>Texas A&M 24, Florida 10.</em> </p><h2> No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> at No. 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Ohio State -15.5)</strong>: This is a tough matchup for the Illini and their banged up secondary. Illinois ranks 121stnationally in defensive success rate against the pass and 113th in passing yards allowed per game. Ohio State and the best group of wide receivers in the FBS is going to expose that weakness. Thus, this game comes down to Illinois' ability to keep up and I don't see that happening straight up. As for the possibility of a cover … I still don't see it. Ohio State is arguably the best defense in the country. It could be a long day for the Illini. … <em>Ohio State 38, Illinois 20.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Illinois +15.5)</strong>: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701853/luke-altmyer/\">Luke Altmyer</a>'s having a great season at quarterback for the Illini, but faces his stiffest defensive test against the Buckeyes. Top-ranked Ohio State needs to be threatened at some point in Big Ten play, at least to give Ryan Day something to work with on film moving forward toward the College Football Playoff. Illinois will not win this one outright, but it's going to be close. ... <em>Ohio State 31, Illinois 20.</em> </p><h2> No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Georgia -4.5)</strong>: This is the moment for Hugh Freeze. The Tigers are coming off a bye and aren't necessarily overwhelmed from a talent perspective in this matchup. There's a real opportunity for Auburn to make this upset happen. The Tigers' biggest weakness so far this year -- its offensive line -- should be able to hold up against a UGA pass rush that's been a non-factor this year. But … I just trust Georgia more. The Bulldogs' secondary has been a weakness. I just don't see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125321/jackson-arnold/\">Jackson Arnold</a> lighting that group up with his arm. Georgia loads up to stop the run, scores enough points and escapes with a one-score win. … <em>Georgia 27, Auburn 20.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Georgia -4.5)</strong>: I'm just not sold on Auburn's offense, specifically the passing game. All that money invested in wide receivers and quarterback Jackson Arnold for the Tigers to simply fail to meet expectations the first half of the campaign. Hugh Freeze could buy himself some good will with a win over Kirby Smart, but that would be a quite a surprise considering the Bulldogs are a successful conversion or two against Alabama away from being unbeaten and ranked inside the top 5. ... <em>Georgia 27, Auburn 17.</em> </p>\n<h2> Texas vs. No. 6 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Oklahoma +2.5)</strong>: This is a difficult game to project. Oklahoma isn't the same offensively without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a>, whose status is very much in question after suffering a hand injury that's expected to force him to miss multiple weeks. Texas, for its part, is a mess on offense thanks to a leaky offensive line and a non-existent run game. That's a bad combination against one of the best defenses in the country. I expect this to be low scoring with turnovers and momentum plays really swinging this matchup. I don't feel great about it, but I'll take Texas in this one. Both offenses are a concern. But I trust Arch Manning and the Longhorns' overall talent on that side of the ball compared to an offense that could be led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29390586/michael-hawkins-jr/\">Michael Hawkins Jr</a>. … <em>Texas 21, Oklahoma 20.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Texas -2.5)</strong>: This game comes down to John Mateer's availability for the Sooners and whether Texas can protect Manning in the pocket. The opening line with the Longhorns as a favorite gives me immediate pause on taking unbeaten Oklahoma here in Red River. It'll be interesting to see how the Longhorns respond to falling outside of the top 25 or if this season's spiral continues for the former preseason No. 1. In one of the weekend's surprises, I'm going Texas. ... <em>Texas 31, Oklahoma 28.</em> </p><h2> No. 8 Alabama at No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Alabama -3.5)</strong>: The competition hasn't been great, but the Tigers haven't really showed many weaknesses early this season. They're an elite rushing attack paired with what is one of the best defensive fronts in college football. But Alabama is a far different test than what the Tigers have faced so far. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> is playing like a legit Heisman candidate, and the Bama secondary is one of the best in the country. This game will come down to Alabama's ability to defend the Tigers run game. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a> is a weapon, and Alabama has been iffy against the run all year. But I still have some reservations of what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874546/beau-pribula/\">Beau Pribula</a> looks like when a more talented team loads up to stop the run. Alabama gets it done on the road. … <em>Alabama 31, Missouri 27.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Alabama -3.5)</strong>: Kalen DeBoer appropriately said his team was wiping the slate clean post-wins over Georgia and Vanderbilt these last two weeks. A third straight conference opponent might be the toughest ask yet considering Missouri has the SEC's leading rusher and is playing with extreme confidence with an extra week to prepare. If Alabama fails to wrap up Ahmad Hardy, it could be a long afternoon for the Crimson Tide, but I think the pressure's on Missouri to come through in a big spot at home in arguably Eli Drinkwitz's biggest game of his tenure up to this point. ... <em>Alabama 30, Missouri 24.</em> </p><h2> No. 7 Indiana at No. 3 Oregon </h2>\n<p><strong>3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/college-football/?ftag=CBS-03-10ada3a\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/Mleetu8HWsb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a></strong>: </p><p><strong>Hummer (Indiana +8.5)</strong>: I'm of two minds about this game: On one hand, the Hoosiers have struggled against obviously better talent under Curt Cignetti. That includes double-digit losses to Ohio State and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> plus close wins over teams like Michigan and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a>. On the other hand, I think the Ducks are a bit overvalued after their road win over a fraudulent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> team. Oregon is better. Oregon is also more talented. But I honestly don't think the gap is extreme. If the Hoosiers take care of the ball -- they've only coughed the ball up twice this season -- they'll be in this game throughout. Give me the Hoosiers to cover. … <em>Oregon 34, Indiana 31.</em> </p><p><strong>Crawford (Indiana +8.5)</strong>: Curt Cignetti showered Dan Lanning with praise this week, calling him one of the sport's best young coaches. Is that a precursor to the adage 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks' this weekend at Autzen Stadium? Cignetti's already taken out one top 10 opponent this season (by 50 points), but hasn't yet beaten an elite team away from home during his tenure at Indiana.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The franchise of George Steinbrenner, who once changed managers 11 times in a five-year span from 1978-82 and cycled through eight general managers in 11 years from 1978-88, is now a model of stability. In the last 28 years, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> have had one general manager (Brian Cashman) and three managers (Joe Torre, Joe Girardi, Aaron Boone).

Some numbers on New York's postseason success in Boone's eight years as manager:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Postseason record:</strong> 25-27 (.481)</li><li><strong>Record vs. AL Central teams:</strong> 15-4 (.789)</li><li><strong>Record vs. all others:</strong> 10-23 (.303)</li></ul><p>I don't mean to pick on the AL Central, but the fact of the matter is that division houses five teams that do not run large payrolls and are often the underdog in a postseason series against non-division rivals. The Yankees have bullied the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Cleveland Guardians</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Minnesota Twins</a>, et al in October. Against teams more on their level, they consistently come up short.</p><p>The Yankees were eliminated by the Astros in 2017, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> in 2018, the Astros in 2019, the Red Sox in 2021, the Astros in 2022, the Dodgers in 2024, and the Blue Jays in 2025. When it happens two or three times, it's frustrating, but it's baseball. We now have almost of a decade of evidence that against top competition on the game's biggest stage, the Yankees aren't up to the task.</p><p>Stability is a good thing and something teams crave. It works for the Yankees because they're in the race just about every season. It also hasn't worked because their season keeps ending the same way. The Yankees will never be judged by their regular season and early October success. After this many years, it's fair to ask whether this leadership group can get them over the hump.</p>\n<p>There is not much reason to expect the Yankees to replace Boone, who in February signed a two-year contract extension that begins next season. There are a lot of careless mistakes with this team though, and a lot of questionable decisions in October. That reflects poorly on the manager. Eight years is a long time for any manager and yet Boone seems likely to get a ninth. </p><p>Cashman is about as secure as any head baseball operations executive in the game (his last name might as well be Steinbrenner). It's hard to see him going anywhere. The team's stability and continuity also applies to Cashman's department heads, including scouting director Damon Oppenheimer (in place since 2005) and analytics department head Michael Fishman (hired in 2005).</p><p>The notable front office hires the Yankees have made from outside the organization in recent years are baseball lifers Cashman considers among his mentors, including former general managers Jim Hendry, Omar Minaya, and Brian Sabean. They're all with the Yankees as advisors. It wouldn't be a bad idea for the Yankees to branch out a bit and make more outside hires just to bring in new voices and new perspectives.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the Yankees have hired bright people away from other organizations in recent years. Pitching coach Matt Blake and director of pitching Sam Briend overhauled the team's pitching development, which is now among the best in the game. Jarret DeHart was brought in to do the same on the hitting side last winter. Countless others have cycled through over the years.</p><p>At some point, though, you do have to ask yourself why your process leads to the same result year after year. The Yankees love to tout their process (so does every team), but it is a results-based business, and the results aren't there, at least not in October. The Yankees can get there. How do they go further? Can they while maintaining the status quo? Evidence is mounting they can't.</p>\n            </div>",

The clock is ticking on the Yankees' window to win a World Series while their franchise player is the best hitter since Barry Bonds.

That might be the single biggest question facing the Yankees this offseason. The team's shaky bullpen cost them an AL East title and Wild Card Series bye during the regular season, and it cost them Game 1 in the first round. It is really, really hard to win the World Series with anything less than a good bullpen these days.   </p><p>For much of what we'll call the Aaron Judge era, the Yankees have had one of baseball's best and deepest bullpens, but that has not been the case the last few years.

The cracks began to form in the second half of 2023 and in 2024 though, as the bullpen's WAR didn't align with its ERA and win probability added. The results (ERA and WPA) were strong. The underlying performance (WAR) carried red flags.   </p><p>Things collapsed this year. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066820/devin-williams/\">Devin Williams</a> did not meet expectations in what is likely to be his only season in New York, though he was hardly the only culprit. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135258/luke-weaver/\">Luke Weaver</a>, who was so good in 2024, regressed in 2025. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2791772/tim-hill/\">Tim Hill</a> gave up almost as many home runs in 2025 (eight) as he did from 2022-24 combined (10). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2804924/mark-leiter-jr/\">Mark Leiter Jr.</a> was ineffective. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2171169/fernando-cruz/\">Fernando Cruz</a> was inconsistent.   </p><p>The Yankees tried to address their bullpen at the trade deadline, and pretty aggressively at that. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821492/david-bednar/\">David Bednar</a> took control of the closer's job and was very good overall. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822464/camilo-doval/\">Camilo Doval</a> struggled and was demoted out of high-leverage work though, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28838541/jake-bird/\">Jake Bird</a> was so bad he wound up in Triple-A almost immediately. Others like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044524/paul-blackburn/\">Paul Blackburn</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26635145/yerry-de-los-santos/\">Yerry De Los Santos</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29033792/brent-headrick/\">Brent Headrick</a> barely moved the needle.    </p><p>Major injuries (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836753/jake-cousins/\">Jake Cousins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2898233/jonathan-loisiga/\">Jonathan Loáisiga</a>, etc.) took bullpen depth and impact away from the Yankees, but that's baseball. No team gets through the season with a fully healthy bullpen and the Yankees know that. Their moves to address those absences were not enough to compensate, be it internal promotions (De Los Santos, Headrick) or outside additions (Bird, Doval).   </p><p>To fix the problem -- an unreliable bullpen, in this case -- you have to first understand the problem. Are the Yankees no longer good at identifying bullpen talent? Are they no longer able to coach up relievers and make them better, a strength of theirs from 2017-23? It is likely a combination of both: not bringing in the right guys and not improving the guys they have.   </p><p>Bullpens are inherently volatile. It is a bunch of imperfect pitchers (that's why they're relievers in the first place) performing in small sample sizes. After the impressive run of bullpen-building from 2017-23, the Yankees were bound to run into a down period at some point. That point has arrived. Bullpens are just so important though. They have to get this unit back on the rails. It is a must.   </p><h2>   What does the outfield look like in 2026?   </h2><p>By any measure, the Yankees had the best outfield in baseball in 2025. It wasn't close, really. Of course, Judge played a major role in that, but a flexor strain limited him to only 822 ⅓ innings in the field and 425 plate appearances as an outfielder. He made up just 19% of the outfield's defensive innings and 20% of their plate appearances. Judge spent the rest of his time at DH.   </p><p>Here are the numbers on New York's outfield this season:   </p><table><tbody><tr><th><br />   </th><th>NYY OF</th><th>Runner-up</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>AVG</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>.276 (1st in MLB) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Red Sox (.265) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>OBP</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>.363 (1st) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> (.341) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>SLG</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>.507 (1st) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> (.464) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>OPS+</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>140 (1st) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Cubs (120) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>HR</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>112 (1st) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/\">Angels</a> (96) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>WAR</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>16.6 (1st) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Red Sox (14.4) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Judge was Judge. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> slugged 34 homers, double his previous career high (17 in 2022), and went from fourth outfielder to starting center fielder. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> had a 5-WAR season, his best since his 2019 NL MVP year. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3131512/jasson-domnguez/\">Jasson Domínguez</a> performed well against righties (113 OPS+) before Bellinger stopped moving around and took over as the everyday left fielder in September.   </p><p>The outfield was the strength and most productive part of the Yankees this season. The good news is Judge will be back next year, and the next five years after that too. Domínguez still has five years of team control remaining. Grisham will be a free agent though, and Bellinger seems likely to join him by declining his $25 million player option for 2026 to seek a long-term contract.   </p><p>Depending who you ask, top prospect <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920028/spencer-jones/\">Spencer Jones</a> is knocking on the door of the big leagues after finishing second in the minors with 35 homers. The 25th overall pick in the 2022 Draft also stole 29 bases and nearly became the first non-veteran journeyman minor-leaguer to have a 30-30 season since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> (34 HR and 30 SB) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2826875/luis-robert-jr/\">Luis Robert Jr.</a> (32 HR and 36 SB) in 2019.   </p><p>At the same time, Jones struck out in 35.4% of his plate appearances this season, the highest rate among the 209 players with at least 500 plate appearances in the minors. At minimum, Jones' career-long strikeout issues create questions about his ability to help the 2026 Yankees in a meaningful way. Longer term, prospects who strike out this much have higher-than-average bust rates.   </p><p>The Yankees know they can start their 2026 outfield with Judge in right and Dominguez in left. That's a pretty good foundation. The question is who plays center? Is it Jones, who is a gifted defender despite his size (6-foot-7 and 240 lbs.)? Do they attempt to bring back Bellinger and/or Grisham? If not, that's an awful lot production walking out the door that won't be easy to replace.   </p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/ranking-the-top-10-mlb-free-agents-for-the-2025-26-offseason-kyle-tucker-alex-bregman-cody-bellinger-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Tucker will be the top free agent on the market this winter</a></span>, though he would be an imperfect roster fit for the Yankees as another natural right fielder. It's one thing to play Judge in center for one season to accommodate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a>. It's another to do it long-term as he gets deeper into his 30s. Is Tucker in left, Dominguez in center, and Judge in right doable? A wonky alignment, it would be.   </p><p>Other potential center field free agent (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211761/harrison-bader/\">Harrison Bader</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2227731/cedric-mullins/\">Cedric Mullins</a>, etc.) and trade (Robert, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932056/alek-thomas/\">Alek Thomas</a>, etc.) candidates aren't especially appealing. From where I sit, the Yankees should just re-sign Bellinger. It'll be too many years and too many dollars, but he brings so much to the table (contact, power, defense, baserunning) and fits their roster and ballpark so well. It just works, you know?   </p><p>One way or another, the Yankees will have to rebuild baseball's most productive outfield this offseason. It will be difficult, but not impossible. Replacing Soto seemed impossible, but the Yankees finished with the same record, a better run differential, and with more runs scored without Soto in 2025 than they did with Soto in 2024. Rebuilding the outfield will again be a winter priority.</p><h2>Are any changes coming higher up in the organization?</h2><p>The Yankees have had impressive organizational stability and continuity. General manager Brian Cashman has been at the helm since 1998 (and was a longtime front office member before that) and the Yankees have had only three managers in the last 30 years (Joe Torre, Joe Girardi, Aaron Boone). This is the same team that changed managers 11 times from 1978-82 under George Steinbrenner.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/yankees-clinch-33rd-straight-winning-season-the-second-longest-streak-in-north-american-pro-sports-history/\" target=\"_blank\">It has been 33 years since the Yankees last had a losing season</a></span>, and they're in the playoffs almost every year. Based on that, the organizational stability is justified. At the same time, the Wild Card Series was the first time the Yankees beat a non-AL Central team in a postseason series since 2012. No disrespect to the AL Central, but against teams more on their level, the Yankees bow out consistently in October.</p><p>Roster changes are coming this offseason because they always do, and chances are the Yankees will swap out a member of their coaching staff or two as well. Almost every team has some level of coaching staff shuffling each winter. But are any bigger changes coming? Is there any heat whatsoever on Boone and/or Cashman after a relatively quick postseason exit?</p><p>My hunch, and I emphasize this is only a hunch, is no. Cashman is about as secure as any head baseball operations executive in the game. Frankly, given the Yankees' successful Plan B pivot after losing Soto, I would not be surprised to see him get some Executive of the Year support. I'm not saying he'll win it, but successful offseason pivots like this typically get some votes.</p><p>Boone signed a two-year contract extension in February that won't even begin until 2026. He is held in high regard by Cashman and owner Hal Steinbrenner, and those are two people you want in your corner. And, frankly, you can only blame so much on Boone this year. No one pitched well in the ALDS and, for long stretches of time this year, he had no one reliable in the bullpen. Boone could only play who was available to him.</p><p>You can never rule out a managerial change, even after a 94-win season, though Boone does seem secure. I would say a Boone firing would qualify as a surprise. Cashman is more likely to be elevated to, say, a team president position than he is to be pushed out the door. And if he is elevated, he would have a say in picking his replacement, if not make the pick outright (vice president of baseball operations Tim Naehring has been viewed as Cashman's eventual successor).</p><p>The Yankees would be justified sticking with the status quo. It is also fair to question whether this leadership group can win a World Series given the outcome of their last 15 seasons. There's a lot of great regular seasons and bullying overmatched opponents in October, then quick exits when facing other the league's other top teams. At some point, it's not a coincidence. It's the result of a flaw in the process.</p>\n            </div>",

Missouri, however, is unbeaten on the season, and Marshall has identified some key betting trends that point to Mizzou being in a good spot to at least keep this one within the number.</p><p>\"Alabama romped in this one 34-0 last October, but that was at Tuscaloosa,\" Marshall told SportsLine. \"The Tide are just 2-5 both straight up and spread in their last seven away from Bryant-Denny Stadium. The Tigers are on an 8-2 spread surge since last year's loss (that includes just missing as 44.5 vs UMass), and 7-4 as underdogs since 2023.

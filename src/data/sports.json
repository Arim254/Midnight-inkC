Former unified welterweight champion Spence is expected to end his nearly three-year hiatus, making his 154-pound debut against former WBO junior middleweight champion Tim Tszyu. Spence vs. Tszyu is expected to take place in Australia in June, according to ESPN, following an initial report by Ring Magazine and subsequently reported by veteran journalist Dan Rafael. The fight is expected to take place on either June 6 or June 13, with a venue still to be determined. The fight would headline a PBC on Prime Video pay-per-view, according to Rafael and ESPN.Spence (28-1, 22 KOs) has not competed since July 2023. Spence suffered his first career loss that night, suffering three knockdowns and a ninth-round stoppage in an undisputed welterweight title fight against Terence Crawford. Rumors tied Spence to a fight with WBC middleweight champion Sebastian Fundora, but it never materialized. Fundora will instead defend his title against former unified champion Keith Thurman on March 28.Tszyu (26-3, 18 KOs) is undergoing his own rehabilitation. Tszyu's 24-fight undefeated streak was snapped by a split decision loss to Fundora. He went 2-2 after that: beating Anthony Velasquez and Joseph Spencer, but getting stopped by Bakhram Murtazaliev and Fundora.\nSpence's expected comeback ends speculation that he'd retire after the \"Bud\" fight. Instead, Crawford retired after winning his third undisputed weight class title.\n            \n    ",

The club announced the move on Tuesday. The deal is for $13 million with $11 million of the total commitment being deferred, FanSided reports. Verlander, who turns 43 on Feb. 20, is coming off a 2025 season for the Giants in which he pitched to a 3.85 ERA (103 ERA+) with an identical FIP of 3.85 across 29 starts and 152 innings. This pact reunites Verlander with the team that first drafted him out of Old Dominion with the No. 2 overall pick in 2004. Verlander went on to spend the first 12-plus seasons of his MLB career in a Detroit uniform. Over that span, he won 183 games and put up a WAR of 56.6 in a Tigers uniform. In 2011, Verlander as a Tiger won the American League Cy Young and MVP honors. With Verlander in tow, the Tigers made it to five postseasons and won the pennant during Verlander's rookie season of 2006. Verlander's time with the Tigers came to an end during the 2017 season, when he was traded to the Astros. Verlander in the years to come won two additional Cy Young awards with Houston. A future Hall of Famer, Verlander will enter the upcoming season with a career WAR of 82.2; 266 wins; and 3,553 strikeouts. Back with the Tigers, Verlander figures to be part of the contending rotation that's fronted by back-to-back AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal and notable free-agent addition Framber Valdez. The Tigers in 2026 will be angling to make the postseason for a third straight year, and Verlander will help stabilize a rotation that also includes Jack Flaherty and Casey Mize. Starter Reese Olson will miss the entire 2026 season after undergoing shoulder surgery earlier this month, the Tigers announced Tuesday.\nVerlander returns to Detroit with 2,373 strikeouts as a Tiger, which puts him 307 behind Mickey Lolich for the most in franchise history. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Villanova and Notre Dame are in the final stages of solidifying a monumental scheduling sacrament to begin the 2026-27 college basketball season. The Wildcats and Fighting Irish's men's and women's basketball teams have been given special clearance by the NCAA to open next season in Rome for a doubleheader on Sunday, Nov. 1, sources told CBS Sports. College basketball's official start to the season is Monday, Nov. 2, but the NCAA quietly approved a waiver in January to allow the teams a one-day head start, given the historic precedent of the games.The motivation for the overseas twinbill happens to be one of the most famous people on the planet: Pope Leo XIV.The two universities are prominent private Catholic schools with connections to the Pope. For Villanova, an obvious one: Robert Francis Prevost is a 1977 alumnus. The Notre Dame piece is tied to the school's massive global brand. Notre Dame is regarded as the most prominent Catholic institution of higher learning in the world. It also has an outpost in Rome. An avowed sports fan, the Pope also grew up in Chicago, which has a significant Notre Dame fan presence given its proximity to nearby South Bend, Indiana. (Soon after Prevost was named the most powerful man in the Catholic Church, online detectives went back and found he appeared on television during the White Sox's 2005 World Series run.)\nNotre Dame's women's program is a powerhouse with two national titles and nine Final Fours. Since 2020, Niele Ivey has been the coach. Villanova owns three national titles in men's basketball and has made the Final Four seven times, most recently in 2022 under Jay Wright. It's now coached by Kevin Willard.Villanova and Notre Dame worked in concert on arranging the game for months, sources said, with talks seriously materializing in the early fall. Paperwork has not been finalized, but both schools are moving forward with the expectation that one of college basketball's most ambitious scheduling ideas in recent memory will transpire on the first day of November.Fox is on board to broadcast both games, per sources, with the doubleheader scheduled to play out in the afternoon in Rome. That means breakfast-time basketball in the United States. While final details are still being worked through, the general plan is to have Villanova-Notre Dame lead into NFL coverage on Fox in the United States on that Sunday. The women's game is planned to air afterward on Fox Sports 1. \nStarting a season in a foreign country isn't unprecedented: Women's college basketball opened this past season in Paris with Duke playing Baylor. On the men's side, Villanova and Notre Dame is believed to be the first season-opener on foreign soil and the first regular season Division I basketball competition in Italy.The teams will play the doubleheader at the Palazzetto dello Sport, known more colloquially as the PalaTiziano. The arena seats 3,500 people for basketball games and has existed since the late 1950s. It was built in the lead-up to Rome's hosting of the 1960 Olympics. The PalaTiziano underwent significant renovations from 2018-2023 and is approximately 30 minutes from the Pope's residence in Vatican City. The Pope's involvement in the event — if any — is unclear and very much to be determined, according to sources, though officials from both schools have been in contact with the Pope and people around the Holy See. Notre Dame's president and others had a private meeting with the Supreme Pontiff in November, while Villanova had officials fly to the Vatican last May to see Pope Leo's inaugural mass. Villanova's president, Rev. Peter M. Donohue, was not in the same class as Prevost in the 1970s, but the two did overlap as undergrads at VU.\nThe schools intend to make the trip not just about basketball, but a huge educational experience as well. Rome, which surrounds Vatican City, is a destination for millions of devout Catholics and tourists every year. And come November, should all go to plan, it will play host to a global American sporting event.\n            ",

I'm working hard to build up my strength and stamina to get back into golf shape before competing on the PGA Tour. Can't wait to get out there with the guys!\"Thomas' last PGA Tour start came at the 2025 Procore Championship, a FedEx Cup Fall event utilized by Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley to sharpen up his team before it competed against the Europeans.\nThe 16-time PGA Tour winner is coming off a 2025 season in which he broke a winless drought that stretched back to the 2022 PGA Championship. Thomas defeated Andrew Novak in a playoff at the RBC Heritage to claim the signature event one week after the Masters. He is currently ranked No. 12 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\"Recovery has gone well,\" Thomas shared on X in January. \"I'm slowly building back my strength and conditioning in the gym, and also hitting wedges/short irons. Little victories and patience have been the biggest part of the process. Taking it slow and listening to how I'm feeling each day!\n\"I'm looking to come back competitively at some point during the Florida swing. I know how important it is to get this injury behind me so that I'm only looking forward over the course of the season.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        LeBron James will miss out on making an All-NBA team for the first time since his rookie year, snapping a streak of 21 straight seasons with the Lakers superstar on an All-NBA team. James will miss his 18th game of the season on Tuesday night against the Spurs, as the 41-year-old will not play in a back-to-back due to left foot arthritis. That 18th absence for James, who didn't make his season debut until Nov. 18, means he cannot reach the NBA's 65-game minimum for awards and All-NBA voting consideration. While it would've been questionable whether James would make it this year on merit based on his current production -- 21.8 points, 6.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game -- his regular absences in his 23rd season will prevent even a strong second half of the season from getting him into the conversation. His 21-year All-NBA streak seems like it'll stand the test of time for a variety of reasons. For one, it's rare to have a player reach All-NBA status as quickly as James did in his career, making his first All-NBA team as a second-year player. It's even more rare for a player to remain at that level deep into their 30s, much less as a 40-year-old as James did last year. \n\n        \n            \n                LeBron James offers blunt assessment of Lakers after loss to Thunder: 'That's a championship team, we're not'\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe closest streak to James all-time is Kobe Bryant with 15 straight All-NBA nods, offering a good representation of how incredible LeBron's run has been. No one has ever sniffed the 20-year mark in NBA history, and it'll only get more difficult going forward. Beyond the requirement of consistent greatness for more than two decades, the same 65-game threshold that officially ended any hopes James had at a 22nd All-NBA selection makes it even more difficult for stars to maintain streaks of their own. Giannis Antetokounmpo has the longest active streak with nine straight selections, but he will also miss out this season due to too many games missed. Nikola Jokić is next with seven straight All-NBA appearances, but is also perilously close to being ineligible for voting this year after missing 16 games already this season. \nLongest All-NBA streaksPlayerSeasonsDatesLeBron James212005-2025Kobe Bryant151999-2013Karl Malone141988-2001Tim Duncan131998-2010Shaquille O'Neal131994-2006Between the rules governing eligibility and the amount of talent across the league, it's difficult to see anyone coming close to matching James' mark. Records, as they say, are meant to be broken, but it would take a truly unbelievable career for anyone to top James' All-NBA streak. That officially comes to an end and is the latest reminder that the end of the James era is nearly upon us. \n            \n    ",

The goal this time around would be to erase the sting of losing Games 6 and 7 of the World Series at home, especially after going to the ninth inning with a lead in Game 7. They lost Bo Bichette in free agency, but otherwise return a strong team for this season.And then bad news struck right at the start of spring training. Oufielder/designated hitter Anthony Santander needs left labral (shoulder) surgery and will miss five to six months, Blue Jays manager John Schneider announced Tuesday.Santander, 31, signed a five-year, $92.5 million deal with the Jays last offseason and didn't provide much in his first year. He hit .175/.271/.294 (57 OPS+) with -1.0 WAR in 54 games. He missed significant time, requiring two different stints on the injured list with left shoulder inflammation. Just because the Jays didn't get anything from Santander last season doesn't mean they weren't counting on him this time around, though. The offense lost one of its top contributors in Bichette to free agency. In looking to pick up that slack, Santander was one of the most obvious places. Now that is off the table until past the halfway point of the season. \nThird baseman Kazuma Okamoto was signed out of Japan and that's one place where the Blue Jays will look to alleviate some of the Bichette loss. Nathan Lukas and Davis Schneider are also options to see increased playing time. Santander is a switch-hitting outfielder while Lukas (left) and Schneider (right) could platoon in that now-open lineup spot. Also remember that injuries held center fielder Daulton Varsho to just 71 regular-season games last year. This is to say that while Santander was being counted on to beef up the offense, the Blue Jays have options to replace him and areas where they can still pick up the lost production from Bichette's signing with the Mets and Santander's surgery.\nThe Blue Jays won the AL East over the Yankees last season via tiebreaker, as both finished 94-68, tied for the best American League record. Baseball Prospectus released its PECOTA projections on Tuesday and essentially have the two teams in a dead heat atop the AL East again.\n            \n    ",

Klint Kubiak had quite the season as Seattle's offensive coordinator, but different challenges await him in Sin City.Not only do the Raiders have a decision to make with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and a whopping $90-plus million to spend in free agency, but they have an important matter to take care of on the home front. There is considerable noise centered around the future of star pass rusher Maxx Crosby. Does he want out of Vegas, and could the Raiders consider trading him? Kubiak was asked about Crosby during his introductory press conference, and he revealed that Crosby was actually the first player in the building working out on Tuesday. The coach was able to grab a cup of coffee and speak with him. \"We want him to be a part of our success going forward, theres no doubt about that,\" Kubiak said. \"He's one of the best players in the NFL. That's a no-brainer, to get to work with Maxx and see him continue to have success with this organization.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Raiders hire Klint Kubiak: Seahawks OC lands Las Vegas job after Super Bowl win\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFox Sports' Jay Glazer believes Crosby's time with the Raiders is over, while NFL Media reported recently that Crosby has not requested a trade, and is in a \"great place\" with the team. It was Glazer who initially reported that Crosby was not happy with the franchise's decision to shut him down for the season in December due to a knee injury to the point where it was going to cause the five-time Pro Bowler to reevaluate his future with the organization.Crosby completed interviews with the media during Super Bowl week while wearing Raiders gear and has previously presented himself as loyal to the franchise that selected him in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft out of Eastern Michigan. But Kubiak is the sixth different head coach Crosby has had to meet in his seven NFL seasons. The Raiders have put together just one winning season during Crosby's time with the franchise, so maybe he's ready for a change of scenery. It's up to Kubiak to sell him on his vision for the future, and that he's the coach to get the Raiders on the right track. \nIf Crosby were to be traded, it would be a blockbuster deal that resembles the Micah Parsons trade the NFL world witnessed last offseason. Since entering the league, Crosby has recorded the most tackles for loss (133), the fifth-most QB hits (164) and sixth-most sacks (69.5) while playing the most snaps among all defensive linemen (6,112). \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Some might call it the miss of the season. Chelsea's Cole Palmer had an opportunity to send the Blues to victory on Tuesday against Leeds and greatly boost their Champions League qualification chances, but he missed a shot in the final seconds that you would not believe in a disappointing 2-2 draw.Palmer's shot went over the bar from right in front of goal, missing everything, with a wide-open net in front of him. For a player whose nickname is \"Cold Palmer,\" the ice was not in his veins in the final moments, and with Chelsea in fifth place, only five points ahead of Liverpool and Brentford, who are currently outside the Champions League race but have a game in hand, it could be quite a result in the race for European soccer next season. \nDespite the miss versus Leeds United being a 0.87 xG miss for Palmer, theoretically easier than his 0.79 xG penalty kick that he slotted home, it isn't saying that it's a major issue (xG is a stat that estimates how likely a shot is to become a goal between zero and one). Palmer's return from injury does make Chelsea more dangerous as a team, but with Joao Pedro in the middle, they need his creative touch as much as his scoring touch. Palmer's assist to the Brazilian in the first half was his first of the season after securing eight last season for Chelsea, and even during the Club World Cup, it was his assists that drove the Blues to the final. It's still early days under new coach Liam Rosenior, and Chelsea are functioning better as a team than they did under Enzo Maresca, but there's still work to do.  Chelsea were cruising in the match until Moises Caicedo conceded a penalty with a challenge on Jayden Bogle before Lucas Nemcha's shot from the spot beat Robert Sanchez for a goal. Seven minutes later, Noah Okafor was turning the ball into the back of the net to secure a true smash and grab result for Leeds, who, in their own right, have been getting results to get away from the relegation zone as they're now safe by six points over 18th-placed West Ham United. Just the xG for both teams shows how far ahead Chelsea were, but taking a look at this race chart below showing the xG progression of the game, it drives home how lopsided of a match this was.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Chelsea created plenty of chances, and with Palmer having eight Premier League goals and one assist, he's been everywhere when healthy for Chelsea, but five of those goals have also come from the penalty spot, as Chelsea being adept while dribbling gives Palmer plenty of chances to score from the spot. Here's a look at his shot map with penalties:\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            And another look without them, where there's a drastic difference and more misses from the center of the box than one would expect. No extra credit for spotting which one of the large black circles came against Leeds with a chance to win.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            It seemed like the Blues were in the driver's seat for a Champions League spot, but matches like this one are a reminder that on any given day, upsets can happen in soccer, but with an FA Cup match facing Hull City and a home match hosting Burnley coming up, there will be time for the Blues to get this one out of their system before a critical March 1 tie with Arsenal that will have serious implications not only on the top four, but also on the Premier League title race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama will play the remainder of the 2025-26 season without big man Charles Bediako after a judge denied his motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. Bediako, who returned to Alabama after signing an NBA contract and playing in the G League, appeared in five games for the Crimson Tide.Speaking for the first time since the ruling on Monday, Alabama coach Nate Oats weighed in on the decision.\"Super disappointed in the ruling for Charles,\" Oats said on Tuesday. \"Regardless of the ruling, we are going to continue to support him anyway we possibly can here. With the team, we have to move forward. We played 18 games before he got here. Some real quality wins without him. ... Sad situation for him, but we have to move forward and continue to help him however we can.\"Bediako, who played for the Crimson Tide for two seasons before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft, averaged 10.0 points. 4.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in his second stint with the team. Before joining the Crimson Tide, he was a fixture in the G League, playing for the Austin Spurs (San Antonio's G League affiliate), Grand Rapids Gold, and, most recently, the Motor City Cruise. \n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Bediako in the rotation, Alabama went 3-2 with wins over Auburn, Texas A&M and Missouri. Oats defended and doubled down on the decision when asked if it was worth bringing him back to Alabama, despite him playing in just five games.\n\"There was an opportunity to help one of our former players out,\" Oats said. \"He was within his five-year window. He's trying to get his degree. Here's the thing too. My job as a head coach is to try to do the right thing by our guys. Charles is one of our guys. That was the right thing to do by one of our guys. ... We're going to continue to help his basketball development. We're going to continue to help his development as a student, as a student-athlete. 100% it was worth it. I would do the same thing 100 times out of 100 for any of our guys.\"With Bediako out, Alabama could rely on Bucknell transfer Noah Williamson for more minutes at the center position. Williamson has appeared in 21 games this season and is averaging just under nine minutes per game. Oats also mentioned the possibility of going with smaller lineups, with Taylor Bol Bowen at center.\"He's going to need to get back to playing hard and giving us great effort,\" Oats said of Williamson. \"You look back to what he was able to do in the Kentucky game, when big Aidan [Sherrell] went out with the injury. He's going to have to give us those types of minutes moving forward. We can also go small.\"\nAlabama will play its first game without Bediako since the ruling on Wednesday against Ole Miss. The Crimson Tide are on the No. 4 seed line in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections.\n            ",

Havenstein, who missed several games in 2025 due to injury, spent his entire career with the Rams, who selected him in the second round of the 2015 NFL Draft. \"Thank you to all my teammates, coaches, and fans who have supported me and helped me over these past 11 years,\" Havenstein wrote on social media. \"I have had the time of my life with the Los Angeles Rams (formerly known as the St. Louis Rams) and can't thank the whole organization enough for giving me a shot back in 2015... As this chapter ends, I couldn't be more grateful, hopeful and excited to see what comes next!\" Havenstein, a product of Wisconsin, started 13 games at right tackle as a rookie -- while the Rams were still located in St. Louis -- and held that spot for the majority of his career. He was a member of the PFWA All-Rookie Team while blocking for former Rams running back Todd Gurley, who earned 2015 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. \nHavenstein maintained his spot at right tackle in 2017 when the Rams hired coach Sean McVay, who took Los Angeles to its first of two consecutive NFL playoff appearances in his first season with the franchise. With McVay leading the charge, Havenstein was a starter for the Los Angeles teams that won four NFC West titles, two NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was in the lineup for Los Angeles' first seven games in 2025 but was placed on injured reserve in November due to knee and ankle bursitis. Havenstein was on the last year of a three-year, $34.5 million contract extension during the 2025 season. \n            \n    ",

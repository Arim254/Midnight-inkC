Once Olivia Borsutzki and Esra Kurban realized two cars had been swallowed by the concrete while waiting at a red light, they left their respective vehicles to help those trapped.\"I was still in the car and I saw a man in a hole,\" Borsutzki told On3. \"I was like, 'I need to help.' Nobody was helping.\" When a sedan and pickup truck surprisingly sunk into the earth, the vehicles closest to the sinkhole backed away in case the hole expanded. Borsutzki and Kurban did the opposite and ran towards the danger to help the trapped drivers. Authorities said no one was injured during this wild incident, but check out what happened, here:\nThe Metropolitan Utilities District said that \"it is too early to attribute the cause to any single source,\" according to KETV, but the incident also included a water main break.Borsutzki said that after the clip went viral, her teammates and Omaha staff began to recognize her and Kurban. Borsutzki also said her strength coach texted her, \"Very strong, big dog.\"\"My dad told me that could have been really bad … ,\" Borsutzki said. \"In the moment it was just adrenaline. We just wanted to help.\"\nIt was a good week for the Omaha Mavericks, as they defeated Oral Roberts on Wednesday, 84-75. It was a historic victory in which freshman Regan Juenemann dropped 40 points, while Sarai Estupiñan scored 30 points. There was also Avril Smith, who grabbed a whopping 23 rebounds. According to OptaSTATS, this Omaha trio was the first NBA, WNBA and Division I men's or women's trio to include a 40-point scorer, a 30-point scorer and a player that recorded 20 rebounds in a single game in the last 15 years.\n            \n",

The schedule is as follows:Friday: TE and DBSaturday: QB, RB and WRSunday: OLIn the morning, players log official measurements, including height, weight, wingspan, arm length and hand size. In the afternoon, they participate in on-field testing -- including the 40-yard dash, vertical and broad jumps, and bench press -- before wrapping up with positional drills inside Lucas Oil Stadium.The festivities kicked off Thursday with defensive linemen, edge rushers and linebackers. Much of the day's discussion centered on Rueben Bain Jr.'s historically short arms, but once workouts began, attention shifted to the top prospects not named Bain, who elected not to work out. (Other top prospects to sit out included Peter Woods, Akheem Mesidor and CJ Allen.)Ohio State EDGE Arvell Reese -- the No. 3 prospect in CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner's rankings -- performed like a bona fide top-five pick, as did Ohio State LB Sonny Styles (No. 10) and Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey (No. 19).Now attention turns to defensive backs and tight ends on Friday. While Tennessee's Jermod McCoy and LSU's Mansoor Delane -- two of Renner's top three cornerbacks in this class -- will not participate, expect other first-round talents like Ohio State's Caleb Downs (No. 7), Clemson's Avieon Terrell (No. 11) and Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq (No. 29) to showcase their unique skill sets.As combine week rolls along, we've got you covered with every official measurement and testing number as they come in from Indianapolis.\nEDGE measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanRueben Bain Jr.Miami6-2 ¼2639⅛30⅞77⅜Arvell ReeseOhio State6-4 ⅛2419½32½79½David BaileyTexas Tech6-3 ½25110¼33⅝79⅝Cashius HowellTexas A&M6-2 ½2539¼30¼74¼Akheem MesidorMiami6-32591032⅛78⅝R Mason ThomasOklahoma6-2 ¼2418⅞31⅝78⅛T.J.

His 77⅜-inch wingspan isn't ideal, either; only 19 edge rushers in the MockDraftable database (since 1999) have measured shorter. Bain will still be a first-round pick -- likely in the top 10 — but teams with strict length thresholds could be wary of those numbers.Cashius Howell, Mike Renner's No. 24 prospect in this class, has even shorter arms than Bain at 30¼ inches -- the shortest of any edge rusher since 1999, per MockDraftable. However, the reigning SEC Defensive Player of the Year doesn't believe his historically short arms will prevent him from being productive in the NFL. \"Those are just the cards that I've been dealt,\" Howell said during Wednesday's podium session. \"I'm going to do everything in my power to perfect my technique and perfect my craft in whatever way possible.\"\n        \n            \n                Can star Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. overcome physical limitations?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEDGE testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Rueben Bain Jr.Miami (FL)------------Arvell ReeseOhio State4.461.58--------David BaileyTexas Tech4.501.623510-9----Cashius HowellTexas A&M4.591.5832.59-7----Akheem MesidorMiami (FL)------------R Mason ThomasOklahoma4.671.63--------T.J.

He reminded everyone of his NFL potential with a strong showing at the Senior Bowl, then followed that up with impressive combine measurables, including an 85¾-inch wingspan — the longest among combine defensive tackles since 1999. He also posted 98th percentile height (6-foot-6 ¼), 89th percentile weight (327 pounds), 94th percentile hand size (10⅞ inches) and 94th percentile arm length (35 inches). Banks has a good chance to go in the back half of Round 1.\nFlorida State's Darrell Jackson Jr. has 11-inch hands, tied for the largest at the combine since at least 2014.ConcernsClemson's Peter Woods entered the 2025 season as a potential top-five pick, but an inconsistent fall -- despite earning first-team All-ACC honors -- pushed him out of that conversation. While Woods remains a first-round talent, some of his measurables disappointed, including fourth-percentile arm length (31¼ inches) and 10th-percentile wingspan (76⅜ inches). Woods also did not participate in on-field drills at the combine. He'll look to show off his skill set at Clemson's pro day on March 12.DL testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Peter WoodsClemson------------Lee HunterTexas Tech5.181.7921.58-4----Kayden McDonaldOhio State------------Keldric FaulkAuburn359-9----Christen MillerGeorgia------------Caleb BanksFlorida5.051.76329-6----Jaishawn BarhamMichigan4.641.613310-3----Chris McClellanMissouri5.051.8029.59-0----Rayshaun BennyMichigan------------Domonique OrangeIowa State------------Dontay CorleoneCincinnati------------Nick BarrettSouth Carolina5.101.7031.59-0--4.91Darrell Jackson Jr.Florida State------------LT OvertonAlabama4.871.70--------Kaleb ProctorSE Louisiana4.791.69339-5--4.71Tim KeenanAlabama5.311.84308-4----Zxavian HarrisOle Miss------------Skyler Gill-HowardTexas Tech------------Gracen HaltonOklahoma4.821.7036.59-6--4.79DeMonte CapehartClemson4.851.7233.58-11----Albert RegisTexas A&M4.881.72349-8--4.85Tyler OnyedimTexas A&M----329-3--Bryson EasonTennessee5.091.7830.59-4--5.00Brandon ClevelandNC State5.121.78--------David GustaKentucky4.881.6832------Zane DurantPenn State4.751.6633.59-4----Damonic WilliamsOklahoma------------Gary Smith IIIUCLA----28------Cameron BallArkansas5.131.79329-1--4.76Bobby Jamison-TravisAuburn------------Deven EasternMinnesota----27.59-4----Jackie MarshallBaylor4.881.69------4.68\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top DL/EDGE prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLB measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanSonny StylesOhio State6-52441032⅞80⅞Anthony HillTexas6-22389⅝32⅜79Jake GoldayCincinnati6-4 ½2399½31⅞76⅞Josiah TrotterMissouri6-223710¼32¼--CJ AllenGeorgia6-0 ¾23010⅛31½75½Kyle LouisPittsburgh6-02209½31¼--Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech6-12319¼30⅞--Lander BartonUtah6-52339½32¼--Harold Perkins Jr.LSU6-12238⅛31⅜--Red MurdockBuffalo6-223210⅜31--Keyshaun ElliottArizona State6-22319¼31¼--Deontae LawsonAlabama6-32269¼31⅞--Bryce BoettcherOregon6-1233930⅝--Taurean YorkTexas A&M5-112268⅜30--Jimmy RolderMichigan6-2 ½2389⅝30½--Aiden FisherIndiana6-12329½31⅛--Wade WoodazClemson6-32361032⅝--Jack KellyBYU6-22409⅛31⅛--Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU6-2234931½--Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M6-22319¼32--Justin JeffersonAlabama6-02231031⅝--Xavian SoreyArkansas6-22289⅝31⅝--Namdi ObiazorTCU6-322910½30⅝--Owen HeineckeOklahoma6-1 ½2279⅝30⅛--Kendal DanielsOklahoma6-52429½32⅝--Eric GentryUSC6-722110½35--Karson ShararIowa6-1 ⅝23110⅛31⅛--Wesley BissaintheMiami6-22259⅝31⅞--LB testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Sonny StylesOhio State4.461.5643.511-2Anthony HillTexas4.511.583710-5Jake GoldayCincinnati4.621.603910-5Josiah TrotterMissouri----CJ AllenGeorgia----Kyle LouisPittsburgh4.531.5839.510-9Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech4.571.6038.510-1Lander BartonUtah----Harold Perkins Jr.LSU----Red MurdockBuffalo----Keyshaun ElliottArizona State----3810-5Deontae LawsonAlabama----Bryce BoettcherOregon----Taurean YorkTexas A&M----Jimmy RolderMichigan----369-11Aiden FisherIndiana----Wade WoodazClemson----Jack KellyBYU4.571.613710-5Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU4.471.594010-4Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M----Justin JeffersonAlabama4.571.6038.510-5Xavian SoreyArkansas4.631.6637.510Namdi ObiazorTCU4.531.56379-11Owen HeineckeOklahoma4.621.6234.59-11Kendal DanielsOklahoma----Eric GentryUSC----Karson ShararIowa4.561.594010-3Wesley BissaintheMiami--\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top LB prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFriday: TE and DB measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.Saturday: QB, RB and WR measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.\nSunday: OL measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.\n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\nThe Houston Rockets have been an average team on the road this season but have had a good amount of success of late, winning five of their last six away games. They've also played well overall, going 13-6 over their past 19 contests.Houston (36-21) has a tough task at hand on Thursday as it visits the Kia Center to take on the Orlando Magic (31-26) at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Magic own one of the best home records in the Eastern Conference at 17-9, and they enter this matchup having won eight of their last 12 overall contests.Orlando has struggled against the Rockets of late, losing each of their last four meetings. One of those defeats took place on Nov. 16 in Houston, where the Magic squandered a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter and went on to drop a 117-113 overtime decision as superstar Kevin Durant scored a game-high 35 points while Alperen Sengun was one of three Rockets to record a double-double with 30 points and 12 rebounds.Nine other games are on Thursday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Charlotte Hornets (28-31) and Indiana Pacers (15-44) at 7 p.m. ET at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The Pacers are in the midst of a four-game losing streak but have won three consecutive meetings with the Hornets, including a pair earlier this season.The NHL has 12 games on its slate, one of which has the Carolina Hurricanes (36-15-6) hosting the red-hot Tampa Bay Lightning (38-14-4) at 7 p.m. ET at the Lenovo Center in Raleigh, N.C. in a clash between division leaders. The Lightning, who are two points ahead of the Hurricanes for first place in the Eastern Conference, have won six straight contests and improved to 20-1-1 over their last 22 with Wednesday's 4-2 home victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Meanwhile, Carolina has won three in a row and earned points in 15 of its past 16 games (12-1-3).A packed college basketball schedule features a Big Ten Conference showdown between No. 13 Michigan State (22-5) and No. 8 Purdue (22-5) at 8 p.m. ET at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Ind. The Boilermakers have won seven consecutive meetings against the Spartans at Mackey Arena and nine of their last 11 overall clashes.The Rockets are 2.5-point favorites against the Magic in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Hornets are 12.5-point favorites over the Pacers. The Hurricanes are -147 on the money line against the Lightning and Purdue is a 7.5-point favorite against Michigan State.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Feb. 26. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchHornets at PacersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Indianapolis | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Over 229.5 (-109)The Hornets are in the top half of the NBA in scoring with an average of 115.9 points, and produced 129 and 131 in their last two games. Indiana is one of the worst defensive teams in the league as it is allowing 119.2 points per game. These clubs combined for 262 points in their last meeting and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see them having much difficulty scoring on Thursday as the Over hits in more than 68% of its simulations.Rockets at MagicTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Orlando | TV: Prime Video\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Rockets -150 | Expert: Alperen Sengun Under 35.5 points + assists +rebounds (-112, PropBetGuy)The Rockets have won five of their last seven contests and easily could be entering this matchup with a seven-game winning streak as they lost 105-102 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 11 on a three-point play with two seconds remaining and squandered an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter of a 108-106 setback against the New York Knicks last Saturday. While Orlando has won six of its last eight games, it has lost four consecutive meetings with Houston. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Rockets will extend that streak as its simulations have them winning 68% of the time. SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (107-76, +1867 on his last 183 NBA player prop picks) doesn't think Sengun will come close to duplicating the performance he had Wednesday against the Sacramento Kings (26 points, 11 assists, 13 rebounds) as the Houston center has gone Under his projected PRA line for Thursday's contest in 12 of his last 16 outings.NHL best bets, where to watchLightning at HurricanesTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Raleigh, N.C. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 6.5 (+108) | Expert: Hurricanes -149 (Matt Severance)The Lightning and Hurricanes are among the top eight offensive teams in the NHL, with the former ranking third with 199 goals and the latter tied for seventh with 193. They also are two of the top five defensive clubs in the league, but they combined for 10 goals in their first meeting this season. Tampa Bay has netted at least four tallies in five consecutive games and six of its last seven, and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't feel the squads will have trouble scoring on Thursday as the Over hits in almost 60% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (39-15, +1744 on his last 54 NHL money line picks involving Carolina) likes the Hurricanes to extend their winning streak to four games and end Tampa Bay's at six. The Lightning likely will have backup Jonas Johansson in the crease after Andrei Vasilevskiy played against Toronto on Wednesday and Carolina couldn't be fresher as it has been idle for three weeks. CBB best bets, where to watchNo. 13 Michigan State at No. 8 PurdueTime: 8 p.m. | Location: West Lafayette, Ind. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 142.5 (-110) | Expert: Purdue -3.5 first half (-115, Chip Patterson)Both squads are in the top half of the 18-team Big Ten Conference in scoring, as the Boilermakers rank third with an average of 82.9 points and the Spartans are ninth at 78.4 per game. Three of Purdue's last four contests have gone Over the projected total for Thursday's showdown, while six consecutive Michigan State games did the same prior to the team's last outing. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think points will be at a premium in this matchup as its simulations have the Over hitting more than 71% of the time. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson (4-1, +295 on his last five college basketball game prop picks) sees Purdue going into intermission with at least a four-point lead as Michigan State has trailed by double digits at halftime in each of its last three conference road games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Premier League chief executive Richard Masters warned that the sport \"cannot rely\" on star players to maintain their level of performance amid an expanding football calendar that he believes leaves domestic competitions in need of protection.Star players such as Chelsea's Cole Palmer, described as shattered by the head of English footballers' union, find themselves in a position where they may be playing in major tournaments in three straight summers, the 2026 World Cup coming on the back of a Club World Cup in the United States last summer and the European Championships in the previous year.During the regular season, the toll on top talent has been somewhat increased by the addition of at least two more games for clubs competing in the Champions League and Europa League, to say nothing of the strain placed on those who compete in an even more competitive Premier League. \"The players at the top level play an enormous number of football matches, and we cannot rely on them to keep performing at the level we want them to,\" said Masters at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. \"What I never want [is] any of our clubs [thinking] that the Premier League isn't their number one priority or for the players to fill the Premier League isn't the number one priority, because they have too many other matches to distract them. 'I'm gonna take a breather this week. I'm prioritizing myself for another competition.' \n\"At the moment, the Premier League is number one, I believe, for all of our clubs, and that's what keeps it strong. We want that to remain the case, both in terms of the managers, the shareholders, and also the players.\"The expansion of European games has had a knock-on effect on an English football calendar that already allowed itself little room for maneuver with logistical nightmares created in recent seasons when those competing on the continent go deep in the EFL Cup. In April 2024, English Football Association was also forced to scrap replays in the FA Cup from the first round onwards, the governing body specifically citing UEFA competitions as a contributory factor to the decision.For Masters' part, he noted that it has become increasingly difficult to schedule Premier League games around clubs' other involvement. That reality is not aided by the remarkable success of England on the continent. At the time of writing, all nine clubs that qualified for the competitions are still active, including six of the remaining 16 teams in the Champions League.\n\"It's a serious concern,\" said Masters of the expanding calendar. \"What we're seeing is continued expansion of regional and international football. In the last 2 years alone, we've seen the relaunching of the UC3 programme with many more European games our clubs are on our participating in. We've seen a Club World Cup launched and we're seeing a much bigger World Cup this summer. All of those decisions, many are unconsulted on, particularly at FIFA level. [With] UEFA, we have that dialogue, not so we agree with all of it, and we're now starting to feel some of that. \"It is incredibly hard to schedule the Premier League to meet all of our broadcast obligations, to keep all of our clubs happy at the same time, as accommodating nine clubs in Europe. It's a real problem. Um, so we have to be aware of that and we have to work very closely ... with UEFA or you have to stay close as leagues because these don't just impact the Premier League, they impact on all of us.\"Domestic competitions need protection. We're going to see the new expanding World Cup in all of its glory. We're looking forward to that. The World Cup is a great thing. Obviously, it's become controversial. We're gonna see how it's all gonna pan out over the summer.\"\nMasters' concerns were echoed by Maheta Molango, chair of English footballers' union, the PFA, and a vice-president on its worldwide counterpart FIFPRO. He specifically cited the case of Palmer, who has been limited to 19 of a possible 42 club games this season as he battles with groin issues and a broken toe. In the previous season, Palmer played 4,247 minutes across 52 matches for Chelsea alone in a season that ran from August 18 2024 to July 13 the following year and the Club World Cup final. That in itself had begun barely a month after a European Championships in which Palmer scored in the final.Molango revealed that he had visited Chelsea's training camp soon after their Club World Cup exertions and that the club had seemed \"shattered.\" \"This is just the reality,\" he said. \"You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.\n\"People say he's a millionaire, yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg, and [we have] come to a stage where you know, 'I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream.' The reality is that the fans pay right now 100% of the ticket [price], and a lot of time they get 70% if they're lucky of the show or 60% because players start regulating themselves.\"The Premier League is the best product in terms of football, they make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity. Christmas is nice because it's not every Tuesday and I think we need to discover that because we thought in football that more is more. Sometimes less is more.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Royal Rumble in the rear-view mirror, there's only one path to a world championship match at WrestleMania, and that path is winning the Elimination Chamber. The event takes place on Saturday at United Center in Chicago.Six men and six women will enter the Elimination Chamber, with the winners of the men's and women's matches earning their shot at a world title. With men's Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns already choosing world heavyweight champion CM Punk and women's winner Liv Morgan selecting women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer, that leaves WWE champion Drew McIntyre and WWE women's champion Jade Cargill for the Elimination Chamber winners.There are also a pair of title matches set for the Elimination Chamber card, with CM Punk putting his world heavyweight title -- and spot as a WrestleMania headliner -- on the line against Finn Balor, and Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenging Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental championship.\n        \n            \n                Drew McIntyre reacts to WWE scrapping John Cena match at Crown Jewel: 'I can't change the creative direction'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's take a look at who the CBS Sports experts believe will emerge victorious on Saturday in Chicago.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsMen's Elimination Chamber Match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Jey Uso: Many times, picking a winner in a match like this comes down to eliminating who wouldn't be a winner. Evans and Williams aren't currently at the level where they'll be going one-on-one for a world championship at WrestleMania. Orton is a legend, but not one who is in a place where he makes sense as a WrestleMania headliner in 2026. Uso isn't going to have a second consecutive world title match at WrestleMania, and he is a tag champion anyway, giving him other things to be doing. That leaves Knight and Rhodes, only one of whom has an ongoing issue -- which some may say has been ongoing for far too long -- with McIntyre. That makes the outcome seem fairly obvious. Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)Women's Elimination Chamber Match -- Tiffany Stratton vs. Rhea Ripley vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: The winner of this match will challenge WWE women's champion Jade Cargill at WrestleMania. Those stakes help narrow the field. The champ looks like a box office star, so WWE should pick a challenger with star power and experience. Asuka and Cargill are both heels, and while that sometimes works, it doesn't gel well here. Bliss fits the bill, but she's more interesting teaming with Charlotte Flair. Ripley vs. Cargill screams WrestleMania, a collision between two of WWE's most powerful women. Ripley's status as women's tag team champion complicates things, but there's more upside here than retreading Cargill vs. Stratton. Pick: Ripley wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)World Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: It's nice to see Balor positioned like a major player once again, and equally nice that it is signaling the end of his time in Judgment Day, but there's just no way WWE pivots from Punk vs. Reigns at WrestleMania to Balor vs. Reigns. It was nice to see WWE finally bring up the bizarre ending to Balor vs. Reigns at Extreme Rules 2021, but that's not enough foundation for a WrestleMania main event. Pick: CM Punk retains the title -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)\nWomen's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk will smooth things over for Chicago after a rough start for their adopted hero Lee. The women's intercontinental champion needs a successful title defense, especially with the potential for another showdown at WrestleMania. Lee has wrestled twice in 10 years, beating Lynch in WarGames and a mixed tag team match with their husbands. Expect Lynch to steal a victory through nefarious means ahead of a one-on-one rematch in Las Vegas. Pick: Lynch retains the title -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's new league year doesn't open until Wednesday, March 11 at 4 p.m. ET. That's when teams can officially sign free agents and complete trades – but trades certainly can be agreed upon at any time and one actually has been on Thursday, Feb. 26 between the Jets and Titans. One of the big stories in the NFL this week was regarding the status of Eagles Pro Bowl wideout A.J. Brown and whether he returns to the City of Brotherly Love. We have odds from DraftKings Sportsbook on his next team.Bet on the NFL at DraftKings and get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:You likely remember during the 2022 NFL Draft when the Eagles got Brown from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for the 18th and 101st overall picks. That was an utter heist for Philly as the Titans took wideout Treylon Burks at No. 18 and he was a major bust and isn't even with the franchise anymore.Following the trade, Brown signed a four-year, $100 million extension with $57 million guaranteed. And he has been worth it with four straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving, the first Eagles player to accomplish that feat. He's also had at least seven touchdown grabs in each season.Brown clearly grew unhappy last season when the Philadelphia offense struggled as a whole, and his numbers were down a bit. The Eagles finished with their lowest scoring average (22.3), yards per game (311.2) and rush yards per game (116.9) under Nick Sirianni. Thanks to its defense, Philly had six wins while finishing with less than 300 yards of offense. Those were the most such wins in that scenario since the 2007 Chicago Bears. The Eagles had three wins when scoring fewer than 20 points, their most such since 2007.Brown had zero receptions in a half seven times last season. That happened just once in 2024. He was clearly angry on the sidelines multiple times and there were a few arguments to be seen on TV with Sirianni and others as Brown openly expressed his frustration with the offensive operation. He reportedly was shopped ahead of the trade deadline, but the Eagles weren't going to just give the 28-year-old away as they still thought they were contenders to repeat as Super Bowl champions.This week, Sirianni said at the NFL Combine that he wanted Brown back next season but neither he nor general manager Howie Roseman committed to that. Roseman said the team would entertain trade offers for Brown.\"Will A.J. be here next season? I think we're still in a spot, like, I can't guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I'm thinking I'm going to be the coach next season, but you can't guarantee anything past tomorrow,\" Sirianni said.  The Eagles would absorb a dead cap hit of over $40 million if they dealt Brown before June 1, compared with less than $20 million if a trade is consummated after that date -- thus, we probably don't see anything happen at least before the draft. The team acquiring Brown would be responsible for his $29 million salary in 2026.Sportsbooks word these player prop futures differently. Some will phrase it as \"Which is A.J. Brown's next team if not the Eagles?\" DraftKings simply asks for Brown's team for next season and includes Philly as the -175 favorite. However, it feels like there's too much smoke there for Brown to return.A.J. Brown next team odds (via DraftKings)Eagles -175Patriots +275Chargers +700Bills +900Titans +1000Raiders +1400Ravens +160049ers +1800Dolphins +1800New England is the clear non-Eagles favorite at +275 and that makes so much sense. For one thing, you know the Eagles would like to ship Brown out of the NFC so he can't torment them in a future postseason. Secondly, the Pats badly need playmakers at wideout, which was made very evident in the blowout loss to Seattle in Super Bowl 60.  Brown began his NFL career with current Pats coach Mike Vrabel in Tennessee and they are still tight. So if Brown has a say in the matter, this marriage makes a lot of sense.Bet NFL futures at FanDuel and get $100 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:Veteran Stefon Diggs had a solid year for the Pats and became the team's first 1,000-yard receiver since Julian Edelman in 2019, but he might be released for salary cap reasons. Diggs will see his base salary increase from $2.9 million in 2025 to $20.6 million in 2026 and 2027. His salary cap number jumps from $10.5 million last year to $26.5 million in each of the next two seasons. The 32-year-old really isn't worth that these days. On Monday when I first saw these odds, the Los Angeles Chargers weren't near the top of the board at +2000 but are now +700 as there is currently two times more handle and bets on the Bolts than the next most-wagered club. Justin Herbert has one good wideout in Ladd McConkey, but he's more of a possession guy and not the red-zone threat the 6-2, 225-pound Brown is. Los Angeles has a ton of cap space and wideout Keenan Allen is a free agent.Buffalo (+900) needs a No. 1 wideout more than New England does and obviously trading for Brown would keep him from its AFC East rivals. Since Diggs left Buffalo after the 2023 season, the Bills have not had a receiver cross the 1,000-yard mark.  Would the Eagles accept the Bills' first-round pick sitting at No. 26 overall as adequate compensation?Tennessee (+1000), Las Vegas (+1400) and Miami (+1800) seem like non-starters as all are light years from contention, so why bother giving up assets for a 28-year-old? The Dolphins have risen from +1000 since Monday.Baltimore (+1600) and San Francisco (+1800) offer contending situations. Adding Brown to Zay Flowers (88 catches, 1,211 yards, five TDs in 2025) would give the Ravens a stellar 1-2 punch at wideout around Lamar Jackson. And Brown has a relationship with Derrick Henry from their Titans days. My value pick would be Buffalo as the Bills need to capitalize on Josh Allen's window while he's still playing at an MVP level. With the beating Allen takes due to his physical running style, a major injury could happen at any time. Brandon Beane is also under quite a bit of pressure to win in 2026 after mega-successful coach Sean McDermott was fired and Beane was kept. R.J. White has already broken down 2026 NFL win totals, and Brown likely would add a half-win to certain clubs if dealt.\n            ",

Under a new recommendation, players disqualified for targeting for the first time during the season will be allowed to play in their next game, regardless of which half the targeting penalty occurs. Under the current rule, a player disqualified in the second half of a game for targeting has to sit out the first half of the subsequent game. If the rule changes, any player disqualified for targeting for a second time during the season would miss the first half of their next game. A third disqualification for targeting would result in the offending player being suspended for their next game in full. \"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said rules subcommittee chair A.J. Edds in a statement. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n        \n            \n                NCAA to discuss targeting rule changes, could make penalty 'less punitive' for 2026 college football season\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe proposal also allows for a conference to initiate an appeals process following a player's second targeting violation. If the appeal is successful, then the player would be allowed to play both halves in their next game. \nThe proposal still has to pass both the FBS and FCS Oversight Committees before it is made official. Both committees are set to meet in March to consider rule proposals. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The opening day of on-field drills at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis presented defensive linemen, edge rushers and linebackers at Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts. Some prospects uplifted their stock with standout efforts while others caused teams to go back and look at their college film with a fine tooth comb.Here are some of the intriguing things from Thursday's on-field drills for the linebacker position, beginning with the measurements and testing numbers of the top prospects in CBS Sports' top 50 rankings, courtesy of NFL Draft analyst Mike Renner:Measurements/testing numbers for top LB prospectsMeasurement / DrillSonny Styles (Ohio State)Anthony Hill Jr. (Texas)Jake Golday (Cincinnati)Josiah Trotter (Missouri)CJ Allen (Georgia)Height6-56-26-4 ½6-26-0 ¾Weight244238239237230Hand109⅝9½10¼10⅛Arm32⅞32⅜31⅞32¼31½Wingspan80⅞7976⅞--75½40-yard dash4.464.514.62----10-yard split1.561.581.60----Vertical43.53739----Broad11-210-510-5----3-cone7.09--7.02----Short shuttle4.26--4.34----Grading top LB prospects\nGrade: A+ Ohio State first-team All-Big Ten linebacker Sonny Styles entered the combine as a projected top-10 pick, and after displaying jump-out-of-the-gym athleticism with a 43.5-inch vertical, he may be making a case to go in the top five in April, positional value be damned. NFL Media reported fellow linebackers were rooting him on and jumping in unison during his attempt. He blew away his positional peers.His 11-foot-2 broad jump put an exclamation point on his elite athleticism. Styles recorded the highest vertical jump by a player 6-foot-4 or taller since at least 2003, when NFL Network began collecting combine data.\nHis combine performance was so explosive that he tested similarly to Pro Football Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson, the artist formerly known as Megatron. \nThat helped him generate a nearly perfect Relative Athletic Score, ranking as the No. 4 linebacker in the metric since 1987.\nGrade: B+ Anthony Hill Jr. is similar to Arvell Reese as a linebacker with edge-rush experience, though he is not quite on the same level as Reese or Styles. Still, he acquitted himself well Thursday. A 4.51-second 40-yard dash at Hill's size is a strong result, and his 9.93 Relative Athletic Score reflects an excellent day in Indianapolis.\nHe remains a tier below Styles, who delivered a historic performance, but Hill's showing was strong enough to earn a B+.\nGrade: BJake Golday measured and jumped well at the combine. He did not get out of the blocks quickly in the 40-yard dash, as reflected in his early split times, but he showcased strong closing speed to finish with a 4.62. Overall, Golday helped himself Thursday.\nGrade: N/A -- Josiah Trotter opted out of doing on-field drills on Thursday. CJ Allen, Georgia: N/A\nGrade: N/A -- CJ Allen chose not to participate in on-field drills on Thursday. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top DL/EDGE prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOther standouts\nMeasurables: 6-foot-1, 231 pounds, 9¼-inch hands, 30⅞-inch armsGrade: BTexas Tech's Jacob Rodriguez was the most decorated linebacker in college football in 2025. He earned the Bronko Nagurski Award (nation's top defensive player), the Chuck Bednarik Award (defensive player of the year), the Dick Butkus Award (top linebacker), the Vince Lombardi Award (top lineman), unanimous All-American honors and Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year recognition.His tape is outstanding, and he moved smoothly during Thursday's workouts in Indianapolis, posting a 38.5-inch vertical, a 10-foot-1 broad jump and a 4.57-second 40-yard dash. Rodriguez's measurables were decent, but the way he moves -- combined with his production at Texas Tech -- earns him a B grade.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-6⅝, 221 pounds, 10½-inch hands, 35-inch arms, 86¼-inch wingspanGrade: A Eric Gentry is a certified freak. He is both the tallest linebacker and owns the largest wingspan recorded at the NFL Scouting Combine since NFL Media began tracking data in 2003.

    "body": "\n        The LPGA Tour rode a wave of momentum into the 2026 season. Commissioner Craig Kessler inked a new broadcast partnership to ensure every round of every tournament is being shown on television, and that came before the creation of WTGL -- the women's version of TGL -- which continues to see more and more commitments from some of the biggest names in the ladies' game.Outside the ropes, deals are being struck to push the women's game forward. Inside the ropes, however, the LPGA Tour is at a bit of a crossroads.There was a point in 2024 when then-world No. 1 Nelly Korda could not be caught. Literally and figuratively, the smooth-swinging right-hander was heads and shoulders above the competition. While Scottie Scheffler dominated the men's game, Korda did the same on the women's side.Korda became the third player to win five tournaments in a row on the LPGA Tour during a season in which she claimed her second major championship, seven total titles, 11 top 10 finishes in 16 starts and north of $4 million in earnings. \n\"As a golf fan, I think I like seeing a player more dominant because then you want to see what's going to happen next and you follow it,\" 10-time major winner, eight-time LPGA Tour Player of the Year and World Golf Hall of Fame member Annika Sörenstam told CBS Sports. \"I mean, there's always competitors, always somebody pushing, but I love the fact that somebody's standing out and pushing the envelope and taking the game to a different level.\"Some expected Korda to continue her run into 2025, but it never materialized. In fact, she didn't win at all. Instead, the wealth was spread among 29 different winners across the 32-event season. At the midway point, there were more winners (18) than tournaments played (17) due to a team event.\"It's great to have multiple winners because you learn different people's games, different personalities that are out there,\" said 11-time LPGA Tour winner Lexi Thompson. \"Of course, it is great to have someone go on a run like Tiger [Woods] or what Nelly did. It's great to see that, but to see different faces be part of the game and to win or get their first win is a huge moment for the game.\"\nThe last two years beg the question: Is dominance or parity better for the game? Would the LPGA Tour benefit from one of its players rising above the rest of the competition like Korda did in 2024, or is the unknown of which player will win any given week able to keep driving the sport on?With all of the improvements surrounding the actual golf being played, the 2026 season may ultimately reveal the answer. \"I think sport needs dominant players; I think sport needs a rivalry,\" said 16-year veteran Mel Reid. \"It's very easy to have rivalries with football teams, soccer teams, hockey teams, rugby teams and basketball teams. In golf, you need some sort of either rivalry or an extremely dominant player. \n\"For me, a season like last season proves that (1) there are incredible players on the LPGA and that anybody can win or the majority of players can win on any given week. (2) I think it shows the talent of the rookies and the players that are coming from Japan, for example. But, at the same time, I am like, 'Why is there not a dominant player? Why isn't power dominating the LPGA? If they really do want to shift the narrative and have a dominant player or even a rivalry, they have to look deeper into it.\"\n            ",

Although the Magic are a significantly tougher team than these two, Houston's offensive success could carry over on Thursday in Orlando. The Magic are 25-32 against the spread this season, and the Rockets are 36-21 overall entering a contest where they only need to win by two points to cover the number. Houston center Alperen Sengun had a triple-double with 26 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists on Wednesday, and he'll be a matchup nightmare against for Orlando, which returns home after a cross-country flight and a 110-109 win over the Lakers on Tuesday. The model projects the Rockets to cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Rockets at DraftKings here:Michigan State vs. Purdue: Over 142.5 total points (-105)The Over has hit in six of the last seven Michigan State games and in three of the last four Purdue contests, including back-to-back games, entering Thursday. Five of Michigan State's last seven games have gone Over 142.5 total points as well, and all three of Purdue's recent Overs had at least 143 combined points scored.

At 13-16, South Dakota State isn't all that great, but they did beat UMKC by 28 in mid-January. Expect another 20+ point blowout as we'll continue to ride the trend of fading Kansas City.\" Back South Dakota at DraftKings here:Want more NBA and college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        NBA Hall of Famer and Miami Heat legend Chris Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare. Bosh revealed Wednesday in a video posted to social media that he woke up covered in his own blood. Bosh, who is still recovering from the ordeal, said the incident occurred when he was getting ready for a date with his wife.\"Next thing you know, I was on the ground,\" Bosh said. Bosh doesn't remember anything other than waking up covered in his own blood. He declined to offer specifics about what exactly caused the medical event, but did go into further detail on his Substack, \"The Last Chip.\"\"I was walking from my closet into the bathroom, getting ready for an evening out, when my body turned on me,\" Bosh wrote. \"A numbing sensation shot down my left leg, that sharp, electric feeling you get when you bump your funny bone. Before I knew it, I was on the floor. I slowly came to in a pool of my own blood while my wife frantically spoke with 911. I tried to move my body the way I always had, and it didn't respond.\"\nBosh explained how the \"terrifying\" moment helped change his outlook on life.\n\"After coming back from the darkness, there was no euphoric clarity,\" Bosh wrote. \"... What did change was an immediate outlook on life that was simpler and more honest.\"Bosh retired from the NBA in 2019 after not having played since 2016 due to another health-related issue. Bosh suffered from recurring blood clots that cut his career short. It was first discovered in 2015, when a blood clot that started in his leg and traveled to one of his lungs ended his season after just 44 games. He returned the following season (2015-16), but a second blood clot was found, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season after playing 53 games.After several medical evaluations, Heat team doctors failed Bosh on his physical ahead of the 2016-17 decision despite his desire to play. It was determined that it would be too dangerous for him to continue his basketball career. He retired at 31, having won two championships with the Heat and earning 11 All-Star selections. In 2019, the Heat retired his jersey after playing six of his 13 years with the team. Bosh was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" and plans to use this moment to share his experiences with others.\n\"This experience motivated me to start writing again, to share my experiences and stories in the hope that we can get something out of it and grow together,\" Bosh wrote.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Team USA men's hockey star Brady Tkachuk is not fond of an AI-altered video the White House posted this week to its official TikTok account depicting him belittling Canadians. Tkachuk, who helped guide Team USA to a gold medal in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, said the disparaging remarks in the clip would \"never come out of my mouth.\"The White House's post came after President Donald Trump made what Hilary Knight, the captain of the U.S. women's hockey team, called a \"distasteful\" joke about the women's team, which also defeated Canada to win the gold in Italy.The video shows Tkachuk at a press conference at the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off and references Canadian fans booing the United States national anthem at the tournament. Tensions between the two countries were high during last February's event after Trump announced he would impose tariffs against Canada.\"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup-eating f---s a lesson,\" Tkachuk was made to say in the doctored video. \"Canada, we own you, little bro.\"\nCanada defeated the United States in the 4 Nations Face-Off final.\"It's clearly fake, because it's not my voice and not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday at an Ottawa Senators media availability. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. Can't do anything about it.\"\n        \n            \n                U.S. women's hockey team captain Hilary Knight responds to President Trump's 'distasteful' joke\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTkachuk plays professionally in Canada and said the thought of not playing north of the border has never crossed his mind. He has spent the first seven years of his NHL career in Ottawa after the Senators selected him with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 draft.A reporter asked Tkachuk if he liked the White House's video.\"It's not my voice, not what I was saying,\" Tkachuk said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video because that just would never come out of my mouth. Never thought. I'll leave it at that.\"\nTkachuk also denied that he was the individual who told Trump to \"close the northern border\" when the President called the men's hockey team after its win over Canada in Sunday's Olympic final.\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me, but if you watch the video, that's not my voice and something that I'd never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here and give everything I have here. I just think that's something that never a thought would happen in my head and especially would never say it. It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. Of course, I would never say anything like that.\"The men's hockey team attended the State of the Union address on Tuesday after receiving an invitation from Trump. The women's team declined its invitation.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        With free agency season less than two weeks away, Najee Harris' representation has provided an update on his recovery from last year's season",
    "body": "\n        With free agency season less than two weeks away, Najee Harris' representation has provided an update on his recovery from last year's season-ending Achilles injury. Harris' agent posted a video of his client running on a treadmill five months after undergoing surgery on his Achilles. While his recovery is impressive, anyone that is familiar with Harris' work ethic shouldn't be surprised. Prior to last season, Harris had never missed an NFL game. His durability allowed him to become the first player in Pittsburgh Steelers history to begin his NFL career with four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. As a rookie, Harris broke Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris' 49-year-old franchise record for rushing yards by a rookie. Harris' durability in Pittsburgh was a testament to his intense training regiment that sometimes included individually training for up to an hour after practice had concluded. One can assume that Harris' work ethic has paid dividends during his recent post-surgery rehabilitation. \nLast season, Harris played in just three games for the Chargers, who signed him to a one-year deal last offseason after the Steelers let him test the open market. Despite missing significant time last summer with an eye injury, Harris played well during his limited time on the field. He averaged a respectable 4.1 yards per carry and caught each of his three targets. \nAt 6-foot-1 and 242 pounds, Harris is a physical back who isn't afraid of contact. While he doesn't have elite speed, Harris has more than enough quickness to get to the outside. He's also an exceptional pass protector and pass-catcher; he caught a career-high 74 passes from Ben Roethlisberger during his standout rookie season. Where will Harris end up next? Here's a rundown of some possible options for the soon-to-be 28-year-old. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks Harris would make a lot of sense for Seattle if the Seahawks don't re-sign Kenneth Walker, who like Harris is also slated to hit the open market. Walker, though, will likely command a higher salary as he is coming off an MVP performance in Seattle's Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots. Walker's current projected market value is just over $36 million over four years. Harris' projected market value is one year for $2.95 million. It's conceivable that Harris would be able to mimic what Walker has brought to Seattle's offense. While Walker may be slightly more talented and versatile as a runner, Harris is a better pass-catcher. He also wouldn't have an issue sharing the workload with Zach Charbonnet after he was asked to do so in Pittsburgh with Jaylen Warren and Omarion Hampton in Los Angeles. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ers San Francisco was just 24th in the league in rushing in 2025, which was largely a byproduct of not having a more impactful complementary back alongside Christian McCaffrey. Brian Robinson Jr. averaged a solid 4.3 yards per carry, but he carried the ball just 92 times and caught just 8 of 12 targets. Harris would likely have a bigger impact if the 49ers signed him. His presence would likely help limit McCaffrey's workload, would help the 49ers possess the ball more while also taking some of the pressure off of quarterback Brock Purdy. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs Harris makes a lot of sense here with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt set to become free agents. Last year, the duo of Pacheco and Hunt ran for a combined 1,073 yards but averaged just 3.8 yards per carry. Neither one made much of an impact for Patrick Mahomes in the passing game. \nAfter starting his career with Roethlisberger, Harris would get another chance to work with a future Hall of Fame quarterback in Mahomes, who could certainly use a stable running game if he and the Chiefs want to get back to the NFL's upper echelon. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Texans Houston appears to have a promising young runner in Woody Marks, but it could use some depth behind Marks given Joe Mixon's uncertain future and Nick Chubb slated to enter free agency. With Marks playing on a rookie contract, the Texans can afford to bring in another accomplished running back. Harris' presence would not only help Marks and the running game, it would also undoubtedly help quarterback C.J. Stroud, whose lack of consistency in recent years has contributed to the Texans' inability to get beyond the AFC divisional round. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver Broncos The Broncos are looking to upgrade their running game after finishing 16th in rushing in 2025. Specifically, Denver is looking at outside options to potentially replace J.K. Dobbins, who like Harris is expected to be a free agent. Dobbins played well last season before an injury sidelined him for the season's final seven games. In Denver, Harris would complement RJ Harvey, who was just as valuable during his rookie season as a receiver than as a runner. Harris' presence would likely allow Harvey to continue to thrive in that role. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Cowboys/Cincinnati BengalsDallas and Cincinnati were lumped together because both could use depth behind their starting running backs. Javonte Williams ran for 1,201 yards last year, but no other Cowboys player ran for over 250 yards. Jaydon Blue, a 2025 fifth-round pick, had only 38 carries while playing in just five games. \nIn Cincinnati, Chase Brown eclipsed 1,000 yards rushing for the first time in his career, but Samaje Perine (382 yards) was the only other Bengals player who ran for over 45 yards. Tahj Brooks, a 2025 sixth-round pick, appeared in 16 games but carried the ball just 16 times for 45 yards. \n            ",

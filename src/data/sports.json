Bet it at bet365 here:\nOver 53 in Lions vs. BuccaneersDetroit has five players in its secondary on injured reserve, and the NFL suspended safety Brian Branch for punching Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster on Sunday night. It is going to be difficult for the Lions to slow down a Tampa Bay offense led by quarterback Baker Mayfield.

Detroit has one of the most talented offenses in the league, so SportsLine's model has the Over cashing in 58% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:Under 41 in Seahawks vs. TexansSeattle gave up 38 points to Tampa Bay two weeks ago, but it has been outstanding in its other five games, giving up 20 points or fewer in all of those contests. The Seahawks gave up just 12 points in their win at Jacksonville last week, and they will be playing in front of a raucous crowd on Monday. Houston has not given up more than 20 points in a game this season, leading the NFL with 12.2 points allowed per game.

The Buccaneers are hopeful that Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka (both battling hamstring injuries) will be able to play tonight and that certainly lends itself well to scoring.

The Seahawks have been anything but, ranking first in yards per play with an elite passing attack that has a chance to beat Houston's pass defense in a strength vs. strength matchup,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The major edge is on the other side of the ball, as the Seahawks also have an elite defense while the Texans offense looked awful prior to its uncompetitive matchups.\" Back the Seahawks at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (+110)\"Recency bias can be hard to overlook in a crucial game seven to decide who goes to the World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays have captured that with winning three out of the past four games over Seattle. In fact they had game five in their grasp as well before a five run eighth inning from the Mariners,\" SportsLine handicapper Zack Cimini said. \"The turn of events was sparked in game three by Shane Bieber but look for this Mariners team to respond as they did in the ALDS against Detroit in game five.

However, he's stepped back into a high-volume role with Irving out these past two weeks and proven that he can still produce. He's played a minimum of 77% of the snaps in the last two games and has been plied with 38 touches for 157 scrimmage yards and three scores.

However, the target volume is still there, as he's been targeted 19 times in the last two games. So far this season, he's been targeted seven times inside the 10-yard line and has six catches with five touchdowns.

However, he's clearly earned the trust of the Seattle coaching staff and new quarterback Sam Darnold in his second season, as he's already caught 17 passes for 205 yards and four touchdowns in his first six games. His 29.4% red-zone target share ranks fourth among NFL tight ends. The model predicts that he scores 0.31 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 20% chance to score.Want more Monday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Lions vs. Buccaneers and Seahawks vs. Texans.

    "body": "\n        While Aaron Rodgers has acknowledged that Sunday night's game will be different, his former coach is treating the Green Bay Packers' showdown against Rodgers' Pittsburgh Steelers like any other game.Rodgers will face his former team for the first time when the Pittsburgh hosts Green Bay on prime time. Rodgers spent his first 18 seasons with the Packers that included the last four with LaFleur as his coach. \"We're playing the Pittsburgh Steelers who happen to have Aaron Rodgers,\" LaFleur said. \"I mean, it's as simple as that. That is for you guys to talk about. \"Granted, I mean, we've got a lot of respect and love for Aaron. What he's done here. He's a Hall of Famer. I know, like our past together, we had a lot of great moments, but this game is not about that. It's about going to Pittsburgh. 'Sunday Night Football.' Our guys will be jacked up. Their guys will be jacked up. It's about the Green Bay Packers versus the Pittsburgh Steelers. And that's for you guys to talk about all those other storylines.\" When asked if he will deliver the same message to his team, LaFleur pointed out that many of the current Packers didn't even play with Rodgers during his final years in Green Bay. \n\"I'm going talk about -- just like we do every week -- what is our blueprint and what are our keys in order to go to Pittsburgh, which is a damn good football team, and a really tough, hostile environment, and try to play our best, because we haven't ... to date,\" LaFleur said. \"We've got a lot of work to do.\" \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 early odds: Aaron Rodgers, Steelers home underdogs vs. Packers; Colts 14.5-point favorite vs. rival\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRodgers aside, Sunday is big game for both teams from a positioning standpoint. Pittsburgh (4-2) is currently 1.5 games ahead of Cincinnati in the AFC North standings. Green Bay (4-1-1) had a slight lead over Detroit (4-2) entering the Lions' Monday night game against the Buccaneers. Like LaFleur, Rodgers is surely more focused on facing Green Bay's defense than he is about facing his former team. But unlike LaFleur, Rodgers -- who is already 1-0 this season against his former teams -- has openly admitted that Sunday night's game will undoubtedly be different. Rodgers did so when asked how it felt to face the Jets shortly following Pittsburgh's Week 1 win. \n\"It doesn't come close to how it's gonna feel playing Green Bay, because that was 18 years of my career,\" said Rodgers, who is hoping to join former teammate Brett Favre as former Packers legends who were able to beat their former team. \n            ",

Zubimendi has not been quite as possession dominant as might be expected of a Spanish deep-lying playmaker, but has instead focused on giving quick ball to those ahead of him, the sort that get Arsenal moving dangerously up the field. -- James Benge  Man of the match: Bukayo Saka, Arsenal: We can expect a tough challenge for the strikers against the defense organized by Argentine manager Diego Simeone on Tuesday, and that's precisely why a player like Bukayo Saka could prove crucial in one-on-one situations and attacking transitions. Saka, who already scored one goal in the Champions League's match against Olympiacos can be that kind of attacking player. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Arsenal 2, Atletico Madrid 1 -- In a matchup between a team with a virtually impenetrable defense and another that relies on its attack to survive, Arsenal's wise bet on defensive resolve looks set to pay off. Atletico's Julian Alvarez is the type of goalscorer that can get past even the best back line and the Gunners may still have questions to answer about which ones of their many attackers are actually the most effective, but the Gunners' other big bet on depth should pay off no matter who starts. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: Bukayo Saka to score or assist (+240): This season hasn't been up to Saka's usual high standards with only three goals in his first eight appearances of the season with no assists yet, but he'll have his chances at home facing Atletico Madrid. This isn't the usual defensively stout Atleti side, and even if Viktor Gyokeres isn't putting away chances that Saka creates, the space that the Swedish striker provides will give Saka chances to score on his own and take care of clearing this line in a game which Arsenal will win. -- Chuck Booth  Barcelona vs. Olympiacos, 12:45 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Marcus Rashford, Barcelona: The pressure is on Barcelona's loan signing, who it should be noted has delivered the sort of performances many suspected might have been beyond him after he left Manchester United on loan. With no Robert Lewandowski or Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal still working his way back to full fitness, the pressure will be on Rashford to deliver shots as well as create for his team mates. -- James Benge  Man of the match: Pedri, Barcelona -- The Spanish midfielder is the most creative midfielder of the side coached by Hansi Flick and this is the kind of matches were his qualities can become crucial for the Blaugrana. As Barcelona are expected to dominate the game that will be played at the Lluis Companys, he can become the player who can help the strikers to score some goals. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Barcelona 4, Olympiacos 0 -- Barcelona are the heavy favorites in this match for a reason, so expect the Champions League hopefuls to act accordingly. Lamine Yamal seems likely to play a sizable role but for a game like this one, manager Hansi Flick will be spoiled for choice with his attacking options, each of them capable of finishing off their chances agianst the Greek visitors. Expected a lopsided victory for the reigning LaLiga champions as it chases a second Champions League win of the season. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: First half over 1.5 goals (-110):  Barcelona should look to create chances quickly, which favors both them and Olympiacos. The Greek side may only have counter attacking opportunities on the day, so why not attack the first half goals market. The way Barcelona plays with a high line under Hansi Flick means that goals will come in bunches from somewhere, and with Lamine Yamal back in the XI, odds are in the Spanish side's favor. -- Chuck Booth  Champions League matches on Wednesday  \tMatchup\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    James Benge\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Francesco Porzio\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pardeep Cattry\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chuck Booth\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Roger Gonzalez\n                            \n            Athletic Club vs. Qarabag2-02-12-11-12-0Galatasaray vs. Bodo/Glimt3-12-01-11-12-0Chelsea vs. Ajax0-04-13-02-04-1Real Madrid vs. Juventus2-02-13-12-12-0Sporting vs. Marseille1-11-10-21-21-1Monaco vs. Tottenham2-10-00-11-11-1Atalanta vs. Slavia Prague2-02-01-01-02-0Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Liverpool1-31-21-12-31-2Bayern Munich vs. Club Brugge4-05-03-06-04-0 Game of the day: Real Madrid vs. Juventus, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Jonathan David, Juventus: A year ago, David was the hero when Lille downed Real Madrid in the league phase. He faces off against the Spanish giants, this time desperately needing to show he is anything like the sort of striker who can match the output of Kylian Mbappe in European competitions, like he did last season. So far, he isn't getting close. Just one shot on target so far this season and zero shots of any variety in back to back starts against AC Milan and Como. The bar could scarcely be lower. -- James BengeMan of the match: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid -- Juventus are currently going through a challenging moment and they need a positive result, but it won't be easy against Real Madrid. In particular, their disappointing defensive performances will be challenged by French striker Kylian Mbappe, who already scored 15 goals in 11 matches played so far in all competitions, including a hat trick against Kairat in the opening fixture of the season. -- Francesco Porzio Prediction: Real Madrid 3, Juventus 1 -- Xabi Alonso's version of Real Madrid is essentially an exercise in restrained efficiency so modest scorelines come more naturally to Los Blancos these days than lopsided victories, but they can make a rare exception and they just might do so on Wednesday. Juventus are a bit all over the place to start the season, which may make it open season for Kylian Mbappe and his colleagues as they look to extend their perfect start to Champions League play. Alonso has a wide range of attackers at his disposal, too, each of them probably eager to make their mark in Europe as the manager continues to rotate through his options while leaving Mbappe front and center. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: Both teams to score and Real Madrid to win (+187): They have too much on the attacking end for Juventus to overcome, especially if Italian side couldn't cope with Como away from home over the weekend. But Xabi Alonso's defense has also given up chances and with talented attackers like Kenan Yildiz, Juventus will find a way to get one goal. Unfortunately once they do, they have to deal with stopping Kylian Mbappe. -- Chuck Booth  Chelsea vs. Ajax, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Pedro Neto, Chelsea: Enzo Maresca could be without a host of key attackers on Wednesday, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Cole Palmer and potentially Enzo Fernandez. Someone is going to need to step up in their absence and Neto might just be the most senior forward in the Chelsea XI at kickoff. The Portugal winger has not come close to a consistent run of form that might justify the $70 million plus that was paid to Wolves for his services. However, a sprightly game against Nottingham Forest is at least something to build on. -- James BengeMan of the match: Estevao, Chelsea: The talented Brazilian striker is expected to start his first ever Champions League's match on Wednesday after playing 45 minutes between the game against Benfica and the one against Bayern Munich. Match after match, he's becoming an increasingly important part of Enzo Maresca's rotations, having also scored a last-minute winner against Liverpool. Now, he looks ready to take the next step and make his mark on the European stage. -- Francesco Porzio Prediction: Chelsea 3, Ajax 0 -- There is no greater treat for a team in inconsistent form than an opponent that will allow them to reverse course, even if the joy only lasts for 90 minutes. Chelsea may have some injuries to contend with and a habit for picking up red cards that hampers their ability to win games more often than it should, but Ajax have been incredibly unimpressive in their first Champions League season in three years, having conceded six goals in two games while scoring none, vulnerable on set pieces and mistake-prone at the back. The Blues just punished Nottingham Forest for having similar attributes over the weekend, so expect Enzo Maresca's side to collect their second win of the European season in the process. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: Chelsea to win to nil (+120): While the Blues have had their ups and downs this season, this iteration of Ajax looks nothing like the ones who used to challenge for the round of 16 every campaign in Champions League play. Chelsea's defense and former Ajax man Jorrel Hato will be able to take care of business winning at home at Stamford Bridge for a much needed three points in the league phase. -- Chuck Booth \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins fell to 1-6 on Sunday following a 31-6 loss to the previously one-win Cleveland Browns. It's fair to say that coach Mike McDaniel is firmly on the hot seat, but no changes are expected at this time, according to NFL Media. Last month, Ian Rapoport reported that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross likes McDaniel and wants this hire to work out. Ross even invested in McDaniel last year by signing him to a contract extension that goes through 2028. However, if fans stop showing up to games and McDaniel loses the locker room, that could lead to a change. On Sunday, the Dolphins offense recorded 219 total yards, converted just 1 of 13 third downs and lost the turnover battle 4-0. Tua Tagovailoa became the first quarterback to throw three interceptions in two straight games since Philip Rivers in 2019. \"The way I look at this job is I find it very offensive to all parties involved if I'm thinking about having the job -- I need to be doing my job,\" McDaniel said following Miami's loss to Cleveland. \"So, for as long as I coach for the Miami Dolphins and this organization, they'll get everything from me. And I refuse to spend my time thinking about [my job security] ... You have a job, you do your job and you do it to the best of your ability. That's where my concern lies. I think it's offensive to all coaches, players and the organization if I'm spending that precious time thinking about myself.\"\nBack in 2023, Miami led the NFL in total offense with a whopping 401.3 yards per game, but those days feel long ago.Dolphins under Mike McDaniel (since 2022)2022-232024-25Record20-149-15Points per game26.320.2Yards per game382.9311.9McDaniel has gone 29-29 in his four seasons with Miami. He has a 3-15 record vs. winning teams, and a 26-14 record vs. teams .500 or below. He's made the playoffs twice, but failed to win either postseason appearance. The Dolphins are in the midst of the longest active playoff win drought in the NFL, dating back to 2000, and the fourth-longest active division title drought, dating back to 2008.McDaniel isn't expected to be fired this week, but it's clear something has to change with this team. The Dolphins return to action next week in Atlanta, and will take on Bijan Robinson and the 3-3 Falcons.One change we know that won't be happening is at quarterback. Tua Tagovailoa is coming of his second consecutive three-interception game, one that got him benched when rookie Quinn Ewers entered the game late in the fourth quarter, but McDaniel said on Monday that he's still the guy.\"He's going to take the snaps this week and he's going to be the starter this week,\" McDaniel told reporters of Tua.As for the backup QB spot, McDaniel is leaving it open as a competition this week. Ewers was elevated for Week 7, but it's not assured he will be in Week 8 vs. the Falcons.\"I made a very calculated intentional effort to observe each player every week,\" McDaniel told reporters. \"Last week, based upon the game plan, the situation and Quinn more than anything it kind of created an opportunity where I thought with conviction, and the coaching staff agreed, Quinn in this particular game gave us the best shot if he had to come in.\"I'm hoping it's not a week-to-week thing. It will be competitive this week and at the end of the week I'll let you guys know who the backup is in the hopes somebody grabs and takes it. For this game and all things are on the table moving forward in their competition and it will be settled on the field.\"\n            ",

Morant missed the entire preseason due to an ankle injury and his status for the start of the season was in question, but Stein indicates he's progressed enough to be available when Memphis' season gets under way. However, that bit of positive news arrived on the heels of yet another injury report from the Grizzlies, who announced guard Ty Jerome will miss at least four weeks with a \"high-grade calf strain.\" Jerome was the top free agent signing of the Grizzlies and was set to be the first guard off the bench for Memphis this season behind Morant and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Jerome had a career-year in Cleveland last season, averaging 12.5 points per game and shooting 43.9% from 3-point range, but the Grizzlies will now have to wait for his introduction into the lineup due to a calf injury. \n        \n            \n                Winners, losers of NBA extension season: Kevin Durant gets Rockets deal; Trae Young seems set for free agency\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat puts another significant dent in Memphis' guard depth, as Scotty Pippen Jr. -- who was Morant's backup last year and started a number of games in his absence -- had recent toe surgery and will miss the start of the season as well. That leaves Javon Small as the backup point guard in Memphis' rotation, although they could certainly look at some non-traditional lineup options when Morant isn't on the floor. \nTheir frontcourt is also depleted going into the season, with centers Zach Edey and Brandon Clarke both injured to start the year, forcing Memphis to lean on small lineups early with Jaren Jackson Jr. and Santi Aldama playing some small-ball five. \n            \n    ",

Tampa Bay has scored at least 30 points in back-to-back games, as even with various wide receiver injuries, Baker Mayfield continues to raise the talent around him. The Lions are coming off a 30-17 loss to the Chiefs, and Tampa Bay should be able to use that film to gameplan ways to shock the Lions. Tampa Bay is the underdog for a reason, as the Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last year and have won each of their home games this season, but the model projects Tampa Bay to win in 37% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 30.3%. This is strong value for the model to view Tampa Bay as a best bet at DraftKings. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Texans (+140) to defeat the SeahawksHouston had one of the least efficient offenses in the NFL over the first three weeks, averaging 12.7 ppg during its 0-3 start. However, in recent weeks, the Texans have played offensively and defensively like a team that has made the playoffs in back-to-back seasons, outscoring opponents, 70-10. Houston is coming off its bye, so fatigue shouldn't be an issue for the No. 1 scoring defense (12.2 ppg) in the NFL this season. Seattle is off to a strong start at 4-2, but at +140 odds for Houston, the model projects the value in the Texans' direction.

Game 7 features the same pitching matchup as Game 3, which Toronto won, 13-4. But that doesn't guarantee a similar result for Monday. Shane Bieber held the Mariners to two runs in six innings on Wednesday, but he made just seven starts in the regular season following Tommy John surgery. Seattle starter George Kirby allowed eight runs in four innings in Game 3, but he allowed just three runs over 10 innings in his first two postseason starts.

    "body": "\n        BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – Jimbo Fisher, who won a national championship at Florida State in 2013, still believes Mike Norvell is a good coach amidst a four-game losing streak that has cranked up the hot seat talk in Tallahassee.Florida State athletic director Michael Alford issued a vote of confidence in Norvell on Monday morning, saying \"we are fully committed to helping Coach Norvell and the 2025 Seminoles strongly rebound in the coming weeks.\" Alford said a \"comprehensive assessment\" of the program would be conducted at the conclusion of the season. That came off as an attempt to tamp down the considerable smoke Sunday that Norvell's job security could be in question after a 20-13 loss to Stanford as influential boosters expressed displeasure with the program's current trajectory. CBS Sports previously reported Norvell even addressed during a Sunday staff meeting that conversations about his future were happening. \n        \n            \n                Why did Florida State decide against firing Mike Norvell? Examining pros, cons as 'Noles back struggling coach\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFisher, who was speaking at Birmingham's Monday Morning Quarterback Club, was asked to assess what is wrong with the Florida State program that he led from 2010-17. \n\"It's easy to point fingers when you're outside or try to assess things but until you're inside you never really know because there are so many things that can affect how young men play, what goes on with coaches,\" Fisher said. \"Sometimes you have a couple bad breaks and things don't go right, a few technical things, and all of a sudden your confidence goes. \"When those losing streaks happen, those coaches are still good coaches. Mike Norvell has had an undefeated season, he's coached great wherever he's been, those players have won. They beat Alabama in a great game so it's not like they can't play. But it's funny in sports how quickly it can turn from just a little bit of confidence, just a break here and there and your psyche. When those things happen, they can snowball the other way just as fast. I still think they have a good team, a good coach and they'll get it right.\"Fisher knows what it's like when the outside noise starts cranking up and fans start calling for your job. He felt it in College Station when he was ultimately fired after a 45-25 record in six seasons. Similar in some ways to the Norvell situation at Florida State, Fisher was at one point viewed as unfirable because of a massive buyout of more than $70 million. Norvell would be owed more than $55 million if FSU fired him this week. \nEventually, the booster unrest and disappointing results pushed A&M to make a move on Fisher in what is still the largest buyout in college sports history. If FSU ultimately moves on from Norvell, it'd slot in at No. 2 all-time, just ahead of Penn State's recent $49 million buyout of James Franklin. Fanbase disappointment can be impossible to avoid, though Fisher said he always stayed off social media as a coach. When it gets particularly loud, he says, that's when you have to rely on your self-belief and make sure you aren't letting the criticism impact you. That's a lot easier said than done, though, and Fisher believes it can be especially hard for the players. \"In today's time, they grew up on social media,\" Fisher said. \"That's how a lot of their own self-worth is measured by what other people think of them. Hopefully these are hard lessons to learn but maybe they can see now not everyone is for you. They are for you when you're doing well but when it's not, they are just as harsh on you. It can be brutal.\"\nFisher is now working as a television analyst for the ACC Network. He last coached in 2023 but is itching to lead a program again soon. He said Monday he hoped to be on a sideline next season and missed everything from recruiting to practices. In what is already a hectic coaching cycle that features seven Power Four jobs open already, Fisher is expected to be in the mix. His time at Texas A&M ended in disappointment, though he still has a resume that includes a national championship, three ACC championships and five top-10 finishes. \"I want to coach somewhere that's committed to winning,\" the former FSU coach said. \"Just make sure they give us the resources to be able to win. I know it's about money, but you've got to have the resources to put into the game to win and do it the right way. The grass is just as green everywhere.\"\n            ",

On Monday, coach Dan Quinn revealed that while Daniels' injury is not \"significant or long-term,\" his status for next Monday's showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs is uncertain. \"I'll have a better sense as I get closer to it, with the extra day and what that looks like,\" Quinn said. \"But the good news came back that it's not a long-term thing ... but I'll have a better feel for you guys when we get to Thursday.\"Daniels missed time earlier this season with a knee sprain, and the Commanders went 1-1 with backup Marcus Mariota at the helm. The concern with a hamstring is always the potential to aggravate it or make it worse by hurrying back too quickly, but with an extra day to recover before playing Monday night, there is a possibility Daniels is able to go against the red-hot Chiefs. As Quinn noted, we likely won't get a full status update on Daniels until later in the week, but the fact that the MRI didn't show anything significant is a positive update for a Commanders team that needed some good injury news for once. \nThe offense has dealt with injuries to their top receivers along with Daniels, as Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin and Noah Brown all missed Sunday's game in Dallas, while the defense just lost sack leader Dorrance Armstrong for the season with a knee injury. \n            \n    ",

The Pacers released a brief statement acknowledging the situation, per Fox 59, but did not have additional comment while they gathered more information. \nJones was the 38th overall pick by the Pacers in the second round of the 2025 NBA Draft out of Marquette and signed a four-year deal worth $8.6 million that is only partially guaranteed in Year 2, non-guaranteed for Year 3 and has a team option in Year 4. Jones is currently dealing with a back injury and was already expected to miss the start of the season, but will now await his hearing and resolution of his two pending charges. \n            \n    ",

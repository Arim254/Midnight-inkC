    "body": "\n        The 10th-ranked Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes will look to continue their unlikely run to the championship when they battle the sixth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels in a 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal matchup at the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday. Miami stunned defending national champion Ohio State 24-14 on New Year's Eve, while Ole Miss held off third-ranked Georgia 39-34 on New Year's Day. The Hurricanes (12-2, 6-2 ACC), who have won six in a row, are 4-0 against ranked opponents this season. The Rebels (13-1, 7-1 SEC), who have won seven consecutive games, are 2-1 against ranked foes. The Ole Miss coaching staff is in flux, but offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. will be on the sideline for the Rebels and calling plays for quarterback Trinidad Chambliss.Kickoff from State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., is at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Hurricanes are 3-point favorites in the latest Miami vs. Ole Miss odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 52.5. The Under is a combined 5-1 for the two teams over their last three games, while each squad is 3-0 ATS over this stretch.

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred was in studio for a segment on WFAN in New York Thursday afternoon and among the topics broached was expansion and, along with it, realignment. It's been a hot button topic the last few years, as it's been a long time since MLB expanded and the league is currently thriving. While the league is currently balanced with two leagues of 15 teams and six divisions of five, each league having an odd number of teams feels a bit off. And, again, the league hasn't expanded since the Diamondbacks and Devil Rays joined the fray in 1998. The commissioner has long said he wants two expansion teams selected before his term expires in January 2029.\"Thirty-two would be good for us,\" he said, also noting there are a lot of cities that want a Major League Baseball team. \"When people want your product, you oughta try to find a way to sell it to them.\"Mathematically, 32 teams would fit more snugly into leagues than 30, given that you could have 16 teams in each league and eight divisions of four. \n\"It does a ton for us from a format perspective,\" the commissioner said. \"You would realign along geographic lines, which could alleviate a ton of the travel burden that's on players.\" It's a good point. Keep in mind that MLB players travel so much more than players in any other sport, given the 162-game schedule, even with it divided up into 2-4 game series throughout the season. Manfred also discussed what a problem the first round of playoff games can be, logistically, if featuring a team from each coast, making the scheduling either too late for people in the east or too early for people in the west -- and sometimes both. Other leagues, like the NBA, are more cleanly split geographically, allowing the Knicks to play in eastern time and the Thunder in western, for example. \nThe big takeaway there is that Manfred likes the idea of moving away from the American and National Leagues and instead toward East and West leagues. However, he did say he would want to keep the two-team cities \"separate.\" That is to say that the Cubs and White Sox, Mets and Yankees and Dodgers and Angels, respectively, would remain in different divisions.  Upon first glance, that might seem like a tough needle to thread, but not impossible.Even if the Mets and Yankees, for example, were both in an Eastern League, you could group the Yankees with the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Pirates while the Mets could go with the Phillies, Orioles and Nationals. It could work.Regardless, there's a CBA next offseason that needs to be completed and Manfred has also said in previous years that he won't deal with expansion until the stadium situations are resolved for the A's and Rays. \nStill, it's a fun offseason topic of discussion.\n            ",

The Fiesta Bowl kicks off on Thursday evening with the Peach Bowl following on Friday. Only four teams remain after two rounds of the CFP, including just one team that received a first-round bye. No. 10 Miami enters the Fiesta Bowl after pulling off a massive upset against No. 2 Ohio State, but the Hurricanes get a tough battle against No. 6 Ole Miss, fresh off a win against No. 3 Georgia. No. 1 Indiana throttled No. 9 Alabama and now gets a rematch against upset-minded No. 5 Oregon in a rematch. The semifinals features several of the most exciting quarterbacks in the nation. Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza leads the Hoosiers, while Miami's Carson Beck was a multi-year star at Georgia. Ole Miss's Trinidad Chambliss is one of the breakout stars of the postseason, and Oregon's Dante Moore could be the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft. The winners of these games will advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship in Miami on Jan. 19.

Detroit is a file-and-trial team, meaning they will not negotiate on a one-year deal before the hearing. That means the two sides are likely headed for a possibly contentious arbitration hearing that could impact extension talks. Skubal's camp filed for a $32 million salary for 2026 while the Tigers filed at $19 million, a $13 million gap that represents the largest difference in arbitration history, according to ESPN. The record for a pitcher in arbitration is $19.75 million, but that was in 2015 (David Price). Skubal's filing of $32 million would beat Juan Soto's record ($31 million) in arbitration.By way of reminder, players with 3-6 years of MLB service time are eligible for salary arbitration. As well, players in the top 22% of service time between 2-3 years are also eligible. Those latter players are called Super Twos and go through arbitration four times rather than the usual three before being in line for free agency. Other big names eligible for arbitration this time around who reached settlements include Randy Arozarena of the Mariners, Hunter Brown of the Astros, Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman of the Orioles, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Yankees, among others. Eighteen players, including the aforementioned Skubal, William Contreras of the Brewers, Joe Ryan of the Twins, and Isaac Paredes of the Astros, were unable to reach a settlement.\nAs for how the arbitration deadline works, players file the salary they believe they should be paid in 2026 and teams file the salary they believe the players should be paid for the upcoming season. If the two sides are unable to agree on a figure, they will go to an arbitration hearing where each side will state their case, and a three-person panel will pick either the salary the player filed or the salary the team filed. There's no splitting the difference between the two figures or picking one out of thin air. As such, the system is designed to promote negotiation, and that's typically what happens before a trial is held. Indeed, the vast majority of arbitration-eligible players sign one-year contracts for the coming season prior to the filing deadline. Only a handful actually file salary figures and even fewer go to a hearing. Neither side wants to go to a hearing because the process necessarily entails, on the team side, emphasizing a player's flaws and shortcomings in the name of winning. That can lead to acrimony and a frayed relationship between team and player. Generally speaking, arbitration salaries are based on comparable players at the same service time level. A player with three years of service time who outperformed a player with six years of service time could have a lower 2025 salary because of, well, service time. Service time matters in arbitration. It's not purely about performance. That means the biggest arb-eligible salaries belong to those players who are in the final year of arbitration.

The College Football Playoff pits those squads against each other in semifinal action this week when No. 6 Ole Miss clashes with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl and No. 1 Indiana battles No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl. Those Thursday and Friday contests are set to determine the two squads that will play for the CFP National Championship.From a war between two underdogs to a showdown featuring the potential top two quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft, these semifinals are destined to deliver ample theatrics. Will Miami move one step closer to returning to glory? Can Ole Miss continue the hot start to the Pete Golding era? Only one will prevail in Thursday's bout. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza then meets Dante Moore again in a compelling rematch on Friday.Both the Ducks and Hoosiers advanced to the penultimate round by way of convincing victories. Their blowout wins over No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 9 Alabama, respectively, made them appear as the top two contenders to win the championship. On the other side of the bracket, the Rebels and Hurricanes both toppled blue-blood opponents in the previous round and planted their flag as worthy title hopefuls.There is a lot of new blood left in the bracket. Oregon is the only team of the bunch to have played in the national semifinals. Indiana, like Oregon, is in search of its first national championship, while Ole Miss has yet to win a title outright and Miami is in the midst of a more than two-decade drought.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: (6) Ole Miss vs. (10) Miami | LIVE updatesState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: (1) Indiana vs. (5) Oregon -- 7:30 p.m. | ESPN | Predictions, previewMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

A make-up date has not yet been set.\nThe game, scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local time) was delayed for nearly two hours before officially being postponed. Chicago experienced unseasonably warm temperatures -- in the 50s -- and significant humidity and rain Thursday, with flood and flash flood warnings throughout the area.Furthermore, the Chicago Blackhawks had played at the United Center the previous night, defeating the St. Louis Blues 7-3. All of those factors combined to form a court that was visibly wet in several spots, despite the best efforts of several arena staffers who used towels and other supplies in an effort to dry the court.The Athletic reported humidity levels in the arena were nearly double what they usually are, and the Bulls broadcast noted the arena had pumped the air conditioning in an attempt to help solve the issue.\nIt created a strange scene inside, with players intermittently doing some light warmups, playing \"horse\" or trying trick shots and then going back to the locker room. Players were sent back to their locker rooms about 50 minutes after the original tip-off time, per Chicago Sports Network. They then emerged from and retreated to the locker rooms again about 1:45 after the game was scheduled to begin.The delay wasn't all for naught, though: Benny the Bull produced this highlight.\nThough rare, postponements of this ilk aren't completely unprecedented. In 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers' home game against the Sacramento Kings at what was then the Wells Fargo Center was postponed due to essentially the same situation: warm temperatures, humidity and a hockey game the previous night.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after a standout junior season, he announced. Reese is the No. 6 overall player in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and projects as a potential top-10 pick.\"Want to say thank you to coach (Ryan) Day and coach Mick (Mickey Marotti) for believing in me and for everything they poured into me,\" Reese wrote on social media. \"Thank you to the entire strength and conditioning staff who pushed me, challenged me, and prepared me for the next level. ... I want to thank all of Buckeye Nation. It was truly an honor to suit up in the Scarlet and Grey. The love and support from this fan base is unmatched.\"I am looking forward to representing my family and my school in the 2026 NFL Draft.\"Reese finished 2025 by recording 69 total tackles (34 solo) with 6.5 sacks. Reese was a finalist for the Butkus Award, which honors the top linebacker in college football. The Ohio State standout is the second-highest-ranked defender in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings behind Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr.\nIn Reese's final game at Ohio State against Miami in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl, he finished with seven total tackles. The Buckeyes lost to the Hurricanes 24-14, which ended their pursuit of winning back-to-back national titles.Reese's NFL Draft stockReese is the No. 6 overall prospect and the top-ranked linebacker in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. However, he could go higher in the draft than his ranking. CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner mocked Reese at No. 4 to the Tennessee Titans earlier this week.\"The Titans have plenty of needs, with wide receiver and edge rusher chief among them,\" Renner wrote. \"I lean edge here, given how consistently teams can find receiving talent later in the draft, but it wouldn't be surprising if Carnell Tate were the pick instead. Arvell Reese, though, is more of a wildcard -- a traits-based projection with high-end upside as a pass rusher. He's a modern hybrid linebacker who would add pass-rushing juice from anywhere on the Titans' front seven.\"\nAnother analyst, Ryan Wilson, mocked Reese at No. 2 to the New York Giants.\"An explosive, high-motor LB with a versatile skill set that includes elite closing speed vs. both the run and the pass,\" Wilson wrote. \"He is a terror coming downhill, showcasing his strength and athleticism to shoot gaps, shed blocks and collapse the pocket. Reese is a wrap-up tackling machine who consistently plays with an aggressive edge and the versatility to line up across the front seven. One of the biggest risers over the first month of the college season.\"Impact on Ohio StateReese declaring for the draft should not come as a surprise to the Buckeyes. There is a very real possibility that Reese will be the first non-quarterback selected. In Wilson's latest mock draft, Reese was one of four Ohio State players selected in the first round.Replacing that level of talent won't be easy, but Ohio State is primed to reload for next season on the defensive side of the football. The Buckeyes will not only have to replace Reese, but also standout linebacker Sonny Styles as well, who also projects as a first-round pick.\nOhio State is already busy trying to find its replacements. The Buckeyes landed a commitment from former Wisconsin linebacker Christian Alliegro, who is the No. 146 overall player and the 10th-ranked linebacker in the 247Sports transfer rankings.\n            ",

The 14th-year veteran is off to a solid start to the season. In 18 games, all starts, he is averaging a 20.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.7 blocks and 1.2 steals in 30.8 minutes. He is connecting on 52.2% of his field goals and 72.6% of his free throws. Davis should fare well against the Utah defense, which ranks 27th in the league by allowing 119.8 points per game.Dallas has won two games in a row thanks in part to Davis' play. He is coming off back-to-back double-doubles. In a 100-98 win at Sacramento on Tuesday, he scored 19 points, while grabbing 16 rebounds. He poured in 26 points, while adding 12 rebounds, five blocks and three assists in a 110-104 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday. New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Another part of McClure's optimal NBA DFS strategy includes stacking Davis with forward Naji Marshall ($5,000 on DraftKings and $5,400 on FanDuel). The fifth-year veteran is averaging 13.2 points in 37 games played, including 14 starts. He is coming off a 15-point, seven-rebound effort in the win over the Kings. In a 140-133 overtime loss at Utah on Dec. 15, he poured in 15 points, while grabbing three rebounds in 36 minutes of action. The Jazz have also allowed the most Fantasy points, on both DraftKings and FanDuel, to opposing small forwards, which is the position where Marshall spends most of his time. See McClure's other NBA DFS picks right here.How to set your NBA DFS lineups for Thursday, Jan. 8McClure is also targeting a player who could go off for massive numbers on Thursday because of an optimal matchup.

The Rebels have kicked off Pete Golding's tenure as head coach with wins over Tulane and Georgia whole the Hurricanes took down Texas A&M and Ohio State, the reigning champs, to advance to the semifinal round. The winner of Thursday's matchup will face either Oregon or Indiana for the title. \nKickoff from State Farm Stadium in Arizona is set for 7:30 p.m. ET on Thursday. FanDuel Sportsbook odds have the Hurricanes as 3.5-point favorites, and the over/under for total points scored sits at 52.5. Miami is -166 on the money line (wager $166 to win $100) while Ole Miss is a +138 underdog (wager $100 to win $138). Here are our best bets for this CFP semifinal round, which we've made with the assistance of the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times. Ole Miss +3.5The Rebels opened the CFP with their second resounding win over Tulane of the 2025 season, and they were able to knock off Georgia in a thrilling game last week thanks to some heroics from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. Ole Miss is 9-5 against the spread this year and has covered in each of its last three games. The SportsLine model expects more of the same against Miami, with the Rebels covering the spread in 55% of simulations.Over 52.5The Rebels have a high-powered offense and the lowest total they've had for a game this year, per SportsLine consensus odds, is 51. Ole Miss is 7-7 to the Over, but the team's offense is clicking well of late with no drop off since Kiffin's departure. Chambliss has been a one-man wrecking crew orchestrating the Rebels' offense as a dual-threat option, and he was a major factor in the Over hitting against Georgia. Miami's defense has been stellar across the first two rounds, but on the other hand, Ole Miss' defense can be had and the Hurricanes have firepower on offense along with a veteran quarterback in Carson Beck. Over 52.5 hits in 57% of model simulations. Ole Miss money lineThe SportsLine model has this as nearly a toss up. Its final score prediction is Miami 29, Ole Miss 28, but the Rebels win in 47% of simulations, returning plenty of value on the money line at plus money. Either the Hurricanes will play for their first national championship in over two decades, or the Rebels will advance and try and win their first title since the 1960s in a wild run after losing their head coach. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n            \n                        \n                                                            \n                                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        History will be chased on Thursday in the College Football Playoff as Miami and Ole Miss gear up for a much-anticipated showdown to kick off the semifinals. The Rebels have already broken the school record with 13 wins and are closer than ever before to winning the school's first solo national title. The Hurricanes, meanwhile, have exceeded the lofty expectations from the preseason, sneaking into the playoff and navigating the most difficult postseason path to reach the semifinals.It's the ACC vs. SEC, a high-flying offense against a big-time defense. It's The U against The New. No matter who wins, the victor will land in the national championship as an unlikely participant. Simply put, No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss doesn't get much better in terms of stakes and storylines. The Rebels could win a national title without Lane Kiffin, who bolted town for rival LSU -- and grabbed a few Ole Miss assistants -- before the playoff. Miami can cap its long-gestating return to glory under alum Mario Cristobal, who left Oregon three years ago to lift his alma mater back on the national stage.Neither team is short on superstars. Quarterback Carson Beck is the most accurate passer remaining in the playoffs. Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss went from a Division II national champion to a backup on the Rebels' bench to perhaps the most electric player in the postseason. Georgia couldn't keep up with him in the quarterfinals as he led the Rebels to a thrilling, 39-34 comeback victory. \nCFP predictions: Why Ole Miss will win the title | Why Miami will win the titleMiami's defense has been a brick wall, allowing only 17 total points in wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State in the CFP. They sacked mobile quarterback Marcel Reed seven times on the road. Julian Sayin, the nation's most accurate passer, couldn't pick up first downs.The Fiesta Bowl pits two of the most fascinating stories in the CFP.Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis as Miami and Ole Miss tangle for a spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship. \nMiami vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Fiesta BowlTrench warfare: Miami's postseason run has been highlighted by the incredible pass rush provided by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped lead the nation's best sack-producing defense. The Hurricanes have 12 sacks in two playoff games and have recorded at least four sacks in four straight games, pushing their total to 46 for the season. Their pressure rate is also an elite 40.5%. Ole Miss only allows 1.3 sacks per game, ranking in the top 20 nationally, and actually ranks behind Ohio State, which gave up six sacks to Miami. Still, the difference for the Rebels is quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, whose mobility kept Georgia out of reach. The Bulldogs had zero sacks and only three tackles for loss in the quarterfinals. Ole Miss is sacked on only 3.1% of pass plays, ranking seventh nationally. Championship pedigrees: Ole Miss has never won a solo national title, and Miami is chasing its first since 2001, but championship-worthy quarterbacks lead both teams in their pursuit of history. Chambliss led Ferris State to a Division II national title last season before transferring to Ole Miss. Carson Beck is 36-5 in his career, including a 15-3 record against ranked opponents. He's the first quarterback to win that many games over three years since 2012-14 (Marcus Mariota). Beck has completed 74.4% of his passes, but in the last two games, he's thrown for fewer than 150 yards for the first time in his career as a starter. Chambliss has thrown for 300-plus yards in eight games this season, including a career high in the win last week against Georgia.Which elite running back steps up?: Get ready for a run-off in Arizona. Miami's Mark Fletcher Jr. has been a bull in the playoffs, especially late in games, rushing for 262 yards in the postseason to rank fourth all-time in CFP history. Ole Miss' Kewan Lacy is a scoring machine, recording rushing touchdowns in the last eight games while picking up an incredible 877 yards over that span. Lacy's 23 rushing touchdowns rank third in SEC history, behind two Alabama running backs who won national titles in their respective seasons.\nMiami vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\nIf Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        Embrace debate, they say. OK, here goes. A year after the Josh Allen-Lamar Jackson MVP discourse raged on into the postseason before delivering Allen the MVP in the closest vote in more than two decades, we are in a similar spot with Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye neck-and-neck. Tensions are high across every community, from experts to casual fans, as stats are flung around the spectrum, from simple to advanced, with ill intent and reckless abandon, typical of how information is shared these days. The discourse ranges from \"Drake Maye didn't play anyone,\" to \"Drake Maye actually played better defenses than Stafford.\" Or, \"oldheads want to give Stafford a lifetime achievement award,\" and he was \"padding stats.\"There's a lot of BS being flung around. Consider this piece a final verdict from our NFL staff at CBS Sports -- providing clarity on two amazing seasons from deserving MVP candidates, busting a few myths -- and myths about myths going around, too!  \tWhat's at stake First off, you can see why people get all worked up over the NFL MVP award. Individual recognition means a lot and this is the top of the mountain. The impact on a player's legacy is undeniable. \nI wrote a few weeks ago about how an MVP is the missing piece of Stafford's Hall of Fame career. He can be the 15th quarterback in NFL history to win an MVP and a Super Bowl title. Ten of the 14 are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and three of the four who are not (Aaron Rodgers, Patrick Mahomes, and Tom Brady) will be in there eventually.  Stafford is going to be in a crowded field of Hall of Fame-eligible and worthy quarterbacks over the next decade, so this would help separate him from the pack.  For Maye, this is about history and the path to the Hall of Fame. He would be the fifth quarterback to win an MVP within his first two seasons, along with Dan Marino (1984), Kurt Warner (1999), Patrick Mahomes (2018) and Lamar Jackson (2019). That's four Hall of Fame quarterbacks.\n \tBoth Stafford and Maye had historic seasons Both players also had such great seasons that they would win MVPs most years.  2025 passing leadersComp pct \t\t\t\tDrake Maye \t\t\t\t72.0% \t\t\t\tYards per attempt \t\t\t\tDrake Maye \t\t\t\t8.9 \t\t\t\tPasser rating \t\t\t\tDrake Maye \t\t\t\t113.5 \t\t\t\tPass yards \t\t\t\tMatthew Stafford \t\t\t\t4,707 \t\t\t\tPass touchdowns \t\t\t\tMatthew Stafford \t\t\t\t46 \t\t\t\tTD-INT ratio \t\t\t\tMatthew Stafford \t\t\t\t5.8 \t\t\t\tStafford put up some counting stats that have rarely been seen before, and when they did, they earned MVPs. He's the third quarterback in NFL history with 45+ touchdown passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. Tom Brady did this in his historic 2007 season when he won MVP and went 16-0. Aaron Rodgers did it during his MVP years in 2011 and 2020. Stafford is also the second quarterback in the past 50 years to lead the NFL in touchdown passes, passing yards and touchdown-to-interception ratio, along with '07 Brady. Anytime you're on a list alone with 2007 Brady, you are in the rarest of air.  Maye did it with superb arm strength, accuracy and his legs. He became the first player in league history with 4,000 passing yards while completing 70% of his passes and running for 450 yards.  He pulled off a rare feat by leading the NFL in both completion percentage (72.0%) and yards per attempt (8.9), too. He's the youngest player to ever do that (23) and only the 10th overall since the merger. Peyton Manning never did it. Brady and Drew Brees only did it once.  It's really hard to lead the NFL in completion percentage while also attempting passes further downfield than the rest of the league. He aired it out more than anyone in the league this year, with his average pass traveling 9.1 yards downfield. In 20 years of tracking, no one has ever had the highest completion rate in the league while also airing it out further than anyone, a testament to how spectacular Maye was this year.   \tMaye had slightly better numbers Overall, whether we are looking at counting stats, rate stats or advanced metrics, Maye had a slightly better season among two special years. Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye this year StaffordMayeW-L \t\t\t\t12-5 (6th) \t\t\t\t14-3 (1st) \t\t\t\tComp pct \t\t\t\t65.0% (17th) \t\t\t\t72.0% (1st) \t\t\t\tCPOE \t\t\t\t+1.5% (16th) \t\t\t\t+9.1% (1st) \t\t\t\tYards per att \t\t\t\t7.9 (7th) \t\t\t\t8.9 (1st) \t\t\t\tTotal yds \t\t\t\t4,708 (3rd) \t\t\t\t4,844 (1st) \t\t\t\tTotal TD \t\t\t\t46 (1st) \t\t\t\t35 (4th) \t\t\t\tEPA per dropback \t\t\t\t0.20 (3rd)  \t\t\t\t0.28 (1st) \t\t\t\tAir yards per att \t\t\t\t9.1 (2nd) \t\t\t\t9.1 (1st) \t\t\t\tYAC per comp \t\t\t\t4.8 (26th) \t\t\t\t4.9 (22nd) \t\t\t\tTurnover pct \t\t\t\t1.7% (T-7th) \t\t\t\t1.7% (T-7th) \t\t\t\tMaye led the NFL in EPA per dropback as the most efficient passer, while Stafford ranked third. Both put up a ton of yards, took care of the ball and aired it out.  The one area where Maye separated himself was deep throws. They ranked 1-2 in completions traveling 15+ air yards, but Maye was first in completion rate (58%) and Stafford was eighth (48%).  This is one of the reasons Maye was the most efficient quarterback this year. He ranked first in the NFL in completion rate over expected (+9.1%), meaning he overachieved more than anyone else in the league based on the difficulty of his throws (how open his targets were, how much pressure he was facing, how far the throw was, among other factors). Stafford ranked 16th.   \tMaye did more with less Maye was better. Not by much. But he was better. Still, when it's so close the debate is basically 1a and 1b, you have to conduct an MVP audit.  The first defense for Maye is his supporting cast. He did more with less. He has a defensive-minded head coach (Mike Vrabel) and Stafford has an offensive mastermind (Sean McVay). True, but let's not pretend like Josh McDaniels doesn't exist. The metrics vary by tracking method, but the general consensus is that the Patriots have an average offensive line, and the Rams have one of the better units in the NFL. I'll lean on ESPN's pass block win rates, which rank the Rams fifth and the Patriots 13th. It's still a lot closer than some would have you believe. No, Maye is not playing behind one of the worst lines in the NFL, not even close. Maye also isn't throwing it to many household names. It's Stefon Diggs past his prime, while Stafford has Puka Nacua and Davante Adams (also past his prime, but an incredible red zone weapon).One more feather in Maye's cap is that he can become the first quarterback in NFL history to win MVP in a season with no Pro Bowl teammate on offense. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez was the only other Patriots player to make the Pro Bowl this season. Puka Nacua earned a selection with the Rams by racking up over 1,700 yards. Of course, Pro Bowls aren't as valuable as they used to be and a Patriot could get in as a replacement, so take that for what it's worth.  \tStafford had a harder schedule So this debate is over, right? Maye did more and he did it with a worse supporting cast. Not so fast! Stafford supporters have come to his defense, pointing out that he played a much harder schedule in the toughest division in football. The NFC West was the first division in NFL history with three 12-win teams. There's some merit to this argument on the surface. The Patriots played the easiest schedule in terms of opponent record since the 1999 Rams. The 2025 Rams played the seventh-hardest schedule in the league. Even our Sportline projections (which factor in each team's strength on a neutral field) had the Patriots with the easiest schedule and the Rams with the fifth hardest. It's hard to ignore these numbers below at first glance. Stafford had 22 touchdown passes vs. winning teams this year, and Maye had two!  \tThis season vs. teams to finish above .500  Stafford MayeW-L \t\t\t\t5-3 \t\t\t\t1-2 \t\t\t\tPass YPG \t\t\t\t280.9 \t\t\t\t232.0 \t\t\t\tTD-INT \t\t\t\t22-2 \t\t\t\t2-2 \t\t\t\tIt's flawed logic to rely solely on an opponent's overall strength when debating the MVP award. For example, Maye should get more credit for playing well against a 5-12 Browns team than Stafford doing the same against a 12-5 49ers squad. It seems upside down, but the Browns ranked second in defensive EPA and the 49ers ranked in the bottom 10 in the NFL.  I agree with that logic, so here's a breakdown of the defenses they faced. Stafford still faced more top 10 defenses using the EPA metric (6 vs. Maye's 2) and top five units (4 vs. Maye's one) but the overall average strength of the defenses they faced (16th vs 20th) is much closer than the above strength of schedule stats would suggest.  Strength of defenses faced by (per defensive EPA) this season StaffordMayeTop 5 \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\t1 \t\t\t\tTop 10 \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\tTop 16 \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tAvg rank \t\t\t\t15.7 \t\t\t\t19.5 \t\t\t\tSo the Patriots' cupcake schedule doesn't bury Maye, but it's still easier than Stafford's, and it doesn't exonerate him, either. The way I look at it, Maye's worse supporting cast and easier schedule pretty much offset each other in this debate. We're even. \n \tStafford is not a stat padder So, what's left? There's still some more noise to parse through. Stafford's 46 touchdown passes obviously stand out on the surface, so many have falsely called out Stafford for stat padding with the memory fresh in their minds of his three touchdown passes late in Week 18 vs. a bad Cardinals team to pull ahead in MVP odds.  First off, if you're going to penalize Stafford for throwing a one-yard touchdown pass when he was up 10 late in the game, you're off your rocker. Have you seen the number of crazy comebacks in the NFL this year? They were trying to lock up the five seed so they could face the Panthers this weekend, one of the worst playoff teams of all time. That was about winning at all costs. I've understandably seen a lot of Maye supporters call out Stafford for a historic amount of short-yardage touchdown passes this year, though. It's tempting to feed into that on the surface, but they couldn't be more wrong.  \nWhy should he be penalized for this when he was more effective throwing for touchdowns from those spots than when the Rams ran it? Stafford had eight touchdown passes from the one-yard line this year, tying an NFL record. He threw eight touchdown passes from the one on 10 dropbacks (80% TD rate) while the Rams had six touchdown runs from the one on 13 attempts (46% TD rate) He also had 16 touchdown passes inside the five, one shy of the record. Mahomes had 17 in 2022 when he won MVP, for the record. Stafford was better at throwing it from inside the five (16 TDs on 23 dropbacks) than the Rams were at running in it (12 on 28 attempts). Again, a huge disparity in the success rate.  If anything, he should get a pat on the back for helping his team win games because nobody could stop Stafford from throwing goal-line fades and slants to Davante Adams, who is a matchup nightmare. But sure, let's call him a stat padder for making the right plays and dunking on fools. Let's not forget Kyren Williams cost the Rams a win in Week 5 against the 49ers when he lost a fumble on a run near the goal line in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.  Since that loss, Stafford is 9-for-11 targeting Davante Adams inside the five for nine touchdowns! Again, that's not stat padding. The team made an adjustment in their play calling in the red area and it helped them win games. Calling BS on that is like getting mad at Brady for throwing touchdowns to Randy Moss. Overall, Stafford had five touchdown passes in the fourth quarter when it wasn't a one-score game this year. I hardly consider that a lot of garbage time production, either.  We also can't penalize Stafford for having more opportunities in close, late situations. He ranked fourth in the NFL in EPA per dropback (0.34) in the fourth quarter or overtime of a one-score game. Maye ranked 17th (0.08). Fourth quarter/OT in one-score games this season  StaffordMayeEPA per dropback \t\t\t\t0.34 \t\t\t\t0.08 \t\t\t\tYards per dropback \t\t\t\t8.0 \t\t\t\t6.6 \t\t\t\tTotal TD/turnovers \t\t\t\t9-2 \t\t\t\t1-2 \t\t\t\tThe Rams were 4-5 in one-score games this year, but we'll hardly blame Stafford for the terrible special teams that cost the team wins in Philadelphia and Seattle.  That should not take anything away from what Maye did, either. He really didn't have a ton of opportunities to come through in the clutch. The Patriots actually went 10 straight games without even trailing in the fourth quarter. OK, enough of the talk. Here's how a staff of 11 voted between Stafford and Maye. Should it be any indication of how the real MVP vote goes, it will be one of the closest in recent memory.  The voters (11) John Breech, NFL staff writerJared Dubin, NFL staff writerJosh Edwards, NFL Draft writerEmory Hunt, CBS Sports HQ analystKatie Mox, CBS Sports HQ analystZach Pereles, senior writerGarrett Podell, NFL staff writerTyler Sullivan, NFL staff writerJP Acosta, CBS Sports HQ analyst  Jordan Dajani, NFL writerDouglas Clawson, CBS Sports researcher and writer Matthew Stafford (5) \nThis is an incredibly close vote, but Stafford just barely squeaks it out, not only because his best was absolutely magnificent, but because he reached that level so often. Stafford had at least 250 passing yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions in eight different games, tying 2020 Aaron Rodgers and 2007 Tom Brady for most in a single season ever. Both of those guys won MVP. We talk about \"MVP moments\" a lot, but perhaps Stafford lacks a single standout one because he has so many candidates -- a simply outstanding season that's just enough to earn him the nod over Maye.  -- Zach PerelesNo disrespect to Maye and the New England Patriots, who clearly have a bright future together, but what exactly was their key victory this year? The Bills? The team they also lost to? The Patriots had a historically easy schedule, while the Rams had to battle in the NFL's toughest division. Matthew Stafford led the NFL in passing yards (4,707), passing touchdowns (46) and TD-INT ratio (46-8). The only other player to lead the NFL in all three categories was Tom Brady in 2007 -- which was arguably his best season. Every quarterback who has thrown 45 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season has won MVP. Why would that change now? -- Jordan DajaniWhen you look at the efficiency of Stafford and the effectiveness with which he runs the offense, especially in critical situations, it shows you how outstanding his play really has been this season. Coupling that fact with the fact that he is playing in an extremely tough division with a lot of high-leverage games, and still is performing at an absurd pace and remarkable level. He's having the same passing season Lamar Jackson had, in which Jackson should've won the MVP. Time to right a wrong and reward Stafford for his play. -- Emory HuntI don't think you can really go wrong here; it's like trying to decide between left Twix and right Twix, but I'm going to take the QB who led the NFL in passing yards and TD passes while playing against the toughest schedule in the NFL. Drake Maye was awesome this season, and if he wins, you won't hear any complaints from me, because he's equally deserving, but as I said, I'm giving the slight nod to Stafford. -- John BreechAs a salty 49ers fan, it pains me to admit this, but Stafford deserves MVP because he's been incredible in the toughest division in football. The NFC West has been a weekly street fight, and he's still making elite throws, answering every punch, and flat-out carrying his team. I hate that I respect it… But that's exactly what MVP looks like.  -- Katie Mox Drake Maye (6) \nStafford led in passing yards and touchdowns, but threw 105 more passes than Maye. Maye led the NFL in completion percentage, yards per attempt, passer rating, QBR and EPA per play. Throw in his work as a rusher, and I think he was ever-so-slightly more valuable over the course of the year. -- Jared Dubin When considering the supporting cast, Maye has done more to uplift that team than any other. The Rams were expected to be where they are now and the Patriots were an unexpected development. New England's offensive line was an issue, and the wide receivers were not all that inspiring on paper coming into the season. Maye has led an efficient, explosive offense through his capabilities as a runner and a passer.   -- Josh EdwardsThis is a tightly contested year for the MVP award, but my pick is Maye, given just how absurd this season is that he's having and the drastic improvement he's made from promising to elite. He's first in the NFL in EPA per play and second in Success Rate as a passer (min. 150 dropbacks), and what he's done on passes 20 or more air yards downfield has been almost video game-like. His 1.31 EPA per dropback on deep passes this season outpaces the NFL by such a large margin that the distance between first and second place (Seahawks QB Sam Darnold) is just under the margin between Darnold at second and Caleb Williams at 11th. On top of that, the biggest reason why the Patriots went from last in the AFC East to a division-winning 2-seed is Maye's rapid growth. This team isn't that drastically different when it comes to on-field talent. The only differences in receiving talent are a 32-year-old Stefon Diggs and journeyman Mack Hollins. Maye's elevation in play is why the Patriots are in this place, and for that, he's my MVP.  -- JP AcostaIf you take Maye out of New England and slot in a baseline QB, the Patriots are nowhere near the playoffs. Do the same thing with Stafford, and while they'll certainly be worse, it wouldn't be like the unmitigated disaster we'd see in Foxborough, which is why Maye is the pick here. He's done more with less.  -- Tyler SullivanDrake Maye was the more efficient passer, leading the league in completion percentage, yards per pass attempt, passer rating, completion percentage over expected and expected points added (EPA) per dropback. Maye did all that while throwing to a noticeably worse supporting cast: Stefon Diggs at 32 years old, fresh off a torn ACL, 31-year-old Hunter Henry and 2023 sixth-round pick Kayshon Boutte were his top targets. That's a little different than throwing to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams like Stafford. Maye is elevating a lesser supporting cast and still profiling as the NFL's most efficient passer with a 14-3 record, tied for the best team record in the NFL this season. Drake Maye is the 2025 NFL MVP.  -- Garrett PodellAt the end of the day, I'm siding with Maye in the MVP debate by a slim margin. Most of the narratives out there are BS or exaggerated and none move the needle enough to move me off Maye. Once you cut through all the noise, it really boils down to two deserving MVP seasons, with Maye getting the slight edge. He had a more productive season and his deep passing with a worse supporting cast was truly special. The cupcake schedule wasn't as soft as it appeared; it was actually closer to average in defending quarterbacks. You can't penalize him for the lack of clutch opportunities because the Patriots were in control in most of their games vs. weaker opponents, either.Maye is more deserving, but the margin is still razor-thin. And just think, we might be having a completely different discussion if the Rams had gotten the one seed and hadn't lost on the luckiest two-point conversion of all time in Seattle. I think that pretty much sums up how chaotic all of the discourse really is. Nuts. Plus, we'll still have another month to debate it too because the winner won't be announced until \"NFL Honors\" on Feb. 5. -- Douglas Clawson\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals begin on Thursday with a Fiesta Bowl matchup between the Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes and Ole Miss Rebels. No. 10 Miami (12-2) has authored a pair of upsets in its CFP run, most recently defeating Ohio State, 24-14, after going on the road to knock off Texas A&M in the first round.

Ole Miss has also scored 30-plus in eight straight overall, which is the longest active streak in FBS, as the team is actually averaging more points since Lane Kiffin's departure. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won a DII national title last year at Ferris State, and he's thrived in the postseason. Chambliss is 6-0 in his NCAA playoffs career, with a staggering 23 total touchdowns compared to just one turnover. He leads an offense which Miami could have problems keeping up with as the Hurricanes' two lowest offensive outputs of the season, in terms of total yards gained, have come in their last two games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover The Canes have won their last four games versus SEC teams, and they are 5-0 ATS this season versus ranked opponents. Miami's defense is as good as anyone's, ranking fourth in the nation in points allowed per game (13.1). It has allowed seven total touchdowns over its last six games, which were all wins, and the team also has three times as many takeaways (12) as giveaways (four) during this stretch. The Canes have also racked up 12 sacks in this CFP, which is already the second-most all-time in a single College Football Playoff. Additionally, Miami can keep Ole Miss' explosive offense on the sideline by attacking the Rebels' defense on the ground and eating up the clock. Just two SEC teams allow more yards per rush (4.2) than Ole Miss, which has allowed an average of 167 rushing yards over its last three games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Ole Miss picksFornelli has analyzied Ole Miss vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history.Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 48.5, having risen 2 points since opening at 46.5. Both teams are 9-5 against the spread this season.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. Mendoza has also been under pressure as of late as he's been sacked three-plus times in four of his last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game.

    "body": "\n        Liverpool held Arsenal to a goalless draw on Thursday, but the Gunners maintain a six-point lead atop the Premier League table that continues their status as the team to beat for this season's title.Arsenal's defensive shape stood out yet again, limiting the Reds to zero shots on target and 0.36 expected goals at the Emirates Stadium but the hosts did not fare all that much better in attack. Though they took nine shots and managed to put four on target, an attack featuring star Bukayo Saka and new signing Viktor Gyokeres strung together just 0.52 expected goals by the final whistle. Their low attacking output hindered their ability to extend their lead at the top of the table to eight points, which would have bolstered their title charge even further.The Gunners' chances of winning their first major title in two decades, though, did not take much of a hit thanks to Manchester City's 1-1 draw against Brighton and Hove Albion on Wednesday. They maintained the six-point advantage they had over City heading into the midweek fixtures, which remains their greatest-ever lead atop the table at this stage of the season. They currently boast a greater lead than last season's champions Liverpool did at this point in the season, when they had a five point advantage over Arsenal, and are still faring better than several recent champions.\nPremier League champions, last 10 seasonsSEASONTEAMTOTAL POINTSPOINTS PER GAME2024-25Liverpool842.212023-24Manchester City912.392022-23Manchester City892.242021-22Manchester City932.452022-21Manchester City862.262019-20Liverpool992.612018-19Manchester City982.582017-18Manchester City1002.632016-17Chelsea932.452015-16Leicester City812.13Arsenal are currently averaging 2.33 points per match, which puts them on pace for 89 points at the end of the campaign when rounding up. If they maintain this rate, they are faring better than three of the last 10 Premier League champions – last season's Liverpool side, which clocked in at 84 points, the 2020-21 Manchester City that racked up 86 points and the historic Leicester City team from the 2015-16 campaign. That Leicester team actually had the lowest point total of any in the last decade, collecting just 81 points, finishing 10 points ahead of Arsenal when all was said and done – despite the fact that the two sides were level on points 21 matches into that season.This iteration of the Gunners entered the midweek fixtures with a sizeable six-point lead, but not an unprecedented one. Eight teams in the history of the Premier League had seven or more points on the next best team through 20 matches, a statistic led by the 2017-18 Manchester City team that had a 15 point lead over Manchester United at that stage of the season and finished the season with an 11 point gap. Of that group, two went on to lose the title – the 1995-96 Newcastle United side with a seven point lead after 20 games that eventually finished four points behind Manchester United and the 2018-19 Liverpool team with a seven point advantage that fell one point behind Manchester City at season's end.\nPremier League teams will take part in FA Cup action over the weekend before returning to league play the following week. Arsenal have a chance to maintain their lead with a game against relegation contender Nottingham Forest on Jan. 17, while Manchester City will play in an all-important edition of the Manchester derby earlier that day.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the broadcast cameras focused solely on Indiana coach Curt Cignetti during the Rose Bowl, viewers may have thought the No. 1-ranked Hoosiers lost to No. 9 Alabama in a blowout. Instead, the inverse was true. Indiana obliterated the Crimson Tide, 38-3, leaving no doubt that it would advance to the College Football Playoff semifinal as the favorite to win its first national championship. Yet Cignetti did not crack a smile until after the game was over.Screenshots of Cignetti's facial expressions circulated across the Internet throughout the Rose Bowl. From his expressionless gaze to his looks of displeasure, the second-year Hoosiers coach never appeared satisfied with his team's performance in a game that was never in doubt. And that's exactly what he wanted.\"There's a lot of times I am happy. I just don't show I'm happy,\" Cignetti said in a joint press conference with Dan Lanning ahead of Friday's Peach Bowl. \"If I'm going to ask my players to play the first game, first play to play 150 the same regardless of the competitive circumstances, then I can't be seen on the sideline high-fiving people and celebrating, or what's gonna happen? What's the effect gonna be? That's why I am like I am during games.\"\nCignetti's demeanor during the CFP quarterfinal rout was no one-off occurrence. It was not some gimmick, either. Anyone who keeps a close eye on him during games -- whether it be a playoff battle or a regular-season matchup with an FCS opponent -- will see the same scowl.\n\"I gotta make important decisions and manage the game,\" Cignetti said. \"These decisions we have to make in terms of game management, when to use a timeout and when not to use a timeout, whether to be aggressive in two-minute … you gotta be dialed in and thinking ahead.\"Nothing could be more on-brand for the coach who built a boring-by-design superpower in Bloomington, Indiana in the span of just two years. Cignetti demands the absolute most of his players, and far more often than not, that is exactly what he gets. The Hoosiers rarely take their foot off the pedal regardless of what the scoreboard reads, and that is why the program that entered the year with more losses than any other in college football history is suddenly 25-2 under Cignetti's watch.\"I'll smile and celebrate later in the coaches' room with the coaches, maybe have a beer. Of course, in the playoffs, you gotta do nine or 10 different press conferences after the game, so that's about an hour and a half later. … So, no, I do smile, and I am happy -- at times.\"\nCignetti will surely be happy if Indiana (14-0) defeats No. 5 Oregon (13-1) in Friday's CFP semifinal showdown in Atlanta. The Hoosiers seek to improve to 2-0 on the year against the Ducks and move one step away from a national championship.\n            ",

But if I wait on Adebayo, then this ML probably isn't playable. Since it's the front end of a back-to-back for Miami, I tend to think the team gives him that extra day off, and he plays Saturday back at home.

    "body": "\n        Michigan has hired former longtime Utah coach Kyle Whittingham as the 22nd coach in program history, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Whttingham, 66, stepped down in December after 21 seasons leading the Utes, and he left the door open to continuing his legendary coaching career elsewhere. The deal, finalized on Friday, is for five years with an average salary of $8.2 million over the course of the contract, according to ESPN. Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck is expected to follow Whittingham to Michigan to assume the same position, while BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill is expected to be one of the names of interest to fill that role for the Wolverines under the new regime. Over more than three decades with the Utes, first as an assistant and then as head coach since 2005, Whittingham cultivated a clean image and a winning program. Both factors would make him attractive to the Wolverines, who are seeking to turn the page from a scandal-ridden era without taking a step back on the field.Michigan is in the midst of an external review focused on its handling of Sherrone Moore, who was fired with cause on Dec. 10 after evidence surfaced that he had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Moore, who had been the program's offensive coordinator during Jim Harbaugh's scandal-marred tenure, was subsequently charged with felony home invasion and stalking.\nWhittingham's final Utah team finished 10-2 (7-2 Big 12) this past season before the school announced on Dec. 13 that he would be stepping down to make way for head coach-in-waiting Morgan Scalley to begin his tenure. However, Whittingham is still slated to coach the Utes in the Las Vegas Bowl against Nebraska on New Year's Eve.Utah reached the Rose Bowl in both 2021 and 2022 under Whittingham after winning 11 games in 2019. Arguably his best season with the Utes came in 2008, however, when Utah went 13-0, beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl and finished No. 2 in the AP poll.Michigan's search processMoore's firing came after the early signing period for high school prospects and well before the transfer portal opens on Jan. 2, which eliminated any need for the Wolverines to rush the hiring process.\nThough Michigan was a late entrant to what's been a busy coaching carousel, the Wolverines have been the only Power Four school on the market for the past couple of weeks. Given the job's allure as one of the nation's best, the list of names connected to the opening in some capacity was strong.Among them have been Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham and Louisville's Jeff Brohm. The elevation of interim coach Biff Poggi also loomed as a potential option if the Wolverines struggled to find a suitable candidate. Poggi has been leading Michigan as it prepares to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Eve.Stabilizing forceHiring Whittingham instead of elevating Poggi, who is also 66, signals that Michigan is OK with a relatively short-term hire but that it wants to accomplish a couple of things in the meantime. First, landing one of the longest-tenured and most successful sitting head coaches at the Power Four level shows the Wolverines are serious about contending in the Big Ten and have no interest in taking a step back competitively as they sort their way through the wreckage of what Harbaugh and Moore left behind.\nElevating Poggi could have been interpreted as a gesture of surrender for the 2026 season after he went 6-16 as head coach at Charlotte in 2023 and 2024. Secondly, hiring Whittingham would show the university is intent on moving forward from its past. Poggi served two stints under Harbaugh at Michigan, including one as the program's associate head coach in 2021 and 2022. Fair or not, he is viewed as a product of that era.So while Whittingham may not be a long-term solution, he's more than a stopgap interim. He's a proven winner who can help the program turn the page from the turmoil of the Harbaugh and Moore eras. As he wipes the slate clean, the program can begin preparing to make a run at a huge name at some point in the relatively near future.Utah dynamicHiring Whittingham might set up an interesting tug of war for both staffers and players between Michigan and Utah. What's certain is that Whittingham will be without Scalley as his defensive coordinator for the first time since the 2015 season.\nAs Scalley launches his Utah tenure and puts his own spin on things there, will he be able to fend off a well-resourced Michigan program led by Whittingham? One of the top storylines to monitor will be Whittingham's appetite to recruit from Utah's roster and coaching staff. It was always assumed that when the Whittingham to Scalley transition occurred at Utah, Whittingham would be retiring.Instead, he has landed an even better job. If he attempts to build the Wolverines program with Utah talent, it could make for an awkward dynamic that would have been difficult to imagine just a few weeks ago.Kyle Whittingham's career success by the numbers Via CBS Sports Research177-88 record (.668) in 21 seasons as full-time Utah coach (2005-25)Most wins (177) by head coach in Utah program historyTied for second-longest tenured active head coach in FBS (behind Kirk Ferentz, 27 seasons)Eight seasons with 10+ winsThree conference titles (2008 Mountain West; 2021-22 Pac-12)Three-time conference Coach of the Year (2008 Mountain West; 2019 and 2021 Pac-12) \n            ",

    "body": "\nHere's a trivia question for you: What NBA team in the Eastern Conference has the longest current winning streak? That would be the (cue spacey intro from the song Sirius) ... Chicago Bulls.Yes, the Bulls (14-15), who sit in 10th place in the East, are the hottest team in the conference, having won four in a row. That's the second longest winning streak in the entire league, behind only the red-hot Spurs, who have won eight straight. On Friday Chicago will look to extend that winning streak to five when it takes on the Philadelphia 76ers at the United Center. The 76ers (16-12) sit in fifth place in the conference and are coming off a 114-106 loss to the Nets on Tuesday. Tyrese Maxey, who ranks third in the NBA in scoring (31.0 points per game), was limited to just 13 points on 3-of-14 shooting in that loss. Chicago is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Philadelphia.While 76ers vs. Bulls is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes nine NBA matchups and three college football bowl games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Dec. 26. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watch76ers at BullsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Chicago | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: 76ers +1.5\nEven though the Bulls have been winning, the defense has been more generous than Santa over the holidays. Over the last nine games, Chicago has a defensive rating of 119.5 points per 100 possessions; only four teams have been worse. At the same time, opponents are shooting 38.2% from beyond the 3-point arc. That doesn't bode well on Friday against Maxey, who is shooting 39.1% from deep. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NBA game 10,000 times, says Philadelphia has a 60.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to 76ers +1.5.Clippers at Trail BlazersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Portland | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Trail Blazers +2.5\nThe Los Angeles Clippers' last two games (wins over the Lakers and Rockets) don't mask the team's deficiencies on defense. The Clippers (8-21) are gifting 118.2 points per 100 possessions this season, which ranks 26th in the entire NBA. That could be trouble on Friday against Deni Avdija and the Blazers (12-18). Avdija is having an All-Star season, scoring a team-high 25.5 points per game while also averaging 7.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. The SportsLine Projection Model says Portland has a 65.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Blazers +2.5.College football best bets, where to watchRate Bowl: New Mexico vs. MinnesotaTime: 4:30 p.m. | Location: Phoenix | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Minnesota -1.5 | Expert: New Mexico +2.5 (Jeff Hochman)\nThe New Mexico Lobos are in the midst of one of the best seasons in program history. In their first year under coach Jason Eck, the Lobos (9-3) were this close to reaching the Mountain West Conference Championship Game but lost a weird tiebreaker to just miss out. With a win on Friday they would earn just the second 10-win season in program history and first since 1982. Meanwhile, Hochman notes that the Golden Gophers (7-5) went 1-5 against fellow bowl teams, were outgained in four of those five games and had a -141 yards per game differential. \"Minnesota went 0-5 on the road, and with the bowl being played in Arizona, the crowd is expected to strongly favor New Mexico,\" he says. However the SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says that the Golden Gophers, who own the nation's longest bowl winning streak (eight), have a 57.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Minnesota -1.5.First Responder Bowl: Florida International vs. UTSATime: 8 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: UTSA -5.5\nOpt-outs will play a huge role in the outcome of this game, and as of Friday morning the complete list of players who will not be participating has not been released. UTSA coach Jeff Traylor has said his team will be \"a shell of ourselves\" because of opt-outs and injuries, estimating to be without between 10 and 20 players. Meanwhile, FIU also will be without several starters, including three members of the secondary. The key to the game may come down to Panthers running back Kejon Owens against the Roadrunners defense. Owens ranks seventh in the nation in rushing yards per game (108.2) and earned Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year honors. He will face a UTSA defense that is allowing 155.5 rushing yards per game, which ranks 77th in the nation, and will be missing at least three linemen. Despite that, the SportsLine Projection Model says the Roadrunners have a 63.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to UTSA -5.5.Looking aheadNFL: Texans at ChargersTime: 4:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texans +108 | Expert: Texans +2.5 (R.J. White)\nTwo contenders in the AFC collide in a game with playoff implications when the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans square off at SoFi Stadium. The Chargers (11-4) have clinched a playoff spot and currently are the top wild card team in the AFC. Meanwhile, the Texans (10-5) have won an NFL-best seven in a row and hold the third and final wild card spot but are still in the hunt for the AFC South title. Behind a fierce pass rush, Houston leads the NFL in scoring defense (16.6 points per game) and will be facing a makeshift Los Angeles offensive line. White notes that the Texans were 1.5-point favorites on the lookahead line last week. \"This feels to me like it could be decided by 1-2 points, so I'll take the value off the lookahead for what I think is the better team overall,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model says that Houston wins 47.0% of the time and gives a C grade to Texans money line (+108).\n            ",

NFL Network is reporting that Crosby was informed by the team that he will not play Sunday due to the knee injury he has been dealing with \"since October.\" Additionally, Fox is reporting that the Raiders want to shut Crosby down for the final two games of the season -- a move Crosby \"vehemently\" disagrees with -- and the star pass rusher left the team's facilities in response. At 2-13, the Raiders and Giants are both in contention for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and their Week 17 meeting will have major implications on which team picks first in April. The Raiders are 1.5-point home underdogs against the Giants, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Crosby was asked about the possibility of the Raiders landing the No. 1 pick earlier this week and was blunt with his feelings on the subject.\"I don't give a s--- about the pick to be honest,\" Crosby told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world and that's what I'm focused on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence -- being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. That's [the NFL Draft] their job, the front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Battle for draft top pick: Giants at Raiders set for rare Week 17 matchup that NFL hasn't seen in 44 years\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 28-year-old Crosby, one of the NFL's top pass rushers, has long been thought of as a top trade candidate, especially for a Las Vegas team that seems headed toward a long rebuild period. The Dallas Cowboys reportedly showed significant interest in Crosby before the 2025 trade deadline, though no deal materialized.Crosby, who has been vocal about his desire to stay with the Raiders, signed a three-year contract extension worth $106.5 million in March. At the time, it made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. \nA fourth-round pick of the Raiders in the 2019 NFL Draft, Crosby has two second-team All-Pro honors and five Pro Bowl appearances during his time with the Raiders. He led the NFL in tackles for loss from 2022-23 and has reached double-digit sacks in three of the last four seasons. In 15 games this season, Crosby has 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time in a row, Michigan had to make its head coaching hire at an inopportune time. First, it was because of the departure of Jim Harbaugh after a national championship win. The Wolverines couldn't make a hire until Jan. 26, 2024, after Harbaugh left for the NFL The program eventually promoted offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore to head coach. Now, after Moore's personal scandal that embroiled the athletic department, the Wolverines were without a coach well into December. Michigan needed a stabilizing force to help bring both the football program and athletic department back to respectability. By hiring future Hall of Famer Kyle Whittingham, Michigan has found an ideal coach to lead them through this turbulent era. Whittingham, 66, is widely considered one of the greatest coaches in college football history. After taking over for Urban Meyer at Utah in 2005, he helped lead them from the Mountain West to the top of the Power Five. Whittingham has a 177-88 career record with two Pac-12 titles and a Mountain West crown.\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan hires Kyle Whittingham as former longtime Utah coach is tapped to lead Wolverines\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPerhaps most important, Whittingham has a spotless reputation during his standout career. His teams have featured few scandals and strong team cultures. At Michigan, he will provide a veteran, experienced hand -- a direct contrast to the foibles of the Moore era. And in both the short and long term, it will pay dividends. Whittingham helped lead a turnaround from 5-7 to 10-2 at Utah this season, spearheaded by a stacked offensive line. The defense remained an elite unit. The Utes just had the misfortune of playing the two best teams in the conference -- BYU and Texas Tech. If they missed one, there's a solid chance they would have been in the College Football Playoff. Now at Michigan, Whittingham will have more resources to win than any moment in legendary career. The Wolverines managed to pull No. 1 overall recruit Bryce Underwood to the program last year with a massive contract. Even after middling seasons, Moore managed to put together back-to-back top 11 recruiting classes. \nWhile Whittingham has never recruited at the most elite of the elite levels, he helped the Utes push into the top 25 national level. Even in his final Class of 2026, Whittingham helped land two top 100 recruits. With the monetary backing of Michigan, he should be able to swim in deeper waters. Whittingham is already backchanneling with some of the top assistant coaches in college football. Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck and BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill are both targets for Whittingham in Ann Arbor, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Both would be game-changing additions to the Big Ten. Additionally, Whittingham is proven enough that the administrative questions swirling around Michigan will be a non-factor. The university does not have a permanent president, and athletic director Warde Manuel is under fire after repeated scandals in the athletic department. That same department is also undergoing a major outside review; Whittingham is a strong enough culture-setter that he will not be distracted by the noise. \nGranted, the hire of Whittingham is a short-term decision. While Whittingham is more motivated to coach at 66 than even he expected, few coaches in college football coach past 70. Even now, Whittingham becomes the third-oldest coach in major college football, only behind Iowa's Kirk Ferentz and North Carolina's Bill Belichick. Over the offseason, Utah mutually decided to move on from Whittingham and promote coach-in-waiting Morgan Scalley to the head job. Whittingham hinted for years that he was close to retirement, and Scalley was first named coach-in-waiting all the way back in 2019. Finally, after six years, Utah decided to pull the trigger. Eventually, Michigan may have to do the same. However, three of the last four coaches at Michigan failed to make it through four full seasons. Those three coaches combined for only one 10-win season. Three good seasons from Whittingham would be far more welcome than taking a chance on a lesser coach and setting the program back. \nAnd when looking around the market, there were few obvious prospects available. Alabama's Kalen DeBoer and Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham both publicly announced they were returning. Louisville's Jeff Brohm was not seriously involved in the process, according to multiple reports. Several others signed long-term extensions, like Vanderbilt's Clark Lea and BYU's Kalani Sitake. Michigan hired a Hall of Fame coach to help shepherd them into the next era of the program. Even if it's a short-term solution, it's the perfect one for this moment. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. Unfortunately for the Steelers, they will be without their best player as they try to clinch the division on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.Pittsburgh announced Friday that star pass rusher T.J. Watt will miss the game despite returning to practice this week. Watt has been trending in the right direction after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling mishap. On Wednesday, he attended practice for the first time since undergoing surgery, though he was listed as a limited participant.The Steelers will now target a Week 18 return for Watt as they gear up for a playoff run. Just having Watt back on the practice field provided a boost to his teammates.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \"TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"  He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt has 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        JJ Redick's frustrations with his Los Angeles Lakers team have been evident for some time now. You see it in some of his angry timeouts, in the shots some of his players take and the defensive miscues many of them make. The Lakers have stayed near the top of the Western Conference largely because of their stellar work in close games, winning all 10 of their games that have reached clutch time. That was never sustainable. Whenever they encounter a team that's bigger and more athletic than they are, their flaws are laid bare for the whole world to see.That's what happened on Christmas, when the Lakers were blown out and bullied by the Houston Rockets. Just as they were by the San Antonio Spurs in the quarterfinals of the NBA Cup, the slower Lakers were exposed on a marquee stage. And Redick has had enough of it.\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\" He went on to blast his team's \"effort and execution,\" and he promised that the team would have an \"uncomfortable\" practice on Saturday, ahead of their game against the Sacramento Kings.Maybe there's a short-term burst coming, but the notion that effort is a choice in the modern NBA is pretty outdated. In today's ultra-fast, ultra-deep league, it's a skill, and it was one that quietly carried the Lakers through long stretches of the regular season last year. Remember the banshees, Redick's term for his energetic role players? Well, Jarred Vanderbilt and Gabe Vincent have been nonfactors offensively, making them tough to play consistently. Dorian Finney-Smith, acquired last December, is gone now. He signed with Houston for the mid-level exception. Given his age and the injury he was dealing with, that might have been a defensible loss for the Lakers at the price Houston paid.\nBut why on Earth is Jordan Goodwin thriving on Phoenix's bench instead of their own right now? Goodwin was an essential reserve last season. The Lakers waived him to make room under their first-apron hard cap for Marcus Smart. They could have attempted to use draft capital or cash to clear any of a number of less valuable players off of their roster to accommodate Goodwin, with Bronny James being the most notable. Instead, they let go of a younger, healthier player to add an older, injury-prone one. Smart has been effective when he's played, but health has predictably been an issue.There was never much of a question that the Lakers would prioritize someone like Smart over someone like Goodwin. Smart is a name brand, a Defensive Player of the Year with high-level playoff experience. The Lakers have a habit of prioritizing such players. Deandre Ayton was their most notable example of that this offseason. Rob Pelinka loves his former high draft picks. Since the disastrous Russell Westbrook trade cost the Lakers most of their depth, he's been trying to replace it with down-on-their-luck lottery picks. In the five seasons since that deal, they've acquired 10 former first-round picks with five or fewer years of experience as buy-low swings: Malik Monk, Lonnie Walker, Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura, Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish and now, Ayton, Nick Smith and Jake LaRavia. Meanwhile, smart teams are consistently plucking high-energy former second-round picks and undrafted free agents off of the Lakers and watching them blossom into exactly the sort of players the Lakers need right now. Goodwin in Phoenix. Scotty Pippen Jr. in Memphis. Jay Huff in Indiana. And, most notably, Alex Caruso in Chicago and Oklahoma City.\nAyton is a good player. Hachimura is a good player. Neither of them have ever been high-effort players, and that's frankly because the Lakers have never really valued high-effort players. The scouting department finds gems for them on the margin, but Pelinka would rather have skill and draft pedigree, which is valuable in context, but exactly what isn't needed on a team led by Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves and a 41-year-old LeBron James. And nearly a year after getting Dončić and changing the course of their franchise for the next 5-10 years, he still seemingly hasn't adjusted to his franchise player's needs. Or his coach's for that matter.Fans have had all sorts of complaints for Redick lately. They think Hachimura should come off the bench. They think Vincent shouldn't play at all and that two-way guard Nick Smith has to play more. There are grains of truth in these complaints. It's possible that the Lakers haven't fully optimized their rotation yet. But at a certain point, you're just shuffling deck chairs. Redick can potentially make lemonade out of these lemons, but he can't make the champagne these fans expect every June. He just doesn't have the ingredients.We've been having versions of these same conversations for years now, and at a certain point, attention needs to turn to the person shopping for the groceries. The Lakers have a new owner in Mark Walter whose track record with the Dodgers suggests he has nearly limitless resources to spend in building a first-class organization. When he took over the Dodgers, he quickly replaced incumbent general manager Ned Colleti with Andrew Friedman and has won three World Series since.\nPelinka is now in Colleti's position. His coach is stating outright that this team needs energy and effort. The league as a whole is shifting toward energy and effort. When the Lakers lose on big stages, it's usually to teams that play with, you guessed it, energy and effort. The trade deadline is a bit more than a month away. If this team is going to have any hope of genuinely contending for a championship, it will have to add energy and effort. If they can't do that, well, it would be hard to justify keeping the general manager who's spent the past half-decade or so ignoring it almost completely.\n            ",

If that happens, the Steelers may be inclined to rest several starters, including 42-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Either way, Sunday's game may include the culmination of Myles Garrett's season-long pursuit of the NFL's single-season sack record. Garrett, who has tormented the Steelers in Cleveland in recent years, needs just one sack on Sunday to break that record that is currently shared by former Giants pass rusher Michael Strahan and current Steelers T.J. Watt. Where to watch Steelers vs. Browns liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, Ohio  TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 33.5 (via DraftKings)Steelers vs. Browns: Need to know Myles the menace. Garrett sacked Steelers quarterbacks five times in Cleveland's last two home games vs. Pittsburgh. \"He's a game wrecker,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said of Garrett earlier this week. \"He provides the wave that others ride, and particularly in that environment when you're working on silent counts and one-dimensional passing circumstances, etc. It is significant.\" No DK. The Steelers will be without leading receiver DK Metcalf for this game after he was suspended for two games by the NFL stemming from his altercation with a Lions fan during Pittsburgh's Week 16 win in Detroit. Tomlin specifically mentioned Roman Wilson has someone whom he hopes steps up amid Metcalf's absence. A 2024 third-round pick, Wilson has 12 catches and two touchdowns this season, but his role has diminished with the recent additions of Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. More Mason? If Baltimore loses Saturday night, there's a good chance that Mason Rudolph will either start or get significant reps Sunday in Cleveland. Rudolph has already started (and lost) two games in Cleveland: in 2019 and during the final game of the 2020 season. In the later game, he threw for a career-high 315 yards in a 24-22 loss. Cleveland doesn't rock for Pittsburgh. Cleveland has been a house of horrors for the Steelers as of late. Since 2018, the Steelers are just 1-5-1 in Cleveland that includes three consecutive losses. Tomlin, when asked what has often led to his team's struggles in Cleveland, kept his answer simple: \"Myles Garrett.\" Shedeur's sixth start. Sunday will be Shedeur Sanders' introduction into one of the NFL's oldest rivalries. Sanders' first five starts yielded mixed results. While he has shown flashes of his potential, Sanders is nonetheless completing just 55.1% of his passes with more interceptions (8) than touchdown passes (6). Steelers vs. Browns prediction, pick \nStatistically, the Browns have the NFC North's best defense, led by veteran defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. That defense has kept them in numerous games this season, and it might do so again Sunday against a Steelers offense that won't have Metcalf and may decide to rest some of its starters if the division title is already locked up.\nIf the division is still up for grabs, though, I don't see the Steelers losing this one, not with how well Rodgers has played in recent weeks. Rodgers & Co. will be highly motivated to take care of business so that they can rest in Week 18 while getting an early start on the playoffs. Pick: Steelers -3.5, Under 33.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        We are in the thick of Week 17 in the NFL, with the Christmas Day slate already providing us with three matchups. Now, as we look towards the rest of these games on the docket, the playoff picture in the NFL is coming more into focus. Thursday's action officially ousted the Detroit Lions from playoff contention and, in the process, clinched a playoff berth for the Green Bay Packers. As for the rest of the slate, the Houston Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win on Sunday, while various division titles could also be handed out in Week 17 if certain dominoes fall. While we'd simply like to just focus on the various playoff clinching scenarios throughout the league, injuries are going to play a central storyline to Week 17, as it does every week in the NFL. Below, we'll dive into the final injury reports across the league and detail who is in, out, and who has their status still in question leading up to kickoff. All Week 17 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5) (Saturday)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusTexansTrent BrownOTAnkle, kneeOutJamal HillLBCalf, wristOutAjani CarterDBHamstringOutDarrell TaylorDEAnkleOutJustin WatsonWRCalfOutAireontae ErseryOTThumbQuestionableChargersDerius DavisWRAnkleOutR.J.

Meanwhile, Derek Stingley Jr. carries no injury designation after being limited this week with an oblique injury. On Friday, Houston downgraded Carter, Taylor, and Watson to out after initially being listed as questionable. Mekhi Becton logged a full practice for the Chargers on Thursday, which has him trending in a positive direction despite his questionable designation. Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers (-4.5) (Saturday)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRavensTaven BryanDTKneeOutLamar JacksonQBBackDoubtfulPackersKristian WelchLBAnkleOutJohn WilliamsGBackOutJordan LoveQBLeft shoulder, concussionOutMalik WillisQBRight shoulder, illnessQuestionableBo MeltonCBIllnessQuestionableSean RhyanOTKnee, illnessQuestionableZach TomGBack, kneeQuestionableChristian WatsonWRShoulder, illnessQuestionableEvan WilliamsSKneeQuestionableLamar Jackson did not practice at all this week, which seems to put Snoop Huntley in line to start on Saturday.After initially listing Jordan Love as questionable, the Packers downgraded him to out on Friday. That'll thrust Malik Willis in as the starter, so long as he is cleared. Willis did not participate on Wednesday, but returned on Thursday on a limited basis. Jacksonville Jaguars (-6) at Indianapolis ColtsTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusJaguarsPatrick MekariOLBackOutDanny StriggowDLAnkleOutJalen McLeodLBAnkleOutBhayshul TutenRBFingerQuestionableRobert HainseyOLGroinQuestionableColtsTanor BortoliniCConcussionOutDeForest BucknerDTNeckOutAnthony GouldWRFootOutAndrew OgletreeTENeckOutAnthony RichardsonQBEyeOutDaniel ScottSKneeOutJT TuimoloauDEObliqueOutDalton TuckerGShoulderQuestionableBernhard RaimannOTElbowQuestionableBuddy JohnsonLBIllnessQuestionableTyler GoodsonRBAnkleQuestionableSauce GardnerCBCalfQuestionableAshton DulinWRHamstringQuestionableTuten (finger) was a limited participant throughout the week, which gives him a good shot at suiting up on Sunday. The Colts are placing DeForest Buckner on injured reserve, so his season is done. On a positive note, Indy looks like they'll welcome back Sauce Gardner after he was a full participant during Friday's practice. New Orleans Saints (-2.5) at Tennessee Titans TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSaintsBryan BreseeDTKneeOutAlvin KamaraRBKnee, ankleOutZaire Mitchell-PadenTEKneeOutCesar RuizGAnkleOutMason TiptonWRGroinQuestionableChris OlaveWRBackQuestionableCharlie SmythKIllnessQuestionableTitansMarcus HarrisCBKneeOutOluwafemi OladejoOLBFibulaOutBryce OliverWRKneeOutMicah RobinsonCBIllnessQuestionableAli GayeOLBKneeQuestionableChris Olave was downgraded to a limited participant during Friday's practice and is now questionable due to a back injury.

The club has already ruled out David Njoku after he did not practice this week, and Harold Fannin Jr. is questionable after popping up on the injury report Friday with a groin injury. Backup quarterback Dillon Gabriel also appeared on the injury report for the first time Friday with a left shoulder injury.Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals (-7.5) TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusCardinalsBudda BakerSConcussion, thumbOutEvan BrownOLNot injury-relatedOutKei'Trel ClarkCBBackOutParis Johnson Jr.OLKneeOutJosh SweatLBAnkle, kneeQuestionableHjalte FroholdtOLElbowQuestionableMarvin Harrison Jr.WRHeelQuestionableWill JohnsonCBThumb, chestQuestionableMax MeltonCBHeelQuestionableJalen ThompsonSHamstringQuestionableBengalsJoseph OssaiDEAnkleOutMatt LeeCKneeOutCharlie JonesWRAnkleOutCam GrandyTEChestOutNoah FantTEAnkleQuestionableB.J.

Meanwhile, Marvin Harrison Jr. was limited on Friday with a heel injury and is questionable. Noah Fant was elevated to a full participant during Friday's practice, which is a good sign for his availability despite that questionable designation. Meanwhile, Josh Newton appeared on the injury report on Friday due to a hamstring injury, which has him questionable. New England Patriots (-13.5) at New York JetsTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPatriotsKayshon BoutteWRConcussion protocolOutMack HollinsWRAbdomenOutHarold LandryLBKneeOutRobert SpillaneLBAnkleOutKhyiris TongaDLFootOutJared WilsonGConcussion protocolOutDeMario DouglasWRHamstringQuestionableTreVeyon HendersonRBConcussion protocolQuestionableCharles WoodsCBFootQuestionableJetsKiko MauigoaLBNeckOutWill McDonald IVDLKneeOutMason TaylorTENeckOutJay TufeleDLFootOutXavier NewmanOLKneeQuestionableNew England's receiving unit will be thin in Week 17 with Boutte and Hollins both out, along with Douglas as questionable. On a more positive note, TreVeyon Henderson was a full participant on Friday, so he is trending in a positive direction. Meanwhile, the defense will also be down a handful of key contributors, including Landry and Spillane. Head coach Mike Vrabel also announced that Milton Williams will not be activated off of IR for this game. Tyrod Taylor did not practice with the Jets on Friday, but the team noted it was due to non-injury-related reasons. The veteran quarterback does not have an injury designation. Seattle Seahawks (-7) at Carolina PanthersTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawksCoby BryantSKneeOutCharles CrossOTHamstringOutPanthersTrevin WallaceILBShoulderOutTershawn WhartonDTHamstringOutRobert HuntGBicepsQuestionableDavid MooreWRElbowQuestionableSeattle will be down its starting left tackle with Charles Cross ruled out.

Meanwhile, Robert Hunt is questionable after returning to practice this week for the first time since going on IR after Week 2. He still needs to be activated onto the 53-man roster before Sunday. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-5.5) at Miami DolphinsTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBuccaneersCalijah KanceyDTPectoralOutTristan WirfsOTToeOutAnthony NelsonOLBKneeOutDolphinsMinkah FitzpatrickSCalfOutIsaiah JohnsonCBKneeOutBenito JonesDTBackOutDee EskridgeWRToeDoubtfulAaron BrewerOLNeckQuestionableTyrel DodsonLBChestQuestionableJason SandersKRight hipQuestionableAndrew MeyerOLTricepsQuestionableNeither Wirfs nor Nelson practiced at all this week and have since been ruled out.

Thomas was sidelined throughout the week with a hamstring injury. \nThe Raiders placed star tight end Brock Bowers on injured reserve earlier this week, ending his season and ruling him out for Week 17. Star pass rusher Maxx Crosby is being held out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Giants, and Week 18, due to a knee injury he's been battling most of the season. Crosby was not happy. Elsewhere, Bech appeared on the injury report on Friday with a back injury that now has him questionable.Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (-1.5)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusEaglesNakobe DeanLBHamstringOutLane JohnsonOLFootOutCameron WilliamsOTShoulderQuestionableBillsDaQuan JonesDTCalfOutJordan PhillipsDTAnkleOutJordan PoyerSHamstringOutMatt PraterKRight quadOutDalton KincaidTEKneeQuestionableDawson KnoxTEKneeQuestionableJalen Carter was a full participant at practice this week and carries no designation, so he will play in Week 17.

He also has no injury designation. After being limited on Wednesday and Thursday, Josh Allen was elevated as a full participant on Friday and carries no injury designation for Week 17 despite dealing with a foot injury. As for two of his top targets, tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox both returned to practice on a limited basis on Friday after missing the bulk of the week due to knee injuries. Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers (-3)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBearsNick McCloudDBIllnessOutRome OdunzeWRFootOutJosh BlackwellDBIllnessQuestionableNahshon WrightDBHamstring, illnessQuestionableT.J.

On a more positive note, however, they'll get Luther Burden III (ankle) back in the fold. San Francisco is holding out hope they'll have George Kittle available on Sunday night, listing the veteran tight end as questionable as he deals with an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Ricky Pearsall returned to practice this week after missing Monday's win over Indy and seems to be trending in the right direction. \nLos Angeles Rams (-7.5) at Atlanta Falcons (Monday)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRamsFalconsAnalysis to come.\n            ",

The Dolphins are coming off a 45-21 beatdown loss that came at the hands of Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals, while the Buccaneers were upset by the rival Carolina Panthers, 23-20.Despite the loss to Carolina last Sunday, the Buccaneers aren't dead yet. The Panthers have a tough matchup this week against the Seattle Seahawks, meaning we could be looking at a win-and-in Week 18 showdown in Tampa. As for the Dolphins, they have already been eliminated from playoff contention and are trying out a new quarterback. We'll get more into that later. Let's break down this interconference matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Buccaneers vs. Dolphins liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -5.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Buccaneers vs. Dolphins: Need to knowQuinn Ewers' debut. The rookie quarterback out of Texas completed 20 of 30 passes for zero touchdowns and two interceptions in his first NFL start. Miami was actually down just three points at the halftime before the Bengals scored 21 unanswered in the third quarter. Miami rushing attack. Predictably, the Dolphins wanted to run the ball to support their rookie signal-caller. De'Von Achane led the charge with 81 rushing yards and a touchdown, Jaylen Wright chipped in 35 yards and a touchdown, then Malik Washington scored a rushing touchdown as well. That made Miami the third team to have rushing touchdowns scored by three different players in a 20-point loss over the last 75 seasons. Mike McDaniel's job security. League sources indicated to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones a belief that Mike McDaniel is likely to return as head coach of the Dolphins in 2026. Multiple prospective head coach and general manager candidates, as well as agents, told CBS Sports they are now operating under the belief the Dolphins will keep McDaniel.A season-altering losing streak. The Buccaneers have lost three straight games, and six out of the last seven following a 6-2 start. At one point, Mayfield looked like an MVP favorite while the Bucs looked like the easy choice to win the NFC South. That is no longer the case. What happened to the Bucs defense? Tampa Bay ranks No. 22 in total yards allowed per game (343.3), No. 24 in scoring defense (25.1 points allowed per game) and No. 27 in pass defense (242.0 passing yards allowed per game). The Bucs also have the second-worst opponent red-zone touchdown percentage (71.1%) in the league.CategoryFirst eight gamesLast seven gamesW-L6-21-6Points per game differential+2.4-7.0Turnover margin+7+1Buccaneers at Dolphins: prediction, pick\nThe Buccaneers have not been a good team to bet on this season. Their 5-10 against-the-spread record is tied for worst in the NFL, and they are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games. With that being said, I'll go out on a limb and say Todd Bowles' defense and Mayfield's offense hit the field with aggression. This team is better than they've played over the past few weeks, and they understand it's do-or-die. Pick: Buccaneers -5.5, Over 45.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Florida International Panthers face the UTSA Roadrunners in the 2025 First Responder Bowl on Friday night. FIU is coming off a 56-16 win at Sam Houston  State on Nov. 29, while UTSA dropped a 27-24 decision to Army that same day. FIU (7-5), who finished tied for fourth in Conference USA at 5-3, have won four in a row. UTSA (6-6), who tied for sixth in the American Conference, have won two of three. Both sides are expected to be down multiple key players due to injuries and the transfer portal, with FIU particularly decimated in the secondary. FIU's quarterback situation is a bit unclear as well after Keyone Jenkins and Joe Pesansky both dealt with injuries late in the season. Both could play in some capacity on Friday. Kickoff from Gerald J. Ford Stadium in Dallas is at 8 p.m. ET. The Roadrunners are 7-point favorites in the latest FIU vs. UTSA odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 61.5, up four from the opening line.

The offense has some balance and QB Jack Layne a knack for making plays. Yet note Mountain West reps are 0-3 SU and vs. the spread in bowls after UNLV's Tuesday loss to Ohio.  Plus, here's our chance to ride the nation's hottest bowl streak, with the Gophers winning eight straight in postseason, the last six of those under PJ \"King of Minor Bowls\" Fleck. There are some portal defections to consider but not QB Drake Lindsey or top RB Darius Taylor, both apparently a go for Phoenix.

The Lobos posted a 4-2 SU record, 5-1 ATS, and finished 3-3 in the stats. Minnesota opponent's win percentage is .545. The Golden Gophers went 1-5 SU, were outgained in four of five games, and had a -141 YPGD. Minnesota went 0-5 on the road, and with the Bowl being played in Arizona, the crowd is expected to strongly favor New Mexico. Jason Eck’s remarkable turnaround at New Mexico has generated significant momentum for the program. The Lobos are bowl-eligible for the first time since 2016 and have won six straight games. Eager for their 10th win, the Lobos are driven to make a statement by defeating a Big Ten opponent.\n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Chip Patterson\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +333\n        \n        \n            (64%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            9-5 in Last 14 NCAAF Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                NMEX @ MINN • Fri 4:30pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                MINN -1.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -110\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Spread\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 26 @ 8:54am\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Minnesota coach P.J.

In terms of opt-outs, reports are pointing to both star running back Darius Taylor and defensive end Anthony Smith playing in this game. New Mexico has had a great season under Jason Eck but this is a low line for a Big Ten team with a history of bringing its best in the postseason. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Mike Tierney\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +226\n        \n        \n            (58%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            11-8 in Last 19 NCAAF Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                NMEX @ MINN • Fri 4:30pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                MINN -1.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -108\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Spread\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 26 @ 1:07pm\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Under coach P.J. Fleck, Minnesota is 6-0 SU in bowls. Given that the Gophers generally land in second- and third-tier bowls, the evidence is incontrovertible that the tie-wearing coach knows how to get teams ready for these low-stakes games. New Mexico, picked to finish second-to-last in the Mountain West, was a massive overachiever. The preseason forecast reflects how the Lobos' modest talent is perceived. Minnesota's size advantage on the O-line should allow the Gophers to rev up their rushing game.  \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Mike Tierney\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +258\n        \n        \n            (64%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            7-4 in Last 11 NCAAF O/U Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                CMICH @ NWEST\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Over 42.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -115\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Over/Under\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    LOSS\n                \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 26 @ 11:42am\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Historically, this is a bowl game of sky-high scores. (Last year's gem had plenty of points before the half-dozen overtimes). While both teams' profile is defense-first, that includes forcing turnovers, which can lead to scores off short fields. The return of Angel Flores from injury to pair with Joe Labas gives Central Michigan two capable QBs with different styles. MAC teams have scored on Northwestern before, with a 4-4 SU record. The Wildcats can, too, exceed their modest offensive stats in light of CMU allowing 45 points to Pitt and 63 to Michigan in its only games against Power Four opponents. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                        \n            \n        \n        \n    ",

    "body": "\nOfficially, the NFL playoffs do not begin until Jan. 10. But don't tell that to coach DeMeco Ryans, whose Houston Texans face the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\"Right now, this is a playoff game versus the Chargers,\" he said during his weekly Wednesday press conference. \"We know they have a lot to play for. We have a lot to play for. How else would you want it?\"There is certainly much riding on Saturday's matchup. The game features two of the hottest teams in the league. The Chargers (11-4) have won four in a row and seven of their last eight and are still in the hunt for the AFC West title as well as the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC playoffs. Meanwhile, the Texans (10-5) are on a NFL-best seven-game winning streak and can clinch a spot in the postseason with a win or tie (or a Colts loss or tie on Sunday to the Jaguars). Houston also could win its division but needs an unlikely loss by Jacksonville this week or next.\nBut according to the SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model, the loser of Saturday's game could actually come out as the winner in the long run.The winner of Saturday's game has a good shot of being the top wild card team in the AFC, if not a division champion. That team would have a wild card round matchup against the worst division champion, which figures to be either the Steelers (9-6) or Ravens (7-8). Meanwhile, the loser of Saturday's game would face, if the current standings hold, either the Patriots (12-3) or Jaguars (11-4) on the road.But the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has both Pittsburgh and Baltimore higher than New England and Jacksonville in its power ratings.AFC rankTeamNeutral win%1Bills63.10%2Texans61.20%3Broncos60.60%4Ravens57.80%5Steelers57.10%6Patriots56.60%7Jaguars56.10%8Chargers55.90%Los Angeles is a 1.5-point favorite over Houston in the latest odds from DraftKings.Saturday's game is a rematch of a wild card playoff game last season, which the Texans won 32-12. In that game, Houston intercepted Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert four times, which was one more interception than he had thrown all regular season.This year, the Texans feature the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL at 16.6 points per game. They will go up against a makeshift Los Angeles offensive line that will be missing its starting tackles.\"This is where you want to be in December,\" Ryans says. \"You want to be playing meaningful games, and that is what this team has earned.\"\n            ",

Love did not clear protocol to return for his team's important Week 17 home game and was officially downgraded to out on Friday. Malik Willis is expected to start in Love's absence.Love was injured when he was sacked by Chicago defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter last week. Love sustained helmet-to-helmet contact from Booker, who was flagged for roughing the passer while Love remained on the turf for several minutes. After being evaluated, Love was ruled out for the remainder of the game and the Bears went on to stun the Packers 22-16 in overtime, grabbing control of the NFC North lead in the process.Significant injuries are piling up for Green Bay in recent weeks, with star pass rusher Micah Parsons out for the season after suffering a torn ACL. Now, Love is sidelined for at least the week as Green Bay pushes for playoff positioning in the NFC.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Packers earn berth after Vikings eliminate Lions; Broncos chasing AFC's top seed\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Packers have already clinched a spot in the playoffs thanks to the Detroit Lions' loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, and there is still some hope they can catch the Bears to win the division. A Green Bay loss or Chicago win on Saturday would shut down any hopes of a division win, however, and Green Bay will now be without key players on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball.Willis is expected to be under center for Green Bay on Saturday, though Willis was also listed as questionable on the injury report after suffering a shoulder injury at the end of regulation against the Bears. Willis has also been battling an illness this week.\nThe Ravens will also likely be starting a backup quarterback as Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful due to a back contusion as Baltimore is playing to remain in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs. Even with a Baltimore win on Saturday, the Ravens would miss the playoffs if the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. If Jackson cannot play, Tyler Huntley would start for Baltimore.\n            \n    ",

The Seahawks are in this position after pulling off an improbable, come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16. Carolina (8-7) can stay ahead of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC South standings if they are able to defeat the Seahawks. The Panthers are currently holding onto the NFC's No. 4 seed after recording a 23-20 win over the Buccaneers last Sunday. \nWhere to watch Seahawks vs. Panthers liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North Carolina TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -7, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Seahawks vs. Panthers: Need to know Tough to beat. It's hard to find a weakness on Seattle's team. They're currently No. 3 in the league in scoring, second in points allowed, and have one of the league's top returners in Rashid Shaheed, who made the Pro Bowl less than a week after returning a punt 58 yards for a score during Seattle's win over Los Angeles. Elite WR. This has been a breakout season for former first-round pick Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who currently leads the NFL with 1,637 receiving yards. He's built a quick rapport this season with new quarterback Sam Darnold, who was just named to his second straight Pro Bowl. Just being Ernest. Seattle's defense has gotten stellar play this year from several players, especially linebacker Ernest Jones. Despite missing two games, Jones leads the team with 116 tackles and five interceptions. He had two interceptions -- including a pick-six -- during Seattle's Week 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Third-down woes. If the Seahawks have an Achilles heel, it's their third-down offense as they are currently 23rd in the league in that area. Fortunately for them, they'll be facing a Panthers defense that is 30th in the league on third down. Ground and pound? A strength of for a large portion of the season, the Panthers' running game hasn't been as good in recent weeks. Rico Dowdle recently crossed the 1,000-yard barrier, but he hasn't rushed for over 58 yards in six weeks. Chuba Hubbard, who had a season-high 83 rushing yards during the Panthers' Week 13 win over the Rams, has toted the rock just 14 times over the past two games. Emerging rookie. Panthers rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan has quietly been having a highly-successful rookie season. His 924 receiving yards is nearly 600 more yards than Carolina's second leading receiver. Stingy secondary. Carolina's defense has been led by cornerbacks Jaycee Horn and Mike Jackson. The duo has combined to record eight interceptions, with Horn having a team-high five picks. Jackson's 17 pass breakups leads the entire league. Seahawks vs. Panthers prediction, pick \nOn paper, this should be a win for the Seahawks, who are trying to secure the top seed in the playoffs first the first time since 2014. That being said, the Panthers' 2025 season has largely been defined by upset wins over teams considered superior. I'm baking on that happening again on Sunday, largely because of Carolina's opportunistic defense and the reliable play of quarterback Bryce Young. Pick: Panthers +7, Under 42.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

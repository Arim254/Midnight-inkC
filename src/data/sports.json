The 49ers will host the Rams at 4:25 p.m. ET, with Los Angeles listed as a 5.5-point road favorite. Elsewhere, the Seahawks are seven-point favorites against the Cardinals and the Chargers are three-point favorites against the Steelers on Sunday Night Football in a game with an over-under of 44.5.SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Under (49.5) in 49ers vs. Rams and is also targeting the Seahawks and Steelers to cover the spread in their respective matchups. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 49.5 in 49ers vs. RamsThese division rivals have gone Under in nine of their last 12 meetings in San Francisco, including a 12-6 final last December in a game that had an over/under of 48.5. They combined for 49 points when they met in Los Angeles on Oct. 2, but the total closed at 43.5 points in that matchup, and it took overtime to get to 49. Given the 49ers' slew of injuries on both sides of the ball and the inflated total compared to their first meeting of the year, the model has the Under cashing in 63% of simulations. Bet 49ers vs. Rams at bet365 here:  Seahawks -6.5 vs. CardinalsSeattle has dominated this rivalry in recent years, going 9-1 straight up and 8-2 against the spread in the last 10 meetings. The Seahawks have won the last three games at home by 10 points, and they are riding a three-game winning streak entering this contest. Arizona continues playing without starting quarterback Kyler Murray (foot), so the model has Seattle covering 56% of the time. Bet Seahawks vs. Cardinals at bet365 here:  Steelers +2.5 vs. ChargersThis has been another lopsided series of late, with Pittsburgh winning 11 of the last 15 matchups and covering the spread in seven of the last eight meetings hosted by the Chargers. Los Angeles could be without three starters along the offensive line, which does not bode well against a Pittsburgh defense that racked up 19 total pressures and five sacks in a win over Indianapolis last week. The Steelers rank second in the NFL in turnover differential, and Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has thrown an interception in three straight games, which are all reasons why the model has Pittsburgh covering the spread in 54% of simulations. Bet Steelers vs. Chargers at bet365 here:  \nLooking for more Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Sunday.

The Week 10 Sunday NFL schedule includes top matchups such as Rams vs. 49ers (+5.5, 49.5) to consider for online sports betting options on Sunday.The day's slate wraps up with Steelers vs. Chargers on Sunday Night Football, and the SportsLine model projects value in backing an upset, having the Aaron Rodgers-led Pittsburgh Steelers as one of its Sunday best bets at DraftKings. The Steelers are +129 underdogs, but the model likes the value of playing the Steelers to improve to 6-3 on the season. Its Sunday best bets at DraftKings also include backing a pair of favorites to cover the spread, playing the Lions (-7.5, 49.5) vs. Commanders and Seahawks (-7, 44.5) vs. Cardinals. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

Kickoff is scheduled for 4:25 p.m. ET and Washington is 3-6 during an injury-riddled season while Detroit is off to a 5-3 start. These two teams met in last year's NFC divisional round, with the Commanders scoring a 45-31 upset win as 8-point road underdogs. Now they're 8-point home underdogs with Marcus Mariota starting in Daniels' place for the fourth time this season. Back the Lions at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Seahawks (-7) vs. CardinalsSam Darnold was nearly perfect on Sunday Night Football, completing 21 of 24 passes for 330 yards and four touchdowns with one interception as the Seahawks defeated the Commanders, 38-14. Darnold has gone from a questionable starter to arguably one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL with the third-best quarterback rating (116.0) in the league. Seattle is fifth in the NFL in scoring offense (28.9 ppg) and scoring defense (18.8 ppg) and is 6-2 on the season. Meanwhile, the Cardinals are 3-5 on the year. Seattle has won eight straight against Arizona, and the model expects that to continue on Sunday, projecting the Seahawks to win and cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Seahawks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Steelers moneyline vs. Chargers (+136)You won't find a divisional leader more disrespected this season than the Pittsburgh Steelers, but when it comes to finding value, that plays to a sports bettor's advantage. The Steelers are 5-3 with a two-game lead in the AFC North, despite being the underdogs to win their division. The Steelers are coming off a 27-20 upset victory over the Colts, handing Indianapolis just its second loss of the season. Pittsburgh is 2-1 straight-up as the underdog this season. Meanwhile, the Chargers have already lost as home favorites to the Commanders and Colts this season, and it wouldn't be a surprise if SoFi Stadium sounds more like Acrisure Stadium, formerly known as Heinz Field, on Sunday. The model projects the Steelers to win in 49% of simulations. Back the Steelers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Aaron Rai of England overcame a shocking short miss with a pair of late birdies for a 5-under 67 and defeated Tommy Fleetwood on the first playoff hole with a 10-foot birdie putt to win the Abu Dhabi Championship on Sunday.Rai returned from a two-month break to win for the first time this year and pick up his third European tour title -- his first on the tour since defeating Fleetwood in the 2020 Scottish Open. He won the Wyndham Championship in August 2004 for his first PGA Tour title.Rory McIlroy started the back nine at Yas Links with five straight birdies and closed with a 62, matching his low score on the European tour. He wound up one shot behind, but expanded his lead in the Race to Dubai that concludes next week.Fleetwood was aiming for a third title worldwide in what already has been a memorable season that included a 4-1 record in a winning Europe Ryder Cup team. He holed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 16th and made a 15-foot par putt to stay tied with Rai on the 17th.\nBoth narrowly missed birdie chances in regulation on the par-5 18th. Fleetwood shot 66 to join Rai on 25-under 263.They finished one shot ahead of McIlroy and Nicolai Hjogaard of Denmark, who just missed a 15-foot eagle putt on the final hole to join the playoff. He closed with a 66.\"It's hard to put into words how this feels,\" Rai said. \"It's amazing to be here.\"\nIt was a tight battle on a day for low scoring, and the 30-year-old Rai fell out of the lead when his 3-foot par putt on the 14th spun hard out of the cup. Then, he had to scramble for par on the 15th, making a 6-foot putt.But he hit 5-iron to 8 feet on the 16th for birdie to stay within one shot of Fleetwood, who holed a 15-foot birdie. Rai made from 18 feet on the par-3 17th to reach 25 under, and Fleetwood had to make his 15-foot putt for par to stay tied.The playoff became a pitch-and-putt contest as neither had the length to reach the 616-yard in two shots. Fleetwood's birdie chance missed to the right, and Rai converted.\nRai came into the week at No. 55 in the Race to Dubai and the victory moved him to No. 9 to qualify for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship next week in Dubai for the top 50. Matthew Jordan tied for 15th to earn the 50th spot.McIlroy, the defending champion next week, will be going for his seventh title as Europe's No. 1 and created a bigger cushion with his runner-up finish in Abu Dhabi.Marco Penge of England closed with a 63 to tie for ninth, but he is now 767 points behind, with 2,000 points to the winner in Dubai.\n\"I just tried to keep my foot down and make as many birdies as possible knowing that, OK, I'm trying to win this tournament but also give myself the biggest cushion possible going into Dubai next week, as well,\" McIlroy said.\n            ",

He was ruled questionable to return, though Sean McVay said the Rams being up multiple scores may have impacted the decision to not have him return.\n\"He got his oblique,\" McVay said in the postgame press conference. \"Think he probably could have been able to come back if it was a little bit closer, kinda similar to Puka [Nacua] last week. But he was outstanding today. You really felt his presence early and often in the game, comes away with another touchdown, but I don't have an update in terms of anything specific.\"Adams had six catches for 75 yards and a touchdown at the time of his departure. The touchdown catch was his sixth in his last three games, and his nine touchdown catches this season are most in the NFL.Adams, 32, has been outstanding since signing with the Rams this offseason, forming one of the NFL's best wide receiver duos in the NFL alongside Nacua. With those two in tow, Matthew Stafford entered Week 10 with an NFL-high 21 touchdown passes and just two interceptions, and he threw four more touchdowns Sunday.\nThe Rams (7-2) are tied with the Seahawks for first in the NFC West, and the two teams face off in Week 11 in Los Angeles, adding particular importance to Adams' health.\n            \n    ",

Stroud (concussion), Davis Mills and company were struggling, and the Jaguars were cruising; Mills had been intercepted on the third play from scrimmage, and after Travis Etienne punched in a 6-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, it looked like it would be a straightforward win for Jacksonville.Then the tides turned. Mills threw touchdowns to Jayden Higgins and Dalton Schultz, and the Texans forced three and outs following both drives. Down 29-24, Mills produced a 14-yard touchdown run to give the hosts an improbable 30-29 lead. It was his first touchdown run since 2022.Things got even crazier. The Jaguars got the ball back with 31 seconds left, and Trevor Lawrence appeared to move Jacksonville into field goal range with a completion to Parker Washington inside Houston territory. But Chuma Edoga was called for hands to the face, putting the visitors in true dire straits: at their own 35-yard line with seven seconds left.Then this happened:\nRankins is the only player 300+ pounds to score a touchdown in franchise history, and he's now done so twice; he also had a scoop and score with Houston in 2023.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL will reportedly award Atlanta with an expansion team for a league-record-fee of $165 million in a bid fronted by AMB Sports and Entertainment, the owners of MLS' Atlanta United and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, according to The Athletic,A formal announcement is expected on Tuesday, which would make the Atlanta team the 17th franchise in the NWSL. The club would begin play sometime after the 2026 season and are set to stage their home matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of both United and the Falcons, with a soccer capacity of 42,500. Further specifics about the team's inaugural season are not public information at this time.Mercedes-Benz Stadium has an artificial turf surface and would not be the first NWSL venue not to have a natural grass field – the Portland Thorns' and Seattle Reign's respective homes, Providence Park and Lumen Field, have artificial turf and the Boston Legacy will play their first season at Gillette Stadium. The Atlanta team, though, would be the first expansion team to receive the green light from the NWSL despite a permanent plan to play on turf.The $165 million entry continues a steady rise in expansion fees for the NWSL, who reportedly received $110 million in January from the group that owns the Denver Summit, who will join the league in 2026 alongside the Legacy. The Boston club and Bay FC, which began play in 2024, reportedly paid around $53 million each to join the NWSL.\nAtlanta's soccer historyAtlanta has emerged as a hub of American soccer in recent years, first with the introduction of Atlanta United in 2017 and now with the opening of the U.S. Soccer National Training Center next year in the suburb of Fayetteville. Much of the recent growth was fueled by Arthur M. Blank, the Home Depot co-founder who leads AMB Sports and Entertainment and made a $50 million contribution for the U.S. Soccer training center, which will bear his name.The city's professional soccer team, though, was a women's team. The Atlanta Beat played in the Women's United Soccer Association, the U.S.' first professional women's league, from 2001 to 2003, and then in Women's Professional Soccer from 2010 to 2011.The usual gathering place for soccer in Atlanta these days is at Mercedes Benz Stadium, the home of both MLS' United and the NFL's Falcons. The stadium has hosted both the U.S. men's and women's national teams on multiple occasions and most recently welcomed the USWNT in April 2024 for a 2-1 win over Japan in the SheBelieves Cup. The USWNT set their attendance record for a friendly on home soil that day, with 50,646 filling Mercedes Benz Arena to take in the victory.\nMercedes Benz Stadium will also host several games at next year's World Cup including one of the semifinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders' downward spiral appears to have no end in sight. During their fifth consecutive loss, a 44-22 blowout by the Detroit Lions, which is also Washington's fourth straight defeat by at least 20 points, it appears that frustrations have reached the boiling point. In the second quarter, Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs rushed for a 13-yard touchdown to extend Detroit's lead to 17 points. After the play, Commanders defensive lineman Daron Payne turned around and punched Lions wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown in the face. Payne was subsequently ejected from the game.Check out what happened, here:\nThe penalty gave the Lions an even shorter field to attempt a two-point conversion. David Montgomery punched in the two-pointer to extend the lead to 19 points, and that's when another Commander lost his cool, as Javon Kinlaw was given a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for making contact with an official. \nNot much has gone right for the Commanders this season. After a thrilling win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Jayden Daniels' \"homecoming\" game on Oct. 5 not much has gone right for Washington. The Commanders have been outscored by 88 points in their last four games. Remember, this is a franchise that was looking for even bigger things in 2025 after last season's magical 12-5 campaign that ended with a loss to the Eagles in the NFC Championship just 10 months ago. \nSo why has Washington's season been a disaster? There are a couple of different reasons. Jayden Daniels' availabilityIt was clear last year that Washington found a franchise quarterback in Daniels. However, even as an NFL prospect, his durability was a question mark. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft didn't miss a single start as a rookie, but missed three contests through the first eight weeks of this season. That number is going to increase with Daniels suffering a dislocated elbow last week in the loss to the Seattle Seahawks.Any team missing its starting quarterback is going to struggle. That's especially true when we're talking about a talent like Daniels -- who almost took a struggling franchise to the Super Bowl in his first season. When Daniels suffered a hamstring injury in the Week 7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Daniels' mother took to social media to ask fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son. Unfortunately, those comparisons exist for a reason. \nThe defenseDaniels' availability is not the only reason why Washington has struggled this year. In fact, you could make the argument the defense has been much more of a factor why Washington has gone from NFC contender to afterthought. The Commanders entered this week allowing an average of 377.8 yards per game (fifth-worst in the NFL), 253.6 passing yards per game (fourth-worst in the NFL) and 26.2 points per game (10th-worst in the NFL). This Dan Quinn defense allowed 33 of 35 completions for 492 passing yards and seven touchdowns in a four-quarter span from the second half of Week 8 at the Kansas City Chiefs, to the first half against Seattle last Sunday night. Things won't get any better for Washington either, as they just lost starting cornerback Marshon Lattimore for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL.To put it bluntly, the Commanders are struggling on both sides of the ball, and that's why they won't be making the playoffs this year. \n            ",

The loss dropped the Giants to 2-8 on the season that includes an 0-6 record on the road. Dart went 19 of 29 for 242 yards against the Bears prior to leaving the game. He also made NFL history on Sunday, becoming the first quarterback to ever rush for a touchdown in five consecutive games. He ran for 66 yards and two scores prior to getting hurt. \nThe 25th overall pick in April's draft, Dart entered Sunday's game with 10 touchdown passes against just three interceptions this season. He's won two of his six starts for the Giants since replacing Wilson in the starting lineup. \nDart left Sunday's game with the Giants ahead, 17-10. The lead swelled to 10 points before the Bears rallied behind Williams, whose game-winning score came on a 17-yard touchdown run with 1:47 left.\nThe Giants lost when the offense turned it over on downs following four straight incomplete passes from Wilson, who went 3 of 7 for 45 yards in relief of Dart. He was also sacked twice as the Giants' offense gained just seven yards during Wilson's three full series of work. \n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        If you were hoping for another Ole Miss Rebel to head north and become the next head coach of the New York Giants, you might be out of luck. ",
    "body": "\n        If you were hoping for another Ole Miss Rebel to head north and become the next head coach of the New York Giants, you might be out of luck. As current coach Brian Daboll currently stands on shaky ground in East Rutherford, there has been a natural question as to who could fill his shoes if New York (2-8) were to part ways with him. Given the emergence of rookie sensation Jaxson Dart as a franchise cornerstone at quarterback, folks have drawn the logical line to giving Lane Kiffin a call to see if he'd want to reunite with his former quarterback and return to the NFL. While it makes sense on paper, judging by what Brandon Dart, Jaxson's father, had to say about that possible reunion, it doesn't sound like a realistic option. \"As we were texting on our Kiffin-Dart family text thread, because I think Boomer Esiason had said something in the media today that maybe they should throw out a potential coaching (offer) to Kiffin, and he just sent it over with a smirk and just said, 'It's too cold in New York for me.' It's just kind of funny,\" Brandon Dart told the \"Bleav in Ole Miss\" podcast, via the New York Post. \n\"But we have our weekly interactions with him and his family, and Jaxson holds high regard. I think Kiffin is one of his most trusted allies, and I think he uses him for advice in a lot of different ways, so there's constant communication between them, even today, and there's a lot of that between our families. I don't think we could have asked for a more special coach relationship between our family and our son, so we're very, very grateful for coach Kiff.\"\nKiffin coached Dart for three years at Ole Miss, which included a stellar senior season in 2024 with the quarterback throwing for 4,279 yards and 29 touchdowns while completing 69.3% of his throws. That tutelage helped him become a first-round pick at the 2025 NFL Draft, and, given the close ties they share, it would make sense for New York to see if he'd be interested in the job. While weather might be a factor for Kiffin, so is the current landscape in college football. There are a number of high-profile jobs open, including at LSU, Penn State, and Florida, where he could be a leading candidate. He could also simply stay put at Ole Miss, where he currently has the Rebels in contention for the College Football Playoff. \nEven with Kiffin as a long shot, the mere fact that this is a conversation highlights how hot the seat is under Daboll at the moment. New York finds itself after Week 10 dead last in the NFC East at 2-8, and the club is currently on a four-game losing streak. That streak includes a 33-32 loss to the Broncos in Week 7, where the Giants allowed Denver to score all of those points in a frantic fourth-quarter comeback. If Daboll, who is 20-40-1 in his 61 regular-season games as head coach of the Giants, doesn't show signs of turning it around between now and the end of the season, it could force owner John Mara's hand to make a change. And if that change isn't toward someone like Kiffin, let's highlight three other possible options. \nJesse MinterCurrent role: Defensive coordinator, Los Angeles ChargersOwnership and fans alike may want an offensive-minded head coach to further cater to Dart's development, but don't sleep on a guy like Jesse Minter, either. New York has invested heavily along the defensive line by acquiring the likes of Brian Burns, signing Dexter Lawrence to a big-money extension, and drafting Abdul Carter and Kayvon Thibodeaux inside the top five of the NFL Draft in recent years. That unit has the potential to be among the best in the NFL, and could reach that with someone like Minter at the helm, which would, in turn, help Dart and the offense. Minter, who was the defensive coordinator at the University of Michigan and followed Jim Harbaugh to the Los Angeles Chargers in the same role, has presided over some dominant defenses. In 2024, the Chargers ranked No. 1 in points allowed and are No. 6 in the league in yards allowed in 2025 (entering Week 10). Kliff KingsburyCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Washington CommandersLast offseason, we saw former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson accept a head coaching job in the division with Chicago, so maybe Kingsbury could be the latest to follow that track. Kingsbury has done wonders for the Commanders offense with a young Jayden Daniels, and could bring a similar boost to Dart's development in New York. On top of being one of the top offensive minds in the NFL, he also comes with prior head coaching experience, leading the Arizona Cardinals from 2019 to 2022. Kingsbury went just 28-37-1 over that tenure, but it did include an 11-6 record in 2021. \nKlint KubiakCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Seattle SeahawksKubiak is expected to be a popular name this upcoming hiring cycle, especially after he has turned the Seattle Seahawks offense into one of the best in the league. Entering Week 10, Sam Darnold is playing at an MVP level and averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. Meanwhile, Jaxon Smith-Njigba currently leads the NFL with 948 yards receiving and is on pace to be the league's first 2,000-yard receiver. Could he work similar magic with Dart and a healthy Malik Nabers with the Giants? \n            ",

The Department of Justice has charged the pair with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. Clase's alleged actions date back to May of 2023, while Oritz's began in June of 2025. Furthermore, Clase's actions are alleged to have benefitted bettors by a sum of $700,000, while Ortiz's accrued to the benefit of co-conspiring gamblers by a sum of $60,000. Overall, bettors conspiring with the pair made at least $450,000 from betting platforms, prosecutors allege. Clase is alleged to have communicated with bettors via text messages during games. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on all charges. The indictment reads: \"The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment on the wire fraud conspiracy count, 20 years' imprisonment on the honest services wire fraud conspiracy count, five years' imprisonment on the conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery count, and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering conspiracy count.\"Clase, 27, was one of two Guardians pitchers placed on administrative leave over the summer while the league investigated potential misdoing. Ortiz was also placed on leave several weeks earlier. Both Clase and Ortiz had their leaves extended in late August through the rest of the 2025 regular season. \"MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,\" the league said in a statement to ESPN. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.\"\nThe Guardians said they will \"continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.\"\n        \n            \n                How can MLB address prop betting problem? Five possible solutions amid Guardians' gambling scandal\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to the Department of Justice, both pitchers \"agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types of pitches and speeds of pitches.\" Said co-conspirators then allegedly used that inside information to place bets.\"In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments ... in exchange for rigging pitches,\" prosecutors wrote.\nThe indictment chronicles specific instances in which the pitchers are alleged to have manipulated outcomes in collaboration with bettors: On or around May 19, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $27,000 on a Clase pitch that was faster than 94.95 mph.On or around June 3, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $38,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 94.95 mph and called a ball.On or around June 7, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $68,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 94.95 and called a ball.On or around April 12, 2025: Bettors allegedly won $15,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 98.45 mph and called a ball. The next day, Clase is alleged to have asked one of the co-conspiring bettors to who won money on the April 12 pitch to \"send some of it to DR,\" seemingly referring to Clase's home country of the Dominican Republic, \"for repairs at the country house.\" April 26, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower than 97.95 mph. May 11, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was called a ball.May 13, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $3,500 on a Clase pitch that was a ball and was slower than 99.45 mph. May 17, 2025: This is one of the games in which Clase is alleged to have used his cell phone to coordinate with one or more bettors during the game. Bettors on this date are alleged to have won roughly $10,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower then 97.95 mph and called a ball.On or about May 20, 2025: Clase is alleged to have directed a co-conspiring bettor to communicate with an associate, who subsequently directed the bettor to send $2,000 to an individual in the Dominican Republic. On or about May 28, 2025: Bettors wagered roughly $4,000 that a specific pitch by Clase would be a ball. The pitch did indeed appear to be out of the strike zone, but the batter swung and missed for a strike. The indictment reads: \"Approximately 20 minutes after Bettor-I lost the wager on May 28, 2025, Bettor-I sent a text message to the defendant EMMANUEL CLASE DE LA CRUZ-a .gif image of a man hanging himself with toilet paper. Even though the Cleveland Guardians won the game, approximately 10 minutes later, CLASE responded to Bettor-I with a .gif image of a sad puppy dog face.\"Ortiz is alleged to have joined Clase's scheme in June of 2025. Some of Ortiz's specific actions highlighted by the debate include: On or about June 15, 2025: Ortiz is alleged to have agreed to throw his first pitch of the second inning for a ball in exchange for $5,000 from Clase. This made approximately $26,000 for two co-conspiring bettors. On or about June 27, 2025: Ortiz agreed to throw his first pitch of the third inning for a ball in exchange for approximately $7,000. Bettors are alleged to have made about $37,000 off the pitch. Ortiz has denied all allegations against him and claimed he \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game -- not for anyone and not for anything.\"\n\"Luis is and always has been a fierce competitor. He has always given his best effort in every inning of every game. Those who have played with him know this. And the government's investigation, including discussions with Luis' teammates, supports this as well,\" his lawyer told CBS Sports in a statement. \"...There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court. The government's case is weak and circumstantial. He will defend himself, and he will be prevail.\"Ortiz's lawyer also said that all payments and money transfers were \"for lawful activities.\"Clase, who did not pitch after July 26, appeared in 48 games prior to the deactivation. He had amassed a 3.23 ERA (130 ERA+) and a 3.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions had been worth an estimated 0.7 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. Ortiz made 16 starts before his suspension, going 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA.\n\"Professional athletes, like Luis Leandro Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz hold a position of trust-not only with their teammates and their professional leagues, but with fans who believe in fair play,\" United States Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement. \"As alleged, the defendants sold that trust to gamblers by fixing pitches.  In doing so, the defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services.  They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed.  And they betrayed America's pastime.  Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.  Today's charges make clear that our Office will continue to vigorously prosecute those who corrupt sports through illegal means.\"As with all such proceedings, defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. \nThe indictment comes just weeks after Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested as part of an NBA betting scandal. Rozier and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained insider information about games, including which players were healthy and active, and passed it along to bettors. More than $200,000 in bets were placed on Rozier's \"under\" line across multiple prop bets during a March 23, 2023, game in which he left after playing less than 10 minutes. Damon Jones, a former NBA player, was also indicted and accused of passing along inside information, including about LeBron James.While sports gambling has been legalized across the country, MLB (and other leagues) have rules that prohibit certain behavior. MLB, for example, does not allow players to gamble on diamond sports, even of other teams. In 2024, MLB banned former San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life and suspended four other players -- Athletics righty Michael Kelly, Padres lefty Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder José Rodriguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Andrew Saalfrank -- after they were discovered to have bet on baseball games not involving their teams.Back in May, commissioner Rob Manfred reinstated several of the most notorious gambling-related rule violaters in league history -- Pete Rose and several members of the 1919 Black Sox -- from MLB's permanently ineligible list on the grounds that the lifetime bans ended with the player's death. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 'Sunday Night Football' matchup in NFL Week 10 is a potential AFC postseason preview as the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Los Angeles Chargers. Pittsburgh (5-3) sits atop the AFC North and is coming off upsetting the Indianapolis Colts, 27-20, on Sunday. Los Angeles (6-3) is second in the AFC West and won by the same 27-20 score over the Tennessee Titans in Week 9. These teams have alternated wins and losses over each of their last six matchups. Safety Jabrill Peppers is inactive for Pittsburgh, while L.A. will be without starting lineman Bobby Hart.Kickoff from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., is set for 8:20 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh won their last meeting in 2024, taking the home game, 20-10. Los Angeles is a 3-point favorite in the latest Steelers vs. Chargers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.

Their +9 turnover differential is second-best in the league, while just six teams have a worse turnover differential than the Chargers (-4). Pittsburgh's defense also stepped up in a big way in its defeat of the Colts, holding the league's top-scoring team to 13 points fewer than their season average on Sunday.On offense, Aaron Rodgers is having his best season in years as his 68.7 completion percentage is the third-best of his career, with only a pair of his MVP seasons ranking higher. He has 17 touchdown passes, compared to just five picks, and he's thrown for 10 scores across just three road games. Additionally, Pittsburgh excels on the margins as it has the best average starting field position in the NFL, and just three teams have been assessed for fewer penalty yards that the Steelers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can winThe NFL has evolved into a passing league over the years, and few teams are as proficient, on both sides of the ball, in the air game than Los Angeles. It has the No. 6 passing offense as Justin Herbert ranks second in both passing yards and passing touchdowns. Meanwhile on defense, the Chargers rank No. 3 in defending thru the air, and only Buffalo has allowed fewer passing touchdowns.The Chargers can also take advantage of deficiencies with the Steelers, namely Pittsburgh's struggles in the ground game. The Steelers rank 30th in rushing offense and are 28th in yards per carry. However, that 30th ranking is still better than what Pittsburgh's pass defense has, as the team has been anything but a Steel Curtain. Pittsburgh is dead last in defending the pass, and it has given up at least 313 passing yards in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Chargers Steelers picksWhite has analyzed Steelers vs. Chargers   from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total.

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 10 has already delivered lots of drama.The action kicked off overseas, where the Indianapolis Colts ran wild against the Atlanta Falcons to claim a high-scoring win in Berlin (more on that below). But it got plenty wacky as the day wore on, as evidenced by the Miami Dolphins cruising past the rival Buffalo Bills in an unexpectedly one-sided AFC East showdown. Then there was the Houston Texans overcoming a three-score deficit to the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, complete with a walk-off touchdown by defensive lineman Sheldon Rankins.And that's not even accounting for some of the other madness of Sunday's schedule, such as the rebuilding New Orleans Saints blanking their own division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens clawing within one game of .500 thanks to a sloppy but resilient showing against the Minnesota Vikings, and the Chicago Bears improving to 6-3 by downing the New York Giants.Which players, coaches and teams stood out the most, for better and worse? Here are some of Week 10's biggest winners and losers:\nWinner: Dan CampbellThe Detroit Lions were stunned in an upset loss in Week 9. No problem. Campbell had his boys revved up and ready to dominate on the rebound, and rebound they did, driving the ball all over the old, depleted Washington Commanders defense for a blowout win. Give Jared Goff even reasonable run support, and he'll pick you apart. Against Dan Quinn's front, he got a lot more than reasonable help, with Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery exploding to the tune of more than 200 yards on the ground.Loser: Robert SalehThe San Francisco 49ers need feisty defense these days, with the offense consistently relying upon fill-in Mac Jones to guide Kyle Shanahan's offense, which was once again without an injured Brock Purdy against the Los Angeles Rams. Yes, Saleh has a whittled-down lineup, with stars like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner out due to injury. But he had basically no answers for Matthew Stafford on Sunday, struggling to find good secondary matchups as the Rams' gunslinger torched the 49ers for four scores.Winner: Jonathan Taylor's MVP caseThe Indianapolis Colts running back was already among midyear favorites for the NFL's top honor. Then he ripped off 286 scrimmage yards, including 244 on the ground, against the Atlanta Falcons to headline the league's first-ever Berlin game. The highlight was an 82-yard scoring scamper, but this is the kind of thing Taylor's been doing all year as the centerpiece of Shane Steichen's rejuvenated attack. No one -- not even elite quarterbacks -- has enjoyed such a special start to 2025. Four years after clearing 1,800 rushing yards as a young breakout, this ball carrier might win the Colts the AFC South with his own legs.  \nLoser: Justin JeffersonThis is for multiple reasons. No. 1: His quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, fell right back to Earth after a resilient Week 9 upset of the Detroit Lions, heaving up a handful of desperation balls to afford the Baltimore Ravens easy takeaways. But Jefferson was actually part of the problem this time, appearing to let up on McCarthy's first pick rather than try to outmuscle a pair of defenders for a jump ball. Then he all but declined to pursue Marlon Humphrey on the second pick, which occurred because Jefferson slipped on a deep route in the first place. It was an unusually passive look for the Minnesota Vikings' star receiver, who's typically above criticism.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 10 grades: Bills get an 'F' for embarrassing loss to Dolphins, Steelers almost fail for 'SNF' showing\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Mike VrabelIn Buffalo, the Bills played down to their competition on Sunday, with Sean McDermott failing to parlay a Josh Allen-led attack into victory against the lowly Miami Dolphins. The Bills' chief rivals did precisely the opposite, proving a formidable foe for the feisty Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Under Vrabel's direction, New England's defense got to Baker Mayfield when it counted, and Josh McDaniels finally unleashed TreVeyon Henderson as explosive run support for Drake Maye, who once again tossed a couple of beautiful deep shots. Just over halfway through his first year running the Patriots, Vrabel is well on his way to the postseason.Loser: Bryce YoungIt's sad, because Young registers as a genuinely likable leader in Carolina, complete with requisite poise for the occasional late-game comeback. But physically, as a passer, this just can't go on much longer for the Panthers if Dave Canales and Co. intend to be taken seriously. It's not just the unusually small build (5-10, 205) that created plenty of pre-draft skeptics; it's the stuck-in-mud speed of his operation that makes interceptions thrown right to the opposing defense look like part of Carolina's plan. This was apparent in an ugly 17-7 loss to the New Orleans Saints, in which counterpart Tyler Shough flashed difference-making traits.\nWinner: Mike MacdonaldOne thing we don't talk enough about: the Seattle Seahawks' surge, not only as new NFC West frontrunners but possible Super Bowl contenders. Maybe that will change after Sunday. Macdonald's defense got off to a rip-roaring start against the rival Arizona Cardinals, scoring a pair of touchdowns to help Seattle jump out to a 35-0 lead ... by midway through the second quarter. And Sam Darnold, the gunslinger at the helm of the offense, was once again razor sharp out of the gate, feeding No. 1 target Jaxon Smith-Njigba to render Arizona helpless. Macdonald and his staff are making the most of a balanced lineup across the board.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Houston Texans pulled off one of the wildest comebacks of the season over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, and in the process, the two teams combined to make some history. The game ended with the Texans topping the Jags 36-29, a score that had never been seen before in the 106-year history of the NFL.Yup, we got a scorigami. With seven seconds left to play, it didn't look like a scorigami was going to happen. The Texans were leading 30-29 with the Jaguars sitting at their own 35-yard line. Jacksonville needed just 12 to 15 yards to get in field goal range for Cam Little, but that didn't happen because Trevor Lawrence got strip-sacked on the play. After Lawrence lost the ball, Sheldon Rankins grabbed it and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown to account for the final points, which officially gave us the 1,094th unique final score in NFL history. \nWhen a player scores with no time left on the clock, you don't have to kick the extra point, and that came in play here because 37-29 would NOT have been a scorigami. The touchdown by Rankins capped an improbable fourth quarter by the Texans, who scored 26 points during the final period to wipe away a 29-10 deficit. Going into Sunday, the Texans had been 0-96 in franchise history when trailing by 15 points or more entering the fourth quarter. \nThe comeback was possible thanks to an offense that came alive and a dominant performance by the defense. The Texans defense forced two punts while holding the Jaguars to just 11 yards in the fourth quarter, which allowed the offense to get Houston back in the game. Davis Mills threw for 104 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter and then capped off the comeback by scoring on a 14-yard run that gave Houston its first lead of the game with just 31 seconds left to play. \nMills was playing for C.J. Stroud, who was sidelined this week due to a concussion. Overall, Mills threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns in the win. This game marks the third scorigami of the 2025 season. There were a total of seven during the 2024 season, but since they become more difficult to achieve with each new score that happens, it's unlikely that we'll see the NFL hit that total this year. \nThis is the second time in the past 12 months that the Jaguars have been involved in a scorigami. Their last one came in November 2024 in a game where they lost to the Lions, 52-6. As for the Texans, this is the second time this calendar year that they've been involved in a scorigami. Their last one came in January during a 32-12 win over the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs. The Texans have been involved in four scorigamis since the start of the 2023 season. In other action, there was one other rare score in Week 10 and that came with the Los Angeles Rams beating the San Francisco 49ers, 42-26. This marked just the second time in NFL history that a game has ended with that score. The only other time it happened came back in September 2001 when Peyton Manning's Colts beat the Bills. \nThere were also two games that ended with a final score of 44-22 in Week 10 (Lions over Commanders, Seahawks over Cardinals). Going into the 2025 season, that score had only happened ONE TIME in the 106-year history of the NFL and that came all the way back in 1967. However, it has now happened three times this year alone and two of them have involved the Commanders. Besides their loss to the Lions, the Commanders also lost 44-22 to the Cowboys back in Week 7. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        MANCHESTER -- Maybe it won't click for Liverpool. At the very least, it is hard to see how it is not too late for this season to coalesce into a sustained defense of the Premier League crown. It isn't just the eight-point deficit to the league leaders, a gap only one less than that which looked unbridgeable for Arsenal at this stage of last season. That isn't even the half of it.The profound problem for Arne Slot now, even after a 3-0 loss at Manchester City, is that the early-season skirmishes are over, the time to work oneself into the season long since past. Most of his squad will jet off to Europe and beyond for the final international window of 2025. When they return, they will do so to a team that has not addressed the issues that have been apparent since the Community Shield. This team cannot defend its flanks. If Mohamed Salah does not play well, neither do Liverpool, who spent $100 million-plus on three attacking players to ready themselves for a new era. From front to back, those who have kept to the standards established last season number in the minority.It would be easy for Slot to point to the decisions that went against his side, chief among them the baffling decision to disallow Virgil van Dijk's well-placed header because Andrew Robertson had been making what PGMOL termed \"an obvious action\" in Gianluigi Donnarumma's vicinity. He might also ponder how different this game would have been if Cody Gakpo had turned in at the back post five minutes before Jeremy Doku got the goal this performance of the season deserved.To do so would be to focus on the discolored leaves on one tree while around him the forest burns. This game might have been different if Liverpool scored their best chance or if Michael OIiver had had a different view of Robertson's positioning. It might have been worse if Erling Haaland had taken a bit more time over an early penalty, if Doku's leg had been a little longer to meet Nico O'Reilly's peach of a cross. Four or more wouldn't have flattered City, even if the expected goals suggest otherwise. \nScrub out the missed penalty and this game looks even in xG terms. It didn't feel it in the slightest, even in a second half where Pep Guardiola was far less impressed. The hosts might not have padded out their shot stats with the Haaland and Nico Gonzalez goals, but they were breezing into the penalty box in the first half, 10 entries to Liverpool's four. A late chance for Salah might have balanced out the xG but the game had long since tilted away from this shadow of their best selves.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            And yes, Liverpool had looked like the team of old on Tuesday night in a deserved win over Real Madrid. Perhaps, in retrospect, that game would have looked very different if Conor Bradley hadn't played out of his skin or if Vinicius Junior had been a little more purposeful in his attacking. It was Bradley's misfortune Sunday to run into Doku at his most devastating, the City No. 11 completing seven take-ons (it felt like more) in the 74 minutes before Guardiola opted to call time on the bully ball. Liverpool ended this match with four.The problem wasn't Bradley. There are maybe a handful of fullbacks in world football who could have dealt with Doku in his current form. Liverpool threw two at him, but Dominik Szoboszlai was no more effective a shield. On the rare occasions where Salah did track back, you could see why Slot was so prepared to let him shade the defending last season.\nThat came with a presumption of output that can probably be parked for now. Like Liverpool as a whole, he seemed to be whirring back into life with dribble-heavy games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid, but after this match, it is still worth asking if those are the exceptions rather than the norm. Salah wasn't bad per se, he ended this game with a hand in six of Liverpool's seven shots and 0.44 of a meager 0.71 xG. He just wasn't the best footballer on the planet. That has been a problem for Slot ever since the Champions League elimination at Paris Saint-Germain's hands.He is not the only one to have dropped off. It was clear on Tuesday how effective the old midfield of Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister can be when all three were humming, but it only took Mac Allister looking leggy again for the center to lose its hold on proceedings. Meanwhile, Ibrahima Konate is not exactly having a Salah-esque contract year. If his mind has already begun drifting to the Bernabeu, he might want to consider that Real Madrid will be watching his performances this season.This, then, was a lot. And it was a lot that should be familiar to Liverpool. Opponents flying in behind their fullbacks had been a game-by-game occurrence before those back-to-back wins. Eighteen games into the season, though, those controlled and authoritative performances look like the exception, rather than the rule. They are a sign that this team can reach heights to match the best in Europe, as they could last year. What has changed in their title defense season is their ability to plumb depths no contender should be able to reach. If they are to have even a scintilla of a shot at the Premier League, this cannot happen again. The problem is, however, that it keeps on happening right now.\n            ",

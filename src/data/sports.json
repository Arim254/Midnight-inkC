    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks picks against the spread, your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +500.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots WR Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1. You can only see the Seahawks vs. Patriots picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for Super Bowl LX that can be combined into an NFL SGP that returns $15,000 on just a $10 bet, and which optimal first touchdown scorer prop pays out 25-1?

The latest NBA odds list his over/under for tonight at 32.5 points and the SportsLine Projection Model is leaning heavily towards the Over, as it predicts that SGA scores 38.3 points on average against one of the NBA's bottom-five defenses. It's also predicting that Jazz guard Isaiah Collier goes Under 9.5 assists in a late matchup with the Clippers and that Pistons forward Jalen Duren comfortably goes over 10.5 rebounds against the Nuggets, who are missing Nikola Jokic (knee).Targeting NBA player props will be a popular way to approach Tuesday's NBA betting at online sports betting sites.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBucks (+10.5) vs. 76ers (-110)Michigan (-10.5) vs. Nebraska (-105)Oklahoma (+130) to defeat ArkansasCombining the three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +734 (risk $100 to win $676). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change)\nBucks (+10.5) vs. 76ers (-110)The Bucks are well rested to begin their next run without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who suffered a multi-week calf injury on Friday. They were supposed to play Sunday, but that game was postponed due to travel issues from the winter storm, giving the Bucks more time to rest and also strengthen their on-court chemistry in preperation of playing without Antetokounmpo. The 31-year-old superstar also missed three weeks in December with a calf injury, and the Bucks went 4-4 against the spread during that time. They only lost two games by more than 10 points, though. While the Bucks are rested, the 76ers are playing the second half of a back-to-back following a 130-93 loss to the Hornets. Neither Joel Embiid (knee) nor Paul George (knee) played Monday, so they could suit up for the second half of the back-to-back, but still, the model views 10.5 points as too drastic a number. The 76ers are home, but they are 12-13 overall and 11-14 ATS at home this season. Bet the Bucks to cover at DraftKings here:Michigan (-10.5) vs. Nebraska (-105)\"Nebraska's non-conference SOS ranks #299, showing their strong record is built on weak opponents,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said.\"They're unbeaten in Big Ten play but benefited from close wins and a high \"Luck\" rating (#33 KenPom). Michigan, with a non-conference SOS of 14th, is No. 2 in KenPom and boasts an Adjusted Efficiency Margin (+35.87) nearly 8 points higher than Nebraska. Such a gap signals a major mismatch. It's the equivalent of a Final 4 team against a Sweet 16 squad. Michigan's top-ranked 2-point offense and defense, while playing the 7th hardest schedule, make them a powerhouse. Nebraska is a poor offensive rebounding team (17th Big Ten, 304th nationally), limiting second-chance points. On the road against Michigan's physicality and the Crisler Center crowd, Nebraska faces a \"market correction\" blowout. Bet Michigan to cover at DraftKings here:Oklahoma (+130) to defeat ArkansasThe model doesn't believe the Sooners are as bad as their 1-6 SEC record indicates, with all six of their losses coming either on the road or against a ranked team. Oklahoma faces another ranked team in its building on Tuesday, but the Sooners nearly defeated No. 18 Alabama in an 83-81 home loss on Jan. 17, and they are coming off a buzzer-beater road loss to Missouri on Saturday. They are a few bounces away from winning two of three entering this contest. Akransas is 5-2 in SEC play this season, but the Sooners defeated the Razorbacks in Arkansas last season. Oklahoma has won three of its last four games against Arkansas. The model projects the Sooners to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing solid value at plus-money odds. Bet Oklahoma to win at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        One quick gesture during Sunday's 4-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche cost Toronto Maple Leafs winger William Nylander, who wasn't even playing. Nylander flipped his middle finger to the broadcast camera, and the NHL fined him $5,000 for that \"obscene gesture.\"Due to a groin injury, Nylander has been out since Jan. 15. When the camera panned his group of injured teammates, Nylander shot the bird.\n\"I apologize for my actions yesterday,\" Nylander said. \"It was out of frustration, so I'm sorry about that.\"It didn't take Nylander long to realize that he made a mistake. Shortly after he gestured toward the camera, he received a message on his phone.\n\"Sitting there, I got a text message,\" Nylander said. \"I was like, 'Oh, not a good idea. Not a good thing to do.' So, yeah, I apologize about that.\"Nylander probably won't sweat the fine too much -- he's set to make $13.5 million this season between his signing bonus and base salary. However, that gesture pretty well sums up the Maple Leafs' season to this point.Frustration mounting for Maple LeafsNylander is certainly not alone. Toronto's season has been frustrating across the board. The Maple Leafs suffered four straight losses, and dropped six of their last seven. They're now six points out of a playoff spot in an Eastern Conference that's much more competitive than anyone could've anticipated.\nPart of those struggles can be explained by the image of Nylander in the press box -- gesture aside. Nylander, the team's leading scorer, has missed 52 games this season. On Sunday, he was joined by fellow forwards Calle Jarnkrok and Dakota Joshua, as well as shutdown defenseman Chris Tanev.Injuries plagued Toronto all season. Goaltender Joseph Woll and defenseman Brandon Carlo are two more key players who have missed extended time in 2025-26, and the team doesn't have enough depth to paper over its personnel losses.However, not all of the Leafs' woes can be pinned on the pesky injury bug. The team has just been subpar on a number of different levels. According to Natural Stat Trick, Toronto owns a 47.5% expected goals share and a minus-7 goal differential at five-on-five. The latter ranks 22nd, and the former ranks 26th.\nThe team's expected goals numbers aren't all that worse than they were in 2024-25, but the actual results have cratered. Last season, Toronto owned a plus-33 goal differential at five-on-five, which was fourth in the NHL. The loss of a dynamic playmaker like Mitch Marner, who just returned with the Vegas Golden Knights to hand the Leafs a 6-3 loss, has played a role in the team's inability to outperform middling underlying metrics.There are still 30 games left in the season, and two good weeks can vault the Maple Leafs from outside the playoffs to a top-three spot in the division. This team is far from dead, but it Toronto hasn't provided much evidence that it could be a real Stanley Cup threat even if it does reach the postseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke and quarterback Darian Mensah agreed to settle outside of court, it was announced Tuesday, bringing finality to a process that began when he entered the transfer portal after the ACC Championship Game. Miami is the expected landing spot for Mensah.The two sides were scheduled to be back in court on Jan. 29 for a preliminary injunction hearing. CBS Sports previously reported there was \"urgency on Mensah's side to get things done quickly\" due to enrollment rules for the upcoming season.\"Through close collaboration and principled negation, we have successfully navigated an unprecedented path, one that has now reached a fair and agreeable resolution,\" Young Money APAA Sports said in a statement. \"Darian extends his sincere gratitude to Duke University for engaging in good-faith discussions and reaching this resolution. He wishes the Blue Devils, Coach Diaz, the staff and the entire fan base continued success in the seasons ahead.\"Duke filed its lawsuit against Mensah on Jan. 20 after the quarterback requested to enter the transfer portal. The Blue Devils alleged that Mensah broke his contract by trying to enter the portal and must stay with the program to finish the arbitration process stipulated in the contract that would resolve disputes.\nDuke's official statement on Tuesday's settlement:\"We are committed to fulfilling all promises and obligations Duke makes to our student-athletes when we enter into contractual agreements with them, and we expect the same in return. Enforcing those agreements is a necessary element of ensuring predictability and structure for athletic programs. It is nonetheless a difficult choice to pursue legal action against a student and teammate; for this reason we sought to resolve the matter fairly and quickly.  \"Duke remains dedicated to the welfare of all student-athletes, and we appreciate them for the talent, dedication, and commitment to excellence they demonstrate both on and off the field.  We also remain committed to upholding the integrity of our athletics programs and institutional guidelines. We thank Darian for his contributions to Duke University.\"Mensah originally signed what was believed to be a two-year, $8 million deal with Duke in November 2024 after transferring from Tulane. At the time, that was the most lucrative deal since the beginning of the NIL and revenue share era.\nThen a redshirt freshman quarterback with the Green Wave, Mensah had thrown for 2,723 yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions while leading Tulane to a 9-4 record. At Duke, Mensah threw for 3,973 yards, 34 touchdowns and six interceptions, leading the Blue Devils to an ACC Championship.In its lawsuit against Mensah, Duke argued he should not be allowed to enter the portal until both sides could enter and engage in arbitration both parties agreed within the terms of the deal to settle disputes. \"Contracts mean something. Mensah's actions violate numerous provisions of his contract with Duke University and disregard his promises and obligations to the University,\" Duke's lawsuit states. \"And, as Mensah agreed when he signed his contract, such breaches cause Duke irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, in the event of any such breach, Duke is entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief.\"\nA judge later denied Duke's request that would have kept Mensah's name out the portal. In a statement previously to CBS Sports, Mensah's legal team argued players could not be restrained from moving from one school to another.\n            ",

Lawyers claim their client was \"never going to receive fair and good faith consideration of Ole Miss' request for an additional season of eligibility from the National Collegiate Athletics Association.\" Chambliss' shot at a preliminary injunction to gain 2026 eligibility will be heard Feb. 12 in the Calhoun County Courthouse in Pittsboro, Miss.Chambliss' representation argues the appellate committee is \"inclined to deny\" despite evidence based on NCAA instructions. This comes after Yahoo Sports reported the NCAA committee responsible for reviewing eligibility appeals met twice and could not come to a decision on the quarterback's future eligibility.Chambliss sued the NCAA earlier after the NCAA denied his initial waiver request.\n\"In considering and deciding whether to waive its 'Five to Play Four' rule and grant an additional season of eligibility, the NCAA literally instructed its staff to unconditionally 'deny cases requesting … additional seasons of competition,' regardless of the evidence,\" the memorandum states, as obtained by The Clarion Ledger. \"Even on appeal of the initial staff-level denial, the NCAA's directives establish a predisposition prejudicial to the student-athlete by proclaiming the appellate committee is 'inclined to deny' the waiver request despite the evidence. Why even have a waiver rule, since denial is predetermined and engagement in the NCAA's waiver request process is futile?\"Chambliss has a deal in place at Ole Miss to return in 2026 contingent on the NCAA granting his waiver request. He seeks relief for his 2022 season at Division II Ferris State due to a \"incapacitating injury or illness.\"After denying his initial waiver request, the NCAA argued that proper documentation from that time period wasn't provided and Ferris State's reasoning for Chambliss not playing after redshirting the previous season was \"development needs and our team's competitive circumstances.\"\nChambliss ranks as the third-best quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft, according to CBS Sports' latest player rankings update. He sits behind Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza and Alabama's Ty Simpson. Chambliss fueled the Rebels' College Football Playoff run after finishing with 3,927 yards passing and 22 touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There has only been one in-season trade so far in the 2025-26 season, but with the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 5 now just nine days away, a surge in activity is surely on the horizon. Giannis Antetokounmpo's uncertain status is holding everything up, but even teams with designs on landing the All-NBA forward still have to eventually take care of business with this season in mind. It might take until right before the deadline for teams to start shifting focus away from Antetokounmpo and make trades to bolster their roster for this season. While the trades themselves might not happen until the deadline itself, the conversations to explore what's available and begin structuring the framework of potential deals are already happening. Two fascinating teams going into the trade deadline also happen to be two of the league's most notable brands. The New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers are both firmly in the playoff mix in their respective conferences, with nearly identical records -- 27-18 for New York and 28-17 for L.A. -- but both displayed some fatal flaws and appear to be solidly in the tier below the true championship contenders as currently constructed. For two franchises desperate to get into the title picture, that usually means some activity at the deadline, but they also have a long-term vision to consider. Those two teams are the focus of the most notable NBA rumors and rumblings on Tuesday, offering some idea into what we may see from them over the next nine days. \nKnicks interested in Jrue Holiday, downplaying desire to trade Karl-Anthony TownsThe Knicks reportedly made calls to the Portland Trail Blazers to explore what a potential deal would look like to bring two-time NBA champion Jrue Holiday to New York, per Marc Stein. Holiday won titles in Milwaukee and Boston before being shipped off to Portland this summer for Anfernee Simons, and he remains a coveted veteran for contenders. The Knicks would view adding Holiday as a positive both for their ability to compete for a title this year, viewing him as an ideal backcourt complement to Jalen Brunson because of his defensive abilities, and also a helpful addition to wooing Antetokounmpo, with whom Holiday won his first title.However, Knicks also stated their desire to give this group a chance to go through a full season and playoff run before making any major changes. James Dolan said at the beginning of the month he didn't see the Knicks \"making a big change\" and highlighted how much he loved the vibes in the locker room. That was before their recent swoon, of course, but it does bring into question whether New York will be willing to meet Portland's price on Holiday. \nSomewhat related, Stein also reports the Knicks \"downplayed\" the availability of Karl-Anthony Towns in trade talks, but rival teams view the All-Star center as still being gettable for the right price. Towns figures to be the centerpiece of any Giannis trade and the Knicks took a major swing to land him prior to the 2024-25 season. That said, Towns has drawn the ire of Knicks fans for some lackluster play in the middle of this season and there have been questions about how he's fitting in Mike Brown's system. The problem with trading Towns is he's not likely to yield a huge return if the Knicks were to shop him actively. That likely explains why they're downplaying his availability on the market, as the best possible deal is going to come from a team that feels more desperate to acquire a stretch big of Towns' caliber, not by shopping him from team-to-team. Lakers canvassing the league to see what their options areThe Lakers were long the \"boy who cried wolf\" of trade rumors, with the franchise constantly attached to stars during the LeBron James era, but after the disaster of the Russell Westbrook trade, they became a bit gun shy of taking swings at the behest of their star. Last year marked the Lakers' return to making splashy moves with the biggest trade in recent memory, when they landed Luka Dončić from the Mavericks. \nNow, one wonders if the Lakers are back to being aggressive with their assets to maximize their chances to contend immediately, or if the uncertainty of this summer with so many free agents will keep them from making major moves. Those are the debates within the Lakers organization, but at the very least GM Rob Pelinka is exploring potential options ahead of the deadline -- particularly seeing if the Lakers can turn one of their future first round picks in 2031 or 2032 into multiple firsts, according to ESPN.Adding multiple firsts would give them some more flexibility in trade talks alongside their expiring contracts like Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent and Maxi Kleber. The biggest area of need for the Lakers remains at center, where Deandre Ayton fell out of favor with JJ Redick. Finding a long-term answer at center will be the top priority for the Lakers this summer, but whether they can find that player in the next week is less certain. Rockets not interested in trading Tari EasonThe Houston Rockets are going to have some difficult decisions to make financially, as their young, talented roster is going to get progressively more expensive to keep intact. Amen Thompson is next up for a massive extension in Houston. Might make the Rockets willing to listen to offers for Tari Eason? Eason hits restricted free agency this summer. \nHowever, per Stein, the Rockets made it clear to hopeful suitors that Eason isn't on the market at the deadline. Houston is fourth in the West and views itself as a contender, so they seem focused on keeping their team as strong as possible for this year's playoff run and will leave the tough decisions on contracts for this summer. While teams rarely extend offer sheets to restricted free agents anymore, Eason might be the exception. He won't command a max deal, but his value as a strong three-and-D wing may intrigue other teams to see if they can't make Houston balk at a big offer sheet with other players to take care of. That's a bridge the Rockets will cross this summer, but for now they know Eason's value to this team and that it'd be hard to replace him in a trade with someone that helps them more. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Any ACC fans up for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in August? NC State and Virginia open the 2026 season -- and conference slate -- in Week Zero to commemorate South America's first college football game. The league revealed full team-by-team schedules for next season Monday night, a robust slate featuring a number of spotlight games and weeknight specials.With the ACC's move to a nine-game scheduling model next season, every team's slate will feature a minimum of 10 games annually against Power Four opponents moving forward. Since this is a transition year for the ACC with an altered league schedule, Boston College, Clemson, Florida State, North Carolina and Georgia Tech will play eight ACC games due to contractual obligations with others outside of the conference.In other words, 12 teams will play a \"9+1 schedule\" during the bridge year -- which include nine ACC games plus at least one Power Four nonconference opponent -- while five teams will play an \"8+2 schedule,\" equating to eight ACC games paired with at least two Power Four nonconference matchups.One school each season with play eight ACC games beginning in 2027 with the conference at an uneven 17 members.\nThanks to Miami's run to the national championship game in the College Football Playoff, the ACC captured nine total wins during bowl season, which tied for the most-ever in the league's history. This comes a year after the ACC stumbled to a 2-11 bowl record during the 2024 postseason, the first year of playoff expansion.The Hurricanes are one of four ACC teams ranked in CBS Sports' way-too-early top 25 for 2026. Miami's slotted at No. 13 despite losing Carson Beck, Rueben Bain Jr. and a slew of offensive linemen, while Louisville, SMU and Virginia Tech also appear.\n        \n            \n                ACC football grades for 2025 season: Miami meets expectations, UNC fails in Year 1 of Bill Belichick era\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis marks the fourth consecutive season that the ACC has unveiled an altered scheduling format. There's also new tiebreaker rules that are expected to prohibit what happened during the 2025 season after seven-win Duke reached the ACC Championship Game and beat Virginia to keep the Cavaliers out of the playoff.\nNC State has arguably the most manageable nine-game ACC schedule with only one matchup against a league opponent expected to be ranked in the preseason (Louisville). On the other hand, Stanford's stretch against Miami and SMU at home along with Virginia Tech and Louisville on the road could be nightmarish. Stanford's the only ACC team that will play those four notable opponents in 2026.All of Clemson's difficult games will be played at home (Miami, Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, South Carolina) unless Duke returns to the top tier or Florida State recovers under Mike Norvell. Speaking of the Seminoles, FSU is one of five teams playing the eight-game conference schedule and its slate is not favorable. The Seminoles play Clemson, NC State, SMU and Virginia in Tallahassee, while they get Louisville, Boston College, Miami and Pittsburgh on the road.Miami vs. Virginia Tech could mean something againThe Hurricanes have won seven of their last eight against the Hokies, including a 34-17 victory last season.\nIt's been a while since this matchup's had stakes, an element first-year Virginia Tech coach James Franklin hopes to change in 2026. The Hurricanes and Hokies will play on Friday, Nov. 20 in Miami Gardens, Florida during the penultimate ACC weekend prior to conference title game participants being decided.The second half of Virginia Tech's schedule is likely season-defining. The Hokies will play Georgia Tech, at Clemson, at SMU, Stanford, at Miami and Virginia from Oct. 24 onward. Franklin has a few games to evaluate his roster before the games that matter begin.One interesting note about Miami's slate is the inclusion of four non-Saturday games. The Hurricanes will play a Thursday night affair and three times on Friday, this coming after Mario Cristobal said last month he preferred keeping a traditional schedule in fixing ACC scheduling.\n\"It's minor in the eyes of many, but I would eliminate Thursday and Friday games … college football is for Saturday,\" Cristobal told Kirk Herbstreit before the playoff. \"That drives me bananas. I know that might be petty for some, but man, I want college football on Saturdays. I really, really do.\"Year 2 for Bill Belichick looks terrifyingThe Tar Heels were 2-6 in conference play under Belichick this season with the wins coming against Syracuse and Stanford, who combined to go 4-12 in the ACC. Perhaps the Tar Heels will have staying power with an incoming top-20 signing class along with 19 transfers, but they're going to have to earn it on the field against one of the league's most arduous schedules.UNC opens the season against TCU in Dublin, Ireland on Aug. 29 and after a mid-September home bout with East Tennessee State, the Tar Heels host Notre Dame on Oct. 3 and go to UConn on Nov. 7. Notre Dame is a preseason title frontrunner, while the Horned Frogs will be gunning for another impressive finish after consecutive nine-win seasons. Former Toledo coach Jason Candle takes over for Jim Mora at UConn and his team will have 50 transfers, including 18 from his former program.\nAcross league play, seven of UNC's eight opponents played in a bowl game last season including Miami, Clemson, Virginia and Louisville. In-state rivals NC State and Duke are back on the schedule, along with Pittsburgh. Preseason win totals are out later this spring, but don't be surprised to see the Tar Heels' total somewhere in the 5.5-win range.Clemson relegated to wild-card statusGone are the days of assuming the Tigers are going to reach double-digit wins as the league's leading playoff threat under Dabo Swinney. After the program's failure to show in 2025, Clemson barely signed a top-25 recruiting class and the Tigers didn't make any noise in the portal, either. The coaching staff is sticking with the current quarterback room following the departure of Cade Klubnik, which means there's considerable pressure on the return of Chad Morris as offensive coordinator to work out.Expected marquee matchups for the Tigers like Virginia Tech, Miami and Duke could lose some of their luster if Clemson's execution level doesn't improve. Assuming Georgia Tech takes a step back without Haynes King at quarterback and favorable contests with UNC, Florida State, Syracuse and California are wins, bowl eligibility should be the bare minimum here.\nClemson plays the Hurricanes at Tiger Stadium for the first time since the 2022 season on Oct. 3, which shapes up to be one of the league's best weekends with a Louisville-NC State clash and Virginia Tech battling Pittsburgh on a Friday night.Dabo Swinney and Clemson look to bounce back after a disappointing 2025 campaign. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Conference games of importanceWith rosters still being finalized and two-deeps that will be further established after the spring, projecting which games could have conference championship or playoff impact is a fool's errand at the moment. Why not try and guess anyway in late January?Miami at Clemson, Oct. 3SMU at Florida State, Sept. 7Duke at Miami, Nov. 14Louisville at NC State, Oct. 3Clemson at Florida State, Oct. 31Georgia Tech at Clemson, Nov. 14Virginia at SMU, Oct. 17Virginia Tech at Miami, Nov. 20In the nonconference, there's a plethora of opportunities for the ACC to show out against quality competition. Clemson goes to LSU for Lane Kiffin's debut on Sept. 5, Louisville plays Ole Miss in Nashville during that same weekend and Miami travels to Notre Dame on Nov. 7. A couple weeks later, SMU gets a crack at the Fighting Irish as well. NC State's showdown with resurgent Vanderbilt on Sept. 19. offers an early ACC vs. SEC test.\nBeefing up the nonconference slate worked to Miami's advantage in 2025, ultimately leading to the Hurricanes' first playoff appearance thanks to a head-to-head win in the opener over Notre Dame that the selection committee finally considered in its last deliberations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        PROVO, Utah -- For just the second time in a proud history that dates back more than 120 years, the Arizona Wildcats have reached 21-0.And they got there Monday night in near-cataclysmic fashion. For the better part of 40 minutes, the top-ranked team in college hoops physically overwhelmed No. 13 BYU. The Wildcats were better in transition (18-6 in fast break points) and more effective in the paint (34-26) while getting the best joint performance this season from their starting backcourt of senior Jaden Bradley and babyfaced freshman Brayden Burries. The two combined for 55 points. Arizona won 86-83.But before the score was settled, it all nearly came crashing down in the final 65 seconds.For the majority of the second half, Arizona had been in command, frequently hushing a sellout Marriott Center crowd that was eager for evidence to keep the joint as loud as a jet engine. Burries outshined not just talented freshman teammates Koa Peat and Ivan Kharchenkov; he vastly outplayed BYU star frosh AJ Dybantsa, who finished with 24 points on 24 shots. It was, by far, the worst shooting effort of his college career, ironically transpiring just two days removed from his best game in a BYU uni: 43 points in Saturday's Holy War home win over hated Utah.\nDespite Dybantsa's off night and Rob Wright III's similarly poor 3-of-14 evening, BYU never tapped out. Inconvenience be damned, the Cougs seem to love the edge of a comeback mindset. BYU nearly ripped the game in its favor after turning an 11-point deficit with 1:05 remaining into a one-point game, Arizona up 84-83, following a rolling sequence of possessions that gave BYU life and threatened the Wildcats' pristine record three months into the season. What was Tommy Lloyd's message to his Arizona team as BYU kept hacking into that lead with every possession, a vomit-on-your-shoes collapse feeling imminent?\"Hang with it, we've just got to make one more play than them down the stretch,\" Lloyd told CBS Sports. \"Get over the past mistakes or bad calls or whatever they were, just get over them and keep it moving.\" \nAmong the events that nearly doomed Zona: a Flagrant 1 foul against Burries on Dybantsa, who would've had an easy dunk if not for Burries' two-armed takedown in the final minute.\"I just didn't want him to score the ball. I didn't want to give him free two points,\" Burries told CBS Sports. \"So I had to make the foul worth it. I didn't think it was a Flagrant 1, but they did. They called it, so I've just gotta live and learn for next time.\" Burries made up for the mistake a few possessions later. With the game 84-83 and BYU having won the ball back on a turnover, the Cougars somehow got the game on their proverbial racquet. Cougars ball, 11 seconds remaining. \nThe comeback was nearly complete. Or so they thought. Shockingly, Dybantsa never touched the ball. Instead, Wright opted to look for the would-be game-changing shot. As he maneuvered closer to the hoop and wiggled Bradley off, it looked for a blip like a bunny bucket would boost BYU to a one-point lead in the final seconds.Then Burries burst into action and came up with his biggest play of the night: a swat out of Wright's hands and then a snatch-and-steal off the block to clinch the win. He gave his team that one play Lloyd was talking about. \nA former five-star prospect, Burries started the season slowly but has been another outstanding freshman as of late in a season overloaded with first-year talent. He finished with a career-high 29 points, four assists, three steals and one huge block. He's up to 15.2 points per game and his emergence has made Arizona's increasing reputation as the best team in college basketball all the more credible.\n\"I know you guys have a job to do, to rank these guys and play with rankings every week. I don't,\" Lloyd told me outside the team locker room. \"I just get to coach a good player and help him get a little bit of experience, and then, honestly, a big part of my deal is getting out of his way and when he's got enough experience, letting him go do his thing. And now he's to the point where he's got enough experience, he's a smart kid, he's a good learner and he has a lot of trust from me. So, I mean, I had no plan for this to happen today, him to play like that. He did it.\" \nArizona's won in a variety of ways over the past three months, typically doing it with brawn and force. Monday's win was a new one for this group, though it did bear some similarity to the Cats' season-opening 93-87 defeat against preseason top-five Florida. Lloyd's team was ready to boot BYU from its building, and then all of it was nearly blown up in the final stretch. But 21-0 is 21-0 and any win in any style is acceptable for Lloyd.\"Revisionist history is a beautiful thing,\" Lloyd said of the narrow escape. \"We're going to make it a good thing, for sure. Would it have been great to win by 20? Yeah. You know, we could really build on that too.\" \nThe Burries performance exemplifies just how sturdy Arizona is in the grand scheme. Lloyd's had a really good team every year since he got to Tucson in 2021, but this is the best one because of the talent, size, physicality, experience and rock-solid dependable play. Burries growing into a capital-D Dude is huge for the Wildcats' national championship expectations.Lloyd went a little deeper with me after the game to explain why this midseason \"growth spurt\" has come to be with Burries and why Arizona was always going to be the best fit for the future NBA pick.\n\"I'll give them credit in the recruiting process,\" Lloyd said of the Burries family. \"Everyone gets really sensitive. 'They want to be the point guard. Want to be that.' Brayden's dad said from Day 1, 'I want him playing with an experienced point guard. He can play some point, he can play some 2. I don't care. But I want him playing with an experienced point guard.' Well, we had a pretty good experienced point guard. I give his dad, Bobby, a lot of credit for having that foresight and not having a huge ego, where he had to make everything about his son. And think, because they think like that, this kid's gonna have a heck of a career.\" Bradley — an elite two-way lead guard who is pacing for an All-American season — is an ideal backcourt mate for Burries. He's unflappable, an A-level defender and the quiet/composed leader who is the heart of Arizona's roster. Those two are why Arizona won in this raucous environment Monday night. They're why Arizona's the best team in college basketball -- and still a stage or two away from fully-formed status. \"Honestly, we can get better at everything,\" Burries said.Maybe the win, though earned in a way that isn't enviable, gives Arizona a dose of reality that benefits them. The upcoming Big 12 schedule in February is a beast. Even if a loss or two is soon to arrive, Arizona might still be the top team in college basketball with a loss or two to its name. Consider: Monday was the first time in 15 years that a top-ranked team with a 20-0 or better record played on the road vs. a top-15 opponent. The most recent example was then-No. 1 Ohio State's 71-67 loss to No. 13 Wisconsin in 2011.Losing here would've been entirely understandable. Arizona hasn't found a way to lose a game yet, though. It's stubborn like that.Arizona improved to 20-5 all time as the No. 1 team on the road. And overall, U of A is 66-11 when ranked No. 1. But it could have been 65-12 if not for BYU's botched penultimate possession. When Arizona was up 64-45 with 10:53 remaining, a rout seemed inevitable. Credit to BYU (17-3) for never quitting, but it can't help but feel like the week was spoiled with how the game finished. \nDybantsa just could never get going. Eleven of his 24 points were on foul shots. Every shot that could have helped BYU stem the tide didn't fall. A game removed from shooting 4-of-5 from 3-point range, Dybantsa was 1-of-8.Earlier this season BYU set a program record by coming back from 22 down at halftime to beat Clemson at Madison Square Garden. This would've been even more impressive, but you can't spot Arizona a 19-point lead, not even at home. With the loss, BYU is 0-3 all time at home vs. No. 1s, the other two coming against Gonzaga in their shared WCC residency in the 2010s. At 21-0, Arizona's matched its best start with the 2013-14 team. That squad went 33-5 and lost as a No. 1 seed in OT to Wisconsin in the Elite Eight. It had Aaron Gordon, Nick Johnson, T.J. McConnell and Brandon Ashley. It was an outstanding team.\nThis one's better, and will get better still, even if a loss or two is soon to arrive. We will wait to see how exactly that materializes, because no one's been able to figure out Arizona yet. \n            ",

Brent Brookhouse here, feeling conflicted as a lifelong Bills fan who married a born and raised New Englander who is celebrating the Patriots return to the Super Bowl. As any true sports fan knows, the future is always brighter, so I will lick my wounds and be happy for my wife getting to -- yet again -- celebrate the success of her favorite team while guiding you through all the news you need to know to get your day going. Let's get into it.  🏈 Five things to know Tuesday Looking ahead to the NFL Draft. With the Super Bowl LX matchup set, all but two teams know where they will pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In our latest mock draft, we're looking at the Rams to draft Matthew Stafford's successor at quarterback. We also have a look at which college teams have been hit hardest by early entries.Shedeur Sanders named to Pro Bowl. Despite a 3-4 record as a starter and 10 interceptions to seven touchdowns on the season, Sanders was named to the Pro Bowl. With Drake Maye in the Super Bowl, it left at least one spot open to be filled, and Sanders got the call.Arizona continues to lock down the college basketball rankings. At 20-0, Arizona has a firm grip on the No. 1 slot across the men's college basketball rankings. Arizona holds the No. 1 slot in the AP Top 25, the Coaches Poll and the Top 25 And 1 rankings. For the women, the SEC made history with 10 teams in the AP Top 25.Bill Belichick gets a \"D\" in first year at North Carolina. It's never easy for a new coach to take the reins of a college team, and that proved true even for a coach as accomplished as Belichick, who received a \"D\" in our grades of first-year college coaches.Reevaluating Giannis Antetokounmpo's trade value. Despite suffering a calf injury that will sideline him for four to six weeks, Antetokounmpo is still coveted by many teams as the trade deadline approaches. Check out the latest on Antetokounmpo and more in our newest NBA trade rumors. 🏈 Do not miss this: Super Bowl hype is in full effect \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Patriots and Seahawks are set to face off in Super Bowl LX. While there's still plenty of time before the NFL season culminates with the crowning of a champion, CBS Sports analyzes the most interesting angles. Among our five bold Super Bowl predictions is Drake Maye becoming the most sacked quarterback in a single postseason. Maye has already been sacked 15 times, the second most in postseason history, behind Joe Burrow's 19 in the 2022 postseason. \nJordan Dajani also identified 10 crazy facts you need to know about this season's Super Bowl. Among those facts is New England becoming the most improved team in NFL history. Dajani: \"If someone told you they knew the Patriots would be in the Super Bowl before the start of this year, they're lying. New England finished 4-13 in 2024, and fired Jerod Mayo for Mike Vrabel. That was clearly a good decision, as the Patriots just surpassed the 1999 Rams in being the most improved team in NFL history. The Pats went from 4-13 to 17-3 -- a difference of 13 wins including playoffs! The Patriots are also the first team to reach the Super Bowl after a 13-loss season.\"Read more: Seahawks QB Sam Darnold 'shut a lot of people up' vs. Rams in NFC ChampionshipFive reasons why Seahawks reached 2026 Super Bowl: Historic rebuildRams' Matthew Stafford, Sean McVay address future after NFC Championship lossBroncos vs. Patriots: Sean Payton regrets fourth-down call in AFC Championship 👊 The biggest storylines ahead of Saturday's UFC 325 \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            After a record-breaking debut for UFC 324, UFC's first card on Paramount+, there's a quick turnaround for the promotion's next numbered event. UFC 325 goes down Saturday in Australia. In the main event, Alexander Volkanovski will make the first defense of his second reign as welterweight champion when he faces Diego Lopes in a rematch of their UFC 314 clash. CBS Sports combat sports expert Brian Campbell broke down the five biggest storylines you need to know before the second UFC event to stream live on Paramount+, including how much longer Volkanovski can remain champion. \nCampbell: \"At 37, the two-time featherweight champion is considered by many as the greatest 145-pound fighter in UFC history thanks to victories over Chad Mendes, Jose Aldo, Max Holloway (three times), Brian Ortega and Yair Rodriguez. And his hard-fought decision win over Lopes last August at UFC 314 awarded Volkanovski the vacant title and a bit of much-needed resurgence following consecutive knockout losses and a skid of three defeats in four fights. Granted, those defeats all came against the current top two fighters in the world (Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria) and two of those came at lightweight. But with Topuria having moved up to 155 pounds, Volkanovski remains the class of the division and sits just two title defenses away from equaling the UFC featherweight record of seven by Aldo. Few fighters have maintained their elite status in the smaller weight classes this deep into their careers and Volkanovski appears as if he still has enough left to add a few more accomplishments to his Hall-of-fame resume entering the Lopes rematch. Even though Volkanovski was dropped in Round 4 of their first fight and visibly hurt twice, he bent but never broke.\" 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            CFP runner-up Miami's defense could be even better next season, according to departing pass rusher Rueben Bain Jr.After a surprising interview, Philip Rivers withdrew from the Bills' coaching search.The 2026 ACC football schedule is out and the conference championship game moved to Saturday afternoon.Japan is loaded again heading into the WBC, and the team is only looking stronger after Yoshinobu Yamamoto officially joined the roster.The internet loves a conspiracy theory, and a graphic from Week 1 of the NFL season sent some people spiraling.After a disappointing season in Colorado, Deion Sanders is cracking down with new team rules and fines.The Giants and free agent outfielder Harrison Bader have agreed to a two-year contract.NFL down under?

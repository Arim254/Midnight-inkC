It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game. Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday against Sweden, who advanced by upsetting Czechia 2-0 on Friday.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's semifinal clash with Sweden, as well as how they got here.U.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalUSA vs. Sweden | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Friars' Duncan Powell sparked the scuffle between Big East rivals when he committed a hard foul early in the second half   on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at Providence from 2022-25 before transferring to the Red Storm. \nPowell, who was assessed a Flagrant-2 for the foul, and Hopkins immediately went after each other, which caused players from both benches to spill out onto the court. It took officials and security guards almost a minute to break up the ensuing scrum. Officials also paused play for 19 minutes so that they could review footage and issue appropriate punishment. St. John's coach Rick Pitino, who coached at Providence from 1985-87, also entered the play area in an attempt to remove his players from the situation. Powell was one of two Providence players ejected alongside leading scorer Jaylin Sellers, who immediately joined Powell in shoving St. John's players. Officials ejected St. John's forward Dillon Mitchell for his initial involvement in the scrap. Red Storm bench players Kelvin Odih, Ruben Prey and Lefteris Liotopoulos were all tossed for leaving the St. John's bench area. Hopkins shot two free throws for the initial foul and St. John's guard Oziyah Sellers shot free throws for the technical foul assessed on Providence's Sellers. Oziyah Sellers then scored to expand the St. John's lead to 44-40 with just over 14 minutes to play in the second half. \nPowell will also be suspended for Providence's next game against DePaul since he was ejected for fighting after the Flagrant-2.   The end of the fight caused further tempers to flare. Later in the second half, Providence forward Jameir Jones was immediately ejected after he pushed Hopkins while Hopkins was driving to the basket. Jones did not attempt to play the ball. Players from both sides jawed at each other following Jones' shove and subsequent ejection, but another scuffle was avoided. \nAfter the game Pitino avoided comment on the incident.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Another year, another alteration to the NBA All-Star Game. Kevin Durant was asked about the new USA vs. the World format on Saturday during media day at the Intuit Dome and whether it would solve the league's perceived problems with the event. He mostly shrugged it off. Durant said he felt like \"fans and the media need something to complain about.\" KD wasn't the only player who was pressed on the topic. Luka Dončić. Nikola Jokić. Anthony Edwards. They all got asked various versions of the question. Adam Silver wasn't so lucky.The commissioner spoke for roughly half an hour and didn't get a single question about the All-Star festivities and having to tweak the proceedings yet again to try to juice fan interest and compel the players to actually compete. Most years, that would have been top of mind for the media and the commissioner. This is not most years for Silver or the NBA. As Silver's annual press conference predictably revealed, the league is facing any number of pressing issues that come complete with significant PR problems. Tanking. A star player partnering with a prediction market. The investigation into the alleged cap circumvention by the Clippers (who are hosting this weekend's events in an all-time well this is awkward everyone just act normal situation.) When those are the main subjects things have gone sideways. \nThis is Silver's 12th full season as commissioner. It is shaping up to be his most challenging, which is saying an awful lot considering one of the very first issues he was tasked with handling was hitting the eject button on former Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught on tape making racist remarks. Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Jazz $500,000 and the Pacers $100,000 for tanking measures that the league took umbrage with. On Saturday, Silver conceded that tanking has been part of the league for a long time and even allowed that it can create a certain amount of interest at times because \"fans are rooting for their teams to be bad\" in order to potentially improve their draft position. But he also said that it's clear \"the incentives are misaligned.\"\"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\nThe problem with figuring out how to punish or discourage tanking, as Silver admitted, is that \"there's a bit of a know it when you see it quality to this.\" In other words, it's subjective and the league has essentially announced that it will be operating in a gray area with regard to disciplinary measures on that front. \"That,\" Silver said, \"is not necessarily a position we want to be in.\"There is no shortage of positions they would rather not be in these days. Holding All-Star weekend at the Inuit Dome while also looking at the Clippers for potential cap circumvention and tampering violations can't be comfortable for anyone. Silver reminded the assembly that the league office is not directly leading the investigation and instead that responsibility has been taken over by an outside law firm. He said from everything he's been told \"the Clippers have been fully cooperative, but as I said I'm not involved in the day to day.\" He called the matter \"enormously complex\" and added that he's reached no conclusions yet. The whole thing came off like Silver's version of the This is Fine meme. He employed the same approach when asked about Giannis Antetokounmpo announcing he had joined the prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder. The commish said \"it's an issue that I'm paying enormous amount of attention to.\" But he also downplayed Antetokounmpo's involvement, noting that the league has a rule for sports betting where players can make small investments in gambling companies. That same rule now applies to prediction markets. \n\"That means their investment cannot amount to over one percent,\" Silver explained. \"In the case of Giannis, from what I understand, it's a minuscule investment, much smaller than one percent. So that does not violate the rules.\"And yet, while not violating the rules, it's obviously not a great look for the league -- which is something Silver seemed to grasp as he tried to spin that topic into something closer to a net neutral for the NBA. \"It concerns me,\" Silver continued, \"in the totality of all this betting that we need a better handle, no pun intended, on all the different activity that's happening out there.\"Concerns over tanking. Concerns about the Clippers. Concerns about sports gambling and prediction markets. But they're looking into all of it -- or a law firm is in the case of the Clippers. And hey as far as prediction market investments and Giannis go, it's a small thing. Nothing to worry about.\nAs damage control goes, I'm not sure how effective any of Silver's efforts were. I sat through the entire press conference and read the transcript several times and mostly it came off as attempted deflection. As one reporter said to me afterward, Silver is really good at saying a lot of things without saying much at all. Maybe that's because all these issues swirling around the league don't come with quick or clear fixes. I don't envy him. But then no one said being in charge would be easy, either.\n            ",

Meanwhile, Tennessee has scored 76 or more points in all 13 of their home games,\" SportsLine expert Eric Cohen said. \"This feels like a game where the Volunteers score 80+, while the Tigers get at least 65 in what should be a resounding win for Rick Barnes' squad.\" Back the Over at bet365 here:Texas Tech (+9.5) vs. Arizona (-110)Arizona is coming off its first loss of the season, which was an emotional battle at No. 9 Kansas on Monday night. The Wildcats are now having to face a Texas Tech team that has won seven of its last nine games, including a 78-44 win over Colorado on Wednesday. JT Toppin leads the Red Raiders with 21.5 points and 10.9 rebounds per game, while point guard Christian Anderson is averaging 19.1 points and 7.7 assists.

Keshad Johnson, the third favorite, is very live to win,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"He doesn't play much for the Heat. The second-year forward averages 3.1 points in 7.6 minutes -- many of which have come in garbage time. But if you have seen highlights of his dunks, you know Johnson can win the 2026 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest. The 6-foot-6, 225-pounder explodes to the rim with authority. His max vertical leap measured 42 inches at the 2024 NBA Combine -- tied for the highest at the combine.

Matt McMahon is probably out at LSU, and I have to wonder if the players are focused on the rest of the season or the transfer portal. The Tigers are just 2-9 in SEC play and coming off back-to-back home losses to Georgia and Arkansas by a combined 41 points. LSU could also be without leading scorer Dedan Thomas for the fourth straight game. I wish the Vols shot free throws a little better, but dominating the offensive glass and getting easy baskets off turnovers should be enough to cover.\" Back Tennessee to cover at DraftKings here:Over 156.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-110)\"Texas Tech has played seven games against power conference opponents that finished with 70 or more possessions. The totals in those games, all decided in regulation, were 155, 162, 182, 163, 140, 167 and 158,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"The thought here is that when the Red Raiders get sped up the totals creep up as well, and Arizona is the most up-tempo team in Big 12 play. Arizona's interior defense is really going to force Texas Tech to connect from outside, but the Red Raiders are currently leading the Big 12 with 41.2% three-point shooting in conference play. With Arizona looking to bounce back from the Kansas loss and Texas Tech desperate to improve its 3-3 road record, count on 70-plus possessions and a higher-scoring affair in Tucson.\" Back the Over at DraftKings here:Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)The Over has hit in six straight UConn games, with all six totals set at 136.5 points or greater, including five games set at more than 142 points. The Huskies cleared the Over by at least five points in five of those six games, in large part due to their own offensive domination. UConn has scored at least 85 points in three of its last five games. Meanwhile, Georgetown went Over in its last game, an 80-73 loss to Villanova on Feb. 7. Georgetown has the 128th-ranked scoring defense in the nation, allowing 73 points per game this season.

It was the flagship event of the night, as the league's top players showcased their athletic feats with jaw-dropping dunks. Players who weren't competing often filled the sidelines, and fans were always enthralled by the nightcap.However, over the last 10 years, the dunk contest has lost its cachet, while the 3-Point Shootout has gotten all the hype. The 3-Point Shootout has delivered in ways the dunk contest hasn't in recent years, with nail-biting finishes as everyone watches in awe as the league's elite shooters show off their skills. While we don't get the top dunkers for All-Star Saturday night in Los Angeles, the top shooters are regularly lining up to compete in the 3-point competition, giving us a star-studded event every year.\n        \n            \n                NBA Rising Stars winners and losers: VJ Edgecombe wins MVP, Cooper Flagg misses showcase with injury\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the dunk contest doesn't have high-level names, we've still seen some impressive dunks in the last two years thanks to two-time champion Mac McClung, who has decided not to defend his title this weekend. As we prepare for the night's festivities, here's everything you need to know.\nBet NBA All-Star Saturday at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:How to watch All-Star Saturday nightTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Saturday, Feb. 14Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockThe 3-Point Shootout will be the first event of the night.

    "body": "\n        For over two months, Arizona has held the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 poll. The Wildcats have been the unanimous top-ranked team for the last four weeks. Notably, that unanimous distinction came after Michigan lost its first and only game of the season against Wisconsin last month.Since that loss to the Badgers, No. 2 Michigan has won 10 consecutive games, including an 86-56 victory over UCLA Saturday. Michigan is now 18-1 against Quad 1/2 opponents, which is the most wins among all Division I teams. Twelve of Michigan's 14 wins in Big Ten play have been by at least 10 points, and six of them have been by 20 or more.Even during its dominance this season against conference opponents, the Wolverines have had their share of upset scares. Earlier in the week, Michigan overcame a 16-point deficit against Northwestern in an eventual 12-point win. Before Michigan lost to Wisconsin, Penn State missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer that would've sealed one of the biggest upsets of the season. Penn State was a 24.5-point underdog, and that game represented Michigan's narrowest margin of victory this season.\nIn the first AP poll of the new year, Michigan and Arizona nearly tied for the top spot. The one-point difference between Michigan and Arizona kept the poll from becoming the second-ever tie for the No. 1 ranking. The only time that happened was in 1981.\nNext week's poll could be just as close, depending on what happens later in the day when Arizona faces No. 16 Texas Tech in a battle of Big 12 contenders. With the Wolverines' latest blowout win and Arizona's first loss against Kansas earlier this week, the voters are now in a position to make a change at the top.What does Michigan have to do to secure the No. 1 overall seed?After Arizona suffered its first loss against Kansas earlier this week, the door opened for a potential change at the top of the poll and in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections. Heading into the weekend, Michigan, not Arizona, was the projected No. 1 overall seed with Selection Sunday less than a month away.Michigan has a brutal schedule for the remainder of the regular season. And that's not even counting potential ranked opponents the Wolverines may face in the conference tournament. Three of Michigan's five remaining opponents in Big Ten play are ranked, with the matchup against No. 8 Illinois looming large later this month. Five of the remaining six regular-season games for Michigan are against Quad 1 opponents.\nMichigan holds a 2.5-game lead in the Big Ten standings over Illinois heading into the weekend. The other potential contenders for the Big Ten regular-season title include Nebraska and Purdue, both of which are 3.0 games back of first place. The Wolverines have a date with Purdue on Tuesday that could create even more separation at the top of the standings.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Michigan State slips in 2026 NCAA Tournament projection, Wisconsin poised to continue to rise\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile those games will matter for the Big Ten picture, there might not be a game in college basketball more consequential than Duke vs. Michigan next weekend in Washington, D.C. More on that later.If you thought Michigan had a tough close to the regular season, then check out Arizona's remaining schedule. The Wildcats face five opponents ranked in the Top 25 (Texas Tech, BYU, Houston, Kansas and Iowa State) before the Big 12 Tournament begins.\nArionza's matchup next weekend with No. 3 Houston -- which is the only scheduled meeting between the Big 12 foes -- could very well decide the Big 12 regular-season title. In short, Arizona has the tougher schedule, but Michigan has the resume to match up against anyone on Selection Sunday. Arizona has 15 wins against Quad 1/2 opponents, which is the second-most wins in the sport behind Michigan.A potential Final Four preview next weekend?Arguably, the top matchup of the regular season will take place next weekend when Duke faces Michigan. The Blue Devils entered last weekend with one loss before being upset by North Carolina on the road. Still, the Blue Devils remained a No. 1 seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections.Next weekend's game will have everything college basketball fans want and need. How will Michigan's bigs -- including star center Aday Mara -- match up against the physicality of National Player of the Year frontrunner Cameron Boozer? Which guards, on either side, will step up?\nAbove all else, this game will have major implications on Selection Sunday. A head-to-head win could be the difference in how the bracket is seeded on Selection Sunday. It could also be a preview of a game we see in Indianapolis at the Final Four.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a 2024 season in which Scottie Scheffler claimed half of the PGA Tour's signature events, all eight were won by different players in 2025. Parity was the name of the game as winner's checks worth $3.6 million and $4 million for the player invitationals were doled out to a variety of names, including not only Scheffler but Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, among others.This week, the 2026 signature events get underway as the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am takes center stage. McIlroy enters as the reigning champion after kicking off a memorable spring in California last year, not only winning at Pebble Beach but adding The Players Championship and his first Masters green jacket to three early season wins. He will be playing his first PGA Tour event of 2026, as will Tommy Fleetwood, who won the FedEx Cup a year ago.The stakes are elevated when a signature event falls on the calendar, which means the payouts are raised, too. Not only will $3.6 million of the $20 million purse be awarded to the winner, every player inside the top 10 will clear $500,000 and those inside the top 20 will each earn north of $250,000.Let's take a look at how the payouts for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am will be divided among the 80 players at Pebble Beach Golf Links.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prize money, purseTotal Purse: $20 million\n1st: $3,600,0002nd: $2,160,0003rd: $1,360,0004th: $960,0005th: $795,0006th: $715,0007th: $665,0008th: $615,0009th: $575,00010th: $535,00011th: $495,00012th: $455,00013th: $415,00014th: $375,00015th: $352,00016th: $332,00017th: $312,00018th: $292,00019th: $272,00020th: $252,00021st: $232,00022nd: $217,00023rd: $202,00024th: $187,00025th: $172,00026th: $158,00027th: $150,00028th: $143,00029th: $137,00030th: $131,00031st: $125,00032nd: $119,00033rd: $114,00034th: $109,00035th: $104,00036th: $99,00037th: $94,00038th: $89,00039th: $84,00040th: $80,00041st: $76,00042nd: $72,00043rd: $68,00044th: $64,00045th: $60,00046th: $57,00047th: $54,00048th: $52,00049th: $50,00050th: $48,00051st: $47,00052nd: $46,00053rd: $45,00054th: $44,00055th: $43,00056th: $42,00057th: $41,00058th: $40,00059th: $39,50060th: $39,00061st: $38,50062nd: $38,00063rd: $37,50064th: $37,00065th: $36,50066th: $36,00067th: $35,50068th: $35,00069th: $34,75070th: $34,50071st: $34,25072nd: $34,00073rd: $33,75074th: $33,50075th: $33,25076th: $33,00077th: $32,75078th: $32,50079th: $32,25080th: $32,000\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 5 Iowa State staged a 20-2 run just before halftime Saturday vs. No. 9 Kansas and never looked back in a 74-56 blowout inside Hilton Coliseum, handing the Jayhawks their first loss in more than a month to shake up the Big 12 title race. The Cyclones' defense held KU to its second-lowest field goal percentage in a game all season while also forcing 13 turnovers, and their offense was equally as potent in a balanced beatdown.The win is Iowa State's largest by final margin vs. Kansas ever in a game played in Ames, Iowa, and tied for its second-largest over KU by final margin with a February 8, 1955 (!!) 18-point win. The only other bigger beatdown of the Jayhawks by the Cyclones was on March 10, 1973, when they defeated Kansas in Lawrence 89-65.Both teams entered the game as No. 3 seeds in the latest CBS Sports Bracketology with the model suggesting the Cyclones could move up to a No. 2 seed with the victory.Iowa State star Milan Momcilovic spearheaded the spectacular day on offense with 18 points and four made 3-pointers, and the quartet of Tamin Lipsey, Joshua Jefferson, Jamarion Batemon and Blake Buchanan each added 11 points of their own. Buchanan set the tone early with nine first-half points on a perfect 4-for-4 shooting, and Momcilovic closed it down with 14 of his final 18 points coming in the second half – including going 4 of 5 frame from beyond the arc.\nAt one point Momcilovic nailed a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner over KU defensive star Flory Bidunga and could do nothing but smile at his hot hand. \nPeterson plays just 24 minutes in lopsided lossDefensively was where Iowa State really shined as it held KU, averaging 78 points per game entering the day, to a meager 56 points in the losing effort. That tied for the fewest it has scored in a game all season, and was executed by holding Bidunga, the Big 12 field-goal percentage leader shooting 68.6% on the season, to a 5-of-13 (38.5%) outing – his second-worst shooting performance by percentage in a game he's taken five or more shots in all season. The Cyclones also held Darryn Peterson, KU's star freshman to10 points on 3-of-10 shooting with three turnovers and no assists. Peterson played just 24 minutes in the loss and was not part of its closing lineup, which Kansas coach Bill Self said was due in part to game flow but also in part because of his conditioning. Peterson missed KU's victory vs. Arizona on Monday with an illness, and Self said that illness lingered throughout the week, cutting into his ability to practice and prep for Saturday's game.\n\"I tried to sub him because he's been sick,\" Self said. \"So when he needed to come out there at the end, I was thinking, 'What do we do to give us to have the best chance to have success on Wednesday.' So that was me making that decision.\"It was a rough game for the projected No. 1 pick, but as Self noted, that was true of almost every KU player — not just Peterson.\"I didn't think he was great,\" he said. \"But he hadn't practiced much. I don't think he was bad, I just don't think anybody, except Elmarko [Jackson], was great today.\"\nBig 12 race tightens-upIowa State and Kansas had diametrically different weeks leading into Saturday, which made the outcome all the more stunning. ISU fell in an ugly 62-55 road loss at TCU on Tuesday despite being 7.5-point favorites, and Kansas knocked off No. 1 Arizona 82-78 on Monday. It says a lot about the Big 12 that Iowa State – even with Saturday's outcome – is even within one game of league-leading Arizona and Houston. The Cyclones and Jayhawks are both 1.5 games back in the standings behind the Wildcats and Cougars, though there are more than a half-dozen regular-season games remaining.We could and should learn a lot about that race soon as Houston makes its way to face Iowa State in Ames on Monday, and Arizona hosts ISU in Tucson on March 2 for its penultimate regular-season game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Unrivaled 1-on-1 tournament delivered again. Three nights of exciting action came to a close on Saturday in Miami, when Chelsea Gray outlasted Allisha Gray in a three-game war in the finals to claim the 2026 title and a $200,000 payday. As the runner-up, Allisha will take home $50,000. Chelsea Gray, a.k.a. the Point Gawd, is a serial winner, and it's little surprise that she was able to add another trophy to her collection, which also includes four WNBA titles, a WNBA Finals MVP, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup title, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup MVP and an Unrivaled Finals MVP. \"First I want to shout out Lish, man. A round of applause for Lish. Something about that last name, man, I swear. Man, we were exhausted,\" Chelsea Gray said. I was just telling [Jackie Young], I'm done with the sprints. But man, just a testament to the hard work that I put in all the time.\"The $200,000 payday is more than Gray made in the WNBA last season, when she earned $196,267 with the Las Vegas Aces. \n\"You just gotta take care of the moment and the rest will happen,\" Gray said. \"You dig deep when there's $200K on the line. We were both battling. We'll spend that money wisely.\"After the work she put in on Saturday night, Gray only had one thing on her mind. \"A vacation,\" she said, when asked how she'll spend the money. \"My wife said that she'll handle it.\"\nBreaking down the finalsGame 1There wasn't much drama in the first game. Allisha started with the ball and immediately hit a 3-pointer to jump in front, then got to the free throw line for a 2-point free throw, and finally closed the game with a tough fadeaway after an offensive rebound. \nGame 2Both players looked exhausted in the second game and traded a number of misses early on. Allisha hit a 3-pointer to go in front, but Chelsea responded with back-to-back 3s of her own to jump in front and earn game point. After a timeout, the former Finals MVP closed the show with a fadeaway jumper. Game 3Allisha started with the ball again in Game 3, and the long break after Game 2 seemed to give her a second wind. She got right to the rim at will and scored six quick points to put Chelsea on the brink. A miss gave Chelsea life, however, and she bounced back with four quick points of her own. At that point, the game turned into an extremely physical slog. Both players were pushing and holding, and neither could buy a bucket, while the refs were reluctant to decide the game with their whistles. After dozens of misses, Chelsea caught a break when Allisha lost her footing, which opened up the space for Chelsea to drain a tournament-winning 3. \nSemifinals deliverGray and Gray reached the finals in thrilling fashion. In the first semifinal, Chelsea Gray fell behind 8-0 to her former Las Vegas Aces teammate Kelsey Plum, then ripped off 12 consecutive points by using her size advantage to get into the paint and finish. It seemed as though the second contest would follow the same script, as Allisha Gray took a 9-0 lead on Aliyah Boston, who immediately responded by bullying the smaller Gray in the post to score 10 points of her own. Boston couldn't complete the comeback, however, and Gray drained a 3-pointer to advance. Boston and Plum, losers of the semifinals, will take home $25,000 each. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest field is set, and four high-flyers will be dunking for the trophy on Saturday evening in Los Angeles. This year's Dunk Contest field is light on star power. and the headlining event on Saturday night will be extremely light on star power. Jaxson Hayes of the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter Bryant of the San Antonio Spurs, Keshad Johnson of the Miami Heat and Jase Richardson of the Orlando Magic will be the four competing for the crown. The field does not have an All-Star in it, but Bryant, Johnson and Richardson will inject a bit of youth into the proceedings. We've seen in the past that sometimes the unknown competitors can breathe some life into the event. That's certainly what the NBA will hope for, but fans will likely enter the night a bit skeptical that the Dunk Contest will deliver high marks. Hayes recently went between the legs for a slam on a fastbreak against the Chicago Bulls and is known for his high-flying theatrics. Hayes, a 7-footer, is averaging 6.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game this season for the Lakers.\nBryant, an athletic first-year player out of Arizona, has played in 40 games this season as a first-round pick. He is averaging 2.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.6 minutes per game. Richardson, a rookie out of Michigan State, has played in 36 games this season and is averaging 5.1 points per game in 12 minuter per night in Orlando. \nJohnson is in his second year in the league with the Heat and has appeared in 21 games, averaging 3.1 points per game in 7.6 minutes of action per night. 2026 NBA Dunk Contest field, odds(Odds via FanDuel)Carter Bryant, Spurs: +180Jaxson Hayes, Lakers: +240Keshad Johnson, Heat: +310Jase Richardson, Magic: +430Why is Mac McClung not in this year's Slam Dunk Contest?Three-time reigning Slam Dunk Contest champion Mac McClung will not participate in this year's event after he was waived by the Indiana Pacers in November following a three-game stint.While his NBA opportunities have been limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's midseason extravaganza at each of the last three All-Star weekends. McClung also boasts a track record as a G League standout and won the MVP award at the end of a stellar year with the Osceola Magic last fall.\nRecent NBA Slam Dunk Contest winners2025: Mac McClung2024: Mac McClung2023: Mac McClung2022: Obi Toppin2021: Anfernee Simons2020: Derrick Jones Jr.2019: Hamidou Diallo2018: Donovan Mitchell2017: Glenn Robinson III2016: Zach LaVine\n            ",

It's a star-studded field at All-Star Weekend and the two biggest favorites entering the event are a rookie and a surprising veteran. Kon Knueppel, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, enters with the best odds (+240 at DraftKings) in the eight-shooter field. Damian Lillard, who is not playing this season for the Trail Blazers as he recovers from a torn Achilles, has the second-best odds (+400).Lillard, now 35, tore his Achilles tendon in Game 4 of the Milwaukee Bucks' first-round series against the Indiana Pacers, a devastating end to a disappointing two seasons in Milwaukee. The Bucks waived him in July, and he returned to Portland -- where he spent the first 11 years of his career and made seven All-NBA teams -- on a three-year, $42 million deal.Lillard won the 3-Point Contest in 2023 and 2024. He is one of eight players to win the contest multiple times, and only two players -- Larry Bird and Craig Hodges -- have won it three times.\n        \n            \n                NBA All-Star Weekend predictions: Expert picks for 3-point Contest, ASG MVP and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn order to get his third victory, Lillard will not only have to shake off some cobwebs.

But with America returning to health, American Alex Zendejas and striker Henry Martin will look to change things in a heated rivalry match.On Sunday, you can also catch quite a clash on the CBS Sports Golazo Network with Cuz Azul hosting Tigres. Both sides had big midweek wins in Conacaf Champions Cup play and are also sitting level on 10 points in the table. The teams with the third most goals scored in the Clausura portion of the season.

    "body": "\n        When discussing Real Madrid's play this season, balance, specifically the lack thereof in attack, is a word that often comes up. But in stopping a surging Real Sociedad side and running their own unbeaten streak in LaLiga play to eight straight victories with a 4-1 win, the balance that Trent Alexander-Arnold can bring was on display. And they did it without Kylian Mbappe.It only took five minutes for Real Madrid to open the scoring via a lovely pass from Alexander-Arnold to Gonzalo Garcia. It's only the second assist for the English right back this season, as injuries have limited him to only 12 appearances in all competitions. But with Benfica looming in Champions League play on Tuesday in the playoffs (which you can watch on Paramount+), this performance comes at a more important time than ever.One of the best creative right backs in the world, Alexander-Arnold joined from Liverpool ahead of the Club World Cup during the summer, and it was an exciting acquisition expected to take the Real Madrid attack to the next level. Rightfully so, as well, look at this pass map from last season at Liverpool.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            With a player spraying the ball forward like that, every attacker is able to focus on getting into good position, and there's the additional benefit of Federico Valverde being able to return to the midfield. That was also an important shift with Valverde switching from open play to join Vinicius Junior, who scored two penalties during the match.\nDespite the result, it wasn't all smiles for Real Madrid, with young defender Dean Huijsen conceding a penalty from a rash challenge that Mikel Oyarzabal scored. Los Blancos also will have felt as if they could've scored more goals, but strong finishing and penalties made sure that Real Madrid made the most of their chances. They struggled to create much from open play after the first half of action, but considering that this was without Mbappe's 38 goals in all competitions, Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa won't be too concerned.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            The leadership of American manager Pellegrino Matarazzo has turned Real Sociedad around in the league, and they're only 90 minutes from an appearance in the Copa Del Rey final, so losing in the Santiago Bernabeau it nothing to hang your head over. Arbeloa's Madrid are moving in the right direction, but all eyes will be on their Champions League fixture this week. Losing to Benfica on the final day of the league phase is what got them in this scenario; instead of the stars getting to rest during the week, Los Blancos need to find their way into the round of 16 in the Champions League.\nAlready being knocked out of the Copa Del Rey in shocking fashion to Albacete last month, catching Barcelona in LaLiga and winning the Champions League are the top priorities, and a lopsided victory over Benfica on Tuesday will be a step in the right direction as they continue to look to find balance.\n            ",

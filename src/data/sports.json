    "body": "\n        Another NFL Sunday has arrived, and with that comes another game day filled with options to utilize the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. The Week 10 Sunday NFL schedule includes top matchups such as Rams vs. 49ers (+5.5, 49.5) to consider for online sports betting options on Sunday.The day's slate wraps up with Steelers vs. Chargers on Sunday Night Football, and the SportsLine model projects value in backing an upset, having the Aaron Rodgers-led Pittsburgh Steelers as one of its Sunday best bets at DraftKings. The Steelers are +129 underdogs, but the model likes the value of playing the Steelers to improve to 6-3 on the season. Its Sunday best bets at DraftKings also include backing a pair of favorites to cover the spread, playing the Lions (-7.5, 49.5) vs. Commanders and Seahawks (-7, 44.5) vs. Cardinals. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. The model enters Week 3 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 26-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its college football betting picks or NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Sunday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookLions (-8.5) vs. CommandersSeahawks (-7) vs. CardinalsSteelers to defeat the Chargers (+136)Combining the model's three picks into a Sunday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +777 (risk $100 to win $777). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nLions (-8.5) vs. CommandersThe Washington Commanders haven't yet put Jayden Daniels on injured reserve after he suffered a brutal-looking elbow dislocation last week, but they have already ruled him out of Sunday's matchup with the Detroit Lions. Kickoff is scheduled for 4:25 p.m. ET and Washington is 3-6 during an injury-riddled season while Detroit is off to a 5-3 start. These two teams met in last year's NFC divisional round, with the Commanders scoring a 45-31 upset win as 8-point road underdogs. Now they're 8-point home underdogs with Marcus Mariota starting in Daniels' place for the fourth time this season. Back the Lions at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Seahawks (-7) vs. CardinalsSam Darnold was nearly perfect on Sunday Night Football, completing 21 of 24 passes for 330 yards and four touchdowns with one interception as the Seahawks defeated the Commanders, 38-14. Darnold has gone from a questionable starter to arguably one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL with the third-best quarterback rating (116.0) in the league. Seattle is fifth in the NFL in scoring offense (28.9 ppg) and scoring defense (18.8 ppg) and is 6-2 on the season. Meanwhile, the Cardinals are 3-5 on the year. Seattle has won eight straight against Arizona, and the model expects that to continue on Sunday, projecting the Seahawks to win and cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Seahawks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Steelers moneyline vs. Chargers (+136)You won't find a divisional leader more disrespected this season than the Pittsburgh Steelers, but when it comes to finding value, that plays to a sports bettor's advantage. The Steelers are 5-3 with a two-game lead in the AFC North, despite being the underdogs to win their division. The Steelers are coming off a 27-20 upset victory over the Colts, handing Indianapolis just its second loss of the season. Pittsburgh is 2-1 straight-up as the underdog this season. Meanwhile, the Chargers have already lost as home favorites to the Commanders and Colts this season, and it wouldn't be a surprise if SoFi Stadium sounds more like Acrisure Stadium, formerly known as Heinz Field, on Sunday. The model projects the Steelers to win in 49% of simulations. Back the Steelers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

Seattle (6-2) is tied atop the division and coming off a 38-14 win over Washington on 'Sunday Night Football.' As for Arizona (3-5), it is last in the NFC West but ended a five-game losing streak via a 27-17 victory over Dallas on 'Monday Night Football.'

The Seahawks' 24-point win at Washington was the franchise's largest margin of victory in a road game in a decade. Receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba (8 rec, 129 yards) now has four straight games with at least eight catches and 120-plus yards, which is tied for the longest NFL streak since 1970. The Seahawks have also won eight straight versus the Cardinals, with Seattle going 7-1 versus the spread in those contests.As for Arizona, it looked impressive as outright winning as road underdogs versus Dallas on Monday. Brissett now has as many total touchdowns (seven) in three starts with Arizona as Murray had over five starts, and the former also has half the turnovers as Murray.

The Cardinals offense has been far more efficient with backup QB Jacoby Brissett at the helm,\" SportsLine NFL expert Daniel Vithlani said. \"Both defenses will be missing a number of starters- Arizona is down starting CBs Max Melton & Will Johnson, along with LBs Mack Wilson & B.J Ojulari. The Seahawks will likely be without LB Ernest Jones and CB Josh Jobe. I expect a competitive game that goes over the total with a 27-24 type of score.\" Back the Over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Lions -7.5 vs. Commanders (-115)The Washington Commanders (3-6) will host the Detroit Lions (5-3) in Week 10 and it's a rematch from the NFC divisional round last season. Washington won that playoff matchup 45-31 as an 8-point underdog in Detroit, but will be without Jayden Daniels (elbow) and Terry McLaurin (quad) this time around. Meanwhile, the Lions are coming off a disappointing 27-24 loss at home to the Vikings last week and have now lost two of three. Back Detroit at FanDuel Sportsbook:Steelers +2.5 vs. Chargers (-102)The Chargers are 6-3 overall, but they've failed to cover the spread in five of their last six games. The Steelers, on the other hand, have covered the spread in four of their last five games and should be riding high after knocking off the Colts as underdogs last week. The Los Angeles offensive line has been decimated by injuries, with Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater both suffering season-ending injuries. T.J. Watt should feast and that's a big reason why the model predicts that the Steelers cover in 53% of simulations. Back Pittsburgh at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Sunday.

If there is one problem for the Rams, and it cost them dearly in the earlier loss to the 49ers, it's the kicking game, and to that end a desperate Sean McVay is turning to a new PK, Harrison Mevis, to take the place of the erratic Joshua Karty.\" Back San Francisco at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 49.5 points in Commanders vs. Lions (-120)\"The Commanders suffered a big blow with the loss of Jayden Daniels, and I'm not sure how the offense responds in a tough matchup here after they had no success vs. Seattle with their QB1. The offense has actually been struggling for weeks if you consider they only managed 22 against Dallas and 24 against Chicago, two defenses who have been lit up in recent games,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"Detroit's offensive line has its own issues with the interior losing multiple players recently and both tackles picking up injuries that may keep either or both sidelined in this matchup. That should keep the Lions focused on a possession offense and running the clock down, making it hard for this game to get to 50.\" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Steelers money line vs. Chargers (+125)The Chargers are 6-3 on the season and have won three of four, but were fortunate to escape with victories against the lowly Titans and Dolphins during that span. They were also beaten handily by the Colts (38-24) in their last matchup against a team with a winning record. Meanwhile, the Steelers just captured a 27-20 win over Indianapolis to move to 5-3 and are 2-1 on the road this season, which includes a road win over the 7-2 Patriots. The model predicts that Pittsburgh wins in 49% of simulations, so there's plenty of value at these NFL odds. Back Pittsburgh at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Sunday.

However, the officials in this matchup made a big mistake to begin overtime, as they allowed the wrong team to call the coin toss.Official Clete Blakeman announced the Colts were the visiting team before flipping the coin in overtime. Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin called \"tails,\" and the coin toss came up tails. Indy elected to get the ball first, and the NFL Network broadcast went to commercial.When the NFL world came back from commercial, it was actually the Falcons that fielding the kickoff. As it turns out, the Falcons were the road team, so the officials had to do the coin toss again during the commercial break. The Falcons won this coin toss, and elected to receive.Ultimately, this gaffe did not play a major role in the game, as the Falcons lost eight yards on five plays during their overtime drive before punting the ball away to Indy. Daniel Jones then led his Colts 57 yards down the field on seven plays, and Jonathan Taylor punched in a 6-yard score to win the game.\nTaylor was the MVP of this matchup, as he turned in one of the greatest international performances we've ever seen. The Colts star running back rushed 32 times for 244 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 42 yards through the air on three receptions. Taylor now has 66 rushing touchdowns, which passed Edgerrin James for the most rushing scores in franchise history. Taylor has 15 rushing touchdowns through 10 games, making him the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to accomplish this feat. By the way, Tomlinson won MVP that year. \n            \n    ",

The clause prohibits Green Bay from trading their pass rusher to the NFC East, notably the Eagles after they tried to land the multi-time All-Pro during his summer holdout. The Packers would owe the Cowboys their 2028 first-round draft pick if Green Bay moves Parsons to Philadelphia, Washington or New York. The \"poison pill\" condition is also featured for Kenny Clark, who was part of the package from the Packers to the Cowboys. If Dallas trade Clark to a team from the NFC North, the Packers get the Cowboys' 2028 first-round pick.The \"poison pill\" stipulations reportedly apply to this season and 2026. This parameter was not discussed publicly when the Parsons blockbuster materialized, but NFL teams reportedly noticed that were conditions attached to the Cowboys' and Packers' 2028 first-round picks that prevented them from being traded.The Cowboys' \"all-in\" trade this week for Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams spiked the \"poison pill\" conversations when Dallas' future 2028 first-round was prohibited from trade discussions.\nParsons, a four-time Pro Bowl edge rusher, agreed to a four-year, $188 million deal with Green Bay that included $120 million guaranteed after the trade. In exchange for Parsons, the Cowboys received two-first round picks — one in 2026 and another in 2027 — along with Clark.ESPN previously reported that the Eagles made a \"strong play\" for Parsons once the Cowboys began entertaining trade offers over the summer. Jones and the Cowboys were not willing to send Parsons to their NFC East rival. Parsons and the Packers play the Eagles on Monday night, so it's not coincidence his contract detail has surfaced ahead of kickoff. Parsons has 20 tackles and 6.5 sacks for the Packers this season. Green Bay (5-2-1) leads the competitive NFC North, which includes every team at .500 or better.\n\"These last six months were super draining, super toxic for everyone,\" Parsons said after his debut in Green Bay earlier this season. \"It's something that I don't think no player should have to go through. Players' fates should be decided earlier. The fact that I was traded a week before the season was really outrageous and rough. It's something where I could have been with these guys getting better and better, and we probably could have had probably an even more dominant start if that was the decision they were going to make.\"\n            \n    ",

The Indianapolis Colts running back ran for 244 yards and three touchdowns in Berlin, concluding in his his game-winning overtime score. Taylor made history, surpassing Hall of Fame running Edgerrin James as the Colts' all-time career leader in touchdown runs. He is also now in position to possibly make more history during the final seven games of the regular season. After entering the game with a league-high 895 rushing yards, Taylor now has 1,139 yards on the year and is on pace to rush for 1,936 yards. In addition to being on pace to break his own single-season franchise rushing record, Taylor is now 861 yards away from becoming the 10th back in league history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. \"Whatever gets us to a Super Bowl,\" Taylor told NFL Media afterward when asked if he has a target number in mind in terms of his rushing total by season's end. \"If that means one more yard and the rest is just blocks so the receivers can get downfield, I'm willing to do it. But whatever it takes for us to be able to get to our goal at the end of the year.\" After being held to a season-low 45 yards during last week's loss in Pittsburgh, Taylor delivered the second-most prolific rushing performance of his career and his best game since the 2021 season. His big day played a critical role in the Colts' getting back on track in Berlin while improving to 8-2. \nTaylor put himself in position to have an historic season from an individual standpoint. The league's leading rusher in 2021, Taylor is on pace to become only the 18th running back in history with multiple rushing titles. He is also in position to possibly become the first non-quarterback in 13 years to win league MVP. Fortunately for Taylor, league MVP typically goes to a player who is on a Super Bowl contending team. So while he continues to be focused on team success, the other things may also end up coming to fruition for Taylor as long as he and his teammates continue to have success on Sunday. \n\"I means a lot that my teammates and coaches trust me,\" Taylor said. \"But at the end of the day, it comes down to displaying that on the field every Sunday. We did it all together today.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon coach Dan Lanning was admittedly nervous before Atticus Sappington's game-winning field goal in the final seconds that lifted the Ducks to an 18-16 win at Iowa, a victory that kept his team inside the top 10 of the latest AP Top 25 after Week 12. It was a crisis averted for Oregon and several other top 10s during a weekend free of major upsets, which included Indiana's thrilling victory against Penn State after Fernando Mendoza led the Hoosiers on an 80-yard touchdown drive with no timeouts in the final moments.\"We do a lot of pressure kicks in practice and try to recreate it, but there's nothing like 70,000 fans in the last second of the game with what, seven seconds left trying to kick that kick,\" Lanning said. \"You can't recreate that in practice. And Atticus handled that like a champ.Indiana, one of three remaining unbeatens in college football, trailed by four points against the Nittany Lions after consecutive fourth-quarter touchdowns from Nick Singleton before Mendoza's go-ahead touchdown toss to Omar Cooper with 36 seconds left.Winless in the Big Ten this season, Penn State began the year as the AP Top 25's No. 2 team before quickly spiraling during conference play. \n\"It was the most improbable victory I've been a part of and there couldn't have been a better place to make it happen,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said, noting Indiana's first win in program history at Penn State.The Hoosiers are one of five Big Ten teams ranked inside the AP's updated top 20, anchored by top-ranked Ohio State. The SEC leads all conferences with nine teams in the latest AP Top 25.Last week's AP Top 25 mirrored the first College Football Playoff Rankings inside the top five, but there was considerable differences when it came to placing Oregon, BYU and Texas Tech.

    "body": "\n        MANCHESTER -- Maybe it won't click for Liverpool. At the very least, it is hard to see how it is not too late for this season to coalesce into a sustained defense of the Premier League crown. It isn't just the eight-point deficit to the league leaders, a gap only one less than that which looked unbridgeable for Arsenal at this stage of last season. That isn't even the half of it.The profound problem for Arne Slot now, even after a 3-0 loss at Manchester City, is that the early-season skirmishes are over, the time to work oneself into the season long since past. Most of his squad will jet off to Europe and beyond for the final international window of 2025. When they return, they will do so to a team that has not addressed the issues that have been apparent since the Community Shield. This team cannot defend its flanks. If Mohamed Salah does not play well, neither do Liverpool, who spent $100 million-plus on three attacking players to ready themselves for a new era. From front to back, those who have kept to the standards established last season number in the minority.It would be easy for Slot to point to the decisions that went against his side, chief among them the baffling decision to disallow Virgil van Dijk's well-placed header because Andrew Robertson had been making what PGMOL termed \"an obvious action\" in Gianluigi Donnarumma's vicinity. He might also ponder how different this game would have been if Cody Gakpo had turned in at the back post five minutes before Jeremy Doku got the goal this performance of the season deserved.To do so would be to focus on the discolored leaves on one tree while around him the forest burns. This game might have been different if Liverpool scored their best chance or if Michael OIiver had had a different view of Robertson's positioning. It might have been worse if Erling Haaland had taken a bit more time over an early penalty, if Doku's leg had been a little longer to meet Nico O'Reilly's peach of a cross. Four or more wouldn't have flattered City, even if the expected goals suggest otherwise. \nScrub out the missed penalty and this game looks even in xG terms. It didn't feel it in the slightest, even in a second half where Pep Guardiola was far less impressed. The hosts might not have padded out their shot stats with the Haaland and Nico Gonzalez goals, but they were breezing into the penalty box in the first half, 10 entries to Liverpool's four. A late chance for Salah might have balanced out the xG but the game had long since tilted away from this shadow of their best selves.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            And yes, Liverpool had looked like the team of old on Tuesday night in a deserved win over Real Madrid. Perhaps, in retrospect, that game would have looked very different if Conor Bradley hadn't played out of his skin or if Vinicius Junior had been a little more purposeful in his attacking. It was Bradley's misfortune Sunday to run into Doku at his most devastating, the City No. 11 completing seven take-ons (it felt like more) in the 74 minutes before Guardiola opted to call time on the bully ball. Liverpool ended this match with four.The problem wasn't Bradley. There are maybe a handful of fullbacks in world football who could have dealt with Doku in his current form. Liverpool threw two at him, but Dominik Szoboszlai was no more effective a shield. On the rare occasions where Salah did track back, you could see why Slot was so prepared to let him shade the defending last season.\nThat came with a presumption of output that can probably be parked for now. Like Liverpool as a whole, he seemed to be whirring back into life with dribble-heavy games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid, but after this match, it is still worth asking if those are the exceptions rather than the norm. Salah wasn't bad per se, he ended this game with a hand in six of Liverpool's seven shots and 0.44 of a meager 0.71 xG. He just wasn't the best footballer on the planet. That has been a problem for Slot ever since the Champions League elimination at Paris Saint-Germain's hands.He is not the only one to have dropped off. It was clear on Tuesday how effective the old midfield of Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister can be when all three were humming, but it only took Mac Allister looking leggy again for the center to lose its hold on proceedings. Meanwhile, Ibrahima Konate is not exactly having a Salah-esque contract year. If his mind has already begun drifting to the Bernabeu, he might want to consider that Real Madrid will be watching his performances this season.This, then, was a lot. And it was a lot that should be familiar to Liverpool. Opponents flying in behind their fullbacks had been a game-by-game occurrence before those back-to-back wins. Eighteen games into the season, though, those controlled and authoritative performances look like the exception, rather than the rule. They are a sign that this team can reach heights to match the best in Europe, as they could last year. What has changed in their title defense season is their ability to plumb depths no contender should be able to reach. If they are to have even a scintilla of a shot at the Premier League, this cannot happen again. The problem is, however, that it keeps on happening right now.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase and right-handed starter Luis L. Ortiz have been indicted on charges stemming from alleged gambling misconduct -- specifically manipulating bets on individual pitches. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the charges on Sunday and unsealed the indictment at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. Ortiz has already been arrested in Boston, while Clase is not in custody. The Department of Justice has charged the pair with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. Clase's alleged actions date back to May of 2023, while Oritz's began in June of 2025. Furthermore, Clase's actions are alleged to have benefitted bettors by a sum of $700,000, while Ortiz's accrued to the benefit of co-conspiring gamblers by a sum of $60,000. Overall, bettors conspiring with the pair made at least $450,000 from betting platforms, prosecutors allege. Clase is alleged to have communicated with bettors via text messages during games. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on all charges. The indictment reads: \"The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment on the wire fraud conspiracy count, 20 years' imprisonment on the honest services wire fraud conspiracy count, five years' imprisonment on the conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery count, and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering conspiracy count.\"Clase, 27, was one of two Guardians pitchers placed on administrative leave over the summer while the league investigated potential misdoing. Ortiz was also placed on leave several weeks earlier. Both Clase and Ortiz had their leaves extended in late August through the rest of the 2025 regular season. \"MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,\" the league said in a statement to ESPN. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.\"\nAccording to the Department of Justice, both pitchers \"agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types of pitches and speeds of pitches.\" Said co-conspirators then allegedly used that inside information to place bets.\"In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments ... in exchange for rigging pitches,\" prosecutors wrote.Clase, who did not pitch after July 26, appeared in 48 games prior to the deactivation. He had amassed a 3.23 ERA (130 ERA+) and a 3.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions had been worth an estimated 0.7 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. Ortiz made 16 starts before his suspension, going 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA.\n\"Professional athletes, like Luis Leandro Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz hold a position of trust-not only with their teammates and their professional leagues, but with fans who believe in fair play,\" United States Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement. \"As alleged, the defendants sold that trust to gamblers by fixing pitches.  In doing so, the defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services.  They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed.  And they betrayed America's pastime.  Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.  Today's charges make clear that our Office will continue to vigorously prosecute those who corrupt sports through illegal means.\"As with all such proceedings, defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. \nThe indictment comes just weeks after Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested as part of an NBA betting scandal. Rozier and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained insider information about games, including which players were healthy and active, and passed it along to bettors. More than $200,000 in bets were placed on Rozier's \"under\" line across multiple prop bets during a March 23, 2023, game in which he left after playing less than 10 minutes. Damon Jones, a former NBA player, was also indicted and accused of passing along inside information, including about LeBron James.While sports gambling has been legalized across the country, MLB (and other leagues) have rules that prohibit certain behavior. MLB, for example, does not allow players to gamble on diamond sports, even of other teams. In 2024, MLB banned former San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life and suspended four other players -- Athletics righty Michael Kelly, Padres lefty Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder José Rodriguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Andrew Saalfrank -- after they were discovered to have bet on baseball games not involving their teams.Back in May, commissioner Rob Manfred reinstated several of the most notorious gambling-related rule violaters in league history -- Pete Rose and several members of the 1919 Black Sox -- from MLB's permanently ineligible list on the grounds that the lifetime bans ended with the player's death. \n            ",

Pittsburgh (5-3) sits atop the AFC North and is coming off upsetting the Indianapolis Colts, 27-20, on Sunday. Los Angeles (6-3) is second in the AFC West and won by the same 27-20 score over the Tennessee Titans in Week 9. These teams have alternated wins and losses over each of their last six matchups.Kickoff from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., is set for 8:20 p.m. ET.

Their +9 turnover differential is second-best in the league, while just six teams have a worse turnover differential than the Chargers (-4). Pittsburgh's defense also stepped up in a big way in its defeat of the Colts, holding the league's top-scoring team to 13 points fewer than their season average on Sunday.On offense, Aaron Rodgers is having his best season in years as his 68.7 completion percentage is the third-best of his career, with only a pair of his MVP seasons ranking higher. He has 17 touchdown passes, compared to just five picks, and he's thrown for 10 scores across just three road games. Additionally, Pittsburgh excels on the margins as it has the best average starting field position in the NFL, and just three teams have been assessed for fewer penalty yards that the Steelers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can winThe NFL has evolved into a passing league over the years, and few teams are as proficient, on both sides of the ball, in the air game than Los Angeles. It has the No. 6 passing offense as Justin Herbert ranks second in both passing yards and passing touchdowns. Meanwhile on defense, the Chargers rank No. 3 in defending thru the air, and only Buffalo has allowed fewer passing touchdowns.The Chargers can also take advantage of deficiencies with the Steelers, namely Pittsburgh's struggles in the ground game. The Steelers rank 30th in rushing offense and are 28th in yards per carry. However, that 30th ranking is still better than what Pittsburgh's pass defense has, as the team has been anything but a Steel Curtain. Pittsburgh is dead last in defending the pass, and it has given up at least 313 passing yards in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Chargers Steelers picksWhite has analyzed Steelers vs. Chargers   from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total.

    "body": "\n        AFC contenders meet on 'Sunday Night Football' in Week 10 when the Los Angeles Chargers host the Pittsburgh Steelers at 8:20 p.m. ET. Offensive linemen aren't part of the NFL DFS player pool, but Los Angeles has lost both starting tackles -- Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt -- for the season. That certainly can impact the outlook for players like Justin Herbert, Kimani Vidal and Keenan Allen.Can you trust Los Angeles skill players in your NFL DFS lineups, and which Steelers should you target with your NFL DFS picks in what could be more of a defensive-oriented battle (over/under of 44.5)? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Chargers vs. Steelers on 'Sunday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

Herbert has spread it around this season with four pass catchers entering this matchup with 32 or more receptions. McConkey, however, has the slight team lead in total receiving yards (524). His trend line is pointing up as well. After recording just one game of 50 yards or more of receiving in the first five weeks, McConkey has averaged 83 yards per game in his past four outings. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy includes rostering Steelers running back Jaylen Warren. He's coming off a two-touchdown game and has provided a high Fantasy floor all season. Warren has at least 63 scrimmage yards or a score in every game this season, while run defense is the Chargers' weakness. It ranks 27th in yards per carry allowed, and two of the last three offensive touchdowns that L.A. has allowed have come to opposing running backs. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Steelers vs. ChargersMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        Toronto Blue Jays designated hitter George Springer is not in the Game 4 lineup Tuesday night, but the team does not seem likely to remove from their World Series roster after he exited Game 3 with a side injury Monday. Removing Springer from the roster would rule him out for the rest of the series. He could not be added back later.\"MRI showed that he's hour-to-hour, day-to-day, so just see how he kind of navigates the next couple hours,\" manager John Schneider said Tuesday before Game 4 (via Sportsnet). \"... Right now the options are either in the lineup or on the bench.\"Bichette is in at DH instead and left fielder Nathan Lukes is hitting leadoff.Follow live updates from Dodgers vs. Blue Jays Game 4Springer suffered the injury during Monday's marathon Game 3, which the Blue Jays eventually lost to the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. In the seventh inning, Springer after fouling off a pitch immediately clutched his right side in obvious discomfort. Soon after he exited the game accompanied by a trainer and was replaced by Ty France: The injury was initially announced as right side discomfort, and Schneider said postgame that Springer had already left to undergo an MRI. The team has not shared the results of the MRI. They seem to be hoping Springer will be able to play again at some point, even if not until Game 6 or 7 later this week.\n\"He plays for moments like this,\" Schneider said Tuesday. \"I think I told you guys yesterday, whenever this season's over, you guys will be surprised to see kind of how much he has grinded physically. So yeah, if he's good to go in any way, shape, or form, I want George in.\"Losing Springer, Toronto's leadoff hitter and one of its most productive players in 2025, would be a serious one. During the regular season, the 36-year-old Springer reversed a pattern of decline and put up one of his best-ever seasons at the plate: \nHis OPS+ of 161 led the team and also ranked third among American League qualifiers. Springer is also one of the most prolific postseason power hitters in MLB history, as he ranks third all-time on the playoff home run list. During the Jays' current run, he's batted .246/.323/.561 with four home runs and six doubles in 14 games.\nOutfielder Joey Loperfido would be the obvious replacement should Springer come off the roster. The 26-year-old Loperfido, who bats left-handed, is a career .248/.297/.392 hitter with eight home runs in 122 games spread across parts of two MLB seasons. He was rostered for part of the Blue Jays' ALCS win over the Seattle Mariners as an injury replacement for Anthony Santander. Loperfido went hitless in one at-bat in that series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA could soon loosen its rules against sports betting, as it announced a pending legislative change that would allow college athletes to gamble on professional sports. That move, approved by the administrative committees across the NCAA's three divisions and now set to take effect on Nov. 22 (instead of Nov. 1), drew significant pushback from prominent figures in the college sports universe and remains subject to rescission. SEC commissioner Greg Sankey spoke up this week against the rule change.Sankey sent a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker on Oct. 25, obtained by ESPN, making it known that the SEC disagrees with the decision to allow athletes to bet on professional sports. He said in the letter that SEC presidents and chancellors came to the conclusion that \"this policy change represents a major step in the wrong direction.\" Importantly, the rule change does not alter the NCAA's stances on gambling on college athletics. Athletes will remain prohibited from betting on college games and sharing information with bettors.\"On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong national standards that keep collegiate participants separated from sports wagering activity at every level,\" Sankey said in his letter to the NCAA. \"If there are legal or practical concerns about the prior policy, those should be addressed through careful refinement -- not through wholesale removal of the guardrails that have long supported the integrity of games and the well-being of those who participate.\"\n        \n            \n                College football early Week 10 betting guide: Notes for North Carolina at Syracuse and more\n                \n                    Bruce Marshall                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSankey argued that the rule change challenges the \"integrity of competition\" and that the SEC is concerned about its athletes' vulnerability. He called on the NCAA to restore its prior policy or modified rules prohibiting gambling at all levels. He raised concerns about the gambling industry's growing reach and influence and said the NCAA's removal of its barrier on professional sports betting \"sends the wrong signal.\"\nThe pushback on the NCAA's decision extends to other conferences, too. Pittsburgh football coach Pat Narduzzi this week called it \"absolutely one of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen.\" He pointed out recent issues in professional sports, including the NBA, which last week saw Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier arrested by the FBI as part of a federal investigation into illegal gambling.\"First of all, it's a habit,\" Narduzzi said. \"It's no different than smoking, drinking, doing drugs, it's a bad habit. I don't think anyone here encourages you guys to go out drinking and getting smashed on a Friday night or Saturday night, or at a ball game.\"\nThe NCAA's proposal to allow betting on professional sports does include measures to protect athletes. The association plans to provide additional education and support to prevent problem gambling.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time since 2004, the Racecourse Ground was the host of a Welsh derby between Wrexham and Cardiff City, which the Bluebirds took advantage of, winning 2-1 to book their place in the last eight of the EFL Cup. A 71st-minute goal by Will Fish was the difference between the two sides, with differing priorities making a difference. Cardiff and Wrexham traded places this season, with the Bluebirds being relegated to League One while Wrexham winning promotion to the Championship, and the rotation in the lineups showed their differing priorities. Phil Parkinson is looking to survive the grind of the EFL Championship, while Cardiff are two points off the top spot in League One. With the Bluebirds looking to make their stay in the third division a short one, the motivation of winning their first derby against Wrexham can help propel them back up the pyramid. It wasn't a pretty game with Cardiff taking a lead into halftime before Kieffer Moore leveled things for Wrexham. The Welsh striker has been irreplaceable with five goals in all competitions, but his strike wasn't enough to secure the win. Wrexham won't be too disappointed about that, though. When they were in the lower divisions, Wrexham were able to make it to the fourth round of cup competitions with ease, but priorities have shifted.\nThe Dragons no longer have the best roster in the Championship, so they have to be shrewd in where they play their best players. Plus, a team outside of the top flight haven't won this competition since 1991, so doing so was always very unlikely. They're struggling with the move up a division with 14 points through 12 games and are only six points out of the relegation zone. That's a fine position to stay in, but struggling to keep their opponents from scoring, picking up more injuries could see Wrexham suffer relegation.After riding a wave of momentum to this point, relegation would put a dent in the Dragons' ambitions and possibly lead to another club being able to poach Parkinson from them. The chief orchestrator of their success, a managerial shift is something that could stop the Hollywood rise in its tracks. Despite the derby loss, Wrexham won't look back on this loss with sadness as long as they're able to play a competitive match against the Championship leaders, Coventry City, on Friday. This is a trying week for Wrexham, but that's a game where if they can get any points, it will go a long way to giving them the confidence to stay in the second division.\nWrexham and Coventry City will face off on Friday at 4 p.m. ET live on Paramount+.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks had already undergone fairly drastic changes when they reportedly attempted to negotiate a blockbuster trade this offseason. New York had fired coach Tom Thibodeau despite coming two wins short of the NBA Finals. Milwaukee agreed to pay the injured Damian Lillard more than $100 million to go away so they could sign Myles Turner in a desperate effort to remain competitive. Even after the fact, though, neither side could be described as fully settled.Giannis Antetokounmpo is two years away from free agency, which effectively means he is one year away from either extending his contract with the Bucks or getting traded to a team he prefers. According to ESPN's Shams Charania this offseason, that team would have been the Knicks. While Antetokounmpo stopped short of directly requesting a trade, he seems to have recognized the dire situation Lillard's torn Achilles and years of iffy management around the roster's fringes have left Milwaukee in. The Knicks, with a deep, win-now roster and an incredibly desirable market in New York City, were the team that appealed to him had he moved on.New York seemingly recognized that. They notably extended Mikal Bridges on July 31. Extensions of the sort Bridges signed carry a six-month trade restriction. His contract expires on Feb. 1, a mere four days before the Feb. 5 trade deadline. If the chance to land Antetokounmpo arose during the season, they wanted the flexibility to pounce. When they discussed a deal over the summer, though, they didn't get close.Now Antetokounmpo and the Bucks will host the Knicks for the first time since those offseason rumors. He'll get asked about them. Stars are always with these long-lasting rumblings. Think of LeBron James and Anthony Davis awkwardly navigating their desire to unite in Los Angeles with the teammates they actually had in 2019. The difference here, though, is that at least for the time being, all parties involved here are likely reasonably satisfied with how things have played out. A trade may come one day, but it doesn't feel quite necessary yet.\n        \n            \n                Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo jokes about building chemistry with Myles Turner: 'Six months ago, he hated me'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Knicks wanted to improve in specific areas this offseason and, at least early on, have done so by and large. They've incredibly jumped from 28th to 1st in 3-point attempt rate. Their stale offense ranked 18th in the NBA in passes per game last season. This year, they've jumped from 281.2 to 309.3 passes per game, good for fifth in the league so far in this young season. That ball movement has been met with a similar verve and enthusiasm from the players themselves. Players are cutting and screening with a newfound intentionality. Everyone is touching the ball, and everyone is involved in the offense when they aren't. Heck, everyone is just involved, period. Gone are the days of Thibodeau's infamously short rotations. Mike Brown has used 12 players thus far, and 11 of them have played at least 28 minutes in three games. The democratization of the New York Knicks has, to this point, been a smashing success.\nThe Bucks have never been further from a democracy. It's a Giannisocracy in Milwaukee, and that has suited the Bucks just fine. His usage rate is up to 36.1%, the highest of his career, aside from his 2020 MVP season and the 2022-23 campaign, when he largely played without Khris Middleton. He's leading the NBA in rebounds, setting a new career-high in assists and averaging an absurd 36 points per game. The metrics suggest that this is the best he's ever played. He's blowing past career-best marks so far in virtually every all-in-one metric. The single-season PER record, for reference, is 32.85. Antetokounmpo is up to 42.82 thus far. At this rate, Antetokounmpo has a real chance at securing a third MVP trophy.The Bucks would be thrilled if he does. For all of the noise Antetokounmpo has made about winning another championship, the Bucks really don't have to get there this season. They just need to stall. If they can get to the summer without receiving a firm trade demand, they'll gain control of both a 2026 first-round pick (the worse of their own and New Orleans') and their own 2033 first-round pick from a trade perspective. Whenever Antetokounmpo gets close to leaving, Jon Horst pulls a rabbit out of his hat. Jrue Holiday. Lillard. Turner. If the Bucks can just survive until the summer, they can swing for another. If Antetokounmpo -- surrounded almost exclusively by shooters that amplify him as a ball-handler -- can win another MVP or come close, that seems like an attainable goal.We have a long way to go here. Until Giannis actually signs an extension, these rumors are going to persist. There's frankly plenty of time for any of the involved parties to develop some urgency. We're only three games into the season. It's too early to crown the Knicks Eastern Conference favorites, and if they don't reach the Finals, they're going to look into significant roster upgrades in the offseason. It's one thing to play the way Antetokounmpo has for three games. It's another to do so for 82. Can he handle this workload forever? Would he prefer to seek a true co-star in the short term to help him out? If the Bucks sense things going awry, is there a chance they'd act early in an attempt to retain more control over a possible trade than to allow Antetokounmpo to force his way somewhere specific, like New York, when he has the leverage to do so on an expiring contract?\nThese are all valid questions. The Antetokounmpo saga is going to take more twists and turns. But this isn't a repeat of James and Davis in 2019. Early in the season, the Knicks and Bucks are both reasonably happy with where they are. The Knicks have every reason to believe they can make the Finals without Antetokounmpo. The Bucks have every reason to believe they've been competitive enough to hold down the fort until they can bring in reinforcements next summer. A trade might make sense one day. It doesn't quite yet. Both sides are probably happy that they'll be able to see this season play out organically before making any decisions on a matter this seismic.\n            ",

Check out SportsLine's Week 10 projections here\nIt continues to be a difficult season for Sam Houston (0-7) and first-year coach Phil Longo. The seven-game losing streak to start the season is one defeat shy of matching the program's start in 2023, the Bearkats' first year in the FBS. As for Louisiana Tech (4-3), it's trying to climb back above .500 in conference play after consecutive losses to C-USA title contenders. Quarterback Blake Baker set career highs in completions (31), pass attempts (45) and passing yards (340) in last week's overtime loss to Western Kentucky. He could have another big game against a Sam Houston pass defense that ranks last in C-USA this season.UAB vs. UConnDate: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 12 p.m.Location: Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field -- East Hartford, ConnecticutTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: UConn -11.5 | Will the Huskies cover?

When the Blazers take the field in Week 10, it'll be more than 1,500 days since they last won consecutive games in a season.

Check out SportsLine's Week 10 projections hereAlthough Liberty (3-4) still has an overall losing record, the Flames are in the C-USA title hunt with a chance to string together their third consecutive win when hosting Delaware (4-3). A healthy Ethan Vasko has energized the Liberty offense after scoring a season-high 30 points in a win at New Mexico State in Week 8. The Flames will need another strong showing to keep pace with Delaware and quarterback Nick Minicucci, arguably the top passer in C-USA this season.Wyoming vs. San Diego StateDate: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 7 p.m.Location: Snapdragon Stadium -- San Diego, CaliforniaTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: San Diego State -11.5 | Will the Aztecs cover?

The Cowboys have a respectable defense of their own, allowing just 19.8 points per game, which is second in the conference behind San Diego State.Hawaii vs. San Jose StateDate: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 7 p.m.Location: CEFCU Stadium -- San Jose, CaliforniaTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: San Jose State -2.5 | Will the Spartans cover?

The veteran passer ranks fifth in the FBS in passing yards per game (307.0) and hasn't thrown an interception since Week 2 at Texas.\n            ",

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.                   The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.                   By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                  \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.                   Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                       \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

    "body": "\n        If the Kentucky Derby is horse racing's Super Bowl, then the Breeders' Cup is horse racing's Olympics.The Breeders' Cup annually attracts many of the best horses from around the world to compete in 14 different events -- everything from the $1 million five-furlong Juvenile Turf Sprint for 2-year-olds on the grass to North America's richest race: the $7 million Classic for 3-year-olds and up at 1¼ miles on the dirt.  This year's Breeder's Cup, which will be held Friday and Saturday at Del Mar just north of San Diego, has brought more than 170 horses from 13 countries, including England, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Chile and, of course, the United States. The lineup is led by Sovereignty, the regal Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes winner who will be looking to clinch Horse of the Year honors with a win in the Classic. The horse, however, developed a temperature on Monday night, and his status for the race is up in the air.Then there's Minnie Hauk, a 3-year-old filly from Europe who came within a whisker of winning the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and will be facing older males in the $5 million Turf. Among those she will have to beat is Rebel's Romance, who will attempt to become just the third horse to win in three different Breeders' Cups.\nBut those aren't the only horses who will be worth watching at the Breeders' Cup. SportsLine horse racing expert and microshare horse owner Jeff Hochman will be at Del Mar for the Breeders' Cup and has identified seven must-watch horses for Saturday. From an ultimate underdog to a hometown hero, these four-legged animals have stories that go beyond their ability to run fast.Note: These are Hochman's seven horses to watch, not necessarily seven horses to bet. Hochman's Breeders' Cup Classic picks are available at SportsLine for subscribers. Straight No Chaser (Sprint)Defending Sprint champion returnsThe 6-year-old colt by Speightster returns to Del Mar with unfinished business: defending his crown in the Breeders' Cup Sprint after capturing both the 2024 Eclipse Award as Champion Male Sprinter and last year's Santa Anita Sprint in commanding fashion. After his championship season, he journeyed halfway across the globe to Saudi Arabia, where he dominated the Riyadh Dirt Sprint at King Abdulaziz Racecourse in February 2025, securing an automatic berth back to the Breeders' Cup Sprint.\nThough he finished third as the favorite in September's Santa Anita Sprint Championship, Straight No Chaser has been training exceptionally well for the Breeders' Cup. His four-furlong workout in 47.20 was the best of 72 at Santa Anita, prompting trainer Dan Blacker to declare, \"He worked really well. We're on target for the Breeders' Cup.\" This will be the last race of his career, as the ownership group has already agreed with WinStar Farms to retire him to stud after this event. This makes Straight No Chaser an exciting athlete, and thousands of fans will cheer for him to win his final career race at his hometown track.Seismic Beauty (Distaff)Del Mar's hometown heroSeismic Beauty has truly transformed into an impressive two-turn filly. After her connections decided to stretch her out in distance, she has won three races in a row, each more convincing than the last. Her most recent triumph was in the Grade 1 Clement L. Hirsch Stakes at Del Mar in August, in which she showcased her dominance. She's now 3-for-3 lifetime at the seaside oval. The familiarity with Del Mar provides psychological and physical advantages that shouldn't be underestimated in a race of this magnitude. The recent defections from the Distaff field make Seismic Beauty even more formidable. Several esteemed older mares have opted for different targets, resulting in a race that will likely make her the betting favorite.The way she bolts to the front right from the start creates such thrilling moments, and you can't help but feel the tension as she dares the competition to keep up with her all the way down the Del Mar stretch, which is the shortest in the country.\nRebel's Romance (Turf)Chasing historic third Turf titleIf any horse embodies the globetrotting spirit and international prestige of the Breeders' Cup, it's Godolphin's magnificent Rebel's Romance. The 7-year-old Dubawi gelding returns to Del Mar with an opportunity to make history: becoming the first horse to win the Breeders' Cup Turf three times. He has won five races this year from seven starts, including prestigious victories in the Group 1 Grosser Preis von Berlin in Germany and a commanding 3½-length score in the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at Aqueduct in September. Rebel's Romance's bid for a historic third Breeders' Cup Turf title is must-see TV.Fierceness (Classic)The beast from the East seeks Classic gloryFew horses arrive at the Breeders' Cup with as much talent, pedigree and unfinished business as Fierceness. The 4-year-old City of Light colt trained by Hall of Famer Todd Pletcher returns to Del Mar seeking redemption after finishing a gutsy second to Sierra Leone in last year's edition. Fierceness encompasses the complete package: pedigree, talent, tactical speed and big-race experience. However, he has also put in some disappointing performances in winnable situations. For that reason, he's a must-watch for me.Rhetorical (Mile)The Ultimate Underdog StoryRhetorical's trainer, Will Walden, has traveled a difficult road to reach racing's biggest stage. The son of WinStar Farm CEO Elliott Walden, Will struggled with severe drug and alcohol addiction for years before finding sobriety through the Stable Recovery program at Shepherds House in Kentucky. The program, created by Taylor Made Farm's Frank Taylor, helps recovering people with an addiction find employment and purpose within the thoroughbred industry.Rhetorical's racing history might be brief, but it's impressive. After an 8½-month layoff following his debut, the gelding returned in May 2025 with a runaway five-length allowance victory that opened eyes. He followed with increasingly impressive wins, culminating in the Coolmore Turf Mile at Keeneland in October, a Grade 1 race featuring seasoned European turf stars. In the Turf Mile, Rhetorical posted a shocking 9-1 upset, settling fourth early before unleashing a powerful late run under Irad Ortiz Jr. to defeat Program Trading and Brilliant Berti by ¾ length, posting a career-best 120 Equibase Speed Figure. Rhetorical may be a longshot against more experienced international turf milers, but that makes him intriguing. It would be a remarkable story and a fitting conclusion for all involved.\nNysos (Dirt Mile)Raw speed meets mile distanceThe 4-year-old Nyquist colt possesses speed figures that put him on another planet from most dirt horses, yet his tendency to miss training and races due to physical setbacks makes every start feel like a precious opportunity. When healthy and on the track, Nysos is simply devastating. His career record of five wins and one second from just six starts tells only part of the story; the manner of those victories captures attention. He opened his career with three consecutive wins by a combined 26¾ lengths, including a 7½-length romp in the 2024 Robert B. Lewis Stakes. If -- and it's admittedly a significant if -- Nysos makes it to post time for the Dirt Mile, he represents perhaps the most talented horse in the entire field.She Feels Pretty (Filly & Mare Turf)Turf Mare ExcellenceShe Feels Pretty burst onto the scene as a 2-year-old, winning the Grade 1 Natalma Stakes in just her second career start, a performance that gave trainer Cherie DeVaux her first Grade 1 triumph and punched the filly's ticket to the Breeders' Cup. Since then, She Feels Pretty has methodically built a record demanding respect: four Grade 1 victories and earnings exceeding $2 million across three racing seasons. There's really something exciting about seeing an American turf mare born and raised here compete against the top horses from Europe in a Breeders' Cup race. Can she outshine the European challengers and take home that prized victory? It's one of the most captivating storylines to watch on race day. She Feels Pretty enters the Breeders' Cup as the likely favorite among American-based runners.\n            ",

The Lions, 5-2 on the year, had a bye during Week 8 and are 8.5-point home favorites over the Vikings on Sunday, per FanDuel.\"Honestly, I didn't even watch the game for real,\" Branch said. \"I couldn't. I love them. I think they know where I stand with them. I would die out there for them boys. I play as hard as I can to help us. Just do what I gotta do to help them. ... watching them would make me miss being out there. That's something that's hard.

UFC 322 takes place in Madison Square Garden on Nov. 15, with two superfights on the poster. Jack Della Maddalena vs. Islam Makhachev and Valentina Shevchenko vs. Zhang Weili headline the massive pay-per-view.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.\nUFC 322 also features numerous notable undercard fighters: former UFC champion Leon Edwards, top welterweight contender Sean Brady, popular prospect Bo Nickal and the ultra-violent Benoit Saint Denis.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

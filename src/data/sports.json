There was no drama in the final game of the wild-card round, however, with the Texans routing the Steelers, 30–6, on Monday night to earn the first road playoff win in franchise history. Houston became the eighth and final team to punch its ticket to the divisional round.In the AFC, the Texans will be joined by New England, Buffalo and Denver. The top-seeded Broncos, coming off a bye, will be in action for the first time this postseason when they host the Bills on Saturday. Houston, meanwhile, will head to New England on Sunday with a spot in the AFC Championship Game on the line.In the NFC, Seattle and San Francisco will meet for the third time this season after splitting their first two matchups. The Seahawks are well-rested after a wild-card bye, while the 49ers will be playing on just five days' rest. In the other divisional matchup, the Bears will host the Rams, marking Chicago's first home divisional-round game in 15 years.With that in mind, here's the full playoff schedule, including the dates and kickoff times for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) Jaguars\nBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) SteelersTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick-six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history. Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17(6) Bills at (1) Broncos, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS)(6) 49ers at (1) Seahawks, 8 p.m. ET (Fox)Sunday, Jan. 18(5) Texans at (2) Patriots, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)(5) Rams at (2) Bears, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC Championship, 3 p.m. ET (CBS)NFC Championship, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

However, it's a losing one for Pittsburgh, which has lost six straight postseason games. Houston owns the No. 1 total defense and No. 2 scoring defense, while it also ranks second-best in the league in turnover differential (+17). The Texans truly have no weak links on defense, as they are the only squad that ranks among the top six in both stopping the run and defending the pass.

Pittsburgh also has a streak which makes Houston's nine-game win streak pale in comparison, as the Steelers have won an astounding 23 straight home games on Monday nights. This Steelers team ranks in the top five in both turnover differential and in sack differential, making it one of two NFL teams that can make that claim. Pittsburgh will welcome back DK Metcalf from suspension, and he has four touchdowns over his last two playoff games. On the other hand, offense is clearly Houston's weakness as only three teams average fewer yards per carry, and just two teams have a worst red-zone conversion percentage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Bet Jaylen Warren to go over 69.5 rushing + receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Steelers vs. Texans  picksWhite has analyzed Texans vs. Steelers   from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\n        In a strange twist of fate, those whose headline-making departures from the PGA Tour legitimized LIV Golf four years ago find themselves in a unique position to end it for good. When the PGA Tour announced on Monday that it had created a new pathway for Brooks Koepka to return to the PGA Tour, it accomplished more than welcoming back one of the game's brightest stars.Koepka left LIV Golf a few days before Christmas, citing that he wanted to spend more time with his family in 2026. The split was mutual, according to a league statement that primarily boasted Talor Gooch's impending captaincy of Smash GC, the LIV Golf team Koepka previously led.The PGA Tour responded to Koepka's decision by releasing a statement within minutes of his departure, calling the player a \"highly accomplished professional\" while stating the tour \"continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.\"Internal conversations were held. PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp met with Koepka on multiple occasions. Meetings took place. A new pathway was concocted out of thin air. Majority approval was achieved, and on Monday, membership was made aware of the reinstatement decision. All of this transpired in a three-week window during the holidays leading into the start of the 2026 season.\nIn doing so, the PGA Tour not only opened an expedited pathway for Koepka to return without serving a year-long suspension, it created an opportunity to deal a massive blow to its rival, one from which it may not be able to recover.Koepka's journey back to the PGA Tour may well serve as a returned knife in the back of LIV Golf -- considering the league previously poached the big-swinging Floridian -- but it's not a death blow. That opportunity belongs to three other players who are now suddenly eligible to come back through the PGA Tour's Returning Membership Program: Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith.Whether any or all choose to take the PGA Tour up on its offer is anyone's best guess, of course.\nRahm's lucrative contract started towards the end of 2023, and it could be a bear to extricate himself from it, even if he wished, which some have suggested he does.DeChambeau is up for negotiations and could become the richest golfer to ever walk on this planet if he plays his cards right. Phil Mickelson once described working with LIV Golf as a once-in-a-lifetime leverage opportunity. That word, \"leverage?\" DeChambeau has in spades.Smith seems intent on remaining where he plays alongside his fellow Australians with a laidback schedule, but a PGA Tour return cannot be ruled out, either, particularly if some other top-level players depart ahead of him.\nWithout those three, what would be left of LIV Golf?A bunch of (mostly) has-beens traveling the world, participating in a rowdy tournament in Australia that is considered the event of year yet comes across as more of a concert than golf event? Players like Joaquin Niemann, Patrick Reed and Tyrell Hatton stranded in what can only be described as no man's land? Oh, the teams. How could we forget about The Crushers? They may be EBITDA positive, but would they be without DeChambeau?These were not questions being asked three weeks ago as LIV Golf and its backers, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, long ago decided they would spend whatever money was necessary to keep the league afloat. But with DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith now having a deadline of Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf kicks off its season -- to decide on their future, sport-defining change could come swiftly.After four years of an intersport battle that has split golf -- involving defections, pointless meetings, grand proclamations, flash mobs, weird messages to set up even weirder announcements and a lot of grandstanding with little to show for it -- it could all come down to these next three weeks.\nThe ball is officially in the court of DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith, and it's the PGA Tour who handed it to them.\n            ",

Possibly aiding the Steelers in their quest to accomplish that goal is their unbelievable record at home in games played on Monday night over the past four decades. Since 1992, the Steelers won a whopping 23 straight home games on \"Monday Night Football.\" Pittsburgh's last home loss on Monday night came in a 23-20 loss to the New York Giants on October 14, 1991. Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll was on the sidelines the last time Pittsburgh lost a Monday Night Football home game. Fellow Hall of Famer Bill Cowher's teams went 11-0 at home on Monday night. His successor, Mike Tomlin, has gone 12-0 in home  \"Monday Night Football\" games. \nPittsburgh suffered a loss to the visiting Washington Commanders on a Monday game in 2020, but that game wasn't on prime time as it was part of the NFL's COVID rescheduling.LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Texans in a playoff edition of \"Monday Night Football.\" Steelers 'Monday Night Football' home results since 1992DateOpponentResultOct. 19, 1992Cincinnati BengalsW, 20-0Nov. 15, 1993Buffalo Bills W, 23-0 Oct. 3, 1994 Houston Oilers W, 30-14Nov. 14, 1994Buffalo Bills W, 23-10Nov. 13, 1995Cleveland Browns W, 20-3 Sept. 16, 1996 Buffalo Bills W, 24-6 Nov. 9, 1998 Green Bay Packers W, 27-20 Oct. 25, 1999Atlanta Falcons W, 13-9 Oct. 29, 2001Tennessee Titans W, 34-7 Oct. 21, 2002Indianapolis Colts W, 28-10 Oct. 31, 2005Baltimore Ravens W, 20-19 Nov. 5, 2007Baltimore Ravens W, 38-7Nov. 26, 2007Miami Dolphins W, 3-0 Sept. 28, 2008 Baltimore Ravens W, 23-20  (OT)Nov. 12, 2012Kansas City Chiefs W, 16-13 (OT)Oct. 20, 2014 Houston Texans W, 30-23 Sept. 30, 2019 Cincinnati Bengals W, 27-3 Oct. 28, 2019 Miami Dolphins W, 27-14 Nov. 8. 2021 Chicago Bears W, 29-27 Jan. 3, 2022 Cleveland Browns W, 26-14 Sept. 18, 2023Cleveland Browns W, 26-22 Oct. 28, 2024 New York Giants W, 26-18 Dec. 15, 2025 Miami Dolphins W, 28-15 Pittsburgh's home unbeaten streak on Monday night featured several memorable performances including: \nA dominant, 23-0 win over a Bills team that bounced Pittsburgh out the playoffs a year earlier in the 1992 AFC Divisional round. Jerome Bettis' coming out party as a Steeler in 1996 that included 133 rushing yards and two touchdowns in a blowout win over the Bills. A dramatic win over Brett Favre and the defending NFC champion Packers in 1998.A convincing win over Peyton Manning's Colts in 2002 that included a halftime ceremony for Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Two come-from-behind wins over the Ravens during the Steelers' two most recent Super Bowl-winning seasons. James Harrison's coming out party that included 3.5 sacks, three forced fumbles and a pick in a 2007 win over Baltimore. His return from retirement seven years later helped spark the Steelers to a win over the Texans on Monday night. Mason Rudolph led the Steelers to two convincing wins on Monday night in 2019 after replacing Ben Roethlisberger, who was out with a season-ending injury. Pittsburgh survives a gritty comeback attempt by future Steelers quarterback Justin Fields in 2021. The Steelers win a defensive duel against the Browns in 2021, Roethlisberger's final home game. Rodgers had one of his best games of the 2025 regular season on Monday night, going 23 of 27 for 224 yards and two scores during Pittsburgh's Week 15 win over Miami. \"I care about winning.

It's another brutal blow for one of the nation's most disappointing teams.\"We just finished a long meeting with Jaland Lowe, a really emotional meeting, actually,\" Pope said on The Mark Pope Show. \"... He's dislocated his shoulder three times now. Every time it's been with less and less contact. He's tweaked it in games and tweaked it once in practice to add on top of that. We searched, tried every possible reasonable scenario to have him continue on but just made the wise and right decision today that he'll go have surgery, and so he'll be out for the season. It'll be multiple months -- six months, give or take -- rehab for him to get back to 100 percent health. I don't know if I've seen a guy go through more in such a short span.\"Lowe, a transfer from Pittsburgh, was expected to be a major part of the Wildcats' season, but the shoulder issues have limited him to nine games and two starts. There was a strong three-game stretch in late December and early January in which Lowe averaged 15.7 points and helped lead wins over Indiana and St. John's. But he struggled in last week's loss to Missouri and then played just three minutes in Saturday's win over Mississippi State before re-injuring the shoulder.Overall, Kentucky is and one of the country's most disappointing teams. After being ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll, the Wildcats sit just 10-6 (1-2 SEC), and they are just 1-5 against ranked opponents. Pope has had to juggle a variety of issues, from inconsistent effort to poor perimeter shooting to injuries. Jayden Quaintance, an Arizona State transfer coming off a torn ACL, has appeared in just four games. Alabama transfer Mouhamed Dioubate missed nearly a month with an ankle injury.\nLowe's injury is a particularly damaging one, though, as he is the only natural point guard on the roster. Pope mentioned Jasper Johnson, a four-star freshman, as one of the players who will need to step up in Lowe's absence. Top scorer Otega Oweh could take on a larger ball-handling role, too.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Russell Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +2000 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        The Boston Celtics fell two possessions short in one of their biggest games of the season thus far: a 100-95 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. Notable in the defeat was a free-throw discrepancy in which the Spurs made 10 more foul shots (14) than the Celtics even attempted (four). Celtics star Jaylen Brown took exception to the distribution of whistles in the loss and after the game unleashed a minute-and-a-half-long diatribe against the officials.The NBA responded Monday with a $35,000 fine for public criticism of the officiating. The league cited Brown's postgame remarks to reporters as well as a social media post in which he said he is \"sick of this s---.\"Brown, who scored 27 points but did not go to the charity stripe once, called out official Curtis Blair by name and lamented the \"inconsistency\" in the amount of contact allowed on the two ends of the floor.\"I'll accept the fine at this point,\" Brown said. \"I thought it was some bulls---- tonight. I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody could just pull up the clips, because it's the same s--- every time we play a good team. It's like, they refuse to make a call, and they call touch-fouls on the other end. That's just extremely frustrating, bro.\"The foul totals were not dramatically out of balance, as Boston was whistled 18 times to San Antonio's 13. But the majority of the Celtics' infractions sent the Spurs to the line, and their 20 free-throw attempts were a factor in the game's outcome. Brown himself was guilty of four fouls, which tied a game-high.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: The Mavericks should've folded their Anthony Davis hand a long time ago\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We play hard,\" Brown said. \"We are outplaying our expectations. We compete hard on the defensive end. They reward the other team with touch-fouls, and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with it. Somebody, please, pull it up. Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the f----ing fine. Curtis (Blair), all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care; they can fine me whatever they want. It's crazy. Every time we play a good team, it's the same bulls---. Somebody, please, pull up the clips.\"The loss knocked the Celtics fell to 24-14 with the loss. But even with the defeat, Boston is in a much better position than the vast majority of prognosticators foresaw before the season. Despite the absence of the injured Jayson Tatum and the flurry of offseason moves that sent key contributors out of town, the Celtics are squarely in the race for the East's top seed.\"I'm irate at how they officiated the game today,\" Brown said. \"If we can't get to the free throw line, and teams are allowed to be physical and bump us off our spots, then it's hard to win games like that. We shot four free throws tonight and lost the game by four. Not to say that's the whole game, the whole story. We gotta be better in spots. But goddamn, like, I'm driving to the basket, I'm physical, I don't flop, I don't shy away from contact, I go up strong, I'm athletic, and nothing. I had zero free throws tonight. The inconsistency is f---ing crazy.\"\nBrown is in the midst of a career year and is on pace to set a personal best in scoring with his 29.5 points per game. His usage has skyrocketed with Tatum on the shelf, and he leads the NBA with 16.1 2-point attempts per contest.\n            ",

The Steelers finished the season 10-7 after winning four of their final five games, and they enter the postseason playing some of their best football of the year.Houston finished second in the AFC South at 12-5, but ended the year as the hottest team in the NFL. The Texans dropped to 3-5 after a Week 9 loss to the Broncos, then ripped off nine consecutive wins to end the season. Led by one of the most ferocious defenses in the league, they are certainly playing their best ball of the year as well.Will the Texans go on the road and knock off Pittsburgh, or will the Steelers pull off the upset? We'll find out soon enough. Before we dig into some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Texans in a playoff edition of \"Monday Night Football.\"Where to watch Steelers vs. Texans liveDate: Monday, Jan. 12 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -3, O/U 38.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesHot at the right time. Both of these teams enter this game playing quite well. As mentioned above, the Steelers have won four out of their last five games and the Texans have won nine in a row. The Steelers have turned the ball over just once during that five-game span and have scored 26-plus points in each of the four wins after doing so just five times in their first 12 games. The Texans have forced multiple turnovers in five of their nine consecutive wins and allowed 20 points or less in six of them. Aaron Rodgers in the playoffs. Rodgers won a Super Bowl in his second postseason appearance, going 4-0 in the playoffs along the way. Since then, though, he is just 7-9 in postseason action. He's played fairly well (63.8% completion rate, 7.3 yards per attempt, 32 touchdowns against 10 interceptions) but his teams have lost several games they probably should have won, including a pair of overtime losses. Rodgers also hasn't actually played in the playoffs since the 2021 season, when he went 20 of 29 for 225 scoreless yards in a 13-10 loss to the 49ers. He'll now face one of the best defenses in the NFL this time around.Houston's defense. The Texans finished the season first in yards allowed, second in points allowed and tied for first in TruMedia's version of EPA per play. You can't really throw the ball on them -- teams completed only 59.3% of their passes at an average of just 5.8 yards per attempt, with 20 touchdowns against 19 interceptions. Opponents averaged -0.13 EPA per dropback, which means the Texans basically turned every quarterback into J.J. McCarthy. But you also can't really run on the Texans. Opponents averaged just 4.0 yards per carry, and only 1.08 per carry before contact, via TruMedia. The Texans are one of the best tackling teams in the NFL, and they don't allow teams to get going downhill against them.Playoff picture. After the Patriots and Bills won on Sunday, the winner of this game will head to New England to take on the Pats in the divisional round. New England is coming off a 16-3 victory over the Chargers. The Steelers beat the Patriots earlier this season in a game where the Pats turned the ball over five times. The Texans and Patriots didn't play, as the Pats' only regular-season games against playoff teams were that game against the Steelers and a pair of matchups against the Bills. That win over the Pats was Pittsburgh's only victory against a fellow playoff team during the regular season, as the Steelers went 1-5 in those games. The Texans, meanwhile, went 4-4 in games against playoff teams after starting the season 0-3 in those contests.Steelers vs. Texans predictionLook, I've been picking against the Steelers all season and they keep making me look stupid by pulling games out of their collective butts. But I'm still picking against them here. I just can't see them consistently moving the ball against this ferocious Houston defense -- especially if Rodgers is unwilling to hold on to the ball for long enough to even try pushing it down the field. All the checkdowns he likes to throw to the running backs don't work as well against the Texans as they do against other teams because of how they rally to the ball. I'm not sure Houston can move the ball with any degree of consistency on the other side, but I'm going to back the team with the best single unit in the game here.\nPick: Texans 16, Steelers 10 | (Texans -3, Under 38.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's head coach hiring cycle was turned on its head last week when the Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh.While the hourglass on his time in Baltimore ran out, Harbaugh instantly became the top candidate on the market for the remaining seven teams looking to fill a head coaching vacancy. His availability has prompted teams to reach out in earnest to set up meetings to pitch the veteran head coach on joining their franchise. Harbaugh has yet to interview for any openings officially, but that will change in short order. Harbaugh previously told Fox Sports that while plenty of teams have reached out, he's going to narrow his search to roughly three or four teams and then go through the interview process with those franchises. Sports Illustrated reports that Harbaugh had preliminary calls with the Browns, Cardinals, Dolphins, Falcons, Giants, Raiders, and Titans, and after hearing those preliminary pitches, he will now figure out which teams he'd like to interview with. As Harbaugh scouts for his next destination in the NFL, let's do the same. Below, we'll rank the three best fits for the head coach.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Tennessee TitansAccording to The Athletic, Harbaugh spent the last few days watching film on a couple of young quarterbacks, including Cam Ward. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft flashed down the stretch of his rookie year, albeit during a forgettable 3-14 campaign for Tennessee.NFL Media added on Monday that Harbaugh likes what he sees in Tennessee, because of Ward's presence along with the organization effectively being a blank slate. Yes, the roster needs to be rebuilt, but the organization has the ammunition to jump-start a turnaround. The Titans are armed with a projected $100-plus million in cap space, the second most in the NFL at the moment. On top of that, they have the fourth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and the presence of Ward allows them to take one of the best non-QB prospects in the class. When you pair those assets with Ward, it's a strong starting point for Harbaugh.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Atlanta FalconsA Matt Ryan-John Harbaugh-led Falcons franchise feels like an awfully powerful duo. The franchise has already hired its former MVP quarterback as its first-ever president of football, and now it needs to find a head coach to replace Raheem Morris. If Atlanta were to lure Harbaugh, it would instantly possess one of the top brain trusts in the league, which is something Harbaugh likely recognizes as well and the two sides have already conducted an interview. From a football perspective, the Falcons are a strong candidate on a couple of different fronts. They have loads of star power on the roster. Offensively, Bijan Robinson is one of the best running backs in the NFL, while wideout Drake London is an up-and-coming star at the position in his own right. On defense, the unit features All-Pro cornerback A.J. Terrell and some fascinating first-year players, such as pass rusher James Pearce Jr. and safety Xavier Watts. On top of that, the Falcons play in a very winnable division in the NFC South.The major sticking point with this possible pairing is the quarterback position, specifically Harbaugh's view of Michael Penix Jr. The former first-round pick is coming off a season-ending ACL tear and has been up and down over the course of his young career. If Harbaugh thinks he can win with Penix, then the Falcons check a ton of boxes.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New York GiantsThere's a really good argument to be made for the Giants as the top job for Harbaugh. We noted that Cam Ward was one of the quarterbacks Harbaugh is reportedly watching tape on -- well, so is Jaxson Dart. New York is a destination that has a young quarterback in place, and Dart flashed a tremendously high ceiling during his rookie campaign. That said, he'll need to be reined in with some of his scrambling, which Harbaugh should view as an easy fix. Once Dart gets that honed in, he'll be quite the dual-threat quarterback, which Harbaugh knows something about after coaching Lamar Jackson to two NFL MVP awards.But the Giants are not just a good fit because of Dart. The roster has potential, with wideout Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo headlining a young skill-position group, along with a defensive line that features Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter. \nNew York also has the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, so there is another avenue to bring in an instant-impact player. This is the type of group that can turn around in a hurry with the right coach, like Harbaugh, and he seems to recognize that. Giants executive Chris Mara told The Athletic that he met Harbaugh for lunch on Sunday and had an informal meeting at the coach's house. The report adds that Harbaugh remains very interested in the New York job. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The wild card round of the NFL playoffs is complete, meaning three-quarters of the first-round draft order is locked in. It was the first of two anticipated draft-related developments this week. Wednesday is the deadline for underclassmen not participating in the College Football Playoffs to declare for the 2026 NFL Draft. One of the biggest remaining questions is whether or not Oregon quarterback Dante Moore will declare.  The pieces are starting to come together and the 2026 NFL Draft is only a little more than three months away. Collegiate All-Star games will also begin late later this month. Invitations are going out to NFL Scouting Combine participants, but an official list will not be revealed until mid-February.     As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. \nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon):1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas over-extended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top-10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. 2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. 3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.\n4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. If they get the head coach hire right, then maybe the a bounce back will happen sooner than most would expect.   6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. \n7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then they will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. 8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog. Assuming Patrick Mahomes' full health, there is no reason to believe the Chiefs will not be in the mix again next season. They do have a deteriorating roster that desperately needs a youthful infusion. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-11)Joe Burrow made a notable attempt to get the Bengals into the playoffs after succumbing to an injury early in the season, but ultimately fell short. The offense will be in a spot to compete next season, but can the defense improve enough this offseason to get them enough stops?\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Steelers beef up the offensive line with Aaron Rodgers' future in doubt\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n11. Miami Dolphins (7-10)Fans can say what they want about the Mike McDaniel era in Miami, but few had such a recognizable aesthetic as the Dolphins' former coach. It is a fresh start for the organization with a new general manager, new head coach and presumably a new quarterback.12. Dallas Cowboys (7-9-1)Dallas is once again searching for answers this offseason. Dak Prescott was healthy and the team still failed to reach the playoffs with a new head coach. \n13. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (8-9)Atlanta fired Raheem Morris as head coach for a second time. They sent their first round pick to Los Angeles as part of the trade up for James Pearce Jr. 14. Baltimore Ravens (8-9)For the first time since 2007, the Ravens will have a new head coach after firing John Harbaugh. It sounds as though the franchise chose Lamar Jackson -- who turned 29-years-old one day after Harbaugh's firing -- over the veteran coach. 15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)Other organizations have been quick to make a head coaching change, but the Buccaneers are going down the path of firing coordinators rather than a change at the top. \n16. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-9)Cornerback Sauce Gardner struggled to stay healthy and the Colts' pick being sent to New York rose precipitously by the week. 17. Detroit Lions (9-8)The coaching drain that took place after last season's run was likely understated in the moment given the presence Dan Campbell has over that organization, but that, along with a few veteran offensive line departures, led to a much more tumultuous season.18. Minnesota Vikings (9-8)J.J. McCarthy's season was volatile, which was once the expectation for a young quarterback. Recent rookie performances from Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud set unrealistic expectations for the majority. Caleb Williams is proof that situation matters. \n19. Carolina Panthers (8-9)The team with the worst record in the NFL Playoffs, but also a home game, was the first punted from the postseason. Although not a desirable conclusion, the Panthers have to be pleased with how the season played out. 20. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-7-1)The team with the second worst record in the NFL Playoffs was also dispatched after building a 21-3 lead over the division rival Bears. It is going to be an interesting offseason for the Packers. 21. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7)The Steelers couldn't do anything against an elite Texans defense as the team suffered its seventh straight playoff loss.\n22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)The Chargers are headed home for the season after falling to the Patriots in the wild card round.23. Philadelphia Eagles (11-6)A frustrating season, for fans and receivers alike, came to an end Sunday against the 49ers. The Eagles will be doing some soul searching this offseason. 24. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)The Jaguars have every reason to celebrate their accomplishments this season. Yes, they lost in the wild card round as the home team, but a year ago, they were making preparations for the No. 5 overall pick. The future is bright for a team who played most of this season without No. 2 overall selection Travis Hunter.\n25. Chicago Bears (11-6)Chicago came back from an 18-point deficit to beat the rival Packers for the second time this season. Ben Johnson advances to the divisional round in his first season as head coach. 26. Buffalo Bills (12-5)Buffalo was the road team everyone in the AFC wanted to avoid, because Josh Allen has been battle tested in the playoffs. The Bills demonstrated why many felt that way Sunday.27. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)San Francisco overcame an injury to tight end George Kittle and enacted revenge over the Eagles for the NFC Championship game two years ago. 28. Houston Texans (12-5)Houston was one of the hottest teams in the NFL entering the postseason, and its defense continued to dominate in a win over the Steelers in the wild card round.29. Los Angeles Rams (12-5)The Rams took care of business on the road against the Panthers in the wild card round. 30. New England Patriots (14-3)The Patriots and Chargers have the \"Sunday Night Football\" game in the wild card round.31. Denver Broncos (14-3)The Broncos earned the No. 1 seed in the AFC West and a first-round bye with a victory over the Trey Lance-led Chargers in Week 18.32. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Seattle clinched the NFC West crown and the top seed last week.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs are in full swing, and while most of the attention is on the teams vying for a Lombardi Trophy, most clubs are already focused on the offseason. Eight organizations are currently searching for a new head coach. Interviews are expected to ramp up this week, but no team has hired its next leader yet.With all eight jobs -- 25% of the league -- still open, let's play matchmaker. Below, we look at each vacant head-coaching position and pair it with one of the top candidates in this hiring cycle.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals: Robert SalehPrevious position: 49ers defensive coordinatorSaleh is likely to be picky about his next job after his failed tenure with the New York Jets. One reason that first stint did not work out was New York's inability to identify a viable franchise quarterback. Arizona is in a similar spot, as the Cardinals are widely expected to move on from Kyler Murray this offseason, but they hold the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, giving them a clear path to address the position. If and when Saleh and the Cardinals solve the quarterback issue, they would have intriguing weapons -- namely Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr. -- to build around.\nWhile the quarterback situation matters, Saleh -- who has reportedly been requested to interview for the job -- would also be an attractive hire to fix what was a disastrous Arizona defense in 2025. The Cardinals allowed 28.7 points per game and 358.9 total yards per game, both of which ranked in the bottom 10 in the NFL. Even during his lean years in New York, Saleh was able to elevate the defense, and he has done a masterful job keeping an injury-riddled 49ers unit humming into the divisional round.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons: Mike McDanielPrevious position: Dolphins head coachThe Falcons are an intriguing destination this cycle. On one hand, they have a boatload of talent on both sides of the ball, headlined by superstar running back Bijan Robinson. \nHowever, whoever takes this job also needs to be confident they can get Michael Penix Jr. -- who has endured an up-and-down start to his career -- back on track. Penix is coming off a season-ending ACL injury, but team owner Arthur Blank said in his end-of-season news conference that he expects the former first-round quarterback to return to full strength.Mike McDaniel seems like a logical fit for a couple of reasons. First, he has experience getting the best out of a young quarterback, as he revitalized Tua Tagovailoa early in his tenure in Miami. There is reason to believe he could do the same with Penix, especially with a strong supporting cast already in place. Second, there is familiarity between McDaniel and the organization thanks to the arrival of Matt Ryan as the franchise's president of football. McDaniel was an offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015-16 under offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, overlapping with Ryan's tenure as quarterback, including his MVP season in 2016.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens: Kliff KingsburyPrevious position: Commanders offensive coordinator It's not hard to figure out which of the eight teams with a coaching vacancy is the cream of the crop. It's the Ravens, and it's not particularly close because of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. No other franchise searching for a head coach can offer that level of elite play and stability at quarterback, so Baltimore should have its pick of the litter. Kingsbury is widely viewed as one of the top candidates on the market this cycle, and he appears to be an ideal fit for Jackson and the rest of the Ravens offense.He has previous head-coaching experience after leading the Cardinals from 2019 to 2022, and he most recently worked with Jayden Daniels as Washington's offensive coordinator. Daniels has a similar skill set to Jackson, and Kingsbury had him operating at a high level during his rookie season, which helped the Commanders reach the NFC Championship Game. \nIf he can tune Baltimore's offense in a similar way around Jackson, the Ravens could be back among the league's top contenders in short order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns: Jim SchwartzPrevious position: Browns defensive coordinator It's rare to see a team fire its head coach and then simply elevate one of his coordinators, as most organizations prefer to clean house. However, Schwartz could be an exception. Cleveland's defense was one of the few bright spots of the 2025 season, and from the outside looking in, Schwartz appeared to have strong buy-in from his players on that side of the ball. If he commands that level of respect inside the locker room, the transition would be seamless.\nHe also has previous head-coaching experience, having led the Detroit Lions from 2009-13. If he wants another opportunity, this would be an intriguing setup, though much will hinge on what kind of offensive coordinator he brings aboard.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders: Klint KubiakPrevious position: Seahawks offensive coordinator The Raiders are an intriguing organization this cycle. The Pete Carroll era crashed and burned, but there is hope for a brighter future. That is because a trying 2025 season resulted in Las Vegas landing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, putting the franchise in position to select Heisman Trophy–winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza. If Mendoza lives up to the hype, the Raiders would suddenly have a promising young core that includes the Indiana quarterback, along with running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers. Pair that with roughly $98 million in projected cap space -- the third most in the NFL -- and this rebuild could be jump-started quickly. That should make Las Vegas an attractive destination for someone like Kubiak, who is among the most sought-after candidates.\nOver the past two years, Kubiak has built a reputation for elevating offenses. In New Orleans, he had the Saints punching above their weight in 2024. This season, as the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, Kubiak helped lead the team to the No. 1 seed in the conference with a dynamic offense. If he can get Sam Darnold to throw for more than 4,000 yards and run a unit that averages 5.9 yards per play -- tied for the third-highest in the NFL -- there's no telling what he could do with Mendoza if the rookie lives up to his billing as the top pick.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins: Jesse MinterPrevious position: Chargers defensive coordinatorI think the Dolphins want to hire John Harbaugh. The question is whether John Harbaugh wants the Miami job. That seems unlikely, given the major salary-cap reset the organization is facing and the expected departure of Tua Tagovailoa. So if Harbaugh is not in the cards, where does Miami turn next? Well, how about Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter?\nTeam owner Stephen Ross has deep ties to the University of Michigan as one of its top donors and has a relationship with Jim Harbaugh, under whom Minter is currently coaching with the Chargers. Minter served as Harbaugh's defensive coordinator at Michigan from 2022-23, including during the program's College Football Playoff national championship run in 2023, so Ross is well aware of him. This pairing also aligns better from a timeline perspective. Minter, 42, is young enough to help lead a rebuild, and Miami's defense played well down the stretch in 2025, giving him something to build on heading into 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants: John HarbaughPrevious position: Ravens head coachHarbaugh is the top coaching candidate on the market, and the best job outside of Baltimore, where he is departing, is the Giants. \nNew York has the pieces in place to begin pushing for the playoffs as soon as 2026 with the right coach. Jaxson Dart flashed as a rookie and looks like a long-term building block at quarterback, as long as Harbaugh can help rein in his tendency to scramble unnecessarily. The Giants should feel confident in Harbaugh's ability to do that, especially given how he reshaped the Ravens offense around Lamar Jackson after moving on from Joe Flacco in 2019.Beyond quarterback, the Giants also have intriguing young skill players, including wide receiver Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo, both of whom are recovering from injuries. Defensively, the presence of Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter gives New York a formidable front. On paper, the Giants check many of the boxes on Harbaugh's wish list.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh interviews with Falcons and reportedly meets with Giants exec -- which job makes the most sense?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee Titans: Kevin StefanskiPrevious position: Browns head coachStefanski is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year, and while his run in Cleveland ended, many of his issues there stemmed from the organization never solving the quarterback position. \nThat would not be a problem in Tennessee, where the Titans have Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, under center. Ward flashed late in the season, and if Stefanski likes what he sees from the young quarterback, the Titans have a lot of potential.The hardest part of a rebuild -- finding a quarterback -- is already in place, and the franchise is entering the offseason with roughly $102 million in cap space, the second most in the NFL, along with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. If the Titans can add the right pieces, they could become frisky sooner rather than later, depending on how quickly Stefanski can accelerate Ward's development.\n            ",

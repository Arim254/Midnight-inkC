    "body": "\n        The top NBA rookies and sophomores will be on display in the 2026 Rising Stars game on Friday as a part of All-Star Weekend. G-Leaguers will also compete in the four-team tournament in which the semifinals consist of teams playing to reach 40 points, with those winners then playing in the Rising Stars Championship Game to 25 points. The three teams of NBA players are coached by Hall of Famers Carmelo Anthony, Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter, with Team G League led by Austin Rivers.  The Rising Stars 2026 will begin at 9 p.m. ET from the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. Team Melo is the +140 favorite in the latest 2026 Rising Stars odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, followed by Team T-Mac at +175 and Team Vince at +320. Team Austin is the biggest longshot in the field at +900. Team Melo is the 5.5-point favorite in the first game against Team Austin, while Team T-Mac is -2.5 in the latest Rising Stars odds against Team Vince.Before making any 2026 Rising Stars picks, be sure to check out the 2026 NBA All-Star Weekend predictions from SportsLine expert Mike Barner.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins:Barner is one of the most respected voices in the industry, and his work has appeared in Sports Illustrated and on Yahoo, RotoWire and KFFL.

The three teams of NBA players consist of a mix of rookies and sophomores, with the G-League squad having only players in the NBA's developmental league. All three of the tournament games will be played to a Final Target Score, rather than over a specific period of time. \nThe first two games will be played to 40, with the final played to 25 to determine the Rising Stars Challenge champion. The first matchup at 9 p.m. ET is Team Carmelo Anthony (-4.5, O/U 73.5) vs. Team Austin Rivers, followed by Team Tracy McGrady (-2.5, O/U 74.5) vs. Team Vince Carter. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can check out the latest Kalshi promo code CBSSPORTS to get a $10 cash bonus after making $10 in trades:Top 2026 NBA Rising Stars predictionsBarner is fading Team Vince (+240), as it has the least accomplished roster of players amongst the three squads featuring NBA players. Team T-Mac has the experience edge over Vince Carter's squad in that the former has the most sophomores, with five second-year players compared to Team Vince having just three. Meanwhile, Melo's team has the reigning Rookie of the Year in Stephon Castle, plus the size edge in 7-foot-2 center Donovan Clingan.\nTeam Vince lacks the caliber of those two squads and has just two players who were top-10 draft picks in V.J. Edgecombe and Egor Demin. Melo's team has four top-5 draft picks, while T-Mac has four top-6 draftees. There's a sheer talent gap between Vince Carter's squad with those two others, and even in an exhibition game like the Rising Stars Challenge, that gulf should be apparent on the scoreboard. See more predictions at SportsLine. How to make 2026 NBA Rising Stars picksBarner has studied the NBA Rising Stars game from every angle and found a critical X-factor that makes one of these teams a must-back on Friday night. See who it is over at SportsLine.Who wins the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, and which critical X-factor do you need to know about? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Barner's pick for the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, all from the expert who has crushed his NBA picks, and find out.\n2026 NBA Rising Star odds, rostersSee picks at SportsLine.Team Melo (+140)Stephon Castle (San Antonio Spurs)Donovan Clingan (Portland Trail Blazers)Reed Sheppard (Houston Rockets)Ace Bailey (Utah Jazz)Dylan Harper (San Antonio Spurs)Jeremiah Fears (New Orleans Pelicans)Collin Murray-Boyles (Toronto Raptors)Team T-Mac (+175)Kon Knueppel (Charlotte Hornets)Kel'el Ware (Miami Heat)Tre Johnson (Washington Wizards)Jaylon Tyson (Cleveland Cavaliers)Zaccharie Risacher (Atlanta Hawks)Cam Spencer (Memphis Grizzlies)Bub Carrington (Washington Wizards)Team Vince (+320)VJ Edgecombe (Philadelphia 76ers)Derik Queen (New Orleans Pelicans)Matas Buzelis (Chicago Bulls)Kyshawn George (Washington Wizards)Cedric Coward (Memphis Grizzlies)Egor Demin (Brooklyn Nets)Jaylen Wells (Memphis Grizzlies)\nTeam Austin (+900)Jahmir Young (Sioux Falls Skyforce)Yang Hansen (Rip City Remix)Sean East II (Salt Lake City Stars)Ron Harper Jr. (Maine Celtics)Yanic Konan Niederhauser (San Diego Clippers)Alijah Martin (Raptors 905)Tristen Newton (Rio Grande Valley Vipers)\n            ",

Former NBA players Jeremy Lin, Tacko Fall and Jason Williams will also play -- Lin and Fall are on the same team, which feels like it could be a significant advantage.Current NBA owners Mat Ishbia (Phoenix Suns) and Rick Schnall (Charlotte Hornets) will go head-to-head, with Ishbia, a former player at Michigan State, getting to relive the glory days. From the music world, GloRilla and Mustard will take the court alongside TV and movie stars Simu Liu and Keegan-Michael Key. \nWhere to watch NBA All-Star Celebrity GameTime: 7 p.m. ET | Date: Friday, Feb. 13TV channel: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)The full rosters for both teams in the 2026 All-Star Celebrity Game can be found below.Team AntetokounmpoCoaches: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo, Mookie Betts\nKeegan-Michael KeyRome FlynnDylan WangShams CharaniaJenna BandyRick SchnallTacko FallJeremy LinGloRillaCafuAmon-Ra St. BrownTeam AndersonCoaches: Anthony Anderson, Lethal Shooter, Chris BrickleySimu LiuCody JonesBadshahAndre De GrasseTaylor Frankie PaulMat IshbiaJason WilliamsNicolas VansteenbergheMustardAdrien NunezKeenan Allen\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am leaderboard is littered with the biggest names in golf, but after two rounds it's Akshay Bhatia who holds a share of the lead heading into the weekend. Bhatia has gone bogey-free around Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill over the first two days of play, following up a 65 at Pebble Beach on Thursday with an 8-under 64 at Spyglass Hill on Friday. Bhatia's iron play has led the way, as is often the case for those that succeed on the small greens at Pebble Beach. He's third in strokes gained on approach through the first two rounds. The young lefty's game has been sharp tee-to-green, and even when he's had the occasional miss, he's a perfect 6-for-6 getting up-and-down. That's the recipe for success at this event, and as the professionals lose their amateur partners for the weekend and get to focus solely on playing Pebble Beach, Bhatia will look to continue his incredible ball-striking performance. The light winds and soft greens on the California coast have created ideal scoring conditions, so even with a bogey-free performance so far, Bhatia has company at the top in the form of Ryo Hisatsune. The young Japanese star is continuing his stellar form early in the season, and while he did cool off a bit on Friday after his first-round 62 put him in another early lead, he was able to put together a solid 67 to remain in a share of the lead.\nLeading the charge from the chase group is Rickie Fowler, who matched Bhatia's 64 at Spyglass to get to 14 under heading into the weekend. Fowler is now in position to contend for his first victory since 2023, and is looking to continue a solid start to 2026. Fowler hasn't traditionally thrived at Pebble Beach, but he's been the best player in the field this week with his irons, gaining 4.8 strokes on approach so far. The 37-year-old highlighted that he feels better physically this year than he did in 2025 when he battled a shoulder injury, but was able to secure a top-50 position and a spot in all of the Signature Events this year. \"My shoulder was bad all last year so I was just trying to manage and get through as best that I could. I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top-50, so that was a nice bonus,\" Fowler said. \"So that was what I was trying to work towards to, like I said, earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.\" \nThat extended time off certainly seems to have paid off with a pair of top 20s to start the season and now a late tee time on the weekend at Pebble Beach. Fowler will need to keep up the strong iron play on Saturday and Sunday if he's going to contend for the win, but he's been lights out attacking soft greens thus far. The time to get the course was certainly the first two days, as the forecast calls for winds to pick up starting on Saturday afternoon and continue blowing 17-21 mph throughout Sunday's final round -- with some rain to add to the misery. For the leaders, that'll make it a challenge to hold up in rapidly changing conditions, but it will also make it harder for the chase pack to go low around them. The leadersT1. Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune (-15)Bhatia had a rocky start to 2026 with a pair of missed cuts, but he found something in Phoenix last week with a T3 and has carried that form into Pebble Beach. A two-time winner on the PGA Tour, we've seen that when Bhatia gets hot, he can go on a tear. Given the scoring to start the week at Pebble Beach, that'll be a must, as he's going to need to keep the pedal down to pick up the biggest win of his young career. \nHisatsune meanwhile has been on a tear for the last three weeks, and he continues to build confidence in his ability to contend with the best. After a T2 at Torrey Pines and a T10 at TPC Scottsdale, he keeps putting himself in position and learning how to handle the nerves on the weekend. The putter has been leading the way this week, and he seems extremely comfortable on poa greens that can give some players fits. We'll see if that holds up on the weekend, but a late tee time should feel like part of the routine after his last two weeks. The challenge for both Bhatia and Hisatsune will be holding off the best field of the young season with the weather expected to shift dramatically over the course of the weekend. Other contendersT3. Rickie Fowler, Sam Burns (-14)T5. Min Woo Lee, Sepp Straka, Jacob Bridgeman (-12)T8. Tom Hoge, Jake Knapp (-11)T10. Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Fitzpatrick, Keegan Bradley, Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and two others (-10)T17. Rory McIlroy, Chris Gotterup, Tommy Fleetwood and two others (-9)T34. Scottie Scheffler and 10 others (-6)\nBurns joined Fowler at 14 under, and in news that will come as a surprise to no one, it's a hot putter that has Burns in contention. Straka had a top 10 at Pebble last year and is in position to back that up again in 2026, joining Min Woo Lee in the top five. The group at T10 features some big names, but even in a sea of other major winners, Spieth is the player most are watching with interest this weekend. We haven't seen him anything close to his peak in some time, but any signs of life from the three-time major winner spark hope that he might be returning to top form. A bit further off the pace is Chris Gotterup, who finally cooled off a touch and is going to need a big Saturday effort if he's going to capture his third win of the young season. Defending champion Rory McIlroy is also at 9 under heading to the weekend, and will feel like he left a few shots out there on Friday that would've made him an even bigger threat to repeat. \nThen there's Scottie Scheffler, who is nine shots off the pace, but similar to last week in Phoenix, he bounced back from a rough Thursday to surge up the leaderboard with a Friday 66. He'll need to produce something magical to get in the mix late on Sunday, but after almost pulling off a huge come from behind victory a week ago, it's impossible to write him off. Updated 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds, picksAkshay Bhatia (+340)Rickie Fowler (11/2)Ryo Hisatsune (11/2)Sam Burns (6-1)Sepp Straka (14-1)Min Woo Lee (16-1)Jake Knapp (20-1)Rory McIlroy (22-1)Jacob Bridgeman (22-1)Xander Schauffele (25-1)If the winds pick up, this tournament could shift considerably, and it's going to be critical for players to get out to fast starts in their third round before it becomes a battle to hang on through difficult weather on Sunday. I tend to trust those leaning on ball-striking over putting when things get tough, which points me to Fowler and Straka of the guys just off the lead. I also don't hate sprinkling some of the pre-tournament favorites like McIlroy and Scheffler at longer odds, because there's certainly the potential for the top of the leaderboard to come back a bit in tougher conditions the elite players may handle a bit better. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- The opening night of the 2026 NBA All-Star weekend is in the books. Team Vince, coached by Vince Carter, defeated Team Melo, coached by Carmelo Anthony, in the NBA Rising Star Challenge title game behind a standout performance from VJ Edgecombe. The 76ers star guard was named MVP of the event.This marked the fifth consecutive year that the top rookies, sophomores and G League players were split into different teams during the four-team event. The first team to 40 points in the semifinals advanced to the title game, while the first to 25 points captured the championship. Edgecombe scored the game-winning free throw to give Team Vince bragging rights. Team Melo advanced to the title game after Dylan Harper, the No. 2 overall pick from the 2025 NBA Draft, knocked down a mid-range jumper over older brother, Ron Harper Jr.Edgecombe scored the most points of any player in the semifinals. He finished with 17 points and six rebounds during Team Vince's win over Team T-Mac, coached by Tracy McGrady. Egdecombe, the No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft, has been one of the biggest stars among all first-year players.\n\n        \n            \n                Everyone seems to be paying attention to NBA tanking -- yes, even the lottery picks themselves\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are the biggest winners and losers from the opening night of NBA All-Star weekend.Winner: Edgecombe steals the showEdgecombe might not be participating in tomorrow's dunk contest -- although he should be, and would have a good chance of winning the event. Edgecombe did ball out in the Rising Stars Challenge. The 76ers star scored 17 points in the semifinals and six in the title game. Edgecombe's play style as a high-flyer made him a perfect candidate to have a standout performance. It was appropriate that he got the final shot to send his team to the championship game.\nLoser: Fans miss out on watching FlaggLess than 24 hours before the Rising Stars Challenge, Flagg was ruled out due to a mid-foot sprain. Flagg, the No. 1 pick from the 2025 NBA Draft, has been putting up video game-like numbers as of late. He became the first teenager in NBA history to record back-to-back 30-point double-doubles last month. He also scored 49 points against the Hornets, which was the most by a teenager in NBA history. It shouldn't be long before fans get to watch play Flagg play on the final day of the event -- the actual All-Star Game. It wouldn't be surprising if that happens as soon as next season.\nWinner: Yang Hansen shines in opening gameOne of the biggest stars of the first semifinal game of the night was Yang Hansen. The No. 16 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft came off the bench and scored 10 points for Team Austin that was coached by Austin Rivers. Considering that Hansen is averaging just 7.5 minutes per game in his rookie season with Portland, this was the kind of performance that he could build upon in the remainder of the season.\nLoser: Ron Harper Jr. gives up game-winner to younger brother One of the top storylines of the first game of the evening between Team Melo and Team Austin was the battle between the Harper brothers. Ron Harper Jr., on the Maine Celtics, had to guard his kid brother, Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs, on what would be the final possession of the game. The younger brother will be earning bragging rights in his household, as Dylan knocked down a go-ahead jumper to send Team Melo to the title game.\nWinner: The format worksThe four-team Rising Stars format should stay a fixture of All-Star weekend. Sure, several parts of NBA All-Star need an overhaul, but all three games Friday night were competitive, fun and had star power. That's exactly what you need in an event like this. Edgecombe said it best when getting interviewed by an in-arena reporter. He said he wanted to win the event. Clearly, Edgecombe and others took pride in this game. It was refreshing to watch.\nLoser: Title game ends in not-so-dramatic fashionWhile the Rising Stars title game was full of entertainment, the ending was not so dramatic. On the final offensive possession, Edgecombe got fouled trying to score at the rim. Edgecombe proceeded to knock down both free throws to give his team a 25-24 win. You hate to see a game as competitive as that one end without someone scoring a field goal.\n            ",

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game.Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday. That matchup is yet to be determined as the teams get re-seeded after the quarterfinals.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's quarterfinal clash with Italy, as well as how they got here.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Zac Gallen is heading back to the desert. Gallen and the Arizona Diamondbacks are closing in on a one-year contract worth $22.025 million, according to a report from The Athletic. About $14 million would be deferred. The deal matches the $22.025 million qualifying offer Gallen rejected in November. The team has not yet announced the signing, which is pending a physical.Gallen, 30, is coming off a 2025 season in which he didn't live up to his established standards, hence settling for a one-year contract despite finishing in the top 10 of the National League Cy Young voting three times in his career.   \nFor his career, Gallen has pitched to a 119 ERA+ and an FIP of 3.65 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Over that span he's compiled a WAR of 20.7, and he's topped 30 starts and 180 innings in three of the last four seasons. Gallen spent the last six seasons and change with the D-backs, who acquired him from the Miami Marlins in July 2019 in exchange for Jazz Chisholm Jr.  Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Gallen as the No. 18 available free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up:  \n\"Gallen salvaged what he could with a good 11-start closing stretch, but an otherwise miserable walk year makes him feel like a strong candidate to accept the qualifying offer (if one is tendered) and try again in 2026. Otherwise? He's a candidate to sign a one-year deal elsewhere and modify his arsenal in an attempt to push back against a trend that has seen his performance slip in each of the past two years.\" \t \tBefore Gallen's return, FanGraphs estimated Arizona's 2026 payroll at $173 million. That is just south of the franchise record ($177 million in 2024), so Gallen will push the club well into uncharted payroll territory. The D-backs will neither gain nor forfeit draft picks to re-sign their own qualified free agent.  Arizona brought Merrill Kelly back earlier this offseason, and now they've reunited with Gallen. Those two will join lefty Eduardo Rodriguez and righties Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt in the rotation. Corbin Burnes, last offseason's big free-agent splash, is expected to return from Tommy John surgery at midseason.  The D-backs went 80-82 last season and missed the postseason by three games. They sold at the trade deadline, most notably sending Kelly to the Texas Rangers and Eugenio Suárez to the Seattle Mariners, though they kept Gallen. \nGallen was originally drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. He went to the Marlins with Sandy Alcantara as part of a December 2017 deal that sent Marcell Ozuna to St. Louis.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jordan Smith, the No. 2 overall player in the Class of 2026, committed to Arkansas at his 'Senior Night' at Fairfax (Virginia) Paul VI Catholic High School on Friday. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound combo guard picked the Razorbacks over finalists that included Duke, Indiana, Kentucky, Georgetown and Syracuse.Smith is the third commitment for Arkansas for the 2026 recruited class. He joins No. 12-ranked JJ Andrews, a five-star wing and No. 26-ranked Abdou Toure, a four-star wing.Arkansas' 2026 class is now No. 5 in the country, behind Duke, Michigan State, Kansas and Michigan according to 247Sports.\nSmith picked Arkansas because of his relationship with Razorbacks coach John Calipari and the opportunity to immediately contribute in a big way.\n\"I have just all the trust in coach (John) Calipari,\" Smith told 247Sports. \"His resume speaks for itself. And just what he has done with other guards in my situation who play like me and impact winning. I feel like he has done a really good job. I also feel like he is a genuine person. Character speaks a lot in today's world and he has the best character. I relate to him a lot.\"Smith has similarities to current Arkansas guard Acuff Calipari has a long-standing history of developing elite guards and getting them ready for the NBA Draft. Current freshman Arkansas point guard and former five-star prospect Darius Acuff is having one of the best seasons in all of college basketball.Smith certainly recognized how Calipari handles top guards and has a proven track record of success at the next level. Acuff's success this season in Fayetteville was a very easy comparison for Smith.\n\"Me and Acuff are the same size and the same height, so just to see how Acuff is playing and how Calipari has put him in different positions to help him succeed and to get to the next level - I really see inspiration in that,\" Smith said. \"I feel I can come in and make an impact right away, so with Calipari's help, I feel like I can do anything.\" When Smith took his visit to Arkansas in the fall, Calipari's message, history and the opportunity he presented to Smith made a lasting impression that changed the course of his recruitment.\"It felt like home when I got there, it just felt like home,\" Smith said. \"Of course, I had to take other visits just to see if it would feel the same and honestly, the other ones didn't feel the same as (Arkansas). The first feel I got from there - it was a real high intensity practice. It looked fun there... There are really no distractions there either, so I feel like I can really do what I need to do to get to the next level.\"\nWhere Smith will have biggest impact  There may not be a player in high school basketball who impacts winning in more ways or with the same consistency as Jordan Smith. The Paul VI and Team Takeover guard has terrific physical tools and even better competitive intangibles that allow him to change the game on both ends of the floor. He averaged 19.2 points, 7.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 2.1 steals per game during the recent EYBL season.Physically, Smith is long and powerful with a 6-foot-8.5-inch wingspan and chiseled physique. He's also a good athlete who excels defensively, has switchability on that end of the floor because of his physical strength and toughness, and is also an elite perimeter rebounder.Offensively, Smith gets downhill like few other guards in the class and has consistently developed his ball skills over the years so that he now has legitimate on/off-ball versatility. He can initiate offense and make decisions (3.4 assists vs. 1.5 turnovers), put pressure on the rim with his force and physicality when he turns the corner, or take smaller guards into the post. He's an improved shooter, with a notably high release, but still more consistent with his mid-range pull-up than his 3-point shooting with some occasional sidespin (25% on 3-pointers and 68% on free throws.\nSmith's transition to subsequent levels will also be lightened by the fact that he doesn't need to be an offensive focal point to impact the game. He can do it with his defense, rebounding, energy, competitiveness or unselfishness. His intangibles are truly elite, so while he may not have totally ideal size or ball skills, he's extremely hard to bet against.How Smith will fit at ArkansasAcuff is on a one-and-done track. He was the top-ranked point guard in high school basketball a year ago, looks like he could be the SEC Player of the Year this season and challenge for a spot in the lottery of June's NBA Draft. There was only one player in high school basketball who had a chance to replace him, and that's Smith.\nNow, that doesn't mean that Smith is exactly the same type of player as Acuff and that's why the roster construction around him will be important.Acuff is a true lead guard who operates with the ball in his hand and is the first domino in the vast majority of the offensive possessions he's on the court floor. Smith is capable of playing that role, but he can also slide off the ball. In fact, one thing that distinguishes Smith is the multitude of ways he can impact the game without having to have the ball in his hands. Even defensively, he should be one of the most college-ready freshmen in the country next season.With a wide open 2027 NBA Draft in mind, Smith and his representation are undoubtedly looking for plenty of on-ball volume. Simultaneously, though, Smith would be ideally suited next to other guards that can share those ball-handling responsibilities and provide some additional shot-making. \nIf DJ Wagner and Meleek Thomas were to return for the 2026-27 season, that would check both of those boxes. Wagner doesn't have much NBA buzz at this point, so a senior season should be probable. Thomas is likely to test the waters, but could find a return to college as a fringe first-rounder with a chance to help his stock as more of a focal point next season. If either of those depart, then Arkansas will need another impact guard out of the portal.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No one covers Arkansas like HawgSports, the market leader in Razorbacks athletics coverage.

    "body": "\nFor the first time since July 17, there will not be a NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL or college football game on Friday. That means all eyes should be on the game of the night: the No. 10 Michigan State Spartans taking on the Wisconsin Badgers at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc.The Spartans (20-4, 10-3 in Big Ten) are tied for third in the conference. They are coming off a much-needed 85-82 overtime win over No. 5 Illinois, which ended a two-game skid for Michigan State.The Badgers (17-7, 9-4) also are coming off an overtime victory over Illinois, a 92-90 decision in Champaign on Tuesday. Wisconsin is tied for sixth in the Big Ten. The Spartans are 2.5-point favorites over the Badgers.While Michigan State vs. Wisconsin is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule and the NBA's Rising Stars. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 13. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 10 Michigan State at WisconsinTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Wisconsin +2.5 | Expert: Over 145.5 -110 (Chip Patterson)\nFor whatever reason, the Badgers are getting no love nationally. Even though they have two road wins (Michigan and Illinois) better than any other team's, Greg Gard's men aren't even among the 10 teams also \"receiving votes\" in the AP Top 25 poll. The Badgers feature a very good back-court in Nick Boyd (20.2 points per game) and John Blackwell (18,7) that would be the envy of many teams. Led by those two, Wisconsin averages 121.7 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom, which ranks 28th in the country. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says the Badgers have a 59.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Wisconsin +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"If the Badgers are a step faster on offense and Jeremy Fears can cut through the Wisconsin defense like Keaton Wagler did, there's a real bucket-for-bucket game script that could take us Over this total,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchRising StarsTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Expert: Team Melo +230 (Mike Barner)The NBA will showcase its best young talent on Friday when the Rising Stars competition takes place at the Intuit Dome. The mini-tournament will feature three teams of the league's rookies and sophomores and one team comprised by G-Leaguers. In the first semifinal, Team Austin will face Team Melo. Team Vince will take on Team T-Mac in the second semifinal, with the two winning teams squaring off in the final. Star rookie Cooper Flagg, who was originally set to play for Team Melo, will miss the game because of an ankle sprain, but Barner still likes the team to win the competition. \"(Ace) Bailey replaces Flagg, and he has been playing well heading into the break, averaging 15.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.6 three-pointers over his last 17 games,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa StateTime: 1 p.m. Saturday | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa State -6.5\nWill he play or won't he? That the question surrounding Kansas Jayhawks star and potential No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson every game now since he has been in and out of the lineup for much of the season, sometimes mysteriously, with various ailments (cramps, hamstring and flu, among other things). When he has played, he has been great (20.5 points per game in 13 starts). And when he hasn't played, the Jayhawks (19-5, 9-2 in Big 12) still have been very good, knocking off No. 1 Arizona on Monday. But on Saturday, Kansas goes on the road to face the fifth-ranked Iowa State Cyclones (21-3, 8-3), who rank sixth in the country in defensive efficiency (92.0 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Cyclones have a 60.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Iowa State -6.5.No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 FloridaTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kentucky +11.5\nThe lead in the SEC will be on the line when the Florida Gators and Kentucky Wildcats collide on Saturday at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (18-6, 9-2 in SEC) lead the conference by one game over the Wildcats (17-7, 8-3) and Arkansas Razorbacks (18-6, 8-3). Florida has emerged once again as the best team in the SEC. Over their last four games, the Gators have outscored opponents by an average score of 92-65. But on Saturday, they face a Kentucky team that is on its own roll, having won eight of its last nine. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance the Wildcats cover this large spread and assigns a C grade to Kentucky +11.5.No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 ArizonaTime: 6:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas Tech +9.5\nThe top-ranked Arizona Wildcats will look to bounce back from their first loss of the season when they host the Texas Tech Red Raiders on Saturday at the McKale Center. On Monday the Wildcats (23-1, 10-1 in Big 12) failed to execute in the second half and lost at Kansas. Meanwhile the Red Raiders (18-6, 8-3) are coming off a 34-point victory against Colorado, which prompted Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle to rip into his team. While the Wildcats figure to have the advantage on the glass, Texas Tech leads the conference and ranks seventh in the nation in 3-point makes per game (11.5), while Arizona ranks 336th (5.9) in that category. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 56.0% chance the Red Raiders cover and gives a C grade to Texas Tech +9.5.\n            ",

Among the allegations made by federal prosecutors is that Clase partook in an illegal gambling scheme during a 2024 playoff game.Clase and teammate Luis Ortiz have been on the restricted list for the Guardians since last July while under investigation. Ortiz has since asked for his case to be severed from Clase and has claimed that he was an unknowing victim in the scheme that was being headed up by Clase. Clase is alleged to have thrown balls on purpose (ball/strike prop bets were available at some sportsbooks) in a list of 15 different examples, ranging from 2023-25. One that stands out in the indictment is a pitch from the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 2024 ALDS against the Tigers. The Guardians won that game 7-0 and Clase retired all three batters he faced in the ninth inning, but the first pitch Clase threw was a ball to Tigers hitter Matt Vierling that bounced in front of the plate.Further, the allegations note that there were at least three other times when Clase intended to throw a ball on purpose but didn't get into the game. \nVia The Athletic: Robinson Vasquez Germosen was charged with five federal counts by prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York. They allege that he worked with Clase and, later, Ortiz to rig pitches during Guardians games so that they and others could win money betting on them. He is also accused of lying to federal agents during an interview as part of the investigation. Vasquez was arrested in December and released on $100,000 bond.The allegations note that Clase and Vazquez would use coded language to communicate on the pitch-fixing. Such as: \"Throw a rock at the first rooster in today's fight,\" from Vasquez and \"Yes, of course, that's an easy toss to that rooster,\" from Clase (The Athletic). \nClase's trial is set for May 4. Expect him to remain on the restricted list until the conclusion of the trial. A lifetime ban from baseball is a potential outcome if he's found guilty. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- For better or worse, tanking and the draft lottery are hot topics in the NBA as we enter All-Star Weekend. Less than 24 hours before the NBA Rising Stars Challenge, the Utah Jazz and the Indiana Pacers were fined by the NBA on Thursday night.The Jazz were hit with a $500,000 fine, while Indiana was fined $100,000 related to the management of their respective rosters in recent games. If you thought the tank last year for Cooper Flagg was worth monitoring, this year will be an even bigger story because of the blue-chip talent at the top. Duke's Cameron Boozer, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Kansas' Darryn Peterson project as the top three picks in this summer's draft, and each of them can represent a foundational building block for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Mock Draft: Where college stars like Cameron Boozer, Caleb Wilson figure to go\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, this year's NBA rookie class, headlined by names like Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, VJ Edgecombe and Kon Knueppel, makes it one of the strongest classes in years. The term \"Capture the Flagg\" took over social media in the months leading up to the lottery, which was won by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas entered the draft lottery with just a 1.8% chance of landing the top pick.With the draft lottery and the race to the bottom of the standings being such a hot topic among NBA fans, some players admitted to keeping tabs on what was happening toward the bottom of the NBA standings before they were drafted. Others, when asked, said they blocked it out.\n\"I ain't going to lie, I did,\" Edgecombe said when asked if he followed the NBA standings. \"Early in the season, I wasn't really hooping. They had me in the honorable mention for Freshman of the Year and stuff like that. ... I did, not going to lie. I was looking.\"Coming out of Baylor, Edgecombe was a projected top-five pick, but it was unclear exactly where he would land on draft night. After the 76ers moved into the top three and passed on the chance to select Ace Bailey, who reportedly canceled his pre-draft workout with the 76ers, Philadelphia landed on Edgecombe.That's part of the reason why this topic has extended to the All-Star Game. A team like Jazz dropped all the way to pick No. 5 last year after finishing with the worst record in the league. Utah selected Bailey at No. 5. Utah owes its 2026 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it finishes outside of the top eight in this year's lottery.\n\"My head was just down, focusing on the main thing, being in the NBA,\" Bailey said on whether he paid attention to the standings. \"That was my main goal. Had my circle around me blocking out the outside noise.\"A player like Brooklyn's Egor Dёmin, who had a wide range of where he might get picked in the months leading up to the draft, also paid attention to what was going on in the NBA before he entered.\"I was really trying to stay present,\" Dёmin said. \"As big as the NBA is, standings and other stuff, it's just popping out. Even if you're trying not to see it, you're going to still see (the standings).\"\nSince the draft odds were flattened in 2019, the team that finished the season with the worst record in the association has never landed the No. 1 pick. In 2024, the Hawks had just a 3% chance of landing No. 1. That draft was more of a mystery than last year and 2026. There wasn't a clear-cut top prospect that teams were necessarily tanking for, which led to drama on draft night.The biggest college star leading up to the 2024 NBA Draft was Reed Sheppard, who was selected by the Houston Rockets at No. 3. Houston held the Brooklyn Nets pick and moved up from having the ninth-best odds at No. 1 to inside the top three on lottery night. The NBA standings and the tank race that year were \"hard to not ignore\" for Sheppard.\n\"It's definitely hard to not ignore,\" Sheppard said. \"I was trying to focus on the season and not trying to get caught up in everything. Social media, you're going to see things. Your friends, they're going to send you stuff.\"With this year's race to the bottom of the NBA standings being one of the most competitive and interesting in quite some time, it's safe to say some of the best (future) draft picks of tomorrow will be following along, too.\n            ",

He claimed the NFL is \"rife with racism,\" specifically in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.\"The court's decision recognizes that an arbitration forum in which the defendant's own chief executive gets to decide the case would strip employees of their rights under the law,\" said attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and David E. Gottlieb in a statement. \"It is long overdue for the NFL to recognize this and finally provide a fair, neutral and transparent forum for these issues to be addressed.\"  \nAs a result of the ruling, the case will now move to trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Friday, April 3 in New York. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Newly minted FBS school North Dakota State found itself in a position similar to Alabama fans during the heyday of Nick Saban's dynasty: It simply won too much. The school has captured 10 national championships in 15 years. Within the fan base, the expectation is not just success, but success at the highest level.Attendance for early-round home playoff games that NDSU is expected to win handily has suffered. This year's loss to Illinois State drew an official attendance of 10,464 to the 19,000-seat Fargodome, roughly half full. Despite five interceptions from Redbirds quarterback Tommy Rittenhouse, the No. 1 Bison lost. It marked the first time NDSU had fallen before the quarterfinal round since 2009 and the first time a No. 1 seed lost its playoff opener since 2004.Few knew it at the time, but it was NDSU's final game at the FCS level. A process that began ramping up in late fall accelerated in January, when athletic director Matt Larsen began to believe the program was moving up from the division it had dominated since 2004. For a segment of the Bison fan base, the move to FBS will provide a new challenge.\"I do think there's an element of our fan base of what's next we've had great success, is there a next iteration at a higher level for Bison football?\" NDSU AD Matt Larsen told CBS Sports. \"And so I think that's where, if you would ask me, six or seven years ago, where the fan base was, they probably weren't there yet, right? But four national championships later, and I think the majority of Bison nation would tell you that this is the right next step, and it's the right time to do it.\"\nTo compete in the FBS, North Dakota State has to be up to par not only on the field, but also financially. NDSU will pay $5 million to the NCAA to transition and a $12.5 million entry fee to the Mountain West over six years.Consider the Fargodome. the longtime home to the Bison is owned by the city of Fargo and requires voter approval for renovations. A referendum has failed twice in recent years. Larsen said the Fargodome has a reserve fund earmarked for renovations, but the 32-year-old building needs updates, particularly for more premium seating. A pending convention center project -- which may or may not be located at the Fargodome site -- also factors into the decision-making.North Dakota State opened a 117,000-square-foot, $54 million football facility in 2022. Its total athletic department budget is about $30 million annually, and Sportico reported the school spent $8.4 million on football in the last fiscal year. Larsen expects that figure to double within two years, accounting for staffing, scholarships, revenue sharing and coaching compensation.\nThe school's primary athletics fundraising arm said it has \"tentatively raised\" $25 million for the move. NDSU does not expect to add sports to offset the increase in football scholarships from 65 to 85 upon moving to FBS.The school will receive a full share of Mountain West television revenue by 2032, but as CBS Sports previously reported, it will collect 50% of College Football Playoff and bowl revenue distributed to full members this year and 100% after its second postseason appearance. The school plans to challenge the NCAA's two-year probationary period that bars it from postseason play.As with many realignment cases, the loss of tradition is part of the cost. South Dakota State and North Dakota State have met 118 times and have played for the Dakota Marker trophy since 2004. The rivalry has often determined FCS supremacy, with one or both teams ranked in the top five when they meet. After the 2022 season, they faced each other in the national championship game.\n\"I would say for the foreseeable future, it's probably on hold,\" Larsen said. \"I think our rivalry was one out of really great respect between programs that did it the right way. And so I think there's so many positives to this move, I think the one thing you could say that our fans are going to miss it's playing for the Dakota Marker, because there were some epic games over the course of the last 10-15, years that have created great memories and great opportunities for our fans.\"As one FCS administrator cautioned to CBS Sports, there is a \"careful what you wish for\" element to moving up -- trading double-digit win seasons and championship runs for years that could end in a lower-tier bowl game in a far-flung locale that is difficult to reach. The novelty can be appealing at first, but it fades without winning.Still, there is reason for optimism about the Bison's ability to compete quickly. Programs with less FCS pedigree have made successful transitions in recent years.\nThe newest FCS-to-FBS members, Delaware and Missouri State, both finished 7-5 and reached bowl games in their debut seasons. After struggling in its 2024 debut, Kennesaw State went 10-2 under new coach Jerry Mack and won a conference championship over Jacksonville State, which moved up in 2023 and has won at least eight games in each of its first three FBS seasons under two different coaches. Sam Houston also moved up in 2023 and, in its second year, narrowly missed a Conference USA title while winning 10 games. James Madison transitioned in 2022 under Curt Cignetti and has won at least eight games every year since. The 2025 season under Bob Chesney culminated in a College Football Playoff berth.The relative ease of those transitions raises questions about the gap between the top half of the FCS and the Group of Five conferences.In many respects, North Dakota State accomplished all it could at the FCS level. Now, the FBS journey begins.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Michigan faces UCLA Saturday on CBS in a clash of Big Ten foes. This will be the 13th matchup between Michigan and UCLA since the turn of the century, with both programs having six wins against each other during that stretch.  The Wolverines (23-1) are off to their best 24-game start in school history, but are coming off an upset scare against Northwestern. Michigan trailed by as many as 16 points on the road before storming back in the second half to seal an 87-75 win over the Wildcats. Michigan's lone loss came against Wisconsin last month at home.  UCLA has won five of its last six games after starting 4-3 in Big Ten play. The Bruins are coming off a 77-73 win over Washington after guard Trent Perry dropped 23 points. UCLA heads into the weekend 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings.   The Wolverines hold a 2.0-game lead over Illinois for first place.    Michigan vs. UCLA: Need to know  Michigan could make race for No. 1 interesting: Michigan is the projected No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections. The Wolverines jumped to No. 1 overall after Arizona lost to Kansas earlier this week. With Arizona dropping its first game of the season, the AP Top 25 poll on Monday should be interesting. Arizona has been the consensus top-ranked team for several weeks. It wouldn't be surprising to see Michigan get some consideration for No. 1.  \nCan UCLA get Donovan Dent going? The key to a potential upset for UCLA will be Dent. The former New Mexico star has had an up-and-down season with the Bruins after transferring in last offseason. Dent is having one of his best stretches at UCLA after recording at least 10 assists in three consecutive games. He played all 40 minutes against Washington and finished with 17 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.  Aday Mara faces his old team: A storyline to monitor will be Mara, who played the first two seasons of his career at UCLA, facing his old team. Mara played limited minutes under coach Mick Cronin at UCLA but has found a consistent role with the Wolverines. Michigan coach Dusty May has routinely deployed two-big lineups in his rotation. With Mara assuming a more prominent role, he has become one of the nation's best defensive players.    Where to watch Michigan vs. UCLA live  Date: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 12:45 p.m. ET  Location: Crisler Center -- Ann Arbor, Michigan   \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Michigan vs. UCLA prediction, pick  \nFor the first 30 minutes of game time against Northwestern, Michigan looked vulnerable. Then, the Wolverines flipped the switch and looked like the team ranked No. 2 in the country. This game will be a tougher challenge for Michigan than its last matchup against Northwestern. Still, I expect Mara to have a big game against his old team and star forward Yaxel Lendeborg to have a bounce-back performance on offense after scoring just 35 points total in his last three games. Pick: Michigan -15.5\n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -15.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 coaching carousel formally opened in March when Troy Taylor was fired from Stanford and went on to be one of the longest in recent memory. In total, 33 jobs changed hands via retirement, firing or coaches leaving for other positions. There wasn't a Bill Belichick-level surprise, but this cycle did see major blueblood jobs change hands in a way that didn't happen in 2024. Below are grades for a wild cycle that appears to be over -- though, as always, you never know when a surprise might happen.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Michigan -- Kyle WhittinghamPrevious school: UtahIt wasn't exactly a stunner that Kyle Whittingham stepped down at Utah -- he had been on retirement watch annually as he got older -- but it was surprising that he ended up back in the game at Michigan. His identity should play well with the Wolverines, and the offense run by Jason Beck is tailor-made for Bryce Underwood. Grade: A\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Missouri State -- Casey WoodsPrevious school: SMU (offensive coordinator)Woods was targeted for several open jobs this cycle, and now he takes over a Missouri State program that made a bowl game in its first year in FBS. The transition can be difficult, but handing it off is even tougher -- especially when someone hasn't been a head coach before. Grade: C\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington State -- Kirby MoorePrevious school: Missouri (offensive coordinator)A regional fit makes sense for Washington State, but few jobs have shifted in scope and stature more than the Cougars in recent years as the Pac-12 moves toward a proto–Mountain West structure. The job is midtier in the revamped league and a tough ask for a first-timer. Grade: C\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Coastal Carolina -- Ryan BeardPrevious school: Missouri StateCoastal Carolina is struggling with its identity as a program after the Jamey Chadwell era. Tim Beck had success in his first season before taking a step back. Beard knows how to do more with less after his run at Missouri State. Grade: B\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Southern Miss -- Blake AndersonPrevious school: Southern Miss (offensive coordinator)Anderson knows Hattiesburg, and this is his second stint. What must be considered, however, is not his on-field prowess but the off-field scandal that led to his firing for cause from Utah State. Anderson was let go in Logan right before the 2024 season after an internal investigation found he violated Title IX policy. Following the arrest of a player for alleged domestic violence, Anderson did not immediately report the incident to the school and contacted the alleged victim and her roommate. He has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the school. Grade: F\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Toledo -- Mike JacobsPrevious school: Mercer (FCS)Group of Six teams must think outside the box, and hiring one of the hottest FCS coaches is the type of move MAC schools should pursue. Jacobs' Mercer teams won consecutive conference championships and he's a solid bet to keep the Rockets rolling in Jason Candle's absence. Grade: B+\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tulane -- Will HallPrevious school: Tulane (offensive assistant)Tulane boasts one of the  the Group of Six's best jobs. So after consecutive coaches left for greener pastures, it's understandable the Green Wave opted for a safe hire familiar with the region and school -- this is Hall's second stint in New Orleans. However, his first turn as a head coach did not go well at Southern Miss. Tulane is banking that with more resources he can succeed, but that remains to be seen. Grade: C\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UConn -- Jason CandlePrevious school: ToledoCandle was a perennial candidate to leave Toledo -- nearly doing so for the Miami offensive coordinator job a few years ago -- so it's something of a coup that UConn was able to land him after its best stretch of football in more than a decade under Jim Mora. Candle will bring offensive prowess, but the Huskies must rebuild with this year's offensive stars gone. Grade: B\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Memphis -- Charles HuffPrevious school: Southern MissHuff took Marshall to 10 wins and quickly dug Southern Miss out of a hole, but Memphis is a different test. It sits at or near the top of the American in resources and should challenge annually for the Playoff via the Group of 6 spot. Expectations are high, but Huff has shown the ability to do more with less. Grade: B+\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Penn State -- Matt CampbellPrevious school: Iowa StateIt seemed Campbell might have been stuck in Ames. Forays with the NFL and Florida State went nowhere. After a circuitous process, he ends up at Penn State, a place that seems amenable to his no-frills style and developmental success. The question is whether he'll run into the same glass ceiling James Franklin did, potentially with less NFL-ready talent. Grade: B\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cal -- Tosh LupoiPrevious school: Oregon (defensive coordinator)Lupoi knows the program, which helps given Cal's fiscal limitations. He also has renowned recruiting prowess on the West Coast -- two major boxes checked for the Golden Bears. The other: holding onto quarterback Jaron-Keave Sagapolutele. Grade: B+ \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    James Madison: Billy NapierPrevious school: Florida Can a tiger change his stripes? That will be the question for Napier at JMU, particularly regarding how much of the reins he'll cede to offensive coordinator Cam Aiken. The Dukes have succeeded with two head coaches in their FBS era. If they can sustain it with a third, this becomes the destination job in the Group of Six. Grade: B-\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UAB: Alex MortensenPrevious school: UAB (offensive coordinator)Hiring the interim coach carries significant risk, and this move raised eyebrows across the industry, with many doubtful about the administration in Birmingham. Mortensen is young and takes over for Trent Dilfer, who never gained traction. Grade: D\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    South Florida -- Brian HartlinePrevious school: Ohio State (offensive coordinator)We know Hartline can recruit, but can he lead a program? Now that he's away from the Ohio State apparatus, we'll find out. He remains close to the region he's recruited best -- South Florida -- and with an upwardly mobile USF program, the resources should be there to replace the pieces that left with Alex Golesh. Grade: C\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    North Texas -- Neal BrownPrevious school: Texas (assistant to the head coach)Brown had success at Troy but struggled at West Virginia to elevate the Mountaineers. UNT caught lightning in a bottle with Eric Morris and quarterback Drew Mestamaker. Can Brown find his version? Grade: C\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kentucky -- Will SteinPrevious school: Oregon (offensive coordinator)A bright young coaching mind with Kentucky ties, Stein is an intriguing hire in the post–Mark Stoops era. Stoops' consistency defined the Wildcats for so long. Now there's carte blanche for Stein to put his stamp on the program. Grade: B\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Michigan State -- Pat FitzgeraldPrevious school: Northwestern (2006-22)Fitzgerald made waves at Northwestern by leading the Wildcats to two first-place finishes in the Big Ten West, but struggled during the final two years of his tenure with a 4-20 combined record. It remains unclear whether Fitzgerald's late-era swoon in Evanston was due to limited resources or if the game passed him by. For years, Fitzgerald maximized rosters with talent deficiencies. With more investment promised, the answer should come quickly. Grade: B-\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLA -- Bob ChesneyPrevious school: James MadisonIn the race to find the next Curt Cignetti, the Bruins made a compelling move by hiring Chesney away from James Madison. He followed Cignetti and reloaded the program, guiding the Dukes to the College Football Playoff. UCLA lacks the resources of crosstown rival USC, but Chesney has a proven developmental track record the Bruins need. Grade: A\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ole Miss -- Pete GoldingPrevious school: Ole Miss (defensive coordinator)By default, it had to be Golding, and early returns suggest he's the right man for the job. There's no telling what this will look like after transfer movement and staff changes, but it's officially Golding's program. Grade: B\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    LSU -- Lane KiffinPrevious school: Ole Miss You'd be forgiven for forgetting Kiffin was hired to coach football amid the drama and social media circus surrounding the search. Given his track record with employers, this marriage may not end well. But considering his success on the field and in the transfer portal, combined with LSU's resources, it's hard to doubt it will work -- until it doesn't. Grade: B+\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Florida -- Jon SumrallPrevious school: TulaneFlorida may have hoped for a different outcome, but Sumrall knows the SEC, and his initial staff appears geared to challenge the conference's standard-bearer and chief rival, Georgia. Grade: B+\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Auburn -- Alex GoleshPrevious school: South Florida Armed with quarterback Byrum Brown, Golesh arrives with expectations of an exciting offense on the Plains. Pairing with incumbent defensive coordinator DJ Durkin should help the first-time SEC head coach adjust to the step up. Grade: B\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arkansas -- Ryan SilverfieldPrevious school: MemphisSilverfield arrives as Arkansas tries to define its place in the SEC. With baseball and men's basketball siphoning resources, can the Razorbacks compete? At Memphis, Silverfield clearly held a financial advantage. That certainty no longer exists. Grade: B\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Stanford: Tavita PritchardPrevious job: Washington Commanders (quarterbacks coach)How much autonomy Pritchard will have in a football program that clearly belongs to Andrew Luck remains to be seen. He's an intriguing young coach, but Stanford represents one of the most aggressive versions of the sport's evolving model, where the head coach isn't always the central authority. Grade: C\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oregon State -- JaMarcus ShephardPrevious school: Alabama (co-offensive coordinator)Oregon State needed someone familiar with the region during its athletic reset. Shephard brings passion, which is half the battle given OSU's current position. On the field, a primary focus must be fixing a struggling special teams unit. Grade: B\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Colorado State -- Jim MoraPrevious school: UConnMora was once viewed as a fish out of water in the college game, but the former UConn coach found success in East Hartford. Now he takes over a Rams program long considered an emerging force out West. It's up to Mora to unlock that dormant potential. Grade: B\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oklahoma State -- Eric MorrisPrevious school: North TexasThe Cowboys arguably had the weakest roster in the Power Four last year, but Morris brings quarterback Drew Mestamaker and others with him. Improvement should be immediate, and promised resources to build around him add optimism. Grade: A\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia Tech -- James FranklinPrevious school: Penn StateThe Hokies sought modernization and hired a coach capable of dragging them into the sport's current era. Franklin's personality should resonate in Blacksburg, and with Brent Pry back as defensive coordinator, he'll have support navigating Virginia Tech's internal landscape in the new ACC. Grade: A\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kent State -- Mark CarneyPrevious school: Kent State (offensive coordinator)By default, promoting Carney from interim is a success. Few programs have struggled historically as much as Kent State, and five wins in 2025 exceeded the combined total from 2023-24. Grade: B\n            ",

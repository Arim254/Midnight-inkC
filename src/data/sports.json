    "body": "\n        Four games over the course of Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday will limit the NFL DFS main slate on FanDuel and DraftKings, but there are still plenty of big names to consider on Sunday. Justin Herbert, Bijan Robinson, Justin Jefferson and George Kittle are some of the potentially high-scoring options for NFL DFS lineups. Points, however, could still be at a bit of a premium with week with weather potentially impacting a few games and six games with an over/under of 41.5 and no game with a total higher than 45.5 scheduled for Sunday afternoon.How should all that factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, where they can pick at Underdog and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager:The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Sunday's 2025 NFL Week 13 schedule and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.New users can get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5.Top NFL Week 13 DFS picks for SundayOne of the optimizer's top DFS value picks for Sunday is Dolphins running back De'Von Achane ($8,700 on FanDuel, $8,300 on DraftKings), who takes on the New Orleans Saints. He's been one of the hottest players in the league recently, pilling up a whopping 390 scrimmage yards over the past two weeks. His 21 carries in Week 12 and 22 carries 11 were his two highest totals of the season, and he has remained a frequent target in the passing game as well. The Saints have given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this season, making Achane a high-value play on Sunday. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Texans receiver Nico Collins at $6,700 on DraftKings and $8,100 on FanDuel. He had a quieter 3-55 receiving line last week on just three targets. That appears to be an anomaly, however, since he was targeted a total of 36 times over the prior three games and put up a 23-303-1 combined receiving line during that span. DFS players can confidently add him on Sunday against a Colts secondary that ranks 23rd in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 13 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Sunday, and which under-the-radar NFL DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule has already seen four upsets over the course of Thanksgiving and Black Friday. There's plenty more to come over the weekend, however. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 6.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time. Jaxson Dart (concussion) is slated to return for the Giants.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-3.5) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Top Week 13 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 13 NFL picks is that the Falcons (-3, 38.5) cover at the New York Jets in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        Some quality Week 13 NFL betting advice would be to consider anything and everything before placing Week 13 NFL predictions. How teams perform versus the spread on a short week is pertinent for this week's slate, as are how teams perform in adverse conditions or with lengthy travel, which are also relevant with this week's NFL schedule. A dome team in Atlanta has to travel to NYC to face the Jets, as the former may have to deal with the elements. Meanwhile, the Rams, who are one of the biggest favorites per the Week 13 NFL odds at -10.5, will have to travel cross country to Carolina for a 1 p.m. ET Sunday kickoff.Those are things outside of the NFL spread records one should consider before laying down any wagers. Along with the Rams, other big favorites include the Seahawks (-11.5) versus the Vikings and the Chargers (-9.5) against the Raiders. The heavily favored teams feature the likes of Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, Sam Darnold and Justin Herbert who could factor into NFL player props, plugged into Fantasy football lineups or be a part of your NFL DFS strategy.

Larry Hartstein, who is 24-18-1 (+386) over his last 43 NFL ATS picks, is backing Indianapolis (-3.5) to cover at home versus Houston on Sunday.\"The Colts haven't played at home since Oct. 26, when they destroyed Tennessee 38-14. They're a different offense inside, on an artificial surface. This is the one of the only 3.5s left in the market, as money is pouring in on the Colts. Houston's elite defense isn't quite as tough on the road. Lay the points.\" Hartstein's NFL best bets for Week 13 can be found here.Broncos vs. Commanders 'Sunday Night Football' picksThe 9-2 Denver Broncos are chasing the top overall seed in the AFC, and they'll go on the road to face the struggling Washington Commanders (3-8) on Sunday night. The Broncos have won eight straight since opening the season 1-2. Six of their past seven wins, however, have been by four or fewer points. The Broncos are 4-3 against the spread in that span, so while they are winning, they haven't been covering with room to spare. Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) has been ruled out. Mike Tierney is on a 15-9 run on picks involving Washington, and he's backing the Broncos (-5.5) to get the cover.\"Siding with a sizable favorite that wins narrowly will be nerve-wracking. Of the Broncos' eight consecuive SU wins, here are the margins in six of them: one, two, three, three, three, four,\" Tierney said. \"On the other hand, the Commodores have failed to cover once during their current six-game SU slide. While both teams have regained a modicum of health, Washington QB Jayden Daniels remains idled, while Denver All-Pro CB Patrick Surtain II is expected to return after three games out. With the league's 14-ranked offense, the Broncos should be able to find sufficient points against the No. 31 defense for a cover.\" Get more 'Sunday Night Football' picks right here. Patriots vs. Giants 'Monday Night Football' picksThese teams sit on the opposite end of the standings in their respective divisions with the Patriots atop the AFC East, while the Giants are at the bottom of the NFC East. New York, however, has covered in three straight, are welcoming back Jaxson Dart from a concussion, and the Patriots are coming off a closer call against the Bengals where they failed to cover as 7.5-point favorites. No. 1 NFL expert R.J. White is on a 127-102 run on NFL picks, returning more than 20 units, and he's taking the Giants and the points in this one. \"The Patriots are on a nine-game winning streak, but the cracks may be starting to show,\" he told SportsLine. \"Drake Maye had accuracy issues in what should've been the easiest matchup he may ever see against a historically bad Bengals defense. The offense's issues from last year may return with the injuries up front, particularly to left tackle Will Campbell, and this is not an ideal matchup for a significant downgrade in protection on the edge. The Giants went blow for blow with the Lions, and I can't see a repeat of their late defensive meltdown with the Patriots' downgraded O-line. While my ratings think this should be 7, I expect it'll end up being another close game for both teams. Get more 'Monday Night Football' picks right here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ten more games are set for the Week 13 NFL DFS 'main slate' on Sunday, consisting of all the games that kick in the afternoon windows. The highest total on the board is Bills vs. Steelers at 45.5, making players like Josh Allen, James Cook and DK Metcalf potential targets for NFL lineups. Aaron Rogers (wrist) is also in the NFL DFS player pool after missing last week's game. With injuries impacting many rosters and the weather turning colder, however, offense could be tougher to find as the regular season winds down.Which players should you target for your NFL DFS picks, and who are the daily Fantasy football sleepers that can differentiate your roster in tournaments on daily Fantasy sites like FanDuel or DraftKings? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 13 Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Sunday NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 13One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks is Seattle running back Kenneth Walker III at $5,300 on DraftKings and $6,900 on FanDuel. Walker was limited in practice earlier in the week, but got back to full participation and does not carry an injury designation. He's provided a high floor for DFS players this season, taking at least 10 carries in every game. He's cleared 65 rushing yards in all but four games this season as well. As a bonus, he's been more active in the passing game the past two weeks, combining for six catches and 74 yards in that span. He has a great matchup against the Vikings, a team with a poor run defense. Seattle's status as an 11.5-point favorite could play in his favor as well in terms of game flow. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II at $4,300 on DraftKings and $5,900 on FanDuel. The rookie out of Syracuse has been a breakout star this year with a 37-507-2 receiving line that few saw coming. Big plays are his speciality as he ranks third among tight ends in average yards per catch at 13.7. McClure has him rated as one of his top tight ends this week against the Raiders, but Gadsden is just the fifth-most expensive tight end on both FanDuel and DraftKings, making him a steal in Week 13.

    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users receive $200 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass to bet on the Week 13 NFL schedule, which is filled with top matchups with postseason implications. The Denver Broncos will host the Washington Commanders on Sunday Night Football, with Denver looking to remain in the forefront of the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, as one of two teams in the conference entering this week with only two losses. Coming off a bye, one of SportsLine's top experts is backing the Broncos to cover as 6.5-point favorites as a part of Sunday's best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The SportsLine Projection Model is backing Over 40.5 total points in Raiders vs. Chargers at 4:25 p.m. ET, while another of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on 49ers vs. Browns. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

White said. \"That's crashed the total to the point where the home team shouldn't be getting more than 4 points. Yes, the 49ers have a superstar at running back, but Brock Purdy looked like a problem throwing the ball in good conditions Monday, and he'll be up against a tougher defense here and prone to making more mistakes. That could neutralize the mistakes the Browns will likely get from Shedeur Sanders, and this feels like a game that ends in the 16-13 range.\" Back the Browns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Chargers vs. Raiders: Over 40.5 pointsThe Raiders have the No. 31 scoring offense in the NFL at 15 points per game this season, but the Chargers are coming off allowing 35 points in Week 11 before their bye last week. Although the Raiders only scored 10 points last week, Geno Smith had one of his better games of the season, completing 68.2% of his passes for 285 yards. The Raiders fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly after the loss, so that change could also provide a spark in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the Chargers had scored at least 24 points in five straight games before their 35-6 loss before the bye. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (-6.5) vs. CommandersSiding with a sizable favorite that wins narrowly will be nerve-wracking,\" SportsLine expert Mike Tierney said. Of the Broncos' eight consecutive straight-up wins, here are the margins in six of them: one, two, three, three, three, four. On the other hand, the Commanders have failed to cover once during their current six-game straight-up slide. While both teams have regained a modicum of health, Washington QB Jayden Daniels remains idled, while Denver All-Pro CB Patrick Surtain II is expected to return after three games out. With the league's 14-ranked offense, the Broncos should be able to find sufficient points against the No. 31 defense for a cover.\" Back Denver at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Sunday NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

Silverfield replaces Sam Pittman, who was fired after a 32-34 record in six seasons with the program. Silverfield was promoted to head coach at Memphis in 2020 after working as offensive line coach and associate head coach under Mike Norvell. In six full seasons, Silverfield posted a 50-24 record, including an AP Top 25 finish in 2024. The former offensive line coach led the Tigers to 21 wins in a two-year period but finished his tenure with a disappointing 8-4 record in 2025. Unlike his two predecessors, Silverfield failed to win a conference championship in the American Conference. Now, Silverfield heads to Arkansas to turn around a struggling program. The Razorbacks lost seven straight games under interim coach Bobby Petrino to finish 2-10, the program's worst finish since Chad Morris's final season in 2019. It was only the fourth winless campaign in SEC play since joining the conference more than 30 years ago. The Razorbacks have a difficult schedule ahead in 2026, including a road trip to play Utah in nonconference. Arkansas will also play Georgia, LSU, Tennessee, at Texas, at Texas A&M and at Vanderbilt. Silverfield will also have to replace star quarterback Taylen Green, top running back Mike Washington and receiver O'Mega Blake, all of whom are out of eligibility. \nCBS Sports will update this story shortly. \n            \n    ",

You can bet up to $1,500  on your first bet and get it back as bonus bets if you lose.The Fanatics Sportsbook promo code  has its own unique structure. Bet insurance is FanCash back if your wager loses, but instead of having the insurance only apply to your first  bet with the sportsbook, Fanatics gives you bet insurance in FanCash on one wager each day for 10 consecutive days after account creation, up to $200 in FanCash per day. That's up to $2,000 in total FanCash after 10 days.  How to sign up for Borgata Sportsbook and claim the promo (Note: Borgata Sportsbook is currently only available to users in the state of New Jersey.)

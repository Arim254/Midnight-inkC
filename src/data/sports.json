The Americans certainly have the team to compete for another gold medal thanks to a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, and they will look to keep their strong start going on Saturday against Finland. The Americans were dominant to open Olympic play on Thursday with a 5-1 win over Czechia. Hayley Scamurra led the way with two goals, team captain Hilary Knight went top shelf late in the second period to extend the lead to 4-1 and Aerin Frankel stopped 13 of 14 shots in net to help the Americans open Olympic play on a positive note.\nAlong with Canada, Team USA is one of just two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.Team USA is poised to retake its place atop the international hockey hierarchy, and it enters the Olympics as the favorite to win gold. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, it's another two-horse race between the U.S. (-155) and Canada (+115), at least on paper. The next closest gold medal contenders are Czechia (+6000) and Sweden (+6000).As is typically the case, the Americans have put together a roster that's loaded at every position, and there's a good mix of experience and youth. Knight is making her fifth Olympic appearance, and star Kendall Coyne Schofield will make her fourth Olympic appearance. Defenders Megan Keller and Lee Stecklein are also familiar with the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, rising stars Taylor Heise, Carlone Harvey and Laila Edwards are getting their first taste of Olympic action.The Americans continue this Olympic journey with a matchup against Finland on Saturday, and we'll keep you up to date with each result along the way.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 USA vs. Finland | Saturday, Feb. 7 | 10:40 a.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Switzerland | Monday, Feb. 9 | 2:40 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

UConn is already 2-0 in MSG this season with wins over Illinois and Florida and Hurley is currently boasting an 11-2 record over his last 13 games in the arena.\" Bet UConn to win at DraftKings here:Pistons (-170) to defeat the KnicksThe model isn't too concerned about Detroit's 126-117 home loss to the lowly Wizards on Thursday, as it may have been the classic case of looking ahead to a showdown the following day. The Pistons have the best record in the East at 37-13, and the Knicks are tied for second at 33-18. The Pistons, and their fans, have revenge in mind heading into this home matchup after the Knicks defeated the Pistons in six games last season, including closing the series in Detroit. The Pistons defeated the Knicks, 121-90, on Jan. 5 in Detroit in their first meeting this season, and the model sees value in betting New York's eight-game winning streak to end on Friday. The Pistons are 20-6 at home this season, while the Knicks are 11-12 on the road. The model projects the Pistons to win in 67% of simulations. Bet the Pistons to win at DraftKings here:Celtics (-5.5) vs. Heat (-118)The Celtics have won four straight games to improve to 33-18, with only the Pistons having a better record than them in the East. Guard Jaylen Brown has proven capable of being a team's Alpha as Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring at 29.5 points per game, including back-to-back games with at least 30 points. Derrick White had 28 points in Boston's 114-93 win over the Rockets on Wednesday, with 7-footer Neemias Queta playing as a force inside with 19 rebounds. His size can challenge Bam Adebayo and Miami as the Heat are coming off a 127-115 loss to the Hawks on Tuesday. Boston will host on Friday, and the Celtics are 16-8 at home this season, while the Heat are 11-15 on the road.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl 60 matchup is set, with the New England Patriots representing the AFC and the Seattle Seahawks coming from the NFC. You can make Patriots vs. Seahawks picks well before the kickoff on Sunday, Feb. 8, and it's fitting these are the only two teams left to make NFL bets on. That's because they boast the two best spread records this year, with Seattle at 14-5 and New England at 13-6-1. However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too.

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III is -190 (risk $190 to win $100) to score a touchdown, Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is -110 and Patriots RB Rhamondre Stevenson is +140. Darnold is the +120 favorite to win MVP. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Seattle has won each of the three meetings since that Super Bowl 49 defeat. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Before making any Patriots vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the Super Bowl 60 predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Brady Kannon.\nKannon rose to fame in 2011 when he captained a four-person team to win the Hilton NFL SuperContest (now the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest). His team set the record for the highest winning percentage in the contest's history at the time, nailing 72.5% (58-22-5 ATS). Kannon has also crushed his recent NFL picks, going 29-15-2 (+1208) in his last 46 NFL against the spread picks. Now, Kannon has set his sights on Seahawks vs. Patriots and just locked in his picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are several NFL odds and NFL betting lines for Patriots vs. Seahawks: Seahawks vs. Patriots                                                 spreadSeattle -4.5 (-115) at DraftKings SportsbookSeahawks vs. Patriots                                                         over/under45.5 pointsSeahawks vs. Patriots                                                         money line Seattle -230, New England +190Seahawks vs. Patriots                                                     picksSee picks at SportsLineSeahawks vs. Patriots                                                         streaming Fubo (Try for free)  Why the Patriots can coverNew England had the No. 4 scoring defense in the regular season, with top 10 rankings versus both the run and the pass, yet the unit has been even better in the postseason. The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained. Additionally, the underdog has outright won in three straight Super Bowls and covered in five straight, with each of those the longest streaks in Big Game history. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverSeattle has played turnover-free ball over their last three games, and it is the only undefeated team (10-0) this season when committing 1 or fewer turnovers. Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970. The Seahawks are also the first team in a decade to rank in the top two in both yards per rush allowed (3.7, 1st) and yards per pass allowed (5.5, 2nd). In terms of the spread, Seattle is a league-best 14-5 ATS this season, as well as 8-1 versus the line away from home. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Seahawks  picksKannon has analyzed Seahawks vs. Patriots from every possible angle.

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props like Kenneth Walker III anytime touchdown (-190) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\n        Penn State hockey star Gavin McKenna will no longer face a felony charge stemming from his involvement in an altercation that occurred at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night. McKenna, the potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, was initially charged with felony aggravated assault after an incident at Doggie's Pub in the hours after Penn State's outdoor game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium. However, Centre County district attorney Bernie Cantorna wrote in a statement Friday that the felony charge against McKenna has been dropped following a review of video evidence and learning the extent of the man's injuries -- which weren't as severe as initially reported.McKenna, 18, still faces a misdemeanor count of simple assault and summary offenses of harassment and disorderly conduct. He has a preliminary hearing for those charges scheduled for Feb. 11.The complaint says the alleged victim \"was punched twice on the right side of his face\" following \"an exchange of words between the alleged victim's group and the group of people with McKenna.\" According to the Centre Daily Times, the injured man was \"heckling McKenna and his mother after the game.\"\nThe initial complaint alleged that the victim \"sustained fractures to both sides of his jaw,\" requiring surgery, and was \"missing a tooth.\" However, a police investigation determined the victim \"sustained two fractures to one side of his jaw ... and was not missing a tooth.\" The man \"had surgery and is recovering,\" Cantorna said. \"In order to establish probable cause for the crime of Aggravated Assault, the Commonwealth must establish that a person acted with the intent to cause serious bodily injury or acted recklessly under circumstances showing an extreme indifference to the value of human life. Both the District Attorney's Office and the State College Police Department have reviewed video evidence of this incident and do not believe that a charge of Aggravated Assault is supported by the evidence,\" Cantorna said in a release from the District Attorney's office. \"Accordingly, the District Attorney's Office will be withdrawing the felony count of Aggravated Assault and correcting the record regarding the injuries suffered by the victim. A review of the video does not support a conclusion that Gavin McKenna acted with the intent to cause serious bodily injury or with reckless indifference to the value of human life.\"McKenna, a freshman forward from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. Prior to his arrival at Penn State, McKenna starred as a 17-year-old in the Western Hockey League in Canada, posting 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) for the Medicine Hat Tigers in 58 regular season games, and helped lead them to a WHL championship. Thanks to an NCAA rule change, McKenna is part of the first class of young Canadian stars who played at the top junior levels in Canada to be allowed to play college hockey in the United States. \nMcKenna's status with the Penn State hockey team is unclear. The Nittany Lions (18-8) next play on the road against Michigan on Feb. 13. \n            ",

New England famously won Super Bowl 49 on a fabled goal-line interception, but both teams are much different now. Bill Belichick was on the sidelines for the Pats back then while Tom Brady was under center. Now, former New England star Mike Vrabel is wrapping up his first season as the team's head coach while getting great quarterback play from second-year star Drake Maye. As for Seattle, gone are Pete Carroll and Russell Wilson and in are Mike Macdonald and Sam Darnold. Both quarterbacks have been in the spotlight not just with their play, but due to injuries ahead of Super Bowl 60. Now, both teams have released their final official injury reports on Friday, Feb. 6. Here, we break down the biggest Super Bowl injuries for bettors to know and share what the latest NFL betting odds look like at DraftKings Sportsbook for Super Bowl 60.

Both teams presented good news on Friday as New England didn't list star quarterback Drake Maye with any designation, and the same is the case for Seattle's standout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori. Maye was limited at times with a shoulder injury and even missed practice last week with an illness. Emmanwori suffered an ankle injury at practice on Wednesday and didn't practice Thursday, but he was a full participant on Friday. Additionally, Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who has been dealing with an oblique injury this postseason, was a full practice participant Thursday and Friday after being limited throughout the playoffs. Two Patriots starters on defense -- linebackers Harold Landry and Robert Spillane -- are questionable to play, as is rookie defensive tackle Joshua Farmer. Spillane had 97 total tackles this season and was limited Thursday and Friday while Landry had 8.5 sacks in the regular season and was limited Wednesday and Friday but didn't practice Thursday. For Seattle, starting rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts is questionable with a neck injury that caused him to miss the NFC title game. The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites in Super Bowl 60 over the Patriots, and the total is 45.5. Seattle is a -230 money line favorite (wager $230 to win $100) while the Patriots are +190 underdogs (wager $100 to win $190). The Seahawks are 14-5 against the spread this year and are 10-9 to the Over. The Patriots are 14-6 against the spread and 12-8 to the Over. Both teams finished the regular season with 14-3 overall records. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Remember how just last week Yankees general manager Brian Cashman was pushing back against the narrative that his team is simply \"running it back\" with basically the same team from last season? Yeah, this won't help. The Yankees are finalizing a deal to bring back free agent first baseman Paul Goldschmidt on a one-year deal, according to ESPN.Goldschmidt, 38, is in the twilight of an amazing career that might one day land him in the Hall of Fame. Last season, he hit .274/.328/.403 (104 OPS+), but that was held up by a really hot start that didn't last. In his last 90 games, Goldschmidt hit .223/.274/.330 and by the time the playoffs came around, he wasn't a regular starter. The opening for playing time in 2026 for Goldschmidt would be the right-handed hitting side of a platoon at first base with lefty-swinging Ben Rice. Rice hit just .208 against lefties last season, so there's an opportunity for Goldschmidt to grab at-bats against tough lefties, at least to start the season. \nTo this point, Goldschmidt has played in parts of 15 MLB seasons. He's a career .288/.378/.504 (137 OPS+) hitter with 2,190 hits, 477 doubles, 372 home runs, 1,232 RBI, 1,280 runs, 174 stolen bases and 63.8 WAR. The seven-time All-Star and 2022 NL MVP ranks 16th all-time in WAR among first basemen. \n            \n    ",

Barry Trotz announced his decision to step down from the post on Monday, and as majority owner Bill Haslam looks for a new general manager, he'll get some help from Nick Saban.Back in December, Saban purchased a minority stake in the Predators, and his knowledge about leadership will already come in handy. While the team will hire CAA to coordinate and contact candidates, the Predators will form a search committee, and Haslam said the group will get insights from Saban on \"building culture\" as they look at each candidate.\"We've hired CAA to coordinate the search for us. We have a search committed that I will lead, but Barry and [CEO Sean Henry] and Michelle Kennedy, our president will be on,\" Haslam said. \"... Nick Saban, who is our newest owner and has a little familiarity with winning organizations, has agreed to be on the committee as well.\"\nSaban may be retired from coaching, but he still wants to be involved with sports, and owning a share of the Predators allowed him to do that. In a statement from the announcement, Saban said he still has a \"competitive nature and a great passion for sports.\"If Nashville is going to rely on anyone outside the hockey world for this hire, it may as well be Saban. No other college football coach has more national championships than Saban's seven, and he developed Alabama into a perennial powerhouse over the course of his 17-year tenure. Under Saban, the Crimson Tide went 206-29-0 with six national titles.\nThe Predators, meanwhile, have been on a downward trend since winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2017-18. The team has missed the postseason in two of the last three years, and it hasn't won a playoff series in eight years. The next general manager will have to make some tough directions about the long-term future of a the franchise -- including whether a full rebuild will be required to restore the Predators to Stanley Cup contender status.\n            \n    ",

It's no surprise to see Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals taking part in the games, but not many expected rookie Shedeur Sanders or 41-year-old Joe Flacco to be named to the Pro Bowl. There was another surprising player that was reportedly asked to participate in the Pro Bowl Games, but he declined to focus on his offseason training. That was Justin Fields of the New York Jets, according to NFL Media.It's surprising a quarterback that was benched this season was asked to attend the Pro Bowl. Fields went 2-7 as the starter for the Jets in 2025, and completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception. His 6.2 yards per attempt marked a career low, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the Jets part ways with him after he signed a two-year, $40 million deal with New York 11 months ago. Fields is certainly an electric athlete that would be fun to watch participate in the games. Back in 2022 with the Chicago Bears, he rushed for 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns. Only Lamar Jackson has rushed for more yards in a single season as a quarterback. In a 35-32 loss to the Miami Dolphins that season, Fields set an NFL record by rushing for 178 yards and a touchdown. Fields was not the only AFC quarterback to decline an invite to the Pro Bowl, as KPRC2 reports C.J. Stroud of the Houston Texans also turned down the Pro Bowl to prepare for next season. The AFC really had to go back to the drawing board when it came to their quarterbacks, as their original Pro Bowl signal-callers were Josh Allen, Drake Maye and Justin Herbert. Allen is recovering from foot surgery, Maye is playing in the Super Bowl and Herbert is banged-up as well.\nThe Pro Bowl Games will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 8 p.m. ET, and take place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first of two regular-season rivalry matchups between Michigan and Michigan State was all the more heated because of the teams' battle for the Big Ten title and status as two of the top 10 teams in the nation. Michigan coach Dusty May argued that those tensions went a touch too far in the No. 3 Wolverines' 83-71 win over the No. 7 Spartans last Friday night, accusing Michigan State of multiple \"very dangerous\" plays.Among the incidents in question was a play in which Spartans guard Jeremy Fears Jr. clipped Wolverines star Yaxel Lendeborg with his right foot. May pushed back on the assessment that it was an \"apparent\" trip and quipped, \"it wasn't an illusion.\"\n\"I think there were several plays that were very dangerous,\" May said on Monday. \"I am incredibly proud of our guys for the responses they had to some of those situations. Incredibly proud for their self-control, their restraint and their impulse control. I'll leave it at that. But they're not isolated incidents.\"Physical play is an expectation in marquee matchups, and even more so when two bitter rivals are involved, but May's perspective is that the Spartans crossed the line on more than just one occasion.\"The film is there,\" May said. \"40 minutes of it. It's not hard to find.\"\nMichigan State's Tom Izzo caught wind of May's accusations. Three days removed from his third loss of the season, the Hall of Famer brushed off his rival coach's comments, chalked the game's physicality up to the heat of the battle and turned his attention to Wednesday's trip to Minnesota.\"I thought there were a couple of plays the other way, too, like jumping into a guy and getting a foul when it was a complete joke,\" Izzo said. \"This is what it's supposed to be. And you know what, Michigan's over. I'm moving on to Minnesota. No insult to you. I don't care what Dusty says. I don't care what they say.\"There were some things Jeremy did I addressed. Him and their point guard were going at it pretty good. That's what happens in games like this. If anybody did anything dirty, tell him to call me, and I would be more than happy to address it. If it was physical play, that's the way that game's always going to be.\"May said that he has not reached out to Izzo about the plays he labeled as dangerous.\nThe Wolverines and Spartans will close their two-leg rivalry series in the regular-season finale on March 8. Michigan will host the second half of the home-and-home.\n            ",

An amended complaint filed last week includes a total of 31 plaintiffs, which attorney Kerry Sutton said comprises athletes from eight different sports teams. Three former athletes filed individual lawsuits in 2022 and 2023, and the case grew in September when 11 alleged victims filed a fourth suit.The lawsuit alleges that Murphy over multiple years engaged in acts of misconduct involving improper touching of the genitals during massages and intrusive observation while collecting urine samples during drug tests.Murphy, who worked at NC State from 2012-22 and was promoted to director of sports medicine in 2018, is one of nine defendants named in the lawsuit. The others are school officials, including former athletic director Debbie Yow, who are accused of negligence. The plaintiffs claim that Yow and other administrators were aware of Murphy's behavior but did not investigate nor prevent him from working with male athletes.\"The health and safety of students and student-athletes is paramount to NC State Athletics and the university,\" a university spokesperson said Monday to ESPN. \"Sexual misconduct of any kind is unacceptable, prohibited by NC State's policies, and in direct opposition to the mission, culture and standards of the university. NC State is reviewing the lawsuit and determining appropriate next steps.\"\nNC State placed Murphy on administrative leave and fired him in 2022, the same year in which former men's soccer player Benjamin Locke filed the initial lawsuit. That complaint stated that former men's soccer coach Kelly Findley told a senior athletic department official in 2016 that Murphy was engaging in conduct consistent with \"grooming\" behavior. The September lawsuit added that Findley raised concerns four years prior in 2012 and requested that Murphy be removed from his role as the team's trainer.Murphy was reassigned from his role in 2013 but resumed working with the men's soccer team in 2014. Athletic department officials allegedly told Murphy between 2016 and 2021 to refrain from treating male athletes and to distance himself from the men's soccer team, but the lawsuit states they did not enforce those requests when he failed to comply.\n\"A culture of fear in the NCSU athletics department led to this tragic set of circumstances,\" Sutton said in September. \"Athletes afraid of losing their scholarship or their spot on the team, trainers afraid of reporting their boss, coaches afraid of getting involved, directors afraid of harming NCSU's reputation. Murphy took advantage of those fears to get away with abusing what we believe may turn out to be hundreds of former Wolfpack athletes.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners are acquiring All-Star infielder/outfielder Brendan Donovan from the St. Louis Cardinals in a three-team trade that also involves the Tampa Bay Rays, ESPN reports. Switch-pitcher Jurrangelo Cijntje is headed back from Seattle to St. Louis and the Rays are expected to get third baseman Ben Williamson from the Mariners. The Cardinals will also receive 2023 first-round draft pick Tai Peete from the Mariners and outfielder Colton Ledbetter and a compensatory draft pick from the Rays. None of the involved clubs has yet announced the trade. Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksDonovan, who's going into his age-29 season in 2026, is coming off his first career All-Star selection this past season. His best position is second base, and he can also man first, third, and left, and cover shortstop in limited doses. At the plate, Donovan put up an OPS+ of 119 this past season, and that figure is right in line with his career mark of 117 across parts of four MLB campaigns. Furthermore, there's cause to believe he may have found a higher level with the bat in 2025. Through the end of May, Donovan boasted a wOBA of .373 and backed it up with expected wOBA of .370. In June, though, an MRI on Donovan's ailing left toe turned up a sprained capsule in the joint. Donovan toughed it out, but the injury cascaded throughout his lower half, messed up his swing mechanics, and sapped his production. The Mariners are no doubt hoping he's able to rediscover and sustain that higher level moving forward. Donovan won't hit free agency until after the 2027 season.\n        \n            \n                Brendan Donovan trade grades: Mariners find obvious fit, Cardinals finish offseason teardown with biggest move\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe'll slot into a lineup that includes All-Star slugger Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor and Randy Arozarena. The Mariners won the AL West in 2025 with a 90-72 record, three games ahead of the Houston Astros, before losing in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.From the Cardinals' standpoint, the trade of Donovan is in many ways the capstone on an offseason that's seen them commit fully to a rebuild under first-year president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom. Earlier in the winter, Bloom and the Cardinals in a pair of deals sent right-hander Sonny Gray and first baseman/former catcher Willson Contreras to the Red Sox and then offloaded veteran third baseman Nolan Arenado to the Diamondbacks. In each deal, the Cardinals added young pitching to an organization that prior to Bloom's takeover was starved for velocity and swing and miss. As well, ownership in each of those three deals included significant cash in order improve the return. That was especially the case in the Arenado swap. As for the Donovan trade, it not only adds young talent to an improving farm system but also fully clears the decks for top prospect JJ Wetherholt in 2026. He's now the favorite to open the 2026 season as the Cardinals' starting second baseman.\nCijntje, headlining the return for St. Louis, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. CBS Sports' R.J. Anderson recently ranked him the No. 7 prospect in the AL West, crediting a \"sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future,\" but warned that his best future almost certainly involves pitching exclusively as a right-hander.Peete, also headed to the Cardinals, spent all of 2025 in High A, hitting .217/.288/.404 in 125 games.Williamson, headed south to the Rays, made his major-league debut in 2025, hitting .253/.294/.310 in 85 games for the Mariners.\nLedbetter hit .265/.337/.378 in Double A last season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, who has been in search of an additional year of eligibility since the conclusion of the 2025 season, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in Knox County Chancery Court. In his complaint, Aguilar seeks a temporary restraining order against the NCAA with the goal of obtaining an injunction that would allow him to play for the Volunteers in 2026.Aguilar is the latest athlete to sue the NCAA over its eligibility rules, and like the other cases, the Tennessee quarterback's complaint alleges that those rules deprive him of the opportunity to earn NIL compensation. Aguilar played two seasons of junior college football, which he argues should not count against his eligibility clock.\"If the Court granted Aguilar relief from the NCAA's JUCO rule in the near term, Tennessee has a spot for him on the roster and would welcome him back,\" the complaint says, per the Knoxville News Sentinel. \"His compensation for playing college football in 2026 would be approximately $2 million.\"If the court rules in Aguilar's favor, it would pave the way for him to join the Tennessee roster while awaiting a final ruling on the injunction. The 2026 season would be Aguilar's second with the Volunteers and fourth at the FBS level. He redshirted in 2019 at the City College of San Francisco, did not play in 2020 when the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, started five games at Diablo Valley College in 2021 and started six games the following year before making his Division I debut in 2023 at Appalachian State.\nAguilar will be 25 at the start of the 2026 campaign.There is no date set for Aguilar's hearing, but he seeks a speedy decision as he charts his path forward. The complaint states the need for a timely ruling in order to allow him to either return for spring practices or prepare for the NFL Draft.Aguilar was the SEC leader last season in passing yards per game and totaled 3,565 on the year, which placed him in third place in Tennessee single-season history. He passed for 24 touchdowns and ran for four more scores while guiding the Volunteers to an 8-5 record.Tennessee's offensive outlook hinges on Aguilar rulingAn injunction allowing Aguilar to spend one more year at Tennessee would likely raise the Volunteers' floor in 2026. The quarterback room in his absence lacks experience and would turn either to George MacIntyre or Faizon Brandon as its starter. Ryan Staub transferred in from Colorado but does not carry the same high-end upside as the former blue-chip recruits in the group.\nWith Aguilar under center, the Volunteers would benefit from both his experience as a fourth-year FBS starter and his familiarity with the offensive system. Any development between his first and second seasons in the program could help the Volunteers pull out of the SEC's middle tier and compete more strongly for a College Football Playoff berth.Diego Pavia case has implications for Aguilar, othersAguilar was initially a plaintiff in Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia's lawsuit against the NCAA, which challenges in federal court the legality of counting junior college seasons towards athlete's five-year eligibility clocks. He was granted voluntary dismissal from Pavia's suit and is thus no longer tied to the decision. The more than 25 plaintiffs in the Pavia case await a Feb. 10 hearing in which a judge will consider a preliminary injunction that halts the NCAA's junior college rule.If the federal court rules against Pavia and the other plaintiffs, Aguilar could still obtain his eligibility through his own lawsuit in state court. If it grants the injunction, further actions could bring additional eligibility to any former junior college player who has yet to play four years of Division I athletics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The book is not yet closed on the 2026 college football recruiting cycle, but Georgia already has its sights set on the following class and made a marquee addition to its 2027 haul. Kemon Spell, the No. 7 overall recruit and top running back in the nation, per 247Sports, committed Monday to the Bulldogs and is the second five-star prospect in his class to pick a destination.Spell is a McKeesport, Pa. native and a longtime Penn State commit, but when the Nittany Lions fired coach James Franklin midway through the 2025 season, the prized running back decommitted from the in-state program and reopened his recruitment. Georgia, Notre Dame and Miami pushed hard to land his talents once he began a new college search, and he picked up new offers from Nebraska, Oregon and Ole Miss.\"It's just the love and relationship between all the coaches,\" Spell said to 247Sports about his relationship with Georgia. \"I got down there the first time and got to meet Kirby Smart. It was nothing but great. It's been great every other day since then, and we've talked every other day, for real.\"Even with an ankle injury sidelining him for three games early in his junior season at McKeesport, Spell rushed for 1,755 yards and scored 32 touchdowns as a ballcarrier, receiver and kick returner.\nSpell not only highlights the 2027 running back class but also stands as one of just nine recruits to hold five-star status early in the cycle. He debuted in the 247Sports rankings as the No. 59 overall player and has done nothing but climb the ladder over the last year and a half.\"Overall, it's a great school and great place for me to be,\" Spell said. \"It was just, as soon as I got there, the love and relationship I had with the coaches, it was just a spark. It's a place that's a home feel. That's what it felt like when I got there.\"It is still extremely early in the 2027 recruiting calendar, but Georgia is off to the kind of start that should result in the Bulldogs contending for the nation's No. 1 class. They stand sixth nationally in the team rankings after Spell's commitment and already have pledges from three players who rank No. 54 overall or better. Cornerback Donte Wright (No. 34) and offensive tackle Kelsey Adams (No. 54) round out the class headliners.\nKirby Smart is set to put the finishing touches this week on his No. 6-ranked 2026 class. Smart has never compiled anything other than a top-10 haul during his Georgia tenure, and that will remain true when the ink dries on this class come Wednesday's National Signing Day. He also has three No. 1 classes to his name over the last decade.\n            ",

All the while, Rozier has been away from the Heat after being placed on unpaid leave after he was arrested. The NBPA filed a grievance for Rozier to be paid his salary, citing the necessary presumption of innoncence until proven guilty, which an arbitrator agreed with.\"We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling and remain committed to ensuring that Terry's due process rights are protected and that he is afforded the presumption of innocence throughout this process,\" a NBPA spokesperson said.The Heat had been holding Rozier's payments in escrow, and will now pay him his full salary for the 2025-26 season -- or until a ruling is made on his case and it's determined whether he was guilty in the alleged betting scandal. \nThat ruling comes at an interesting time for the Heat, as they are considered one of the top potential suitors for Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of the NBA's trade deadline on Thursday. Rozier's salary could be important filler in any deal, whether for Antetokounmpo or any other trade the Heat want to make. Because Rozier is an expiring salary, using his contract would allow the Heat some added flexibility in trade talks. His money will come off of the books after this season and would allow Miami to make an offer to the Bucks that could provide some much-needed cap relief for the Bucks. \nRozier's contract has counted against Miami's cap all season and has always been considered tradable, but the uncertainty of his situation given the charges against him made it feel a bit murky. The arbitrator's ruling in Rozier's favor could help provide clarity for teams perhaps unsure if a deal involving Rozier would clear at the league level. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAfter the Kansas Jayhawks' 90-82 win over AJ Dybantsa and then-No. 13 BYU on Saturday, college basketball analysts and hoops Twitter had one, unified take: If Darryn Peterson stays in the lineup, the Jayhawks are national title contenders.That, however, is one big if. Peterson, who is widely regarded as the No. 1 overall pick in a potentially loaded NBA Draft, has been in and out of the lineup for much of the season, sometimes strangely, with various ailments. He scored 18 points in 20 minutes on Saturday against the Cougars but did not play the final 16 minutes with what coach Bill Self later described as cramps. On Monday, Kansas (16-5, 6-2 in Big 12) and presumably Peterson will look to win their third straight game against a ranked opponent when they take on the No. 13 Texas Tech Red Raiders at United Supermarkets Arena in Lubbock, Texas.The Red Raiders (16-5, 6-2) are coming off an 88-80 loss at UCF, which ended a five-game winning streak. JT Toppin has been a double-double dandy for Texas Tech, averaging 22.4 points (seventh in the country) and 10.9 rebounds (sixth) per game this season.The Red Raiders are 4.5-point favorites over the Jayhawks on Monday.While Texas Tech vs. Kansas is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes four NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Feb. 2. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchSyracuse at No. 16 North CarolinaTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Chapel Hill, N.C. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: North Carolina -11.5 | Expert: North Carolina -10.5 (Larry Hartstein) \nWhat in the name of Howard Triche is wrong with the Syracuse Orange? Syracuse (13-9, 4-5 in ACC) had lost four in a row before an 86-72 win over woeful Notre Dame at home on Saturday. The Orange's last two road games were a 20-point loss to NC State and an overtime defeat at Boston College. That won't cut it in Chapel Hill on Monday night against a North Carolina Tar Heels (17-4, 5-3) team that, during conference play, leads the ACC in scoring (85.5 points per game) and assists (17.3 per game). \"[The Tar Heels] just blew out Georgia Tech despite shooting 8-of-31 from deep,\" Hartstein says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, agrees. It says that North Carolina has a 54% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to Tar Heels -11.5.No. 11 Kansas at No. 13 Texas TechTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Lubbock, Texas | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas Tech -4.5\nLed by Toppin, the Red Raiders own the 10th most efficient offense in the country, scoring 125.8 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom. They also have been difficult to beat at United Supermarkets Arena this season. Texas Tech is a perfect 11-0 at home, which includes victories over then-No. 6 Houston and then-No. 11 BYU. Coach Grant McCasland's squad also is the only team to have beaten Duke this season, having done so at Madison Square Garden in December. Monday's game will be Kansas' toughest road test of the season by far. The Jayhawks have played only one true road game against a ranked team and lost, 87-74, at then-No. 25 North Carolina in November. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 51% chance the Red Raiders cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Texas Tech -4.5.NBA best bets, where to watchTimberwolves at GrizzliesTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Memphis | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Timberwolves -6.5 \nThe Memphis Grizzlies are 3-13 since late December, have lost six consecutive games and have crashed to 12th in the Western Conference. Ja Morant has missed 11 of the last 13 games, and reports say he could still be shipped out before the trade deadline. Is Memphis already on the journey to Tankville? On Saturday, the Minnesota Timberwolves (31-19) got 33 points from Anthony Edwards in a 131-114 blowout win over the Grizzlies in Memphis. The victory was Minnesota's fourth in a row. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Timberwolves have a 62% chance to cover and assigns a \"B\" grade to Minnesota -6.5.76ers at ClippersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Clippers -2 | Expert: Kelly Oubre Jr. Over 12.5 total points -128 (Mike Barner)\nThe bad news for Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer: He lost $14 billion on Thursday when Microsoft's stock plummeted. The good news: His Clippers are 17-4 over their last 21 games to climb back in the Western Conference playoff race. That certainly won't offset $14 billion in losses, but it's ... something. L.A. is coming off a 117-93 victory over the Suns in Phoenix on Sunday despite playing without James Harden. On Monday, the Clippers will face a Philadelphia 76ers team that will be without suspended star Paul George, who apparently didn't heed Nancy Reagan's \"Just Say No\" advice. With George out, Barner likes Kelly Oubre Jr. to get more scoring opportunities. \"A key stat for this game is that Oubre Jr. is shooting 36.9% from behind the arc,\" he says. \"The Clippers allow the sixth-highest 3-point shooting percentage in the league, so Oubre Jr. could be a matchup problem for them.\" The SportsLine Projection Model says Los Angeles has a 67% chance to cover and gives a \"B\" grade to Clippers -2.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For soccer players around the world, playing in the Premier League can be a crowning achievement of their careers while also offering lucrative financial rewards. That allure can cause players to leave good situations in other European leagues for a chance to compete in England, which may not manifest in reality. A move was close for PSV Eindhoven striker Ricardo Pepi to join Fulham, but it fell through on deadline day due to PSV not being able to secure a replacement striker for the American.On one hand, Pepi won't be able to join Antonee Robinson at a club that has a rich history of American players becoming stars, but, on the flip side, Pepi's last move to a big five league should act as a word of caution. After leaving FC Dallas, Pepi went to Augsburg in the Bundesliga, featuring in only 16 matches across two seasons before moving to FC Groningen in the Netherlands, where he was able to rebuild his career, showing that he was still a top striker, and earning a move to his current club.But the damage was already done during that time in the Bundesliga. Pepi fell down the pecking order for the United States men's national team, eventually missing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Pepi then made a move to PSV, where he has been able to get back on the right track, but despite having impressive production when he's on the pitch, he has yet to complete a full season's workload since coming to the club.Ricardo Pepi European minutes per seasonClubSeasonMinutes playedGoalsAssistsAugsburg2021-2247500Augsburg/ FC Groningen2022-232,746133PSV2023-2476493PSV2024-251,132183PSV2025-26983112Knee injuries and a broken arm have stopped Pepi from making more appearances over the past few seasons, but PSV have also had numerous options all over the pitch, leading to rotation all over. For example, in three seasons, Pepi has made 22 appearances in the Champions League, scoring nine goals and assisting three more. Only three of those 22 appearances were starts. Not only is it a different pace coming off the bench, but when also taking into account the physicality of the Premier League, a midseason move to England would be quite a shift for Pepi.\nWith another World Cup on the horizon in 2026, any drops in playing time could lead to a deja vu scenario for Pepi. Even with the injury, he's on track for the most minutes played for any club since the 2022-23 season, and PSV have shown trust in him by presenting him with the number nine shirt. Another move before the World Cup could have seen Pepi lose out on playing time and an opportunity to make it, but that's especially the case right now when Pepi hasn't scored for the USMNT since the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals in November of 2024.He didn't get his first cap under Mauricio Pochettino until facing Paraguay in November of 2025, so while Pepi is expected to be in the World Cup squad, it's not something that can be taken for granted at this time. Only being 23, another European move gone wrong wouldn't be enough to be a full setback in his young career, but it wouldn't be optimal when so much is at stake.\nThe grass isn't always greener when it comes to transfers, and it can't be taken for granted how important carving out a role with a club can be. There's still much more for Pepi to prove as a player with the Dutch side, and with the transfer window closing while he's still there, he'll have a chance to do it. With a strong end to the season and good performances at the World Cup, there's every chance that a move to a club like Fulham could still be there during the summer.  Striker Raul Jimenez isn't getting any younger, and moving then would give Pepi the best chance of settling in with time on his side.\n            ",

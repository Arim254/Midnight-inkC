The Week 6 NFL schedule includes three late-window matchups, with Raiders vs. Titans kicking off at 4:05 p.m. ET, while Buccaneers vs. 49ers and Packers vs. Bengals kick off at 4:25 p.m. ET.Picks from all three games are among our Sunday NFL best bets at BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts. Get the newest BetMGM bonus code and take advantage of one of the best sportsbook promos. Get started now:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 41-21 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Best Week 6 Sunday NFL predictions at BetMGMRaiders -4.5 vs. Titans (-105)Over 44.5 points in Packers vs. Bengals (-110)Buccaneers -3.5 vs. 49ers (-105)Combining these three picks into a Sunday NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +627 (risk $100 to win $627). Bet it at BetMGM here:Raiders -4.5 vs. Titans (-105)Both teams are 1-4, but under very different circumstances, with the Raiders winning their first game while the Titans won their most recent game. However, a deeper dive into the statistics paints a pretty clear picture that Tennessee is the inferior team. The Titans have been outgained by nearly 700 yards this season but have benefitted from being +1 in turnover differential while the Raiders have only been outgained by 27 yards but are -6 in turnover differential. Those types of numbers have a tendency to balance themselves out over time and the model predicts that Las Vegas covers in 56% of simulations.Over 44.5 points in Packers vs. Bengals (-110)Cincinnati's offense has been stuck in neutral without Joe Burrow (toe), but the Bengals are hopeful that 40-year-old Joe Flacco can give them a boost considering the talent he'll be surrounded by (Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown). Flacco struggled with the Browns this season but has had a recent history of sparking offenses midseason with the Colts, Browns and Jets over the last three years. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati defense ranks 30th in points allowed and yards allowed and could have a tough time with a Packers offense that hung 40 on the Cowboys before the bye. The model predicts the Over hits in 64% of simulations.Buccaneers -3.5 vs. 49ers (-105)\"Some curiosities about these teams should be answered on Sunday. Regarding the 49ers, how long are they going to be able to hang in there with a patchwork lineup? Injuries have decimated the roster but here the Niners sit at 4-1 into this weekend, with Mac Jones (in again for ailing Brock Purdy at QB) now 3-0 as a starter, even minus the likes of Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle,\" Legendary SportsLine handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, the Bucs have mastered Perils of Pauline acts, with four last-minute wins in five games as orchestrated by QB Baker Mayfield, generating some deserving MLB buzz. Tampa Bay has injuries as well, but Mayfield also has an exciting new target, Ohio State rookie Emeka Egbuka, already on 5 TD catches.\"Want more NFL picks for Week 6?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Bye weeks and a long list of NFL injuries bring plenty of challenges for figuring out Week 6 Fantasy football rankings. Fantasy players already knew players such as Lamar Jackson, Brock Purdy, Chris Godwin and CeeDee Lamb would be out on Sunday. Ja'Marr Chase (illness) was a late addition to the injury report, though reports indicate he is trending towards playing. How should those injuries impact your Fantasy football picks, and which Fantasy football sleepers should be on your radar this week? Before making your Week 6 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 6 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 6 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 6 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 6: The model is fading Lions quarterback Jared Goff, a two-time Pro Bowler who leads the NFL with 12 passing touchdowns. Goff ranks 10th in Fantasy points amongst quarterbacks this year, but much of his success came in two games against a pair of teams who rank in the bottom five in scoring defense in Cincinnati and Chicago. In Goff's other three contests, he's averaging just 198.3 passing yards with four total touchdowns and a pair of turnovers.Detroit visits Kansas City on Sunday night in Week 6, and only three teams have allowed fewer passing touchdowns than the Chiefs. They're also top 10 in passing yards allowed, as only one opposing quarterback has had more touchdowns than interceptions versus Kansas City, which has held its last four opposing QBs to just 157.3 passing yards. Thus, Goff may not warrant a spot in Week 6 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 15 in positional rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Raiders wideout Tre Tucker. The third-year pro out of Cincinnati is coming off a 71-yard outing in Week 5 and has been one of the most surprising Fantasy players this season. He is the WR16 in PPR scoring and is the WR10 in standard leagues. Tucker is tied for the team lead with four touchdowns, and his 315 scrimmage yards top both Jakobi Meyers (290) and Brock Bowers (225) amongst Raiders' pass catchers.Vegas takes on Tennessee on Sunday, and few defenses are as giving to wideouts as the Titans are. They allow the fifth-most receiving yards per game to opposing wide receivers, and just eight teams have given up more catches to the position. Tennessee has seen eight different opposing wideouts have at least 67 receiving yards or a touchdown versus the team this season, with three receivers reaching both of those thresholds. Tucker is slotted as a top-20 Fantasy wideout by the model in Week 6.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 6 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising running back could lead you to victory?

The Dallas Cowboys are off to a 2-2-1 start where the offense is clearly clicking but the defense is struggling to get stops. They'll take on the Carolina Panthers on Sunday and are favored by 3 on the road while the over/under for that game is 48.5 points.There's also an AFC North rivalry matchup in the 1 p.m. ET window as the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers are 3-1 coming off a bye and have been able to grind out wins in Aaron Rodgers' first season at the helm. Meanwhile, the Browns are 1-4, but do rank second in total defense. Pittsburgh is favored by 6 at home while the over/under is 38.5, and Cowboys -3 and Steelers -6 are among out NFL best bets for Sunday.Click here to bet today's games with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which offers new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses:Whether you're looking into MLB betting, NFL betting or anything else on the Sunday sports schedule, there are a number of online sports betting options, and our team can help point you in the right direction. Our computer model and experts will weigh in on all of the biggest events every day, and they're offering their top sports betting picks right now.Here's what we're betting todaySunday NFL best bets Game: Carolina Panthers vs. Dallas Cowboys (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)The Pick: Cowboys -3 (-120)A beatdown at the hands of the Bears and a bizarre tie against the Packers was enough to cause some panic in Dallas, but the Cowboys were able to right the ship with a win over the Jets last week and are still positioned to be competitive at 2-2-1. The offense ranks fourth in scoring and first in total yardage and they're going all that without CeeDee Lamb (ankle) in the lineup. He'll miss this game too but Dak Prescott, George Pickens and Javonte Williams should still be enough to give a middle-of-the-road Carolina defense fits. Meanwhile, the model predicts the defense manages enough stops for the Cowboys to cover in 57% of simulations.Game: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cleveland Browns (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)The Pick: Steelers -5.5 (-120)Pittsburgh's three wins have all come in one-possession games and the Steelers rank bottom five in the NFL in total offense and total defense. However, they're +7 in turnover differential and they've had an extra week to prepare for Dillon Gabriel in his second career start. Expect Teryl Austin to throw a lot at the rookie and for a large emphasis to be placed on winning the turnover battle yet again. The model has Pittsburgh covering the spread in 59% of simulations.Game: New Orleans Saints vs. New England Patriots (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)The Pick: Saints +3.5 (-120)\"This is a tricky spot for the surging Patriots. They just pulled off a seismic upset of division rival Buffalo, and next week they visit Tennessee -- the team that fired their coach Mike Vrabel following the 2023 season,\" SportsLine NFL expert Larry Hartstein said. \"With an emotional trip to Nashville on deck, and with the Patriots' injury report looking worse than the Saints' report, I like New Orleans to keep this close. The Saints have been in every game but one. And they get pass rusher Chase Young making his season debut.\"More NFL best betsEvery NFL game simulated 10,000 timesSportsLine expert reveals his Week 6 NFL score predictions\n            ",

Cleveland's defense continues to be its bread and butter, allowing the fewest rushing yards per game in the league (75.6) while hitting the Under three times. It has also racked up 14 sacks in five games, so Myles Garrett and the pass rush will be gunning for an aging quarterback in Rodgers, who has already gone down nine times this season.  Rodgers is only throwing for 196.5 yards per game, but has a serviceable 8-3 TD-INT ratio coming off the early-season bye. He and DK Metcalf will not have to carry quite as much weight, as running back Jaylen Warren is not on the injury report. The Steelers defense is allowing 122.0 rushing yards per game, but hasn't allowed a touchdown on the ground since Week 2, so it will be interesting to see how they defend against Quinshon Judkins.Click here to bet Browns vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Browns vs. Steelers score prediction, picksThe Steelers are 2-2 against the spread on the season and 18-1 straight up against the Browns at home in the Mike Tomlin era.

Maye didn't throw a touchdown pass against the Bills but was still 22-for-30 with 273 passing yards as he continues to improve week over week. New England's defense has been solid all year and should be able to pressure Rattler through a weak Saints offensive line in Week 6.  Rattler did his part by connecting with Rashid Shaheed in New Orleans' upset against New York, and has gone two straight weeks without throwing an interception. While the Saints offense has shown signs of life, the defense is allowing 326.2 total yards per game. It has been particularly inconsistent against the run game, so it's anyone's guess if or how they will be able to contain Rhamondre Stevenson.Click here to bet Patriots vs. Saints at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Patriots vs. Saints score prediction, picksNew England is 3-2-0 ATS on the season and 9-3-0 ATS over their last 12 road games.

Dallas defeated the Jets, 37-22, last week after a wild 40-40 tie with the Packers on Sunday Night Football in Week 4. Dak Prescott is playing at an MVP level, ranking second in the league in passing yards (1,356) and tied for third with 10 passing touchdowns. CeeDee Lamb (ankle) will miss his fourth straight game, but Prescott has still excelled even without the WR1. Meanwhile, the Panthers rank 24th in scoring (20.4 ppg) this season. The model projects the Cowboys to cover the spread in 57% of simulations.Raiders (-4.5) vs. TitansThe Raiders have lost four straight games, but a matchup against the team that had the No. 1 pick in last year's NFL Draft could be the solution for that. The Raiders return to Las Vegas, where they suffered a final-minute loss to the Bears, 25-24, in Week 4 but led the majority of the contest. Both the Raiders and Titans are 1-4 this season, and the Titans are 3-9 under head coach Brian Callahan on the road. The Titans are 31st in scoring (14.6 ppg) and yards (233.8) in Cam Ward's rookie season, and the model expects the Titans to struggle on the road. The model projects the Raiders to cover in 56% of simulations.Bengals vs. Packers: Over 44.5The Bengals traded for Joe Flacco in hopes of salvaging their season and improving the offensive production, and the model projects Flacco to do his part in making that possible. However, with the Packers well-rested off their bye week and coming off a disappointing 40-40 tie against the Cowboys following an embarrassing 13-10 loss to the Browns the week before, the model expects offensive fireworks from Green Bay. The Packers have the No. 9 offense at 26 ppg, and they scored 27 points in each of their home games this season. Meanwhile, the Bengals have the 30th-ranked scoring defense (30.2 ppg) this season. Flacco can help the Bengals create offense, but he can also help the Packers via turnovers, as his six interceptions over four games played a key role in his benching in Cleveland.

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's 2025 postseason will proceed on Sunday with the start of the league championship round. The American League's matchup will pit the Seattle Mariners against the Toronto Blue Jays and will get underway tonight. Over in the National League, which will start on Monday, the Los Angeles Dodgers will take on the Milwaukee Brewers.The respective winners will advance to face each other in the 2025 World Series.As is tradition, CBS Sports brings in the start of every new playoff round by highlighting a plausible X-factor in each series that could make the difference. There is no real definition of an \"X-factor\" beyond it being whatever could play a role in the proceedings. Sometimes, that's a piece of insight gleaned from granular analysis; other times, it's almost glaringly obvious. Keep that in mind, and we'll be doing just fine.Now, let's get to why you clicked in the first place.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    ALCS: Mariners vs. Blue JaysX-factor: Splitter performanceThe Blue Jays had four different pitchers throw at least 25% splitters during their series against the New York Yankees: starters Kevin Gausman (45.3%) and Trey Yesavage (37.2%) and relievers Jeff Hoffman (34.9%) and Seranthony Domínguez (26.9%). It's a small sample size, to be certain, but it's perhaps notable that each of those usage rates were higher than their regular-season marks.That shift made sense. The Yankees slotted into the middle of the pack in performance against splitters during the regular season, posting a .572 OPS. Why is any of this relevant? Because the Mariners were even worse against splitters than the Yankees did, ranking 22nd in OPS (.565). For context: the only playoff team to perform worse against splitters was the Cincinnati Reds.\nSeattle's best hitters, switch-hitting backstop Cal Raleigh and center fielder Julio Rodríguez, were still top performers when they faced a splitter during the regular season, posting OPS above 1.000. Otherwise? Not a single other Mariners batter who was part of their ALDS roster finished with an OPS higher than .670 against splitters. Several important supporting cast members -- including outfielder Randy Arozarena, first baseman Josh Naylor, and infielder/DH Jorge Polanco -- actually finished below .500.There are no guarantees that the Blue Jays will spam the Mariners with splitters, but c'mon, it seems like an obvious strategy. It's on Seattle to adjust and adapt. Otherwise, the Blue Jays would seem to have a clear pathway to success in games started by either Gausman and Yesavage. That may prove to be enough for them to win and advance to the Fall Classic.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    NLCS: Dodgers vs. BrewersX-factor: BullpensWhen it comes to the bullpens, this is a battle of contrasts in terms of quality and quantity. \nDuring the regular season, the Brewers ranked sixth in unit ERA; the Dodgers checked in at 21st. Moreover, FanGraphs tracks this statistic called \"meltdowns,\" which uses Win Probability Added to gauge how much a player contributed to (or subtracted from) their team's win expectancy. Milwaukee's relievers collectively had the 11th-fewest meltdowns in the majors. The Dodgers, conversely, had the second most, behind only the lowly Chicago White Sox. This isn't quite the same Dodgers bullpen now that some of their surplus starters, like Emmet Sheehan and Roki Sasaki, are working in relief. Still, the Brewers would seem to have the edge here.Correspondingly, the Dodgers have taken more steps to prevent their bullpen from being overexposed. They've thrown fewer innings this postseason than the Brewers, with that despite them having played more games. Five of Los Angeles' six starts this postseason have lasted at least six innings. Comparatively, the Brewers haven't had a single pitcher throw six innings in an appearance this month -- not as a starter, not as a reliever. Only Freddy Peralta has exceeded five innings, and he did it once.\nThese are the only two NL teams left standing. Clearly there's more than one way to get through nine innings. But this is going to be an intriguing battle of contrasts: the club with the leaky bullpen that attempts to leverage their great rotation for all it can muster, even if it means turning over the lineup more often than they might like, versus the team that cannot wait to change pitchers and avoid the times-through penalty.How those relievers perform when they are called upon by either side will by and large determine who takes home the pennant.\n            ",

Former Dallas coach Mike McCarthy agrees. Prescott registered seven touchdown passes without an interception over his last two outings.\"He's playing his ass off,\" McCarthy told Pat McAfee about Prescott. \"I don't know what his completion percentage is, but I know it's gonna be well over 70 percent. I just love the way he's distributing the football. And I really like the maturity of the perimeter group, and you've got an offensive line that's got a lot of depth there. So exciting on offense, and I just think he's managing that thing exactly the way it needs to be managed.\"Offensive production has not been an issue for Dallas, but struggling to stop the opposition is the primary reason the Cowboys aren't leading the NFC East ahead of Week 6. \nOver two wins and a tie, Dallas scored 117 points, but the Cowboys gave up 99 points in those games along with 55 in losses to the Eagles and Bears. The Cowboys' scoring defense ranks 29th in the NFL at 30.8 points per game, this coming after the franchise traded away its best player — Micah Parsons — ahead of the opener.Prescott leads the league in passing attempts. The four players ahead of him in completion percentage — Jared Goff, Drake Maye, Sam Darnold and Lamar Jackson — each threw at least 42 fewer passes.\n\"I want to be higher than that [71.3%]. I don't like any incompletions unless it's truly just throwaways, right,\" Prescott said. \"So our standard is high and we make sure we push it each and every day at practice. It's just about going out there and continuing to raise it.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Developing a successful NFL DFS strategy can take many forms, but one of the most common approaches is focusing on games with the highest projected point totals when identifying top NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks.The highest over/under in the NFL odds for the Sunday main slate is 48.5 in the Cowboys vs. Panthers matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include 49ers vs. Buccaneers (over/under of 47.5), Seahawks vs. Jaguars (47.5), and Colts vs. Cardinals (47). Thus, you can expect stars like Dak Prescott, Sam Darnold, Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Taylor to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups. Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Daniel Jones or Baker Mayfield find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites?

In 2025, he has rebounded with one of his most efficient starts in years.Through five weeks, Prescott has 1,356 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and just three interceptions. The 32-year-old has regained his rhythm as the leader of the Cowboys' offense, showcasing improved decision-making and accuracy. His ability to extend plays and deliver under pressure has been a major factor in keeping Dallas competitive early in the season. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Rams running back Kyren Williams ($6,300 on DraftKings and $8,400 on FanDuel), who has an over/under of 16.5 carries. The former fifth-round pick out of Notre Dame burst onto the 2024 season as the Rams' every-down workhorse, carrying the ball 316 times for 1,299 yards and scoring 14 rushing touchdowns, while also adding 34 catches for 182 receiving yards. His volume and versatility marked him as one of L.A.'s most reliable offensive weapons. In 2025, he's off to a another solid start. Through five weeks, he's already logged 82 carries for 368 yards (4.5 yards per carry) with one rushing score, and chipped in as a receiver with 16 catches for 118 yards and three receiving touchdowns. Despite sharing some of the workload with Blake Corum, Williams remains the focal point of the backfield and has even secured a three-year, $33 million contract extension from the Rams. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 6 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        Money-line favorites in the NFL had a rough Week 5, going 7-7 straight-up. Given the uncertainty, hitting on exact NFL score predictions could result in a huge payday of around 100-1. Can the Ravens (+7) avoid a 1-5 start with a win over the Rams at home, even with Lamar Jackson out? And will Kansas City (-2.5) avenge a tough Monday loss with a victory over 4-1 Detroit on Sunday Night Football, in what could be a Super Bowl preview? What should one make of the Monday Night Football two-game slate of Bills vs. Falcons (+4.5) and Bears vs. Commanders (-4.5), with the latter being the teams' first meeting since Washington's Hail Mary victory a year ago? Before making any Week 6 NFL picks, be sure to see the exact NFL score predictions from SportsLine expert Eric Cohen.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:A SportsLine expert and host, Cohen is evaluating the entire Week 6 NFL slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. He finished the 2024-25 season with a 190-95 record on straight-up NFL betting picks (69%) and was profitable for bettors. He's 50-27-1 (65%) on straight-up picks so far this season. Anyone who followed Cohen's NFL predictions has been profitable at their favorite sports betting sites and betting apps. You can only see Cohen's Week 6 NFL exact score predictions at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.Top Week 6 NFL picksAfter diving into all 15 games on the NFL Week 6 schedule, Cohen likes the Buccaneers (-3.5, 47.5) to win and cover at home against the 49ers at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday, even as the Bucs deal with a lengthy injury list that includes Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder), Chris Godwin (fibula) and Mike Evans (hamstring) all out. \"You can parlay a Baker Mayfield MVP-Emeka Egbuka Rookie of the Year ticket at more than 20-1 odds. The way both are playing, I don't hate it. The Buccaneers are in a class by themselves in the NFC South and will be hosting a playoff game come January. I can make an argument for a 13-4 season if all goes well for Tampa Bay. And many props to San Francisco for being 4-1 and winning last Thursday in LA, but this isn't a good spot for them with still plenty of injury concerns to navigate on offense including Brock Purdy (toe) being out and backup Mac Jones (knee, oblique) being questionable. Buccaneers 28, 49ers 21.\" See his other Week 6 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 6 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one team to blow out their opponents by three touchdowns. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 6 NFL game, and underdogs pull upset victories?

Sign up here:How does the Crab Sports promo compare to other sports betting app bonus offers?Crab Sports offers a competitive initial offer for Maryland residents, giving new users the chance to win up to $500 in cash with a successful first bet. Here's how their offer stacks up against the best sportsbook promos from around the industry.SportsbookBonus OfferPromo CodeCrab Sports100% profit boost on first bet up to $500CBSSPORTSDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanDuelBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanatics10 x $100 Bet Match in FanCash CBSFANBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBS20Xbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365Types of welcome promosFanDuel and DraftKings offer bet and get offers where the customer must win the first wager to receive the bonus bets (which expire after seven days). bet365 offers a similar bet and get welcome bonus, but the player will receive their bonus bets regardless of the outcome of their initial wager.BetMGM's offer of a no sweat bet up to $1500 essentially gives the customer a do-over if their first bet loses. However, the no sweat bet is paid in bonus bets, so if that second bet hits, the player will not receive the stake, only the winnings.Crab Sports' introductory offer most resembles Caesars, where a 100% profit boost is available to new customers. The difference is that Caesars offers 20 100% profit boosts (with a max. stake of $25 each) while Crab Sports gives new users one chance to go big up to $500.How to sign up for Crab Sports and claim the promo codeThose looking to sign up for CrabSports and claim this offer can follow these outlined steps:1.   Click on the link in this article to begin the process.2.   Click the SIGNUP button to start registration.3.   Fill in your personal details including name, email, address, and date of birth.4.   The next screen will ask for your address and last four digits of your Social Security number.5.   When prompted on the third screen, enter Crab Sports promo code CBSSPORTS.6.   Configure 2 Factor Authentication.7.   Make your first deposit. You can use the various deposit methods including debit card, credit card, or bank transfer.8.   Place your first wager up to $500 to redeem your 100% profit boost. How to place a bet on Crab SportsPlacing a straight wager is relatively straightforward on Crab Sports, with the user needing to click on the sport, game, and market of their choosing before selecting the dollar amount and placing the bet. For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip, making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where, if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally, two-leg Same Game Parlays are where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app, but in most cases, has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far.

When it comes to props, though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks, which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps, including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately. For eligible games, a Same Game Parlay button appears which must be selected before options are chosen.How to track your bets on Crab SportsOn desktop, the My Selection tab on the right side of the page makes it easy to follow along with your bets. The My Bets tab allows you to view your existing wagers. On the app, the icon of a ticket in the center at the bottom makes it easy for players to make their selections. To track selections on the app, My Bets on the bottom right is the place to click.Crab Sports customer supportIn addition to comprehensive help, rules, and FAQ pages, users with an issue may email support@crabsports.com, with the response time usually within an hour or two. Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        A decent portion of the NFL world believed that Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers would retire this offseason after completing his 21st season at 42-years-old. Longtime coach Mike Tomlin stepped down, and it appeared the franchise would embrace the rebuild it had put off for some time. However, Pittsburgh's trajectory shifted when the Steelers hired Mike McCarthy to be their new coach.The odds are increasing for Rodgers to return to the Steelers in 2026, per NFL Media. He reportedly spoke with McCarthy multiple times, and his top wideout, DK Metcalf, wants Rodgers back, as well. The future Pro Football Hall of Famer is going to take some time to figure out what he wants to do, but at this point, it wouldn't be shocking if Rodgers signed a new deal to return to Pittsburgh. McCarthy and Rodgers spent 13 seasons together with the Green Bay Packers from 2006-18, and won Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Their relationship wasn't always perfect, but McCarthy made it clear in his introductory press conference last month that he would like Rodgers as his quarterback. \n\"Definitely. I don't see why you wouldn't,\" McCarthy told reporters. \"I have spoken to Aaron, and so that's really where we are there. I was able to sit back and watch the games. I watched most of the Pittsburgh games on TV, and I thought he was a great asset for the team.\"In his one season with the Steelers, Rodgers went 10-6 as the starter and threw for 3,322 yards, 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions. The Steelers clinched the AFC North thanks to a thrilling Week 18 victory over the rival Baltimore Ravens, but were quickly ousted from the postseason by the Houston Texans in the wild-card round, 30-6. Rodgers' final passing attempt was a pick six to Calen Bullock. Would he really want his career to end like that?\nRodgers ranks No. 5 on the NFL's all-time passing list with 66,274 yards, and No. 4 in passing touchdowns with 527. If he does decide to retire, Rodgers would do so as one of the best quarterbacks ever. He's a Super Bowl champion, a 10-time Pro Bowler and four-time NFL MVP.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl brings the most betting opportunities of any sporting event each year, and Super Bowl 60 between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is no different. One of the popular Super Bowl props is the MVP award, which is handed out after the game. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite (risk $100 to win $120) in the Super Bowl 60 odds at DraftKings, while Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is +240. While quarterbacks are the most likely winners, three of the last 10 winners have come from non-quarterback positions. Jaxon Smith-Njigba (+500) and Kenneth Walker III (+850) are next on the NFL odds board. It's been a decade since a defensive player (Von Miller, Broncos) won Super Bowl MVP, but Patriots cornerback Marcus Jones has the shortest odds (+6000) to be named MVP at Super Bowl LX.  There are plenty of longshot betting opportunities for other players in Patriots vs. Seahawks. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White went 718-623-37 on NFL against-the-spread picks from 2017-24, returning more than $3,200 to $100 players as SportsLine's No. 1 NFL expert in ATS picks. He's also gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, and now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 MVP picks.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl MVP picksBest bet: Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (+120)Best longshot value: Patriots WR Mack Hollins (+18000)Defensive longshot: Seahawks LB DeMarcus Lawrence (+9000)Sam Darnold, Seahawks (+120)\"When it comes to taking a player to win Super Bowl MVP, the safest play is to back a quarterback,\" White said. \"Fourteen of the last 19 Super Bowl MVPs have been quarterbacks, with the position winning the award 34 times overall versus eight times for receivers, seven times for running backs and 10 times for any defensive player. With the Seahawks being huge favorites on the money line, taking Darnold to win Super Bowl MVP presents the best value on the board by getting plus odds for them winning and the award going to the most likely candidate.\"Mack Hollins, Patriots (+18000)\"The Patriots have been criticized for playing an easy schedule this year, but when the tougher opponents have shown up, Hollins has tended to be more involved in the offense,\" White said. \"After a quiet first seven weeks, he caught all seven of his targets for 89 yards in Week 8 against a Browns defense that held Stefon Diggs to 14 yards. He delivered a season-best 106 yards on 10 targets in Week 10 in a close game against the Buccaneers, again outperforming Diggs by a wide margin. He had just 41 yards in Week 15 against the Bills but saw a team-high eight targets in the game while Diggs had four, and then the next week Hollins racked up 69 yards on nine targets in a comeback win over the Ravens, with Diggs leading the team in all receiving categories in that one. Hollins went to IR after that game and returned for the AFC Championship, where he recorded catches of 31 and 20 yards in a game where Maye threw for just 86 yards total.\"Hollins definitely doesn't deserve to be among the favorites for the award, but he should be much closer to Stefon Diggs (+5500) considering how much Maye leans on the secondary receiver in big games. And when compared to the other players ahead of Hollins in odds, including guys like Jake Bobo and George Holani who may not make any impact on the box score for Seattle as well as both backup QBs and a number of defensive players, Hollins stands out as the best value pick on the board.\"DeMarcus Lawrence, Seahawks (+9000)\"There hasn't been a defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP since Von Miller 10 years ago, but it happens more than you think and doesn't necessarily have to be the best defender on the team, with Malcolm Smith and Dexter Jackson taking home the award this century as well,\" White said. \"While that brings super longshots like Jaylinn Hawkins (+25000) and Drake Thomas (+25000) into play, my favorite defensive pick is Lawrence. He'll be up against a Patriots offensive line that has struggled to protect Maye during the playoffs, and the quarterback has had a massive issue hanging onto the ball.\"Lawrence has a sack and forced fumble in three of his last four games, and he's recorded at least one QB hit in 13 of the last 14 games. With the veteran playing in his first Super Bowl after more than a decade with the Cowboys, he could continue his recent fine form, and if he can score a touchdown after recovering a fumble, which he did twice against the Cardinals earlier this year, he could be in contention for this award in a lower-scoring game. I'd put Lawrence at least as the co-favorite among Seahawks defenders, but he's slotted behind Ernest Jones and Nick Emmanwori, so he's my favorite value among the defenders.\"Want more Super Bowl 60 picks?Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif, the home of the 49ers, where the Seahawks are 9-4 all-time. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5.

The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye who is +240 in the Super Bowl MVP odds, is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained.

Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most exciting annual sports days on the calendar, and millions of Americans watch football for the touchdowns. With online sports betting becoming legalized in more states, anytime touchdown scorer bets have become among the most popular bets you can make on any NFL Sunday, especially for Super Bowl Sunday. The 2026 Super Bowl features the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET, and Seattle and New England both had top-10 scoring offenses, which could lead to plenty of potential winning Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown scorer bets. Seattle's over/under for total team points is 25.5, while New England's is 20.5. The Seahawks are favored by 4.5 points, and the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. The SportsLine Projection Model has simulated Super Bowl 60 10,000 times, and found multiple players with value to cash 2026 Super Bowl anytime TD scorer bets. One of the model's top picks is Seahawks star wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who has scored a touchdown in each of Seattle's first two playoff games. \nThe model projects that to continue, locking in Smith-Njigba as one of its best bets for Super Bowl 2026 anytime touchdown scorer picks. The model is also backing a pair of Patriots, projecting value in both New England running back Rhamondre Stevenson and wide receiver Kayshon Boutte to score in Super Bowl 60. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Super Bowl betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings, the SportsLine Projection Model can help you find value to add to your 2026 Super Bowl picks. Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown picks:Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (-110)Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+140)Kayshon Boutte, Patriots (+330)\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (-110)\nThe third-year receiver is staking his claim as the best wideout in the NFL. He led the league with 1,793 receiving yards this season, while finishing fourth in receptions (119) and tied for sixth with 10 touchdowns. Smith-Njigba was nearly unstoppable against the Rams last week, posting 10 receptions for 153 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets. He's scored in both playoff games, as, despite teams knowing he's going to be the focal point of the offense, Seattle still finds ways to scheme him open while other teams can't stop him, even with multiple defenders. The model projects the 23-year-old to score in 65% of simulations, compared to his implied probability of 52.4%.Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+140)\nThe 27-year-old running back appeared to be being pushed out of the top spot in the backfield toward the end of the regular season, with rookie TreVeyon Henderson playing more snaps as the season progressed, but New England has made it clear which back it trusts more for the postseason run. Stevenson outsnapped Henderson 60-4 last week, with the veteran playing 94% of snaps against the Broncos. Stevenson has played at least 62% of snaps in all three playoff games, with Henderson's snaps never totaling more than 41%. Stevenson had at least one rushing touchdown in each of New England's final three regular-season games, and the model projects him to score in 53% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 41.7%.Kayshon Boutte, Patriots (+330)\nBoutte leads the Patriots with 147 receiving yards this postseason, and he's one of four New England pass catchers with a touchdown during the playoffs (no Patriot has more than one). He is second behind Stefon Diggs in receptions (eight) and targets (15), yet he's only third among Patriots pass catchers in anytime touchdown odds and eighth for all players at DraftKings. During the regular season, he was second on the Patriots in touchdown receptions (six), which doubled his touchdown total over the first two years of his career. The model projects him to score in 31% of simulations, which shows strong value for a player priced at more than 3-1 odds. Want more Super Bowl NFL picks? You've seen the best model Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown picks.

    "body": "\nWhether you've made Super Bowl DFS picks before, or this will be your first time playing NFL daily Fantasy for The Big Game, you're aware that someone will come out of nowhere to make a major impact. Thus, NFL DFS lineups should comprise more than just big names like Sam Darnold, Drake Maye, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Hunter Henry. The Championship Round saw Jake Bobo find the end zone for Seattle and Mack Hollins lead New England in receiving, so those could be the type of underrated options for your daily Fantasy football strategy and Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineups.Who should you target from the Super Bowl DFS player pool, and who are the sleepers your NFL DFS strategy should consider to help differentiate your lineups when kickoff comes at 6:30 p.m. ET? Before making any NFL DFS picks or locking in Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Super Bowl LX, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.\nThe DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Super Bowl LX and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.Top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of the optimizer's top Super Bowl DFS value picks is Seahawks receiver Rashid Shaheed. After a slow start to his Seattle tenure, Shaheed has come on strong as of late. Over his last seven games, he has at least 50 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five contests. Also, New England is vulnerable to wide receivers finding the endzone against it as just five teams allowed more wideout touchdowns in the regular season than the Patriots. The Pats also gave up a punt return touchdown in 2025, adding to the DFS value Shaheed, who has three return scores this regular plus postseason. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Shaheed to go Over 22.5 total receiving yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Patriots quarterback Maye. While Seattle has the No. 6 total defense, Maye is the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason. So, he won't be intimidated by Seattle's unit, and it was one which was just shredded by Matthew Stafford. In the NFC Title Game, the Seahawks allowed its most passing touchdowns (3) of the year, it's second-highest passer rating (126.5) and its third-most passing yards (370). Add in that Maye has 65-plus rushing yards in two of three postseason games, and he's poised to produce, Fantasy-wise, on Super Bowl Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Maye to go Over 264.5 passing plus rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers in the 2026 Super Bowl. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Super Bowl Sunday, and which under-the-radar Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tight end Travis Kelce is now a free agent, as he has played out the two-year extension signed in 2024. Many believe the Kansas City Chiefs star will retire in the coming weeks, but that may not be the case.Kelce has not made a decision on his future, and has been in touch with the Chiefs about a potential return, per NFL.com. The Chiefs want him back, and the two sides reportedly plan to meet after the Super Bowl to discuss the future. It's fair to expect a resolution quickly. Kelce said in November he wanted to give the franchise that selected him in the third round back in 2013 adequate notice whether he would play in 2026 or not. He does not want to hold the team hostage as the Chiefs turn their attention to offseason tasks.\"I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not -- or whether they want me back or not,\" Kelce said, via ESPN. \"I'd like to make that decision before they've got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately...\"\nIn his 13th NFL season, Kelce caught 76 passes for 851 yards and five touchdowns. Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said during a Good Morning Football interview last month he has \"no doubt\" Kelce can still play, and that the franchise is not ready for him to retire and enter his next stage of life.\"As an organization, we certainly hope that he will come back,\" Hunt said. \"He had another great year, maybe not on par with where he was four or five years ago, but still had over 800 yards, and was really one of the leaders on the offensive side of the ball for us. So there's no doubt in my mind that he can still play. We're trying to be respectful and let him have the time that he needs to make a decision.\"He has sort of a busy offseason coming up with his engagement and marriage, so we want to be respectful and give him the time he needs to make a decision. But we certainly hope that he'll be back.\"\nKelce also may have hinted where he's leaning during an episode of \"The New Heights\" Podcast, as he revealed that he's excited about the return of Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy. \"I can't wait to see him back in the building,\" Kelce said. \"He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.\"Kelce is without a doubt one of the best tight ends in NFL history, and a future Pro Football Hall of Famer. He ranks third all-time in receptions (1,080), receiving yards (13,002) and fifth in receiving touchdowns (82) at his position, and is the Chiefs' all-time leader in each of those categories. Kelce is also a postseason legend, as no player has caught more passes than him in the playoffs (178 receptions). His 2,078 yards receiving in the postseason rank second behind Jerry Rice, as do his 20 receiving touchdowns.\n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but who are the daily Fantasy sleeper picks who can create salary cap space to build a winning roster? Every Big Game sees a player come out of nowhere to make both real-life and Fantasy impacts. So, before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The chaos came in the fight for the final No. 1 seed after Illinois fell 85-82 in overtime at Michigan State.The Illini did no significant harm to their resume by falling in a tight Big Ten road game against the No. 10 Spartans, but they are back on the No. 2 line as the revolving door for the final spot on the top line continued.Rising to take their place is Houston, which stated its case during a 77-66 road win over No. 16 BYU late Saturday night. It's the Cougars' best true road win of the season, and it improved their Quad 1 record to 6-2. But the race for the final No. 1 seed remains tight, with UConn, Iowa State and Illinois squarely in the hunt.

Arizona extended its lead in the race to be No. 1 overall with a 37-point beatdown of Oklahoma State. In addition to being the only unbeaten high-major team remaining, the Wildcats now also rank No. 1 in Wins Above Bubble (WAB) and are also first in the NET and at KenPom. Massive challenges are coming, starting on Monday night at Kansas, but the Wildcats are entering the fray on solid ground.\nIndiana makes big jumpIndiana climbed comfortably into the field following its overtime win against Wisconsin. Oklahoma State took one on the chin against Arizona -- as mentioned above -- but the Cowboys haven't gotten the boot just yet. That's partially because Seton Hall and New Mexico both lost Saturday after entering among the \"First Four Out\" and also because Ohio State didn't play Saturday. But if the Buckeyes topple No. 2 Michigan on Sunday, our model projects they will enter the field.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the number of players moving in the transfer portal every year, college football careers have never been more inconsistent. Players that seemed to be the future of a program one year can rapidly fall off the map when their situation changes. But just as rapidly as they fall off, elite talents can return to the table and make major impacts. Miami's Carson Beck, for example, shook off a frustrating finish at Georgia to lead the Hurricanes to the national title game. South Florida quarterback Byrum Brown also came back from an injury to help coach Alex Golesh earn the Auburn job. In 2026, another group of second-chance players will get the opportunity to reestablish themselves. Here are 10 players most poised for bounce-back years in 2026, including a few ready to start over at new destinations. \n        \n            \n                Every way-too-early top 25 team's most pivotal game in 2026: Texas, Oklahoma face huge early tests\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Nic Anderson, WR, KentuckyNic Anderson missed the 2024 season with injuries at Oklahoma before a frustrating junior season at LSU. Injuries have always been his greatest hindrance, but Kentucky could be the perfect place to settle down. First-year coach Will Stein built some of the best offenses in the sport at Oregon and should give Anderson plenty of opportunities to stretch the field for the intriguing Wildcats. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boo Carter, DB, ColoradoBoo Carter's 2025 started with transfer rumors and ended with getting dismissed from Tennessee. The former blue-chip recruit starred as a freshman with the Vols, but now embarks on a new adventure at Colorado. The Buffaloes brought in an impressive defensive class for defensive coordinator Robert Livingstone, and Carter can become a centerpiece. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Xavier Chaplin, OL, Florida StateBefore landing at Auburn, Xavier Chaplin started 25 games at Virginia Tech and emerged as a standout. Like many others, his Auburn career was inconsistent at best, but he has a chance for a fresh start in Tallahassee. The Seminoles have been looking for consistency along the offensive line, and betting on Chaplin's experience is a smart move. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Makhi Hughes, RB, HoustonMakhi Hughes was one of the weirder on-field stories of 2025, going from 2,849 yards and 22 touchdowns in two years at Tulane to 17 total carries at Oregon. In 2026, he reunites with former Green Wave coach Willie Fritz at Houston and has the chance to completely reshape the Cougars' offense. Hughes posted 40 carries for 199 yards in two regular-season Power Four games in 2024 before leaving for the Ducks. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jehiem Oatis, DL, Ole MissJehiem Oatis was billed as the centerpiece of Colorado's defensive surge in 2025. At 6-foot-5 and 328 pounds, the former Alabama standout was the kind of body that the Buffaloes had not fielded in years. Instead, he again fell out of favor at Colorado before entering the transfer portal. Ole Miss has done a great job of integrating defensive transfers over the years, and Oatis could be the next success story. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    DJ Lagway, QB, BaylorDJ Lagway was billed as one of the top quarterbacks in the sport last season, but floundered, recording 16 touchdowns to 14 interceptions as coach Billy Napier was fired. Now, he joins a vastly more quarterback friendly situation under offensive coordinator Jake Spavital. Last season, the Bears ranked No. 4 nationally in passing offense. Baylor has to find some new playmakers at receiver, but Lagway should instantly step in as one of the most productive passers in the Big 12. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    LaNorris Sellers, QB, South CarolinaSouth Carolina's offense was a total disaster in LaNorris Sellers' second year as starter as the Gamecocks went from nine wins to 4-8. Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer wasted no time, bringing in offensive coordinator Kendal Briles and a handful of new skill talents to complement Sellers. The infusion of talent should help take Sellers back to his best. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Evan Stewart, WR, OregonEvan Stewart's apparent final season was derailed before it started when he suffered a torn patellar tendon that kept him out the entire 2025 season. With Dante Moore back for his senior season, Stewart should emerge as one of the top receivers in the sport. On an offense that spreads the ball around, Stewart posted 48 catches for 613 yards and five touchdowns in 2024. Expect more targets heading forward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jahiem White, RB, North TexasJahiem White was billed as the potential centerpiece of Rich Rodriguez's offense at West Virginia, a dynamic, all-purpose sparkplug. Unfortunately, injuries ended his effort before it got started. At North Texas, White reunites with former coach Neal Brown and running backs coach Chad Scott. He could instantly become one of the most electric athletes in the American Conference. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ryan Williams, WR, AlabamaRyan Williams was the most disappointing player of 2025 by a fairly wide margin. After earning numerous preseason All-America honors, Williams finished in a distant second in receptions and receiving yards on his own team. With fellow top receivers Germie Bernard and Isaiah Horton gone, Williams will be asked to take a step towards superstardom. The talent is there; is the production? \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The new Major League Soccer season kicks off in only 10 days with St. Louis City SC and Charlotte FC ringing in things on Saturday, Feb. 21. With the season around the corner, it's time to address the biggest issue of the off season. How are all the new threads that teams are wearing going to stack up? Due to MLS having a two-year cycle for jerseys, each team has either has released a home or away jersey ahead of this season, which means that they have to be ranked, because what else does one do when given new jerseys? From music to historically designed kits, there's a lot to like in here, including the fact that not a single team released something that could be considered a plain white shirt with a logo. Don't worry, there are plain shirts of other colors with logos, with that out of the way, let's get ranking.30. Nashville SC - The Reverb Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            You can almost swap this with the next team on our list, Miami, without issue. The yellow is a nice color, but it also seems like a training shirt and could've used something else, anything else, to spruce it up.29. Inter Miami - Presagio\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Is this a training top with an ad? Miami have great colors to work with, and this is what we got? It'll be everywhere with Lionel Messi's number 10 on it, but opening a new stadium this season, it would've been nice to see a bigger, bolder swing. \n28. St. Louis City SC - The Tina Turner Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            St. Louis did nail the design of this, looking like a flowing dress that the \"Queen of Rock\" would wear, but it's also odd as a soccer jersey. We've seen plenty of musical tributes around the league, and this one misses the mark.27. Houston Dynamo - Mission Control\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            The concept of this being a satellite image of Houston is cool and unique, but how this works with their colors on the pitch will be interesting to see. This is one that could grow on you with time, but it's not catching me right now.26. San Jose Earthquakes -  The Dead Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            In what may be the most polarizing kit in the league, you're either going to love or hate this with no in between. San Jose know their target audience here, honoring the Grateful Dead.\n25. Columbus Crew - The Crafted for Excellence kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            This is better than a standard yellow shirt, thanks to the collar, but there was room to do more.24. San Diego FC - Unprecedented Unity Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            I can't get past the fact that this looks a bit like an oil spill on a marble countertop. San Diego has such a good team, and they deserve a kit to match.23. New England Revolution - Independence Day \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            One of two America 250-themed jerseys on this list, the utilization of the badge to represent fireworks is cool, but also kind of clunky.\n22. Atlanta United - Spirit of 96 \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            The colors on this jersey are excellent, and it's cool to get the nod to the Olympic Games in the jersey, but when it comes to everything working together, the off-center sash makes things wonky for me. Central or leaning heavier into the green would've been excellent. 21. CF Montreal - The Procure Jersey\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            It's almost there, but it feels like CF Montreal are missing something here. I like the digital look, but they could've leaned further in. Instead the kid ends up giving the impression that the printer was running out of ink during printing.20. FC Cincinnati - The Seven Hills Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            You get what Cincinatti are trying to do here, and the orange may end up growing on me, but it feels a bit cluttered. Credit for trying something outside the box. \n19. Colorado Rapids - Colorful Colorado \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Uh, I'm not sure where the colors went in this one. It's clean, and the trim does add to the jersey, making it a nice look, but there's so much that can be done with the burgundy that the Rapids sport.18. DC United - The Black and Red Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Technically, there's red in there. It's fine, but this is another team with a standard shirt that's saved by a nice detail in the trim.17. Chicago Fire - Forever Red \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            You always know what you're going to get in Chicago's looks. The iconic red with a white stripe is instantly recognizable, and collars are always a nice touch. There's a thin line between classic and boring, but Chicago are on the right side of it. Just.\n16. Orlando City SC - Sunken Treasure Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            This is a tough one, while I think the purple elements are great, it doesn't feel like there's enough contrast in the shades of yellow, making the details hard to make out but it could seem different in person or on the pitch. 15. Austin FC - The Rooted Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Mint green is becoming a good look for Austin, as this is a clean jersey. The black of the Adidas stripes seems a little out of place here, but for working with a unique color, Austin have created something recognizable even when they don't use their primary colors, which is impressive. 14. LA Galaxy - The VeloCITY kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            The Galaxy are an iconic brand in American soccer, so it makes sense that their home kit will reflect that. It's not a bad thing that it only reaches the top half of the new releases; that's a credit to improvement around the board.\n13. Minnesota United - The Decade Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Minnesota are another club that does jerseys well. This is a great way to add a sash without it taking over a jersey, and the slight color elements are excellent. 12. Red Bull New York - The Rooted Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Going back to black but spicing it up in a nice way, this is a great way to usher in the Michael Bradley era at the club as he takes over at manager.11. New York City FC - The All Nations Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Fitting design undertones in without making a shirt too busy can be tough, but the way NYCFC executed this is great. It's also the club's way of honoring the five boroughs ahead of the World Cup.\n10. Charlotte FC - Carolina Kit: Crowns Up\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            An excellent one, as simplicity is better with this stellar shade of blue. The crowns integrated into the sleeves and the collar are a nice touch in an all-around great look. 9. Seattle Sounders - The Evergreen kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Mostly monotone jerseys can be great -- it's all about the detail, and that's something that Seattle nail. The slight texture in their iconic green also helps the logo pop, which is a nice touch. The ultimate if it ain't broke, don't fix it look.8. Portland Timbers - Civic Stadium Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            A lovely shade of green rarely seen in MLS, the Timbers are honoring the 100th anniversary of Providence Park in this look. The arches are a nice touch in a kit that will age well.\n7. FC Dallas - DNA Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            The name nails it. Dallas do a great job of giving an iconic look a fresh feel, and it's a nice touch putting some space between the hoops. This will look great on and off the pitch. 6. Real Salt Lake - The Switchback\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            More hoops is always a good thing. Real Salt Lake have great colors, and this kit uses them well. The detail of the mountains is a nice touch in what is an all-around great look.5. Vancouver - The Coastal Jersey\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            On one hand, this is a simple look that may be a bit understated, but the mountains around the collar and cuffs are such a nice touch, while even the sponsor looks like it belongs. A jersey doesn't always have to be busy to be great.\n4. Toronto FC - Winter Kit\n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Refreshed roster and a refreshed kit to match. This is a clean look and immediately identifiable as Toronto's. The six stripes are also a nice touch to represent local communities. 3. Philadelphia Union - 1776 Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Looking to honor Philadelphia's place in America's history, the Union hit all the right notes here with elements of the team and city mixed throughout their unique jersey. It may be a little strange to keep this as a home look for two years, but right now as part of America's 250th birthday, Ben Franklin a solid look.2. Los Angeles FC - 2026 Primary Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            When your primary colors are black and gold, making a stunning kit is easier than some teams have it but the attention to detail is where LAFC nail it by weaving the gold into the jersey while still giving it a striking appearance.1. Sporting Kansas City - The 18th & Vine Kit \n                                                                    MLS\n                                                            Sporting with another banger. The jersey honors their jazz district, and you can pick up the vibe just from looking at it. Excellent work all around in a shirt that will age well with time. \n            ",

Holliday, who suffered the injury during batting practice last week, will undergo surgery on Thursday. The Orioles have not stated an official timeline for Holliday's recovery, but Elias said it'll be \"measured in weeks\" after Opening Day. Holliday is one of several notable players to suffer hamate injuries recently. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor is expected to miss about six weeks after suffering his own hamate injury, but is expected to be ready for Opening Day, and Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll will miss the World Baseball Classic after requiring his own surgery on Wednesday. His own Opening Day status is unclear.For whatever it's worth, Baseball Prospectus' database estimates players who have undergone hamate surgery in the past have missed about seven weeks on average. Every injury and recovery are unique in their own ways, but Opening Day 2026 is roughly six weeks off. If Holliday's recovery follows that precedent and proceeds without setback, he should be able to return relatively early in the year.Holliday, 22, is a former top prospect and the No. 1 pick in the 2022 Draft. Last season, his first full campaign in the majors, he hit .242/.314/.375 (95 OPS+) with 17 home runs and 17 stolen bases (albeit on 28 attempts). His contributions were worth an estimated 1 Win Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nDuring Holliday's absence, the Orioles could slot recent acquisition Blaze Alexander in at the keystone. It should be noted that Alexander was added before Holliday suffered his injury, making that move look more prescient. Alexander, 26, hit .230/.323/.383 (95 OPS+) with seven home runs and four stolen bases in 74 games. His contributions were worth an estimated 1.7 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler, the top-ranked golfer in the world, will seek his second win of the season when he takes part in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He enters as the odds-on favorite at +300. Scheffler earned his first win of the season on Jan. 25 at The Desert Classic. The 29-year-old American has 20 career wins since turning pro in 2020, when he earned Rookie of the Year honors. This year's Pebble Beach Pro-Am gets underway at 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday from Pebble Beach Golf Links at Pebble Beach, Calif. The tournament will be played on a par-72 course measuring 6,989 yards. Besides Scheffler, other favorites include Rory McIlroy (+1300), Si Woo Kim (+2200), Xander Schauffele (+2500), Tommy Fleetwood (+2500) and Viktor Hovland (+2700). McIlroy, the defending champion of the event, is making his season debut.

    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1300 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300) in a loaded 2026 Pebble Beach field with the first tee times coming at 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday.Other Pebble Beach contenders include Si Woo Kim at +2200, Tommy Fleetwood and Xander Schauffele at +2500 and the players who went to a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- among the golfers at +3000. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Kim (+2200). Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting a massive +5000 sleeper who brings huge value in outright bets. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which massive longshot will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am marks the first Signature Event of the season, with several of the world's best competing at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Northern California. Scottie Scheffler is the +300 favorite, per the latest PGA odds, while other contenders include defending champion Rory McIlroy (+1300), Xander Schauffele (+2500), Justin Rose (+2700) and Hideki Matsuyama (+3000). Outside of making PGA bets on the outright winner, you could create a 2026 Pebble Beach parlay featuring finishing positions, head-to-head outcomes and many other golf props.Ryan Gerard may not be the first name you think of when constructing a PGA longshot parlay, but the UNC alum has three runners-up over his last four starts. He's at +1000 to simply notch a top-5 at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am 2026 and at +5500 to win his second PGA event. That could be a standalone golf bet or part of a lucrative golf parlay for Pebble Beach 2026. Before making any 2026 Pebble Beach   picks or golf parlays, you need to see this PGA Tour parlay from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Pebble Beach   field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times. It has locked in betting picks to form a 5-leg golf parlay that pays out over $40,000 for a $10 bettor. See the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top 2026 Pebble Beach parlay, PGA Tour picksFor the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am   2026, one of the picks featured in the model's 5-leg PGA Tour parlay is McIlroy finishing as the Top European at +370. The defending event winner, McIlroy won at Pebble Beach with a score of 21-under-par last year, and that score to par is the lowest ever in the history of this tournament at this specific course. He broke par in all four rounds as that was his first of three victories in 2025. The Irishman is teeing off at his first PGA Tour event of this year, but he did place third in a European Tour event last month.\nThat event had many of the fellow Europeans he will be competing against at Pebble Beach, and McIlroy's game is well-suited for what's the second-shortest course in use for the 2026 PGA Tour season. McIlroy was second in driving distance last season as his length off the tee will well position him for easier chips. Then once he gets on the green, McIlroy is coming off a year in which he ranked in the top 10 in putting average and strokes gained: putting. Thus, his strengths are magnified at a short course like Pebble Beach, making this +370 golf prop one that's worth investing in. See the rest of the PGA Tour parlay legs here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make PGA Tour parlay picks The model has also picked an outright winner, plus a prop that returns nearly +1000 among its five PGA Tour picks for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am     parlay that pays over $40,000 on just a $10 bet. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.\nSo, who will win Pebble Beach 2026, and what combination of PGA Tour props could unlock a $40,000 payday on just a $10 bet?

Few teams have leaned over more often than the Warriors, who have seen the Over hit in 57.4% of their games, which is the third-highest percentage in the league. As for the Spurs, they've engaged in nothing but high-scoring affairs over the last week. Each of San Antonio's last four games have eclipsed the total.These teams have met four times since the start of 2025, and those contests have averaged 235.3 combined points. Each of the four also had totals of at least 231.5 points, so the O/U for this game being much lower gives it an ever greater likelihood of the total being surpassed. Seven players for each team are projected to score more than 9 points, with six total players having at least 15 points.

    "body": "\n        There is no shortage of player prop options on Wednesday, with 28 of the 30 NBA teams in action ahead of the upcoming NBA All-Star Weekend. Many of the league's biggest stars will be in action knowing they'll have a few days off to recover, but the sportsbooks clearly know that as well. That has resulted in some of the stars' NBA player prop totals rising to numbers the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't agree with, as the model is backing a pair of the NBA's biggest stars to go Under some of their NBA prop totals. The model is backing Nuggets center Nikola Jokic to go Under 10.5 assists, as he has in five of his last seven games, and Timberwolves superstar guard Anthony Edwards to go Under 29.5 points against the Trail Blazers as part of its top Wednesday NBA player prop picks.The model is also backing Warriors guard Brandin Podziemski to go Over 13.5 points in a matchup against the Spurs for Wednesday NBA prop bets, as Golden State continues to play without Stephen Curry (knee). Bet NBA props with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $100 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins:Targeting NBA player props will be a popular way to approach Wednesday's NBA betting at online sports betting sites.

He had 11 assists against the Cavaliers on Monday to just barely go Over this total, and even in that being a two-point game, the Nuggets limited him to 33 minutes as he returns from a knee injury and is now battling a sprained ankle that has him listed as probable on the injury report. Jokic leads the NBA at 10.7 assists per game, but much of that is due to his play before the injury, when he was also averaging more minutes. The 30-year-old has played more than 33 minutes just once over his six games since returning from injury, and given the Nuggets are 13.5-point favorites against the Grizzlies on Wednesday, they may use this game as a chance to rest him even more. The model projects Jokic for nine assists on Wednesday. DraftKings offers the best odds at -128 for Jokic Under 10.5 assists, with other betting apps either listing a higher price or lowering his total to 9.5 assists. Bet on Jokic with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users a $300 in bonus bets if your first wager of $5 or more wins:\nAnthony Edwards, Timberwolves, Under 29.5 points (-121)Edwards is averaging 31.4 points per game in five contests in February, but he's scored more than 30 points just once over his last four games, so even when he's gone Over this total lately, it hasn't come easily. Edwards went Under this total in two of three games against Portland last season, and went Under in two of four games against the Trail Blazers the year before, averaging 24.3 ppg in those four contests. Portland has won three straight games, and the model projects the Trail Blazers to find success containing Edwards again on Wednesday, projecting him for 27.1 points. The majority of sportsbooks have dropped Edwards' total to 28.5 points, but DraftKings still has his total at 29.5 points, making this the best place to place this bet.Bet on Edwards with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users a $300 in bonus bets if your first wager of $5 or more wins:Brandin Podziemski, Warriors, Over 13.5 pointsHe's scored 16 points and 14 points over his last two games with Stephen Curry (knee) out, and the superstar guard is out again on Wednesday, which should create more scoring opportunities for Podziemski. The 22-year-old has often been one of the key scorers Golden State turns to with Curry out. The Warriors host the Spurs, who could have tired legs in the second half of their back-to-back after playing the Lakers on Tuesday.

In their final preliminary game, the Americans completely dismantled the Canadians, their heated rivals, 5-0.Taking on a Canadian team that was without superstar Marie-Philip Poulin due to an injury, Team USA controlled the game from start to finish. The Americans' speed simply overwhelmed the Canadians on the forecheck, and these matchups are rarely this lopsided.Driving the bus en route to a statement win -- once again -- was defender Caroline Harvey. She registered her second consecutive three-point game with a goal and two assists, but Harvey wasn't alone in her heroics. Linemates Abbey Murphy and Hannah Bilka gave Canada headaches for three periods, and they combined for two goals.Their first tally was a beauty with Murphy showing off her blazing speed to reach a loose puck before sliding a no-look pass to Bilka in the slot. Bilka finished with two goals, and Murphy totaled three assists.\nTeam USA capped off a perfect 4-0-0-0 run in the preliminary round, and it's now in the driver's seat to win the gold medal. Even with Canada down Poulin, this was a thoroughly impressive victory for the Americans, who want to reclaim their spot atop women's hockey.The Americans will now set their sights on a quarterfinal matchup against host nation Italy, which is slated for Friday afternoon.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalUSA vs. Italy | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        WNBA star Angel Reese will return to Unrivaled and join Rose BC on Feb. 20, the league announced Wednesday. Reese, who played for Rose BC in Unrivaled's inaugural season, was not expected to participate this season. Her return, though late in the campaign, is a major boost for the upstart league given her popularity. Reese averaged 13.3 points, a league-leading 12.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists on 46.9% shooting last season, and was named Unrivaled Defensive Player of the Year. While she helped Rose BC finish second in the standings with an 8-6 record, she was unable to suit up in the playoffs due to a hand injury. Rose BC defeated Lace BC and Vinyl BC to win the league's inaugural championship. \"Double-double machine. She's somebody who has a knack for rebounding and just goes after it,\" Reese's Rose BC teammate Chelsea Gray told ESPN last year. \"It's really hard to do that consistently. It's a lot on your body. It's a mindset that you have to have, and it's one she's had this whole time.\"Rose BC's new-look roster has not had as much success without Reese this season. They sit in fifth place at 5-6, with three games remaining, and must finish in the top six in order to make the playoffs again. Recently, Rose BC traded Azurá Stevens to Hive BC as part of a four-team trade. The deal opened up a roster spot for Rose BC to bring in Reese for a playoff push. Here' a look at Rose BC's remaining schedule:\nFeb. 20 vs. Hive BC, 8:45 p.m. ET -- TNT / truTV / HBO MaxFeb. 22 vs. Laces BC, 8:45 p.m. ET -- TNT / truTV / HBO MaxFeb. 27 vs. Phantom BC, 1 p.m. ET -- truTV / HBO MaxThe single-elimination Unrivaled playoffs are set to begin on Feb. 28. Reese had a frustrating close to the 2025 WNBA season, as she dealt with a back injury and suspensions from both the league (too many technical fouls) and the Chicago Sky (publicly criticizing her teammates in a controversial interview). At a Team USA training camp in December, she said she plans to return to the Sky in 2026. During a recent episode of her podcast, Reese said that she missed the \"development\" aspect of Unrivaled. \"I can try stuff, I can do whatever, and I can take it and implement it to the W,\" Reese said. \nThe 2026 WNBA season is scheduled to tip off on May 8, but the campaign remains in jeopardy as the league and the Women's National Basketball Players Association continue to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. \n            ",

Last year's inaugural event was a major success, filled with intense action and a number of upsets. This year's edition figures to be no different. The 28 players have been separated by position into four, eight-player pods to create the bracket -- though due to last-minute withdrawals, two of the guard pods only have six players. They will compete in single-elimination matchups all the way until Saturday night's championship, which will be a best-of-three series. All games through the semifinals will be played to 11 points, by 2s and 3s, or to 10 minutes, whichever comes first. The championship series games will be played to eight points, by 2s and 3s, or 10 minutes, whichever comes first. All games are make-it, take-it, with a seven-second shot clock. The winner will take home $200,000, the runner-up will receive $50,000 and the two semifinalists who are eliminated in that round will get $25,000. Napheesa Collier, who co-founded Unrivaled with Breanna Stewart, won last year's tournament, but she is unable to defend her crown after undergoing surgery on both ankles last month. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Unrivaled 1-on-1 tournament: Bracket, rules, schedule and how to watch\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAhead of Wednesday, CBS Sports spoke with Stewart and Kelsey Plum about the highly-anticipated event.

And we wanted to bring 1-on-1 into that so that you can really showcase your skills and go against all the other best players here and have a monetary prize behind it. I think that's something that's motivating for everyone. Once you step on that court, everyone's going after it. \nCBS Sports: How pleased are you that the event is back for a second year?Stewart: I'm really happy. Shoutout to our partners, shoutout to Sprite for being back with us and making that pot money $300,000. I think that's eye-popping for everybody and everybody really wants to go and get it. I think it will be cool this time because all the games will be at night for the first round, so that buzz and that hype will grow as the night goes on. CBS Sports: Kelsey, you didn't play in Unrivaled last year, so this is your first time participating, and Breanna, things obviously didn't go to plan for you last year. (Stewart was stunned in the first round, 11-0, by Aaliyah Edwards.) How are you feeling going into the tournament?Kelsey Plum: I'm excited, I'm just gonna have fun with it. I have a great first-round matchup. [Natisha] Hiedeman's a great competitor, we're buddies, so we're just gonna have a great time. I haven't really looked past anything but that. [Ed. note: Due to withdrawals, Plum and Hiedeman are getting a bye to the second round; they will face off on Friday night. The same goes for Allisha Gray and Saniya Rivers.]\nStewart: I'm feeling good. I'm happy to be healthy and really playing the way that I know that I can. I'm just gonna enjoy it. I have small goals. My first goal is to score a basket and then from there it's taking it step-by-step. That's the thing about this. Listen, it can be anyone's game. Whoever gets hot and can score 11 points is the winner and I'm literally gonna take it step-by-step. CBS Sports: How are you preparing for the tournament? Are you scouting your first-round opponent? Working on anything specific?Plum: I play off of instinct, so kinda really just reading and reacting. At the end of the day, it's basketball. You've been doing it your whole life, so gotta trust your instincts and just go hoop. \nStewart: I'm just gonna go and just play. Not think too much about it and just try to give [Li Yueru] tough shots. I don't want her to get underneath the basket. CBS Sports: Did you learn anything from watching and participating last year?Stewart: I think the thing you learn is you gotta make your first shot and try to separate yourself as quickly as possible because you never know when somebody's gonna go on a spree and knock down a bunch of shots. Plum: If you watched last year's, you probably picked up some little cues here and there, just like, schematically, what's the best way to go about it. But honestly, at the end of the day you gotta make shots. That's probably the biggest thing that I've taken away is you gotta score. \nCBS Sports: This tournament, and Unrivaled in general, is such a unique experience. You might end up facing a WNBA or Unrivaled teammate, or a good friend. What's the mood down in Miami? Is there trash-talking going on, are people keeping to themselves?Stewart: I think it's gonna be competitive. It's like, we'll be supporting each other but also not. Everybody's gonna be frenemies over here. I also think 1-on-1 is about respect. You know that you're going at it on the court, but you're still trying to play basketball the right way, and if someone scores a tough basketball on you, you give them props for that. Plum: Everyone understands what's at stake. It's a lot of money and everyone is super cool and friendly, but I'm sure when the lights come on – very similar to the games we have here – it gets very intense, very aggressive, very competitive. I don't expect that to be any different. \nCBS Sports: What do you think of arranging the pods by position? Would you have rather faced a center or a guard?Plum: Well hey, don't kill me, I could face [a center] in the Finals. But I think the pods are great. I think to be honest, it's better just in terms of the fluidity. I think last year got a little bit clunky sometimes with certain matchups. Eventually, though, you're gonna have to run into somebody. But I think they did a great job this year. Stewart: I think it's smart just because the matchups might be a little bit better. When there is such a wide range of positions and heights and you just do one giant 1-on-1 tournament, it can be tough, especially for the guards, like it was last year. \nCBS Sports: Kelsey, I was reading an article in The Athletic a few months ago about the CLA (Constraints-Led Approach) method that you were quoted in. It seems like the 1-on-1 tournament almost fits in with that approach. Would you agree with that?Plum: That's a great point. I think definitely, there's restraints on it. The shot clock, there's a level of physicality that's allowed that in traditional basketball maybe wouldn't be, there's people you can pass to on the sides, so it's very interesting. I think it's gonna be fun. I've never done it before, so I'm excited. It's something that engages the fans and grows the game, so I'm up for anything that does that. CBS Sports: Is growing the game something you were thinking about when putting this together?\nStewart: When you do something new or 1-on-1, it puts you in a vulnerable state automatically and forces you to walk the walk and have that confidence. But it's also a way for the next generation to see how we're playing. While you see traditional 5-on-5, you now see 3-on-3 in Unrivaled and 1-on-1, so there's many ways to play the sport. You have to find the one you love the best. \n            ",

These things are always subject to change at a later date, be it because of injury or further roster move, but we'll keep this as current as the news cycle allows.Before we meet this year's crop of Opening Day starters, here's a look at the pitchers who've made the most of these starts in MLB history:\nTom Seaver: 16Steve Carlton: 14Jack Morris: 14Randy Johnson: 14Walter Johnson: 14\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Red Sox: Garrett CrochetCrochet will be entering his second season with the Red Sox, and he'll be making his third consecutive (and third overall) Opening Day start. Crochet finished second in American League Cy Young Award voting after compiling a 2.59 ERA (159 ERA+) and a 5.54 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Tigers: Tarik SkubalSkubal, winner of two consecutive AL Cy Young awards, will make his third consecutive Opening Day start for the Tigers, tying him for eighth most in franchise history. It's possible this could be Skubal's final Opening Day assignment for Detroit. He's entering his walk year and is expected to receive a massive payday after accumulating a 3.08 ERA (135 ERA+) and a 5.17 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 137 big-league appearances.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Astros: Hunter BrownThe Astros will start someone other than Framber Valdez (now a member of the Tigers) on Opening Day for the first time since 2021. Brown will receive the honors after managing a 2.43 ERA (172 ERA+) and a 3.61 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 31 starts in 2025. \n            \n    ",

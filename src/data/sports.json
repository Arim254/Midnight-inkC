    "body": "\nThe NFL Week 18 Saturday matchup between the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will determine who wins the NFC South and earns a playoff berth. Carolina (8-8) faces a win-and-in scenario, while Tampa (7-9) must win to have a shot at the postseason. The Bucs also need Atlanta to lose to New Orleans on Sunday to clinch a postseason spot and the NFC's No. 4 seed. Both teams are coming off Week 17 losses, while the Bucs have dropped four in a row overall. Starting cornerback Jamel Dean (shoulder) has been ruled out for Tampa Bay. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Carolina prevailed, 23-20, when these teams met two weeks ago.

Tampa has dropped a staggering eight straight games ATS, as its 5-11 record versus the line this year is the worst in the NFL. The Bucs are just 1-6 ATS at home, while Carolina brings a 9-5 spread record as an underdog in 2025. On the field, the Panthers can take advantage of the Bucs' No. 30 redzone defense and a team that hasn't won the turnover battle in each of its last four games, which were all straight-up defeats. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Buccaneers can coverTampa has owned the recent matchups in this series, going 9-2 over their last 11 meetings. The Buccaneers also have the edge in one of the most important stats in any level of football, and that's the turnover margin. The Bucs have the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-five) in the NFL, while the Panthers are just tied for 14th with as many takeaways as giveaways. Tampa Bay also has a clear strength of running the ball as it has the No. 7 rush offense, despite missing Bucky Irving for nearly half of the season. Thus, the Buccaneers can exploit Carolina's run defense, which ranks 24th in terms of yards per rush allowed, and just three teams have given up more rushing touchdowns (24) than the Panthers. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Buccaneers vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Buccaneers 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bucs vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time?

    "body": "\nThe AP Offensive Rookie of the Year won't be announced until Feb. 5, but the leading candidates will make their final cases this weekend. According to current odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, the award is seemingly down to two candidates: Carolina Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan and New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough.At DraftKings, McMillan is the -175 favorite entering the final week of the regular season, while Shough is the +150 second choice. Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson (+1200), Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart (+1400) and Buccaneers receiver Emeka Egbuka (+1600) round out the top five choices in the wagering but are considerable longshots.The case for McMillan to be the Offensive Rookie of the Year is strong. He leads all rookies in receiving touchdowns (seven), while ranking second in receiving yards (929) and third in receptions (66) for an 8-8 Panthers team that leads the division and can clinch a spot in the playoffs with either a win or tie against Tampa Bay (7-9) on Saturday or a Saints loss to the Falcons on Sunday. McMillan and Carolina are three-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings to the Buccaneers.\nMeanwhile, Shough also has an argument to win the award. Since taking over the starting job for New Orleans in Week 9, the strong-armed quarterback has completed 69.6% of his passes for 1,997 yards and nine touchdowns against four interceptions. Most importantly, he has the Saints on a four-game winning streak, which is the franchise's longest in a single season since 2020. Shough and New Orleans are 3.5-point underdogs in the latest odds from DraftKings against Atlanta.\nBut there are two reasons why the betting value may still be on McMillan even though he's the favorite. First, he has a plus matchup against the Tampa Bay defense. Against this same defense just two weeks ago, he had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown. The Buccaneers have one of the worst pass defenses in the league, allowing 236.4 yards per game through the air (26th in the league), and will be without cornerback Jamel Dean, who's out for Saturday with a shoulder injury.In addition, the structure of the voting could help McMillan. Voters are required to rank their top five Offensive Rookie of the Year candidates, and the players earn points on a 10-5-3-2-1 basis (10 points for a first-place vote, five for a second and so on). Past results show that voters favor players who play a full schedule versus those who play a shortened one. That could very well put McMillan, who has every game, on more ballots than Shough, who has played just 10 games and started eight of those.The -175 odds on McMillan to win the award translates to a 63.6% chance of winning, which means there's value to a bettor who believes McMillan's chance to win is roughly two-thirds or more.\n            ",

He has 4,482 yards passing through 17 weeks, which is 34 yards ahead of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and his total of 4,448. \"It'd be cool to stamp that, just lead the league in passing. I think Matt Stafford probably needs to rest this week, get ready for the playoffs. That would help,\" Prescott said with a grin on Thursday. \"It'd be cool, but I'm just playing the game. I'm not going to try to chase it. I'm not going out there like 'let me throw it every time. It may be the opposite of that right? Just trying to play a smart game, a clean game. Most importantly, get a win. The record will come if they come.\"Meanwhile, the Giants could be somewhat incentivized to lose on Sunday because a New York loss plus a Las Vegas Raiders win against the Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City Chiefs would grant them the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Tanking is nearly impossible to implement in the NFL with so many players playing for their football lives on a week-to-week basis given the non-guaranteed nature of most of the league's contracts. \nBoth teams will be playing with the skeleton crew versions of their roster on Sunday. Dallas will be without the following players: running back Javonte Williams (shoulder/neck), running back Malik Davis (calf/eye), guard T.J. Bass (knee), linebacker DeMarvion Overshown (concussion) and cornerback Shavon Revel (concussion/neck). New York will be without the following players: defensive back Cor'Dale Flott (knee), safety Jevon Holland (knee/concussion), tight end Theo Johnson (illness), offensive lineman Evan Neal (neck), defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches (ankle/toe) and defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris (knee). Where to watch Giants vs. Cowboys liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford, New Jersey)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -3.5, O/U 49.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nCowboys vs. Giants: Need to knowHow much will Dak Prescott play and how much will Joe Milton play? \nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer's approach to playing Prescott at the tail end of another playoff-less season in Dallas the last two weeks has been along the lines of \"we're playing to win, so Dak is playing the whole game.\" Now that it's Week 18, and the Cowboys are playing in a 1 p.m. ET game on Sunday afternoon, Schottenheimer admitted he's open to giving strong-armed backup Joe Milton some time at quarterback this week against the Giants. \"We'll look at that. The biggest thing for me is to put the game plan together and hopefully have another great week of practice and focus on getting our prep. You know how much respect I have for this team, this defense we're getting ready to play, an elite front seven,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"But yeah, we'll see how the week goes. But right now the plan is to play Dak.\"\nEven Prescott acknowledged there's a chance he may not finish the game on Sunday, which leads to the 32-year-old, four-time Pro Bowl quarterback having a slightly different process entering Week 18. \"To some extent, yeah. I'd be lying if I said 'it's exactly the same,'\" Prescott said when talking about playing in a game but knowing he'll likely not finish the game. \"No, there's a little bit to it. It's more of just like 'when [when will I be pulled]?' So for me, it's about going out there and planning to play the whole game. Just stick to the way that I play the game. I'm not going to do too much early and make some big plays so I can get out of the game. ... Not knowing when it is [the time he will be pulled] and if it is [going to happen], just go in, play my game and be smart.\"The 25-year-old Milton has four games of NFL experience in two seasons, including a Week 18 start in the New England Patriots 2024 regular season finale a year ago. He feels much more advanced in terms of both his experience and his football IQ entering his likely opportunity to play on Sunday. \n\"Just be ready,\" Milton said Friday. \"I think that was the plan every week. Coming here was a different status for me. When I say status, I mean it's a different gameplan. I get more reps than I did when I was at the Patriots last year. I moved up in the NFL level as far as the quarterback positions and as far as my knowledge.\"  Could Week 18 be a turning point for Cowboys RB Jaydon Blue? \nWith both Williams and Davis ruled out with injuries, rookie fifth-round pick running back Jaydon Blue could have a chance to have his biggest volume game of the season. The speedster out of the University of Texas has played in four games this season and amassed 65 yards rushing on 22 carries. A fumble in Dallas' 44-24 Week 8 road loss at the Denver Broncos spelled a stop in his play time with Blue not touching the field since. Cowboys vice president of player personnel Will McClay banged the table for Blue in the draft, and he used the adjective \"explosive\" five times to describe him on draft day. \n\"I'd love to get eyes on Jaydon. I think the last couple of weeks have been good weeks for him,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"He's practicing harder and better. I think if he continues on that path, there's definitely a chance.\"  Will three-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns put on a show vs. depleted Cowboys offensive line? \nCleveland Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett's 22.0 sacks this season are so far away from the rest of his competition that there was no real race for who was going to lead the NFL in sacks in 2025. However, New York Giants three-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns is No. 2 in the league in that statistic with a career-high 16.5 this season, a figure that is tied for the fourth-most in a season in Giants history. \nDallas facing him right now could lead to Burns having a monster game and making a push for 20 sacks. The Cowboys allowed a season-high six sacks against the Washington Commanders in Week 17, and their offensive line is even more depleted this week. Left tackle Tyler Guyton (ankle) remains on injured reserve. In response to that injury, Dallas moved three-time Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith out to left tackle for the last three games of the season and put undrafted veteran T.J. Bass at left guard. Bass (knee) didn't practice all week, and he was ruled out on Friday. Cowboys right tackle Terence Steele's 44 quarterback pressures allowed this season are tied for the second-most in the NFL, just one behind Las Vegas Raiders offensive tackle DJ Glaze's 45, according to TruMedia.Sunday could be a massive day for Burns, especially if Milton plays the majority of the afternoon in place of Prescott.Giants vs. Cowboys prediction\nPrescott plays just long enough for the Cowboys to jump out to a multi-possession lead, and Dallas hangs on to avoid a losing record and finish the season at 8-8-1 while New York secures a top 2 draft pick in 2026 at 3-14. \nPick: Cowboys 24, Giants 21 | (Giants +3.5, Under 49.5)\n            ",

Adenyi Mobalaji Kayode has been charged with \"reckless\" and \"dangerous driving causing death,\" driving without a valid driver's license and driving \"without due care and attention, causing bodily harm and damage to property,\" according to police in Lagos. He was arraigned in Sagamu Magistrate Court Friday.The Federal Road Safety Corps previously said the findings of their preliminary investigation indicated the SUV carrying Joshua was speeding and lost control before crashing into a stationary truck. Joshua and Kayode suffered minor injuries, but Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele -- both of whom were members of Joshua's team -- were killed. Joshua was taken to a local hospital to be treated for his injuries, and was released on Wednesday. Joshua was in Nigeria visiting the homeland of his parents. Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu posted a statement on Monday offering his condolences. \"I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami in the recent accident,\" Tinubu posted. \"I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care.\"\nThe former heavyweight champion had just knocked out Jake Paul on Dec. 19. Paul also posted a statement on social media, saying \"Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The final week of the 2025 NFL regular season is finally here. There are two games on Saturday and a full slate of 14 games the following afternoon and evening.    Because it's the final week of the season, there is more to detail than usual when it comes to injury reporting. Teams that have either clinched the playoffs or locked in their draft positioning will often rest key players for the last game of the year, and this year appears to be no different.   With that and more in mind, in the space below, we'll dive into the final injury reports across the league and detail who is in, out, and whose status is up in the air.

Hunt's potential absence would hurt the running game as well.    Dean's absence could affect Tampa's efforts to cover Tetairoa McMillan. Kancey could be on the verge of a return from his pectoral injury after upgrading to a full practice on Thursday.      Seahawks at 49ers (Saturday)   \nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawks \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCharles CrossTHamstringOut\t\t\t\t   Coby BryantSKneeDoubtful\t\t\t\t   Josh JonesG/TAnkle/KneeQuestionable49ers \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRicky PearsallWRKnee/AnkleQuestionable\t\t\t\t   Keion WhiteDEKneeQuestionableCross' absence will affect the protection in front of Sam Darnold, while Bryant potentially missing the game would affect the coverage on the back end of the defense.   \nGeorge Kittle seems on the verge of a return for San Francisco. Pearsall played last week despite his injuries. White is one of San Francisco's top pass rushers in the wake of all the injuries the Niners have been dealing with and his potential absence could be a blow on that front.

After facing off in last season's NFC Championship Game, the playoff-bound Philadelphia Eagles host the disappointing Washington Commanders in the regular season finale.Even as Philadelphia (11-5) plans to rest or limit snaps for most of its starters -- Jalen Hurts will not play, and Tanner McKee will get the start at quarterback -- there are potentially some seeding implications up for grabs.The Eagles have already clinched the NFC East, becoming the division's first repeat champion in over two decades, and are currently the No. 3 seed in the NFC. They could move up to the No. 2 seed if the following happens ...Eagles win and the Chicago Bears lose to/tie the Detroit Lions OREagles tie and Bears loseAfter an up-and-down first few months to the season, the Eagles are looking like their reigning champion selves having won three straight, including a 13-12 win over the Buffalo Bills in Week 17. The defense especially has rounded into form led by Pro Bowl selections Jalen Carter, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell and Zack Baun, though don't expect to see much from those players, if they even play at all.\nOn the other side, things couldn't have gone much worse for the Commanders (4-12) this season, and that's reflected in the quarterback situation. Josh Johnson, a journeyman backup, is likely to draw his second straight start. After an injury-riddled season, Jayden Daniels was shut down for the year several weeks ago, and Marcus Mariota (hand/quad) was injured in Washington's Week 16 loss to Philadelphia. Though Daniels has been the headliner for the difficult year, Washington has fielded one of the NFL's worst defenses, too.Here's how to watch the game, followed by betting information, top things to know and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Eagles vs. Commanders liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Lincoln Financial Field -- Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -4.5, O/U 38.5 (via DraftKings)Eagles vs. Commanders: Need to knowTanner McKee gets another chance to impress. McKee has been in this situation before -- his only career NFL start came in Week 18 last season -- and thrived. He went 27 for 41 for 269 yards and two touchdowns. In his career, he has thrown four touchdown passes and zero interceptions while completing nearly 69% of his passes. He's one of the NFL's top backups. Eagles defense back to its dominant self. Over the past four weeks, the Eagles have allowed just 52 points, second-fewest in the NFL, and are first in yards per game allowed, yards per play allowed, passing yards per game allowed and sack rate. But perhaps most importantly, Philadelphia has played much better against the run. After allowing 281 rushing yards to the Bears, the Eagles are allowing just 3.8 yards per carry over the past four weeks, a top 10 rate in the NFL.Commanders looking for any positive signs. Washington has lost 10 of its last 11 games, but there have at least been a few nice signs of late. Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt has 226 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns over his past three games, and second-year defensive lineman Johnny Newton had three sacks last week against the Dallas Cowboys.Eagles vs. Commanders pick, prediction\nThe Eagles may be resting most starters, but there is still plenty of talent. McKee has impressed before, and he should be able to do so again facing one of the league's worst defenses. Washington is depleted across the board and ready to put this season in the rearview. Pick: Eagles -4.5, Under 38.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Whether they'll look to improve upon that seeding or rest some of their key players remains TBD.\"We want to win the game,\" Bills coach Sean McDermott said Monday. \"That's number one.\"However, several players are nursing injuries -- including quarterback Josh Allen who is dealing with foot soreness -- and it's unclear who will play and if they will handle their normal workload.\n\"We talked a little bit [Sunday] night,\" McDermott said. \"Haven't had a lot of time just to isolate those situations, Josh Allen included.\"The Bills could climb as high as the No. 5 seed with a win and some help from elsewhere, potentially losses by the Chargers, Texans and/or Jacksonville Jaguars. Here are all of the seeding scenarios.Back to the stadium farewell, if the Bills end up as the No. 7 seed it would guarantee that Sunday's finale would be the last Bills game played in Highmark Stadium, where the team has played since 1973. Buffalo will play in a new stadium across the street starting next season. Before that, though, they have some business to take care of, not just Sunday but into the postseason.\nWhere to watch Bills vs. Jets liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Highmark Stadium -- Orchard Park, New YorkTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -7, O/U 38.5 (via DraftKings)Bills vs. Jets: Need to knowWho could see their normal workload reduced for Buffalo? If the Bills want to focus on health rather than seeding, Allen would be the prime candidate to see a light workday -- if he plays at all. Allen has dealt with right foot soreness that limited him in practice last week. For what it's worth, last season Allen appeared briefly in Week 18 so that he could say he played in every game. Perhaps that will be in store again. James Cook, Joey Bosa, Dalton Kincaid, Dawson Knox and other players could get some extra time off before the postseason begins.Jets hunting draft pick. It's been a tough debut season for coach Aaron Glenn. The Jets are on their third quarterback -- undrafted rookie Brady Cook -- and are 3-13. They've lost each of their last three games by at least 20 points. But they also own the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft as well as the Colts' first-round pick -- a selection that currently slots in at No. 18. Both picks could get even better this week, too, if the Jets and the Colts lose again.Bills hope run defense improves. Regardless of who plays and who doesn't, Buffalo would like to see improvements from its run defense. Only the New York Giants are allowing more yards per carry than the Bills (5.3), though Buffalo did a nice job last week, limiting the Philadelphia Eagles to just 82 yards on 26 carries (3.2 yards per attempt).Bills vs. Jets pick, prediction\nWithout knowing exactly who is going to play for the Bills, this could be a tough one to pick. But if McDermott says the Bills want to win, then they should win. Plus Buffalo will be wearing the red helmets and the throwback unis of the early '90s era squads that went to -- but lost -- four straight Super Bowls. And you know that \"Bills Mafia\" doesn't want to see that team from the Meadowlands get the last win at Highmark. Besides, the Jets have looked completely lifeless, so even if it's Mitchell Trubisky leading the way for the hosts, they're worth believing in.

Their game against the Las Vegas Raiders will be the last of their 2025 season, and it could be the last of Travis Kelce's prolific career.As injuries mount, Kansas City is limping to the finish line this season. Third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun will try to get the first win of his career and halt the Chiefs' five-game losing streak. The major story going into this one is the future of Kelce, who might be suiting up for the final time. While a win would hurt the Chiefs' position in the 2026 NFL Draft, I'm sure they would love to send their legendary tight end out with a win, if this is it for him.How bad have the Raiders been? They've lost 10 in a row, and the latest one was a 24-point defeat at the hands of the lowly New York Giants. Las Vegas now possesses the No. 1 pick in the draft, and why mess it up now? The Raiders have gone nearly three months without a win, and there are no signs that will change this weekend. Maybe Las Vegas can force feed Ashton Jeanty in the hopes of getting him to 1,000 rushing yards.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC West matchup.\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, NevadaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -5.5, O/U 36.5 (via DraftKings)Chiefs vs. Raiders: Need to knowKelce's farewell?: Kelce hasn't announced that he is retiring after the season, but it seems like that's certainly a possibility. If Sunday does bring the end of his career, it was one of the best we've ever seen from a tight end. He's third all-time among tight ends in both receptions (1,077) and receiving yards (12,990). He's also the franchise leader in total touchdowns with 85. Whenever his career ends, Kelce can start getting sized up for his Hall of Fame jacket.Raiders have lots to lose by winning. The Raiders haven't won anything since Oct. 12, so why start now. By beating the Giants last week, the Raiders took possession of the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft. That will allow them to get their pick of whatever quarterback they desire -- or trade down for a haul if they determine the 2027 quarterback class is stronger. Either way, Las Vegas has little to gain from actually winning this game.AFC West woes for Las Vegas. Few teams have been as terrible against their own division than the Raiders. Over the team's last 11 divisional games, Las Vegas is 0-11 with an average margin of defeat of 11.8 points. Oftentimes, division games are more competitive than you might expect, but that's not been the case when the Raiders match up against other AFC West teams.Chiefs vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nThis may be a trap, but I don't see how the Raiders cover this spread. Sure, Oladokun has struggled mightily in each of his first two appearances this season, but have you seen Las Vegas play football recently? At least Kansas City has shown the ability to play competent football. The Chiefs just went toe-to-toe withe Broncos last week. Give me Andy Reid's squad by a wide margin.

The Los Angeles Rams are already playoff bound, and the Arizona Cardinals just need a win in the worst way.There isn't much drama for Los Angeles in this one. The Rams will either be the No. 5 or No. 6 seed in the NFC, and they are the type of lower seed that no division winner wants to face. Matthew Stafford is playing at an MVP level, and Puka Nacua is the best receiver in the NFL this season. Exactly how much those two will play on Sunday remains to be seen, but they will get some action as they prepare for what could be a deep playoff run.The Cardinals, on the other hand, just want to taste a victory before going on vacation. Arizona has lost eight straight games, and that 2-0 start feels like it was an eternity ago. The defense has been getting gashed, and while Jacoby Brissett has been serviceable at quarterback, he hasn't been able to outscore opponents on his own. At this point, Cardinals fans might just be rooting for one more loss to protect the team's draft position. What's one more loss?Here is everything you need to know about this NFC West matchup.\nWhere to watch Rams vs. Cardinals liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, CaliforniaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -7.5, O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)Rams vs. Cardinals: Need to knowRams will play starters. Coming off a shocking Week 17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, the Rams will not be resting their starters in Week 18. That's a departure from how Sean McVay has handled these situations in the past, when he was very conservative with his stars. Perhaps Los Angeles just needs to wash the taste of that loss out of its mouth with a good showing on Sunday. If things get out of hand, will McVay plant his key players on the bench at that point?Ball hogs facing off. Rams receiver Puka Nacua and Cardinals tight end Trey McBride both have 119 receptions, tied for the top mark in the NFL. Both players have been the focal point of their respective offenses, and they've shown off their spectacular hands all season. McBride has already broken the record for single-season catches by a tight end, and Nacua has at least 160 receiving yards in three of his last four games. Who will finish as the league's reception leader?Cardinals looking to avoid new low. Arizona's 13 losses are already tied for a franchise record, so one more would make this the worst season in team history. That brings into question the job security of Jonathan Gannon, who is now 15-35 in his three seasons as Cardinals coach. His best season was in 2024 when he led the team to an 8-9 mark. Can he rally the troops to avoid a record-setting 14th loss?Rams vs. Cardinals prediction, pick\nThe Cardinals have been a gigantic mess for a couple months now, and I get the sense the Rams didn't like the way they performed in last week's loss. Picking Los Angeles is risky because of the chance that the team sits its starters midway through the game, but I still think the Rams' backups would have more juice than this lifeless Cardinals squad.

The 8-8 Vikings have been eliminated from playoff contention, while the 9-6-1 Packers are in as a wild card. With how the playoff picture looks in the NFC, this game is meaningless for Green Bay. The Packers will be the No. 7 seed in the conference.The Packers are actually the only team locked into their seed in the NFL. They've made the playoffs three straight years, but have been the No. 7 seed each time. Green Bay will play either the Chicago Bears or the Philadelphia Eagles on the road in the wild-card round. Perhaps the Packers would like a shot at revenge against the Bears after that Week 16 loss in Chicago, or revenge against the Eagles for the postseason loss last year. Let's break down this NFC North matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Packers vs. Vikings liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Vikings -7.5; O/U 35.5 (via DraftKings)Packers vs. Vikings: Need to knowClayton Tune gets the start at QB: Jordan Love has cleared concussion protocol, but the Packers will be starting third-stringer Clayton Tune at quarterback with backup Malik Willis also dealing with injuries. A 2023 fifth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals, Tune is 0-1 as a starter. He has thrown for 78 career yards and three interceptions in 14 games played. Malik Willis impressing: Despite the loss to the Baltimore Ravens last week, Willis impressed in significant action in relief of Love. He completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown, and led the team in rushing with 60 yards and two more touchdowns. The former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans became the first quarterback all-time to complete 85% of his passes while averaging 13 yards per attempt and rush for 60 yards. However, coach Matt LaFleur wants to \"pump the brakes\" on any speculation that he will take Love's job.Trending in the wrong direction: The Packers have lost three straight games and allowed 41 points to the Ravens last week. Those are the most points allowed by Green Bay in a game since 2016. The Packers have also recorded just two sacks over the last four games. It's tied for the fewest sacks over a four-game span in team history.A surprising win streak: The Vikings have now won four straight games, which is their longest win streak of the season. In the surprise upset of the Detroit Lions on Christmas, Minnesota's defense forced a whopping six turnovers while quarterback Max Brosmer completed 9 of 16 passes for just 51 yards. Surging defense: The Vikings have recored at least five sacks in each of the last two games after having just one such game earlier this season. The Vikings are one of three teams with four or more players that have recorded six sacks on the year. Packers vs. Vikings prediction, pick\nThe Packers certainly would like to finish out the regular season strong, but that could be tough with an inexperienced quarterback on the road. The trends point to Minnesota covering the 7.5 points. The Vikings are a perfect 4-0 against the spread over their last four games, while the Packers are 1-7 against the spread vs. teams entering the matchup .500 or worse. Pick: Vikings -7.5, Under 35.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $250 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet Win or LoseCBS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel requires a user's first bet to win, while DraftKings and bet365 provide bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook has gone offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook which consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there's season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

One thing that didn't change, however, was the top team in the poll. Arizona received all 60 first-place votes for the second consecutive week and checked in at No. 1. The Wildcats have now occupied the top spot for eight weeks and counting.Duke moved up one spot to No. 4 after defeating Wake Forest, 90-69. The Blue Devils won seven consecutive games ahead of a marquee matchup against Louisville today at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has been added to the Pro Bowl as a replacement, as first reported by Jordan Schultz. Sanders is the first fifth-round rookie to make the Pro Bowl since Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The original AFC quarterbacks selected to the Pro Bowl were Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. With Maye off to the Super Bowl, there is at least one spot open for a new quarterback in the NFL's all-star games. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. After being made the inactive emergency third quarterback for the first half of the season, Sanders got his first career start in Week 12 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Sanders led the Browns to a 24-10 victory, and completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995.While Sanders won his first NFL start, he registered the second-worst completion percentage since Week 11, which was his NFL debut, and threw an NFL-high 10 interceptions in the last eight weeks of the season as well. Sanders was pressured on an NFL-high 51% of his dropbacks, yet blitzed at the seventh-lowest rate (24%). \nThe son of NFL legend Deion Sanders fell to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft despite winning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year during his final season at Colorado. Sanders was the second quarterback Cleveland selected, as the Browns drafted Dillon Gabriel out of Oregon in the third round. Questions remain about where Sanders stands with the organization, as Deshaun Watson is expected to return to the active roster in 2026 and the Browns are still in the process of selecting their new coach, but Sanders joins the elite club of rookies to make the Pro Bowl. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Each of the No. 1 seeds in the latest run of the CBS Sports Bracketology model will be in action against formidable conference opposition early this week, and at least one of them is guaranteed to lose. That's because of two of them will be playing each other on Tuesday night, when Michigan hosts Nebraska in a seismic Big Ten clash.Nebraska is holding on to the final No. 1 seed as it heads to Ann Arbor to put its undefeated record on the line against the Wolverines. The Cornhuskers are 10.5-point underdogs, which reflects an analytics profile that is lagging behind its resume. With the nation's No. 2 strength of record and as one of two unbeaten high-major teams left along with Arizona, Nebraska's bod of work is strongHowever, it still is not a top-10 team in any of the analytics-oriented metrics that appear on its NCAA team sheet. In fact, the Cornhuskers rate a paltry 17th in the BPI. Upsetting Michigan on the road would help narrow the disparity between Nebraska's record and its ratings.But even if Nebraska loses, the CBS Sports Bracketology model projects that it could still remain a No. 1 seed. Taking a road loss against a team as strong as Michigan wouldn't leave much of a mark on the Cornhuskers' resume.

Those two conferences account for eight of the top 12 spots in the bracket entering Monday night's action.However, the SEC reclaimed the lead in total number of bids over the weekend as bubble teams Missouri and Texas both picked up conference victories to nudge the conference's tally back to 11. Also on the rise was the Big 12, which went from seven bids to eight after TCU's road victory over Baylor elevated the Horned Frogs into the field. Falling from 10 bids to nine was the ACC, as Stanford dropped out of the field following a 12-point home loss to Cal. The Big East dropped from four bids to three as Seton Hall fell into \"First Four Out\" territory following its fourth straight loss.A Bracketology breakdown by conference as of Jan. 26, 2026. \n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Rematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament selection committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.\nWith regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

The defending champions are loaded again. Dodgers teammates Shohei Ohtani (a four-time MVP in Major League Baseball) and Yoshinobu Yamamoto (the 2025 World Series MVP) headline the roster. Ohtani confirmed his participation in November, but Yamamoto was not added to the roster until this week.\"I've trained during the offseason to get myself in condition to compete at the WBC,\" Yamamoto said in a statement released by Japan (The Japan Times). \"Together with my fantastic teammates and our reliable staff, we will aim to be No. 1.\"In the regular season Yamamoto was 12-8 with a 2.49 ERA, 0.99 WHIP and 201 strikeouts in 173 ⅔ before a stellar postseason that saw him pitch to a 1.45 ERA in 37 ⅓ innings, a run that included two complete games. \"He is Japan's top pitcher, there is no doubt about that,\" manager Hirokazu Ibata said (The Japan Times). \"As Japan's ace, I can rely on him to give us a chance to win wherever he pitches.\"\nExpect Ohtani to be the designated hitter, though his pitching role has yet to be determined, per Ibata. As a reminder, Ohtani got the save in the finals last WBC, striking out then-teammate Mike Trout to preserve Japan's 3-2 win over USA. Yamamoto and Ohtani aren't the only names on the roster that will be familiar to MLB fans. They are joined by Seiya Suzuki (Cubs), Yusei Kikuchi (Angels), Munetaka Murakami (White Sox), Kazuma Okamoto (Blue Jays), Yuki Matsui (Padres) and Tomoyuki Sugano (Orioles last year, now a free agent). Pool play for the 2026 World Baseball Classic begins on March 5. The knockout stage starts March 13 in Houston and Miami with the semifinals in Miami on March 15-16 and the finals March 17 in Miami's LoanDepot Park. \nThe United States has a star-studded roster of its own and is the favorite to win the 2026 WBC title. Team USA (+105) has better odds than Japan (+320) and the Dominican Republic (+380), per FanDuel.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League is back again this week for one of the most eventful matchdays of the season as all the 36 teams involved in the league phase will be playing on Wednesday at the same time. While Arsenal and Bayern Munich have already secured the top eight, most of the other teams will be involved to determine their position in the standings and if they will be playing the playoffs next months. Meanwhile, Eintracht Frankfurt, Villarreal, Slavia Prague and Kairat Almaty are all already eliminated from the tournament. Let's take a look at our weekly power rankings:     1. Arsenal (--)They are still the best team around Europe, but the side coached by Mikel Arteta is starting to show some issues as they lost 3-2 against Manchester United over the weekend only a few days after winning at San Siro against Inter and clinching a top eight spot. There are no real concerns at the moment but they need to be more cynical from now on as they can't miss the opportunity this season to win at least the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years. 2. Bayern Munich (--)I was not expecting to see them lose their first Bundesliga match of the season over the weekend against Augsburg. Vincent Kompany's side are still one of the best teams around Europe and, like Arsenal, there is no reasons to be worried about them yet. They are still eight points ahead of Borussia Dortmund and have already clinched the top eight in the UEFA Champions League. Next up: knockout stages.  3. PSG (--)Meanwhile, we've got the new leaders of the Ligue 1. It was just a matter of time to see them at the top of the French league standings and here we are. I was expecting to see them improving in the last weeks and it has happened. The match against Newcastle on Wednesday will determine if they will get to the knockout stages directly or through the playoffs. \n 4. Barcelona (--)Lamine Yamal's stunning goal against Real Oviedo made us realize once again why he's one of the best players around Europe and he's a big reason why I strongly believe Barcelona are one of the teams to beat this year. They are at the top of the LaLiga standings despite last week's defeat and they will need to win their last match against FC Copenhagen in the league phase to end up in the top eight. They can make it. 5. Manchester City (--)What's going on at Manchester City? After losing to Bodo/Glimt away last week in the Champions League's second last matchday of the league phase they managed to win against Wolverhampton over the weekend. The feeling is that they are facing some issues while the future of Pep Guardiola is still uncertain. 6. Real Madrid (+1)What a start from Alvaro Arbeloa! Three wins in one week against Levante, Villarreal and against AS Monaco last week in the Champions League debut for the former Real Madrid defender as the new head coach after he replaced Xabi Alonso on the bench of the Spanish giants. It's still early to understand where they can end up this season, but so far so good for them and the new manager. \n7. Inter (-1)They are still showing issues when they face the top teams. After winning the opening four games of the league phase, the Nerazzurri lost to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal while they are now at the top of the Serie A standings. I mean, this is not enough if they want to have success in the knockouts. The away game against Borussia Dortmund could be a pivotal moment of their European season.  8. Atletico Madrid (--)Every season, they appear to be struggling and under threat, only to finish among the top teams in the competitions they enter. This campaign is no different: Diego Simeone's side currently sits third in the LaLiga standings and is pushing to avoid the European playoffs, holding 12th place with 13 points.9. Chelsea (+1)If we praised the job done by Arbeloa, we need to do the same here about Chelsea and the new coach Liam Rosenior. He was able to turn the spirit around of this team that seemed a bit lost under Enzo Maresca and the game against Napoli on Wednesday will be fundamental for their European run this season. \n10. Atalanta (-1)Everything has changed since Raffaele Palladino joined Atalanta and was able to turn things around pretty quickly at the club. Atalanta are back in the contention for a European spot in Serie A while they can also end up in the top eight of the Champions League potentially. 11. Liverpool (--)I don't get what's going on at Liverpool. Last week they won 3-0 away against Olympique Marseille, one of the best teams around Europe but then lost 3-2 to Bournemouth this weekend and failed to win the last five Premier League games (four draws, one defeat). Too much inconsistency this season. 12. Newcastle (+1)They needed to improve and they did it. Eddie Howe's side are currently in the top eight of the league phase but they will face PSG on Wednesday, a key match for their European campaign. I'm pretty confident that multiple clubs will try to appoint him in the summer as there will be big changes in multiple teams and a likely domino of coaches. \n13. Olympique Marseille (-1)I was definitely more confident to see them performing better against Liverpool last week, when they lost 3-0 to the side coached by Arne Slot. Roberto De Zerbi's side were also able to win 3-1 against Lens on Saturday, allowing PSG to become the new Ligue 1 leaders. 14. Borussia Dortmund (--)While the Bundesliga season seems already over they can focus on their European run. This week they will face Inter on Wednesday at their home stadium, a great opportunity to show the world they are still one of the best teams around Europe despite failing to win the last two matches against Manchester City and Tottenham. 15. Juventus (+1)Luciano Spalletti has done an incredible job and brought Juventus back to their level. Over the weekend, the Bianconeri won 3-0 against Napoli, performing one of their best matches of the season. The road is still a long one, but things are now looking much better. \n16. Galatasaray (+1)Now that Victor Osimhen is back in the team after AFCON they can hope to achieve much more than what they've done over the past two months. 17. Sporting CP (+3) They are currently 10th in the league phase standings and can potentially end up in the top eight and avoid the playoffs next month. What a season for Sporting CP, but sadly for them there is FC Porto doing something absolutely incredible with 17 wins and one draw in 18 matches so far. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)Some ups and downs for them this year but we could expect this from them after partying ways with Xabi Alonso at the end of the past season. \n19. Napoli (-4)What is going on at Napoli? Probably too many injuries, but Antonio Conte's side are seriously risking being eliminated from the league phase if they don't win against Chelsea this week. Over the weekend they lost 3-0 to Juventus and likely ended their hopes to win the Scudetto again. 20. PSV (-1)Weekly update of their great season: 17 wins, two draws, only one defeat and a 14-point gap on Feyenoord. Things are playing really well and ending up in the top 24 of the Champions League would be even better. 21. Tottenham (+2)It's difficult to put in words the season they are playing. Thomas Frank's team are in a good spot in Europe (5th place) but facing another big disappointing Premier League season. Which is the real Tottenham? Probably neither. \n22. AS Monaco (--)The 6-1 defeat against Real Madrid told us this is really not their season, but probably we knew that before. 23. Qarabag (+3)They still have a chance to qualify! It will be difficult because they face Liverpool in the last match on Wednesday but the 3-2 win against Eintracht Frankfurt gave them a last chance.  24. Benfica (-1)Will Jose Mourinho qualify or not? Big question. If they do, it means they managed to beat Real Madrid in the last game of the league phase. \n25. Athletic Club (+4)Before last week, I had lost all hope of seeing them reach the next phase, but the unexpected away win against Atalanta has given them another chance heading into the final match.    26. Club Brugge (--)They are finally doing better now, and have a two-point gap on Union SG in the league. They still have a chance to win the title and also qualify for the playoffs in the Champions League. 27. Olympiacos (+6)The 2-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen gave them the chance to qualify quiet surprisingly and facing Ajax away can be the perfect match to show it. \n    28. Copenaghen (-1)After beating Villarreal, they managed to hold Napoli to a home draw despite playing most of the match with ten men. However, the clash against Barcelona may prove too big a hurdle for them to realistically believe in qualification. The potential was always there, they just showed it too late.29. Bodo/Glimt (+5) The win against Manchester City was a surprise for many, but this is a team that could have done better this season in Europe. 30. Pafos (+1)They've got a chance to qualify for the knockouts but its a small one as many other teams do as well. 31. Union Saint-Gilloise (-3)Only one win in the last five Champions League matches won't make them a contender for the playoffs even if they aren't technically eliminated. 32. Ajax (+3)Too late. They are slowing coming back and the last two Champions League wins showed it. They can give themselves a chance with a win against Olimpiacos.33. Eintracht Frankfurt (-6)They are out and that's expected. 34. Villarreal (-4)They probably focused too much in the league and they were already eliminated.  35. Slavia Prague (-3)Three draws and no wins in seven games, that's not Champions League level.  36. Kairat (--)I was really hoping they could do more than just one draw in seven matches. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Super Bowl matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will determine the final two spots in the first round. The announcement of compensatory selections is the only other missing piece to all seven round of the 2026 NFL Draft being known. As a reminder, four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- do not own a first-round pick in 2026 due to draft-day trades, including the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order:The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. More draft coverage is available at CBS Sports, including weekly mock drafts and regular looks at eligible prospects.1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas over-extended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top-10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. \n2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. 3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.\n5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. If they get the head coach hire right, then maybe the a bounce back will happen sooner than most would expect.   6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. 7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then they will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. \n8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog. Assuming Patrick Mahomes' full health, there is no reason to believe the Chiefs will not be in the mix again next season. They do have a deteriorating roster that desperately needs a youthful infusion. 10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-11)Joe Burrow made a notable attempt to get the Bengals into the playoffs after succumbing to an injury early in the season, but ultimately fell short. The offense will be in a spot to compete next season, but can the defense improve enough this offseason to get them enough stops?\n11. Miami Dolphins (7-10)Fans can say what they want about the Mike McDaniel era in Miami, but few had such a recognizable aesthetic as the Dolphins' former coach. It is a fresh start for the organization with a new general manager, new head coach and presumably a new quarterback.12. Dallas Cowboys (7-9-1)Dallas is once again searching for answers this offseason. Dak Prescott was healthy and the team still failed to reach the playoffs with a new head coach. 13. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (8-9)Atlanta fired Raheem Morris as head coach for a second time. They sent their first round pick to Los Angeles as part of the trade up for James Pearce Jr. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL mock draft: Rams take Matthew Stafford's successor with draft order nearly set ahead of Super Bowl LX\n                \n                    Blake Brockermeyer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n14. Baltimore Ravens (8-9)For the first time since 2007, the Ravens will have a new head coach after firing John Harbaugh. It sounds as though the franchise chose Lamar Jackson -- who turned 29-years-old one day after Harbaugh's firing -- over the veteran coach. 15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)Other organizations have been quick to make a head coaching change, but the Buccaneers are going down the path of firing coordinators rather than a change at the top. 16. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-9)Cornerback Sauce Gardner struggled to stay healthy and the Colts' pick being sent to New York rose precipitously by the week. \n17. Detroit Lions (9-8)The coaching drain that took place after last season's run was likely understated in the moment given the presence Dan Campbell has over that organization, but that, along with a few veteran offensive line departures, led to a much more tumultuous season.18. Minnesota Vikings (9-8)J.J. McCarthy's season was volatile, which was once the expectation for a young quarterback. Recent rookie performances from Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud set unrealistic expectations for the majority. Caleb Williams is proof that situation matters. 19. Carolina Panthers (8-9)The team with the worst record in the NFL Playoffs, but also a home game, was the first punted from the postseason. Although not a desirable conclusion, the Panthers have to be pleased with how the season played out considering they picked top-10 overall in April. \n20. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-7-1)The team with the second worst record in the NFL Playoffs was also dispatched after building a 21-3 lead over the division rival Bears. It is going to be an interesting offseason for the Packers. 21. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7)An offseason of change has already begun for Pittsburgh, as it replaced Mike Tomlin with Mike McCarthy. A decision from veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers looms. 22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)The Chargers are headed home for the season after falling to the Patriots in the wild card round.\n23. Philadelphia Eagles (11-6)A frustrating season, for fans and receivers alike, came to an end against the 49ers. The Eagles will be doing some soul searching this offseason but have already moved on from their offensive coordinator. 24. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)The Jaguars have every reason to celebrate their accomplishments this season. Yes, they lost in the wild card round as the home team, but a year ago, they were making preparations for the No. 5 overall pick. The future is bright for a team who played most of this season without No. 2 overall selection Travis Hunter.25. Chicago Bears (11-6)It was a magical season for the Bears in Ben Johnson's first season. There is hope and expectation where it had not been a year ago. \n26. Buffalo Bills (12-5)The stage was set for Josh Allen to excel in a playoff setting that excluded the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, but it ended the same as every other year -- in heartbreak. Sean McDermott is out of a job as a result. 27. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)San Francisco perhaps exceeded expectation this season considering the injuries and drama with wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. They will be replacing defensive coordinator Robert Saleh once again. 28. Houston Texans (12-5)C.J. Stroud was awful to end the season, but the Texans should return the majority of its league-leading defense. 29. Los Angeles Rams (12-5)For the second and final time this season, the Rams have fallen to the Seahawks. 30. Denver Broncos (14-3)Denver suffered the rare win that felt like a loss in the divisional round. It was learned after the game that Bo Nix had broken his ankle and would miss the AFC Championship. The season ended in the conference championship against New England. 30. New England Patriots (14-3)New England has returned to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019. 32. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Seattle returns to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2015 when it played the Patriots. Mike Macdonald has built one of the league's most dominant defenses.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele is the +1400 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, with Cameron Young at +1900, Si Woo Kim at +2200 and Cantlay joining Jason Day, Keegan Bradley and J.J. Spaun at +2500. Brooks Koepka is also set to make his return to the PGA Tour after leaving LIV Golf, and he's a +5500 longshot.

He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Patrick Cantlay a top-two contender this week despite slightly longer odds at +2500. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend.

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks meet on Sunday, Feb. 8 in the 2026 Big Game, which features a 2015 rematch that had an infamous conclusion when Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson in the end zone to secure a 28-24 New England victory. The Patriots (14-3) are playing in their third title game since then, but the first in the Mike Vrabel and Drake Maye era, while the Seahawks (14-3) are making their first trip back. The latest NFL odds list the Seahawks as 4.5-point favorites, while the over/under is 46 points in a 6:30 p.m. ET start at Levi's Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL Big Game, but Seahawks vs. Patriots will be your final opportunity for NFL betting this season.

The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Big Game on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Patriots vs. Seahawks betting preview, picksSeahawks (-4.5) vs. PatriotsThe Seahawks have the No. 2 scoring offense (29.2 points per game) and No. 1 scoring defense (17.1), statistics fitting for a team playing in the final game of the NFL season. However, some have continued to doubt Sam Darnold's ability to lead a team on a deep postseason run. After completing 25 of 36 passes for 346 yards and three touchdowns in Seattle's 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, it's tough to still downplay Darnold's accomplishments over the last two seasons. He was fifth in the NFL with 4,048 passing yards this season after also finishing fifth last year with 4,319 passing yards with the Vikings. The Seattle defense entered the NFC Championship Game allowing just one touchdown over its last three games, and they held the Rams below their season average in that contest. The Seahawks have all the value in the model's latest simulations. Bet on the Seahawks at FanDuel, where new users get $200 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Under 46 pointsAlong with Seattle having the league's No. 1 scoring defense, the Patriots are No. 2 and just behind Seattle at 17.3 ppg allowed. With two weeks to prepare for this matchup, the model projects both defenses to be at their best, backed by two defensive head coaches. Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was the Ravens' defensive coordinator before becoming the Seahawks' head coach, and Mike Vrabel had a 14-year career at linebacker before going into coaching. He guided some of the league's top defenses as head coach with the Titans as well. The Under has hit in two of three New England playoff games, and the model projects the Under to hit in 59% of simulations. Bet the Under at BetMGM, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Some of the top NBA matchups include Cavaliers vs. Magic and Bulls vs. Lakers, while No. 1 Arizona faces No. 13 BYU in a college hoops showdown. BYU is a 2-point home underdog, and SportsLine's proven computer model is taking that spread among its Monday best bets at bet365. It is also backing the Cavaliers to cover, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a bet for Lakers vs. Bulls. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 15 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 37-16 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. It also enters Week 13 of college basketball on a sizzling 10-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and it is on a 6-0 roll on college basketball side picks.

Bet it at bet365 here:Cavaliers -5.5 vs. Magic (-110)\nCleveland is on a three-game winning streak and has won four of its last five games as it gets set to host Orlando after beating the Magic by 14 points on the road on Saturday. Donovan Mitchell poured in 36 points as the Cavaliers easily won as 1.5-point underdogs. Mitchell ranks first in the NBA in second-half scoring and also leads the Eastern Conference with 162 3-pointers. Orlando has lost three straight games by double digits, so the model has Cleveland covering the spread in 67% of simulations. Back the Cavaliers at bet365 here:Bulls +1 vs. Lakers (-110)\"This has been a good past week for the Bulls, with four wins on the spin, and not against chopped liver either, with the Clips, T-wolves, and Celtics falling in the last three,\" SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Josh Giddey's recent return to active duty seems to have provided a lift, scoring 21 vs. the Wolves and then dishing out 10 assists in the win over Boston. Coby White has also been on a heater, scoring 22 or more in each win during the uptick. Meanwhile the Lake Show is off of a win at Dallas when Luka Doncic scored 33 vs. his old team, but most recent efforts have failed to convince, with LA usually unable to maintain defensive intensity save for brief stretches.\" Back the Bulls at bet365 here:BYU +2 vs. ArizonaArizona sits atop the polls with a 20-0 record, but it is facing one of its toughest tests of the regular season on Monday night. The Wildcats have not played a ranked team since Dec. 13, while BYU has not lost a home game this season. The Cougars are led by star freshman AJ Dybantsa, who set the BYU freshman scoring record with 43 points against Utah on Saturday. SportsLine's model has Dybantsa scoring 22 points in its latest simulations, which is a key reason why the Cougars cover the spread 63% of the time. Back BYU at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Monday.

Each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span> — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> called time and picked up some dirt, rolling it between his right index finger and thumb.</p><p>Not for feel. But for sight.</p><p>Sight of what could be.</p><p>What it could mean to lift his team -- and himself -- from the ashes, even for one more day. It could be imagined, if not yet believed because could is hope. Would is what's felt.</p><p>It was the bottom of the fourth inning of Game 3 at Yankee Stadium Tuesday evening. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> reliever Louis Varland blew a 100 mph middle-middle heater past the Yankees' 6-foot-7 MVP, putting Judge in an 0-2 hole. The warm October night felt like summer. The kind of night that's turned him into the mythical figure his peers and opponents have known him to be.</p><p>New York was still down by three runs before 47,399 at Yankee Stadium, quiet after watching the Blue Jays hang six runs on the board early.</p>\n<p>So Judge twirled the dirt not to feel, but to reset. Not to escape the moment, but to own it.</p><p>And on the third offering, Varland went back to his four-seamer. Another one at 100 mph. This one crowding the Yankee captain. Judge pulled his hands in. His sights were set. He chose left field. The visual turned tangible, clobbering a game-tying three-run shot off the foul pole, forcing a Game 4 on Wednesday night in the Bronx.</p><p>The moment was Judge's. Certainly. Even though he played it down afterward, it was him who pulled his team back from the brink of elimination. The one who stared failure down, and finally connected with one swing. It was Judge who made it possible for them to breathe again, for fans to believe again.</p>\n<p>That's who Judge is. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> move as he moves. When he resets, they do too. When he finds it, so do they. Sometimes it's a hand on a shoulder. Sometimes it's a quiet word. Like when he tapped Carlos Rodón after 2⅓ rough innings and said, in that calm, steady voice, \"Don't worry. We're gonna pick you up.\" They were facing a 6-1 deficit. </p><p>It's part of the reason why <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm/\">Jazz Chisholm</a> cranked his first homer of the postseason, a missile to right field off Varland, the following inning. It's why the Yankees tacked on a couple more runs after the Chisholm homer. Or why a bullpen that has underachieved all season suddenly covered 6⅓ innings of scoreless baseball.</p><p>It starts with Judge.</p><p>\"It's because of who he is day in and day out,\" Yankee manager Aaron Boone said afterward. \"How he treats you, how he leads this group. He's the real deal. He's as beloved a player that I've ever been around by his teammates.</p>\n<p>\"They all admire him, look up to him, respect him, want his approval, and that's just a credit to who Aaron is and how he goes about things.\"</p><p>His teammates wanted it for him as much as they wanted it for themselves. Chisholm smacked the padded dugout rail in celebration as the ball ricocheted off the foul pole. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> followed. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a> lifted both hands to the Bronx sky, as if his prayer had been answered -- the prayer not just to win, but to see Judge, finally, ordained in postseason folklore. </p><p>\"I mean, he's obviously otherworldly talented too, so he's a big part of our run production and a big part of our offense,\" injured Yankee ace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1893753/gerrit-cole/\">Gerrit Cole</a> said. \"So I think just naturally, those things kind of go hand in hand when you have a great player like that who goes out and does great things like the team. But I think there's a good camaraderie amongst the team, and I think other players feed off of his energy. I think he feeds off other players' energy in the same way.\"</p>\n<p>That Judge even got to that pitch spoke to his otherworldly talent. It was 1.2 feet from the center of the plate, according to MLB.com -- the farthest inside or outside pitch he's ever homered on, regular season or postseason. It was also the fastest, a 100-mph heater.</p><p>\"I get yelled at for swinging outside the zone,\" said Judge, alluding to his chased pitch, striking out in Game 1 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000033/kevin-gausman/\">Kevin Gausman</a> with the bases loaded. \"And now I'm getting praised for it. It's a game you got to go out there and play. I don't care what the numbers say or something like that, I'm just out there trying to put a swing on a good pitch.\"</p><p>Judge has a way of shifting gravity in his favor. He's that special. For the Yankees, his swing, his game -- from the baserunning to the plays in the field to the bat -- all pointed to the version of Judge they've been waiting for. It could very well shift a series. Rookie phenom Cam Schlittler will take the ball for the Yankees against what will be a bullpen game for the Blue Jays on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>There's hope that lingered in Yankee Stadium. The belief made possible by a man that many had lost belief in except the ones close to him.</p><p>\"He's just in tune,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066810/ryan-mcmahon/\">Ryan McMahon</a> said of what makes Judge contagious. \"He's in touch with everything. And I think it stems from his heart and his mind being in the right place, man. He cares about this team. He wants us to win.\"</p><p>So as the ball hung in the air, the moment did, too. Judge didn't move. And when it clanged off the foul pole, he looked toward his teammates in the dugout, signaling that it was his -- no their -- time. </p>\n<p>The reset became real. The dirt between his fingers became the dirt beneath his feet as he rounded the bases.The sight became seen.</p><p>Perhaps for the first time in his postseason career, Judge could finally feel.</p>\n            </div>",

Both running back Jaylen Warren and cornerback Joey Porter Jr. worked during Monday's \"bonus\" practice and that the arrow is \"pointed up\" regarding their status for Sunday.   </p><p>Porter missed Pittsburgh's last three games with a hamstring injury. A knee injury sidelined Warren for the Steelers' Week 4 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> in Dublin. </p><p>\"We'll follow them throughout the week to make sure it continues to move in the appropriate direction,\" <a href=\"https://www.steelers.com/video/\" target=\"_blank\">Tomlin said</a>. </p><p>Tomlin said that cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a> and wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866214/calvin-austin-iii/\">Calvin Austin III</a> will be limited practice participants but may get increased reps during the later stages of the week. Ramsey (hamstring) and Austin (shoulder) <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-injuries-jalen-ramsey-calvin-austin-iii-expected-to-miss-multiple-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">each sustained injuries</a></span> during Pittsburgh's win over Minnesota. </p>\n<p>\"Both have been highly aggressive from a rehabilitation standpoint during the bye week, and so really encouraged about the potential of those guys,\" Tomlin said. \"But we'll take it certainly day-to-day.\" </p><p>Obviously, the availability of each player would make a significant impact regarding Sunday's game. Specifically, Warren's presence would undoubtedly impact the workload as it pertains to Pittsburgh's backfield. </p><p>With Warren out against the Vikings, backup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968948/kenneth-gainwell/\">Kenneth Gainwell</a> made the post of his extra playing time. After getting 16 carries in Pittsburgh's first three games, Gainwell had 19 carries for 99 yards and two touchdowns in Pittsburgh's 24-21 win. He also caught all six of his targets for 35 yards. </p>\n<p>\"We just thought he was a good player that was kind of underutilized within the system that he was in, because Saquon [Barkley] was just so talented,\" Tomlin said when asked about the offseason acquisition of Gainwell, who previously played for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>. \"We played against him a year ago, and he made some critical plays against us in the running game and in the passing game. ... And so we just looked at a player that had a versatile skill set in a lot of areas, and that we thought was capable of more than what we were looking at on tape due to circumstance.\"</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Few forwards in the world have scored as many goals as Haji Wright for Coventry City this season, as he has the Sky Blues atop the Championship nine games into the campaign. They have an astonishing plus-20 goal difference as Wright has scored eight of their 27 goals this season, leading the goal scorer charts. That form has earned Wright a spot in Mauricio Pochettino's United States men's national team squad to face Ecuador and Australia this month, where he could make his first USMNT appearance since the beginning of the Gold Cup, where he picked up an injury while facing Trinidad & Tobago in June.</p><p>Wright was on the World Cup squad in 2022 and scored the lone goal for the USMNT in their round of 16 defeat to the Netherlands, and like everyone in Pochettino's team, he wants to do what he can to be in the squad for the 2026 tournament on home soil.</p><p>\"It's no secret that I want to be in the World Cup squad,\" Wright said speaking to the media ahead of Friday's friendly vs. Ecuador. The forward didn't use that injury at the Gold Cup as something to dwell on, he has instead been putting his best foot forward through a positive outlook and sensational form.</p><p>\"It's disappointing. I was super excited to be at the Gold Cup, to be with the guys, and hopefully go on a run and win the tournament,\" Wright said. \"In the end, that's obviously not how it turned out, but it's disappointing to not be able to really contribute much, and I just tried to heal up and get ready for the season and hopefully earn my spot back into the national team.\"</p>\n<p><strong><em>Call it What You Want</em></strong><em>: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/kg/podcast/call-it-what-you-want-a-cbs-sports-golazo-network-podcast/id1614458454\"><em>cover all things USMNT</em></a><em> and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.</em></p><p>Back in the squad, Wright is doing just that to move past the Gold Cup disappointment. Someone who can play on the wing, as an attacking midfielder, or a proper nine, Wright has found his form this season playing as a point striker under Frank Lampard. Wright has enjoyed playing under the English manager, and it has shown in his form. Wright has also had a consistent position for the Sky Blues and is showing that he needs to keep starting week in and week out.</p><p>\"I've been playing primarily striker this season, so that's where I see myself, but if I'm asked to play out wide or take a step back and play as a 10, that's all fine with me. I feel comfortable in all positions,\" he said. </p>\n<p>Wright acknowledged that he hasn't spoken with Pochettino and his staff about which position is where they see him, but in the two matches that Wright has played for Pochettino with the USMNT, he has come on as a striker and a left winger. Pochettino has been open about how he values versatility in the squad, and that's somewhere that a player like Wright can help when World Cup squads call for players to feature in multiple roles.</p><p>He understands that there are ups and downs when it comes to national team duty, and how that impacts Wright's mindset is critical. He is focused on doing what he can for his club and letting the international part take care of itself. Whether he's getting called into camp or not, that mindset remains the same, as do the hopes of making another World Cup roster. Folarin Balogun may be the starting striker, but that doesn't mean there isn't room to make an impact in games.</p><p>Rotation and players coming off the bench will be important to the success of the USMNT, and if Wright can translate this form into camp, it could go a long way to getting the USMNT on the right track as they prepare for the World Cup. Who knows -- there's a chance that the last player to score a World Cup goal for the USMNT could also be the first one to score a goal for them on home soil when things kick off for 2026.</p>\n            </div>",

The clock was running down. Things looked dire. Even Lawrence admitted, lying on the ground at the 7-yard line, that he felt \"sheer panic.\"</p><p>And then he got up, somehow untouched, scrambled left and dove into the end zone. Jaguars 31, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> 24. It was the type of game this team had lost for years. In fact, this is Jacksonville's first 4-1 start since 2007. Lawrence was 8 years old.</p><p>But coach Liam Coen isn't worried about the message Jacksonville's first \"Monday Night Football\" win since 2011 sends to the league. Rather, he's focused in house.</p>\n<p>\"The opportunity to play on primetime is definitely something that you want more of as an organization, as a team,\" Coen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVIARpW7OhM\" target=\"_blank\">said Tuesday</a>.\"You want to be able to play in those moments and have those stages to perform. We're really not as concerned about the rest of the league in terms of how they view us. We obviously want respect, but that's ours to take.</p><p>\"You want to have pride in what you do as a team, as an individual, as a coach, as a player, as a staff member. You want to have pride in what you do, and ultimately, I think, when you go out and win those type of games, you can have pride in how you walk and how you talk and how you parent and how you father and how you do everything. Pride in what you're doing. Our players right now have confidence.

Overall, Lawrence finished with 221 yards, one touchdown and one interception passing as well as 54 yards and two touchdowns rushing.</p>\n<p>\"He's so calm, cool for the most part,\" Coen said. \"He very much lives in this level world, and I appreciate that as well. But to see him extending plays, using his legs, competing the way he was competing was the thing I was very impressed with last night. You talk about competitive greatness -- we talk about competitive greatness all the time -- and competitive greatness is being your best when your best is required. ... He willed himself. He willed himself to get into the end zone. He did it all night using his legs, playing hard, playing tough, showing some fire. I think our players did feed off that, and [I] was really proud of the way he competed.\"</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span> -- The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> have had a lot of problems with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in the ALDS, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> is not one of them. Tuesday night in Game 3, New York's captain launched a game-tying three-run home run off the left field foul pole to complete his team's comeback from an early 6-1 deficit. The Yankees have avoided elimination for at least one more night and forced Game 4 on Wednesday (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/live/MLB_20251007_TOR@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">NYY 9, TOR 6</a>). </p><p>\"I felt like I made good contact and I thought we had a chance,\" Judge said after the game about the ball staying fair. \"You  just never know with the wind, if it's going to push it foul, keep  curving or not.  But I guess a couple ghosts out there helped kind of  keep that fair.\"</p><p>The home run was Judge's first of the 2025 postseason and also his sixth career homer with his team facing elimination, tying Hall of Famer David Ortiz for the most in MLB history. The Yankees are 4-2 in elimination games when Judge goes deep.</p><p>That is a special home run hit by a special player. According to Statcast, it is the fastest pitch Judge has ever hit for a homer (99.7 mph) and also the farthest inside pitch Judge has ever hit for a homer (1.2 feet). It is the fastest inside pitch any player has hit out of the park since pitch-tracker launched in 2008. It takes a 1 of 1 player to do that. </p>\n<p>\"You're just in the moment.  Just trust your eyes,  trust your swing.\" Judge said when asked how he got to that pitch. \"I feel like I can get to every pitch in the zone. I think the biggest thing is just being ready on time.  I think  it's all timing.  That's what a lot of hitting comes down to.\"</p><p>Blue Jays manager John Schneider put it more succinctly: \"That was a ridiculous swing.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/why-blue-jays-john-schneider-isnt-sweating-that-game-changing-aaron-judge-home-run-give-him-credit-man/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Blue Jays' John Schneider isn't sweating that game-changing Aaron Judge home run: 'Give him credit, man'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Snyder                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Blue Jays' John Schneider isn't sweating that game-changing Aaron Judge home run: 'Give him credit, man'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/83c2732f-07cf-4648-a775-c4729683c063/thumbnail/270x152/3f5c2dbd6bc9aefcc9e31a25a2127d76/judge-getty-3.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Judge has been criticized, not unfairly, for a lack of postseason impact throughout his career. He entered 2025 as a .199/.313/.435 hitter in 57 career postseason games, numbers far below his immense regular-season production. Even this postseason, Judge was 8 for 18 (.444) going into Game 3, but with seven singles and not much game-changing impact. </p>\n<p>Now, Judge is shedding the postseason monkey that has been on his back the last nine years. He went 3 for 4 with an RBI double to get the Yankees to within 6-2, and then the three-run homer to tie Game 3. The big night improved him to .500/.577/.727 through New York's six games this postseason. Judge has reached base 15 times and made only 11 outs. </p><p>The Blue Jays were spooked enough to intentionally walk Judge with one out and the bases empty in the sixth inning Tuesday, which led to an insurance run. And on top of the offense, Judge made a diving catch to take at least a single away from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2504134/anthony-santander/\">Anthony Santander</a>, if not keep a run off the board. It's not often one player can take over a game in this sport, but Judge did in Game 3. </p><p>\"The diving catch was great. A perfect jump on it,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"Right when we got  back in, now here they go, it looks like they're going to lead off with  base runners, and he shut it down right away.\"</p>\n<p>The five-run comeback is tied for the second largest in Yankees postseason history behind a six-run comeback in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Atlanta Braves</a>. It is also the third-largest comeback in an elimination game in baseball history. The Yankees still have never been swept in the ALDS. They are 4-0 all-time in Game 3 when down 2-0 in the series. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm-jr/\">Jazz Chisholm Jr.</a> hit his first home run of the playoffs to give the Yankees a lead they would never surrender in the fifth inning, and five relievers kept Toronto off the scoreboard for the final 6 ⅔ innings. That includes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066820/devin-williams/\">Devin Williams</a>' first four-out appearance since May 2023. The Yankees got contributions up and down the lineup and from almost everyone in the bullpen. </p><p>Judge was the star of Game 3 though and the Yankees needed him to be. There was no chance -- zero -- the Yankees would be able to force Game 4 without Judge making a difference in Game 3. He needed to put his team on his back, which he does for long stretches of time every season. Now Judge has done it in October, and the Yankees live to play another day. </p>\n<p>\"Just trying to just do my job, what I've been trying to do all year,\" Judge said. \"Not trying to do too much.  Guy's on base, drive him in.  If no one's on  base, try to get a rally going.  That's all you can do, especially in  front of our fans.\"</p>\n            </div>",

The Chiefs' lone two wins this season came against the Giants and a banged-up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a> team that was missing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> for a chunk of the second half.</p>\n<p>In Week 6, Kansas City hosts a Lions team that has been prolific on offense, averaging an NFL-best 34.8 points per game. This season, the Chiefs are giving up 4.8 yards per carry on the ground, which is tied for the NFL's fifth-highest mark. That seems like a monumental mismatch against a Detroit backfield led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261252/david-montgomery/\">David Montgomery</a>. And if the Lions run the ball effectively, that will further limit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>' time of possession and reduce his chances of lifting a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-patrick-mahomes-sounds-off-after-collapse-at-jaguars-weve-lost-too-many-games-already/\" target=\"_blank\">question cast</a></span> around him.</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> (-3)</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>When: </strong>4:25 p.m. ET | <strong>Where:</strong> Raymond James Stadium (Tampa)</li><li><strong>TV: </strong>CBS | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/nfl-on-cbs/?ftag=PPM-22-10bdd6c\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a></li><li><strong>49ers ML odds</strong>: +130</li></ul><p>It remains to be seen who'll be available to the 49ers in Week 6, including the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818265/george-kittle/\">George Kittle</a>.

This season, Jones is 3-0 as a starter with a 67% completion rate while throwing for 301.7 passing yards per game and six touchdowns to just one interception.</p><p>So, even if it is Jones under center, San Francisco should be able to hang around, especially against a Bucs team that is routinely in one-score games. Tampa Bay is the first team in NFL history with four wins by three points or fewer in the first five games. What if that luck doesn't fall the Bucs' way in Week 6 with Kyle Shanahan coaching on the other sideline?</p>\n            </div>",

Carter Bahns here with your morning newsletter. I hope you like trades, because the NFL delivered a pair of them in one day well in advance of the Nov. 4 deadline. But before we get to that we have some baseball to discuss, as all four of the day's division series games are possible closeout contests. </p><p>Let's get started. </p><h2> \t<strong>🐯</strong> Five things to know Wednesday </h2><ol><li><strong>Historic Yankees comeback in an <strong>elimination game </strong>puts them in Game 4.</strong> In flipping a 6-1 deficit into 9-6 win, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-alds-game-3-live-updates-scores-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">the Yankees produced the largest come-from-behind victory</a> in an elimination game in franchise history. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/aaron-judge-finally-gets-his-signature-yankees-playoff-moment-with-game-tying-alds-game-3-home-run/\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Judge's 3-run blast off the foul pole</a></span> in the fourth inning tied the game at 6, and then in the fifth Jazz Chisholm's solo shot gave New York the lead for good. In the other ALDS, the Mariners mashed their way to a commanding lead and then held off a ninth-inning rally to put the Tigers on the brink of elimination <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-alds-game-3-live-updates-scores-results/live/\">with an 8-4 win</a>.</li><li><strong>The Bengals have a new quarterback.</strong> Joe Flacco is on the move but does not have far to go after the Bengals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-trade-joe-flacco-to-bengals-cincinnati-acquires-veteran-qb-from-division-rival-in-late-round-pick-swap/\">acquired him in a trade</a> with the Browns. The 40-year-old veteran and a sixth-round pick were the haul for Cincinnati, which in return gave up a fifth-rounder. The Bengals are reportedly hoping to start Flacco this week at the Packers after Jake Browning went 0-3 taking over for the injured Joe Burrow. We have this trade covered from all angles, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-flacco-trade-grades-browns-get-rewarded-for-dumping-40-year-old-qb-bengals-take-big-swing/\">grades for both teams</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/three-reasons-why-joe-flacco-trade-actually-makes-sense-for-bengals/\">why the move makes sense</a> for Cincinnati.</li><li><strong>Defensive secondary help is on the way in Baltimore.</strong> The Ravens also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-trade-edge-odafe-oweh-to-chargers-for-safety-alohi-gilman-late-round-pick-swap/\">pulled off a trade</a> and acquired safety Alohi Gilman in a late-round pick swap with the Chargers. The only puzzling part of the move? They gave up another defender to do so. Odafe Oweh is on his way to Los Angeles on the other side of the deal. That was not the only move Baltimore made on Tuesday, though. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-sign-c-j-gardner-johnson-to-practice-squad-as-baltimores-defensive-struggles-continue/\">The Ravens also added</a> C.J. Gardner-Johnson to their practice squad as they continue to scramble amid a litany of injuries on their defense.</li><li><strong>Brenton Strange is out for at least four weeks.</strong> The breakout Jaguars tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/brenton-strange-injury-update-jaguars-te-lower-body-placed-on-ir-after-strong-start-to-season/\">hit the injured reserve</a> after suffering a lower-body injury in the thrilling \"Monday Night Football\" win over the Chiefs. Strange, one of the best run-blocking tight ends in the NFL, entered Week 5 as Jacksonville's leading receiver and helped the squad to an unforeseen 4-1 start.</li><li><strong>No leadership changes are in store for the Astros. </strong>Despite a late-season collapse that led Houston to miss the playoffs for the first time since 2016, both general manager Dana Brown and manager Joe Espada are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/astros-will-bring-back-gm-dana-brown-manager-joe-espada-for-2026-despite-late-season-collapse-per-report/\">reportedly set to return for 2026</a>, giving them a chance to right the ship before the end of their respective contracts. The Astros lost six of seven games down the stretch to blow an AL West lead.</li></ol><h2> 🏆 Do not miss this: UEFA Women's Champions League continues Wednesday on Paramount+ </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"FBL-EUR-C1-WOMEN-ARSENAL-LYON\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/93946140-d332-4393-a8f7-04608b96164b/resize/670x377/6cccb8e0ad65a3195829506cff451a86/gettyimages-2239349023-1.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Matchday 1 rolls on in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/uwcl-scores-barcelona-back-with-a-vengeance-with-huge-win-champions-arsenal-lose-to-ol-lyonnes/\">UEFA Women's Champions League</a> after an eventful Tuesday in which <strong>OL Lyonnes</strong> defeated <strong>Arsenal</strong>, 2-1, in a rematch of last year's semifinal. <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> also made a statement on the first day of the tournament with a 7-1 rout of <strong>Bayern Munich</strong>. </p><p>Five matches are in store for Wednesday, and you can catch all the action on Paramount+.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><em>Welcome to \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Thoughts,\" a wide-ranging, in-depth look at some of the top storylines of the 2025 season. This week, we're examining two young quarterbacks who will be inexorably tied to one another: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161957/bryce-young/\">Bryce Young</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a>, the No. 1 and No. 2 picks in the 2023 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> who have taken very different paths ahead of crucial third seasons. </em></p><p>On Oct. 13, 2024, Stroud threw three touchdown passes as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> cruised past the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a> 41-21 to improve to 5-1. Some 800 miles down the East Coast, Young watched, helpless and, from an outsider's view, hopeless, stuck to the sideline as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> fell to 1-5 with a 38-20 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Atlanta Falcons</a>.</p><p>A year and a half since Young and Stroud went first and second overall, respectively, their careers appeared to be polar opposites. After a marvelous Offensive Rookie of the Year debut, Stroud was spearheading a contender ahead of schedule. Young, meanwhile, wasn't even on the field, much less leading any sort of success. He had been <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/panthers-bryce-young-benched-just-two-starts-into-2024-season-andy-dalton-takes-over-in-carolina/\" target=\"_blank\">unceremoniously benched after just two games</a></span>, the once-promising partnership with new coach Dave Canales seemingly turned sour nearly immediately. This was the fourth straight time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1125961/andy-dalton/\">Andy Dalton</a> had started over Young, and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-benching-bryce-young-for-andy-dalton-makes-some-sense-but-ultimately-may-be-pointless-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\">things looked as dire as ever.</a></span></p><p>When we say the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> stands for \"Not For Long,\" it usually has a bad connotation. Success can turn into struggle, and promising careers can be over, in the blink of an eye. But for Young, the opposite was true; his benching ended two weeks later, and he'd finish the season strong, capped by a five-touchdown performance in a Week 18 win over the Falcons -- the very team he could only watch months earlier.</p>\n<p>For Stroud, though, Week 6 was as good as it got. He managed just 86 passing yards in a loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> the next week. Two weeks later, his Halloween got especially spooky when he completed just 11 of 30 passes and took eight sacks. The Texans would make the playoffs and win a game once there for the second year in a row, but given Stroud's terrific 2023, it was impossible to view 2024 as anything other than a disappointment. How big a disappointment -- and how to divvy up the blame -- is up for debate.</p><p>That leaves a fascinating dichotomy entering 2025. Young showed good signs late in the season, but the overall product was still underwhelming. Stroud took steps backwards but was overall still a superior player. Can Young continue his upward trajectory? Can Stroud rebound after significant changes in Houston?</p><h2>Bryce Young 2025 outlook: Decisiveness, accuracy among biggest keys</h2><p>There are lots of things Bryce Young has never been and will never be: particularly big, particularly strong-armed or particularly athletic. Those were things the Panthers knew when they moved heaven and earth to get the No. 1 pick and take him. What they counted on were his smarts, his poise, his feel and his slithery improvisation.</p>\n<p>For Young's entire first season and the start of his second, the weaknesses looked to be overwhelming him. During his late-season run, his strengths helped him overcome those weaknesses.</p><p>The biggest difference was Young's ability to avoid negative plays. Before being benched, Young had an untenable 10.4% career sack rate. It's not just how often he was sacked, either, but how rarely he avoided sacks. He was sacked on 25.1% of the dropbacks on which he was pressured.</p><p>We can blame an atrocious set of circumstances for his rookie struggles, but that number was actually<em> worse</em> across just the first two weeks of the 2024 season (31.6%). For what it's worth, no one has had a sack-per-pressure rate that high in at least the last decade. Pressures happen. They can't result in disaster as often as they did for Young.</p>\n<p>Young's pocket management was vastly improved after his benching. He took a sack on under 15% of his pressured dropbacks, and he not only stopped having as many negative plays but started producing several really good ones.</p><p>From Week 8 onward, Young was sixth in expected points added per dropback against the pressure, one spot ahead of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>, who is considered the king of play against pressure (among other things). And that's with Young's pass catchers dropping seven passes in those situations over that span, most in the NFL.</p><p>Young let throws rip, playing a much more aggressive brand of football, too. He averaged the sixth-highest air yards in the NFL from Week 8 onward, not necessarily throwing the ball deep but really attacking the intermediate depths. Nearly 28% of his pass attempts traveled 11-20 yards downfield, the highest rate in the NFL. The results on these throws were middling, but when it was good, it was really good. He made throws with anticipation and threw his players open. Here's a tremendous throw against almost immediate pressure from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a>:</p>\n<p>Young played with more confidence after his benching. He knew where passes were supposed to go and threw them often before they were open, which makes up for his lack of arm strength. It was an awfully impressive 360.</p><p>If there's an aspect in which Young must continue to improve, it's his accuracy. Even in his much-improved final 10 games of 2024, Young had the seventh-highest off-target rate in the NFL. Given how many throws are going to be really hard to make due to his physical limitations, plus his natural inclination to attack the intermediate part of the field and try some high-skill throws, he has to hit on the easy ones.</p><p>Still, Young's development was immense. He really showed his savvy playmaking skills down the stretch and simply played more like the star he was at Alabama, making confident reads and throws while adding creativity when he needed to. That is, in part, what should excite Carolina fans about first-round wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28877124/tetairoa-mcmillan/\">Tetairoa McMillan</a>, a big-bodied ball winner who can fit well in that intermediate area of the field, especially on in-breaking routes.</p>\n<p>It's reasonable to expect Young to be to a solid starter who will have his down moments -- throws he misses or that get intercepted/broken up because he simply doesn't have the arm strength. But if he plays with the anticipation, confidence and poise he showed down the stretch, another jump is very much in the picture.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-all-32-nfl-teams-by-qb-history-packers-broncos-steelers-headline-most-prolific-passing-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Ranking all 32 NFL teams by QB history: Packers, Broncos, Steelers headline most prolific passing groups</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Benjamin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Ranking all 32 NFL teams by QB history: Packers, Broncos, Steelers headline most prolific passing groups\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/25/1362c3e1-b1cc-4cd1-b255-2b18532ea2f7/thumbnail/270x152/b5f09fe2da801d7ff9e16dff2c343758/getty-brett-favre-john-elway-1998.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>C.J. Stroud 2025 outlook: Pocket management, surroundings must improve</h2><p>After having a first-row seat to Stroud's terrific rookie year, the Texans made several win-now moves last offseason, including trading for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000038/stefon-diggs/\">Stefon Diggs</a> and signing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984262/danielle-hunter/\">Danielle Hunter</a>. Then they posted the exact same 10-7 record and won the exact same number of playoff games (one). Worst of all, Stroud regressed.</p><p>So, too, did his surroundings. Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Out of 77 qualified guards, the Texans' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2174089/shaq-mason/\">Shaq Mason</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3131660/kenyon-green/\">Kenyon Green</a>, ranked 47th and 76th, respectively, in Pro Football focus' grades.</li><li>Right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2161266/tytus-howard/\">Tytus Howard</a> ranked 39th out of 50 right tackles.</li><li>The Texans were dead last in rushing success rate (38.7%).</li><li>Stroud had the most pressured dropbacks in the NFL. Nearly 85% of those dropbacks -- the fifth-highest rate in the NFL -- were at least partially the offensive line's responsibility, per PFF.</li></ul><p>Now, to be fair, Stroud's management of said pressure was ... not good. Only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/\">Caleb Williams</a> took more sacks. Stroud was sacked 22.1% of the time he was pressured, the 11th-highest rate in the league, and unlike many of the players who had a higher rate, he didn't pose much of a threat with his legs. He took 3+ seconds on over 42% of his dropbacks, the fourth-highest rate in the NFL.</p>\n<p>There were far, far too many times the pass protection was fine and Stroud, unwilling or unable to pull the trigger, eventually got swallowed up, often losing even more yardage in futile attempts to escape. Only the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> lost more yards per sack. Here's a perfect example; the second view shows Stroud had multiple check-down options.</p><p>Of course, there were also too many times Stroud was completely hopeless. He was pressured within two seconds of the snap 59 times, second-most in the NFL, and he took 11 sacks in those situations. Again, some were his fault. Others, like when his right tackle simply falls down trying to get back in his stance or when three players block one defender, weren't.</p><p>Perhaps the perfect encapsulation of the Texans' offensive drop off was offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. After 2023, Slowik had several head-coaching interviews and appeared to be the next young hotshot offensive mind on the fast track. After 2024, he got fired. So, too, did offensive line coach Chris Strausser and assistant offensive line coach Cole Popovich.</p>\n<p>So, what's next? The Texans hired Nick Caley as their new offensive coordinator, and Stroud has said he's <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/c-j-stroud-new-oc-nick-caley-allows-me-to-take-more-control-of-offense\" target=\"_blank\">able to control the offense at the line of scrimmage</a>, something Slowik's system didn't allow him to do. That's a start</p><p>Whether an overhauled offensive line is better remains to be determined. Houston traded away its top offensive lineman, Pro Bowl left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079900/laremy-tunsil/\">Laremy Tunsil</a>, to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a>. New left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2146457/cam-robinson/\">Cam Robinson</a>, on his third team in under 10 months, struggled last season. Same with new left guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737467/laken-tomlinson/\">Laken Tomlinson</a>. Howard is moving to guard, and new right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26700865/blake-fisher/\">Blake Fisher</a>, who had a rough rookie season, needs to make a big leap.</p><p>Even if the individual talent isn't as good, the protection plan should be much, much better. That, coupled with growth from Stroud, could lead to better results.</p>\n<p>Stroud simply didn't look nearly as confident last season. He was sometimes too quick to come off reads, sometimes too late. His luck also balanced out, too. After having six potential interceptions dropped in 2023, he had just three dropped in 2024. His off-target rate was actually the exact same as it was as a rookie, though still a little too high, and the misses were penalized more heavily. If anything, it was a similar year to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>: an unexpected major rise in turnovers that led to a disappointing overall product</p><p>There were plenty of really, really good moments, too. Let's not forget Stroud's terrific arm talent and ability to fit the ball into tight windows. He still fared well in NFL Next Gen Stat's completion percentage over expected, coming in ahead of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a>. He was still a top-dozen quarterback on intermediate throws (11-20 yards), where his ball placement can be exquisite. He's not damaged goods, perhaps just delayed goods.</p><p>He -- and Houston -- clearly needed an offensive reset. They got one. Now, having shown he can be an upper-tier quarterback as a rookie and received more pre-snap responsibility, Stroud needs to ascend once again.</p>\n<h3>Previous 'NFL Thoughts' stories</h3><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/projecting-2024-rookie-qb-class-in-2025-can-caleb-williams-bounce-back-jayden-daniels-continue-his-rise/\" target=\"_blank\">Projecting 2024 rookie QB class in 2025: Can Caleb Williams bounce back, Jayden Daniels continue his rise?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/can-49ers-rebound-after-disappointing-2024-how-christian-mccaffreys-return-remade-defense-impact-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Can 49ers rebound after disappointing 2024?

We're also one step closer to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-trade-deadline-2025-buyers-sellers-candidates-rumors/\" target=\"_blank\">this year's in-season trade deadline</a></span>, which falls on Tuesday, Nov. 4, following Week 9.</p><p>But that doesn't mean trades can't take place before the deadline and that's exactly what happened on Tuesday when the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> addressed their messy quarterback situation by <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-trade-joe-flacco-to-bengals-cincinnati-acquires-veteran-qb-from-division-rival-in-late-round-pick-swap/\" target=\"_blank\">acquiring veteran Joe Flacco from the Browns</a></span>.</p><p>Plenty of scrappy playoff contenders, like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, could be in the market for midyear reinforcements. Meanwhile plenty of struggling teams, like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, could be eyeing opportunities to accumulate draft resources for the future.</p><p>With that in mind, here are seven notable names to monitor in the lead-up to this year's trade deadline, including a former Pro Bowler at quarterback and a wide receiver who's already been dealt four different times in his career:</p>\n<p>New York is reportedly in no rush to move on from Wilson after benching the veteran for rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>, but what if there's one team desperate enough for last-gasp quarterback help? The Bengals seemed like a perfect landing spot for Wilson until they pulled the trigger on dealing for Flacco. With Cincy out of the mix, how about a reunion with Pete Carroll? The Raiders are off to a 1-4 start under turnover-prone Geno Smith with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a> waiting in the wings.</p><p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong>Raiders</p>\n<p>New York declined to give much thought to a potential Hall trade prior to the season, preferring to keep the backfield well stocked. Now the Jets are 0-4, and while fellow running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26726580/braelon-allens/\">Braelon Allen's</a> injury has guaranteed an uptick in action, time is running out for Aaron Glenn's squad to even sniff relevance in 2025. Fresh off a 100-yard outing in Week 5, isn't it possible Hall actually has more value to Gang Green as a trade chip, considering he's due to hit free agency after the season anyway?</p><p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a></p>\n<p>Meyers requested a trade prior to the season before accepting his fate as Las Vegas' most trusted perimeter target. The Raiders don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon, however, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> throwing pick after pick as Pete Carroll's handpicked veteran quarterback. Is Carroll ready to wave the white flag on his first year in silver and black? Probably not. But Meyers isn't likely to stick around for the long term anyway. He might be of more value to a team that can still dream of a playoff push.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong>Cardinals, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a>, Steelers</p>\n<p>The Cooks who once dominated as a multipurpose weapon in New Orleans is long gone; the veteran is now 32 and sparingly used as a short-yardage outlet. Still, Cooks has a history of bouncing around as a plug-and-play fill-in, and other clubs might like his experience for a late-year push. The Saints, meanwhile, are in full rebuild mode as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125863/spencer-rattler/\">Spencer Rattler</a> holds down the fort at quarterback. They have little reason to retain Cooks beyond 2025, and it's possible they could still get a pick for his services.</p><p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a>, Steelers</p>\n<p>Cleveland suddenly has a beacon of light under center thanks to rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriels/\">Dillon Gabriel's</a> composed first start. Njoku played a big role in Gabriel's first extended <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> action, too, collecting six passes for 67 yards and a score in Week 5. Still, as a pending free agent, the veteran tight end has an unclear future with the franchise. That's especially the case with rookie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28900882/harold-fannin-jr/\">Harold Fannin Jr</a>. emerging as a fellow pass catching threat at the position. Njoku might welcome a chance to work in tandem for an actual contender.</p><p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong>Chargers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a></p>\n<p>Miami has a potential predicament at pass rusher: Both Chubb and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2806235/jaelan-phillips/\">Jaelan Phillips</a> (more on him below) are cornerstones of the defensive front, and the former is leading the charge with four sacks in five games this year. Chubb is also approaching 30 with a significant injury history and an expensive price tag for 2026 and beyond. Dealing him would further strip an ailing Miami defense of its remaining talent, but at 1-4, the Dolphins might be careening toward another overhaul as it stands.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong>Broncos, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a></p>\n<p>If the Dolphins are going to keep one of Chubb or Phillips, there's some long-term reason for it to be the latter, as he's roughly three years younger. But what if Miami is concerned about committing big bucks to a guy who's struggled to stay healthy, when Chubb is currently reaffirming his place as a defensive leader? Rather than wait for Phillips to test free agency after the season, perhaps the Dolphins would sell the former first-round draft pick as a midseason rental for a team in need of added pass rushing juice.</p><p><strong>Potential landing spots: </strong>Eagles, Jaguars, Raiders</p>\n            </div>",

At times, there are reasonable explanations of things that could have been done differently in the situation. Others, a player did everything asked of him and someone else just did their job better. When that happens, it's generally best to acknowledge that sometime you get beat and that's part of sports. </p><p>Credit to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> manager John Schneider on this front, who did just that on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judges/\">Aaron Judge's</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/aaron-judge-finally-gets-his-signature-yankees-playoff-moment-with-game-tying-alds-game-3-home-run/\" target=\"_blank\">game-changing, three-run home run</a></span> off reliever Louie Varland in Game 3 of the ALDS Tuesday. That home run tied the game, 6-6, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> would eventually win 9-6 (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20251007_TOR@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>), extending the best-of-five series to Game 4 on Wednesday. </p><p>That pitch is high and off the strike zone inside the plate to Judge at 100 mph and he still turned it around and kept it fair. That's just lunacy. </p><p>\"I don't know, man,\" Scheider said after the game when asked if they could have pitched Judge any differently. \"He puts the fastball by him, and you can go one of two ways. You can try to go up and in like he did. You can try to bury a breaking ball. Again, give him credit. You got to make pitches, sometimes you have to make really good pitches. It's not like you're waiting for that to happen, but you understand the talent he does possess.</p>\n<p>\"He's someone you're always aware of. We're always aware where he is, and I think they've done a good job of putting good players in front and behind him in the lineup too. So there's times where you just don't want him to swing. There's times where you say, OK, let's get after him. I'll take 100, 101 with some nasty breaking stuff executed any day of the week, and it just didn't work out today.<br />Hopefully he gets a bad night's sleep and has some bad food tonight or something like that. Give him credit, man, that was a ridiculous swing.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/aaron-judge-finally-gets-his-signature-yankees-playoff-moment-with-game-tying-alds-game-3-home-run/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Aaron Judge finally gets his signature Yankees playoff moment with game-tying ALDS Game 3 home run</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Axisa                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Aaron Judge finally gets his signature Yankees playoff moment with game-tying ALDS Game 3 home run\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/159c82c0-ceaf-44c5-923b-bb532fb38d01/thumbnail/270x152/43928e1115c4b19d7e1169638c71577e/judge-getty-2.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Yes, it was. </p><p>Again, props to Schneider for just straight up saying, basically, that Judge gets the credit credit instead of searching for a place to assign blame. He also said Judge is \"one of the best players, if not the best player in Major League Baseball.\" </p>\n<p>That's true too. And Judge stepped up when his team needed him most in Game 3 of the ALDS, facing elimination. Judge went 3 for 4 with a double, home run, four RBI and three runs scored. He did what superstars are supposed to do. Schneider, then, did what adults with good self-awareness do: he gave credit to the opposition and acknowledged that sometimes you just get beat.</p>\n            </div>",

No reason to save him for Game 5 if there isn't one. With terrific Bryan Woo not on the ALDS roster due to injury, it appears to be the clear weak starting pitching link on Seattle in Bryce Miller (4-6, 5.68 ERA). None of his season numbers were very good but especially in day starts: 7.58 ERA in four of them. Miller also has zero playoff experience. Come on Tigers, give my super-fan Mom a Game 5 ... and ideally not having used Skubal. Detroit hasn't won at home since Sept. 6, so it is due. \n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n                    </li>\n                                                                <li>\n<article>\n    <div>\n            <p><img alt=\"expert headshot\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/images/sportsline/authors/90_micah_roberts.png\" />\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Micah Roberts\n            </p>\n            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                    <p><img alt=\"league logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/league-logos/52.svg\" />\n                                        </p><p>\n        #5\n    </p></div>\n                                    <div>\n        <p>\n            +901\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            (59%)\n        </p>\n    </div>\n                <p>\n                                            35-24-1 in Last 60 MLB Picks\n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>\n                    SEA @ DET <span>•</span> Wed 3:08pm\n                </p>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                    <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">\n    <img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/312.svg\" />\n                                                </a>\n                    </p>\n                    <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">\n    <img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/306.svg\" />\n                                                </a>\n                    </p>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <p>\n                                Over 8.5\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                -103\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                                                    <p>\n                                Over/Under\n                            </p>\n                                            </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                            <p>\n                    Picked: Oct 8 @ 12:01am\n                </p>\n                    <div>\n                <h3>\n                    Analysis\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                                            We have the wind blowing out to right field at 13 mph, 55° at the start time of 3:00 p.m. Eastern. By 4:00 p.m., the winds are expected to be closer to 15 mph, also blowing out to right field. We have a matchup between Bryce Miller pitching for the Mariners and Casey Mize for the Tigers, but the main factor for me in this wager is the wind. Mize only pitched three innings, allowing one hit and one run in his last start. Manager AJ Hinch was nervous about him pitching, had no confidence in him, and they've lost four straight behind him. The Mariners had a hit fest in their July sweep in Detroit; they like playing at Detroit. \n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n                    </li>\n                                                                <li>\n<article>\n    <div>\n            <p><img alt=\"expert headshot\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/images/sportsline/authors/90_bruce_marshall.png\" />\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Bruce Marshall\n            </p>\n            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                    <p><img alt=\"league logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/league-logos/52.svg\" />\n                                        </p><p>\n        #1\n    </p></div>\n                                    <div>\n        <p>\n            +3061\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            (52%)\n        </p>\n    </div>\n                <p>\n                                            172-157-3 in Last 332 MLB Picks\n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>\n                    SEA @ DET <span>•</span> Wed 3:08pm\n                </p>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                    <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">\n    <img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/312.svg\" />\n                                                </a>\n                    </p>\n                    <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">\n    <img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/306.svg\" />\n                                                </a>\n                    </p>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <p>\n                                Under 8.5\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                -115\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                                                    <p>\n                                Over/Under\n                            </p>\n                                            </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                            <p>\n                    Picked: Oct 8 @ 4:07am\n                </p>\n                    <div>\n                <h3>\n                    Analysis\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                                            Staying alive might be a chore for the Tigers in Game 4 as their offense is scoring only 3 runs pg in this series. We saw the Detroit  propensity for low-scoring games in Games 1 & 2 if not in Tuesday's Game 3.  Detroit's offense remains of the swing-and-miss variety and the Tigers so that 3 runs pg in this series is no surprise. Casey Mize, however, was generally up to the task on the mound down the stretch, not allowing more than three runs in any of his starts since the beginning of September.  A bigger concern on the mound is Seattle's Bryce Miller, though if not sharper than his September work (5.61 ERA), the Mariners bullpen gets plenty of work.

Crikey! Yeah, you have to actually score to win in the league.\nI don't expect Washington to have such a great regular season again, but Boston is a shell of its former self after a trade off last year and missing the playoffs when it was 12 games under .500 away. It is also under a new coach. How about an Alex Ovechkin hat trick to reach 900 regular-season goals? I generally love backing teams in their home openers but neither the Rangers nor Kings got the memo on Tuesday. \n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n                    </li>\n                                                                <li>\n<article>\n    <div>\n            <p><img alt=\"expert headshot\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/images/sportsline/authors/90_matt_severance.png\" />\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Matt Severance\n            </p>\n            <div>\n                                    <div>\n        <p>\n            +38\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            (67%)\n        </p>\n    </div>\n                <p>\n                                            8-4 in Last 12 NHL Picks\n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <p>\n                    LA @ LV <span>•</span> Wed 10:00pm\n                </p>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                    <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/LV/vegas-golden-knights/\">\n    <img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/2835761.svg\" />\n                                                </a>\n                    </p>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <p>\n                                LV -1\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                -128\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                                                    <p>\n                                Spread\n                            </p>\n                                            </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                            <p>\n                    Picked: Oct 7 @ 3:17pm\n                </p>\n                    <div>\n                <h3>\n                    Analysis\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                                            Wednesday will be the second of a back-to-back for the Kings off facing Colorado in L.A.'s home opener on Tuesday. Which means backup Anton Forsberg in net Wednesday in the Vegas home opener. Decent goalie but there's a reason the 32-year-old has bounced around, and this will be his Kings debut. Also the Golden Knights debut of the biggest free-agent signing of the offseason in former Maple Leafs All-Star Mitch Marner. I might like Vegas to win the West for the first time since 2023. No. 1 netminder Adin Hill was 20-6-2 at home last year with a 2.40 GAA and three shutouts. Los Angeles was almost unbeatable on home ice in 2024-25 but two games under .500 away. \n                                    </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n                    </li>\n                                        <li>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>",

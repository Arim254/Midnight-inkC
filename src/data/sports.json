    "body": "\n        Rick Pitino takes on the program he coached for eight years when the No. 22 St. John's Red Storm face the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday in the 2025 CBS Sports Classic. Pitino led Kentucky from 1989 to 1997, taking the Wildcats to six NCAA Tournaments and winning it all in 1996.

Additionally, the Aggies have struggled versus the line since Mike Elko came onboard in 2024, as A&M is just 8-17 ATS since then, with that 32% cover rate being the third-worst amongst Power Conference teams over that span. Quarterback Carson Beck tops the ACC in both completion rate (74.7%) and passing rating (165.8), and his top target, Malachi Toney, is coming off back-to-back games with 125+ receiving yards and a touchdown. That offensive firepower sometimes overshadow the fact that Miami also has the No. 6 scoring defense in FBS and allowed just 16.3 points to its four ranked opponents with defensive end Reuben Bain Jr. wreaking havoc on opposing backfields. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Texas A&M can coverMiami has a recent history of not showing up for bowl games as the Canes have lost six in a row, which is one shy of the longest active streak in the nation. Additionally, Miami is on an eight-game road losing streak versus AP Top-10 teams. Those trends will bring A&M confidence, as will having dynamic playmakers on both sides of the ball. Quarterback Marcel Reed led the SEC with 14 yards per completion and is a threat with both his arm and legs. Reed has more games with 4+ total touchdowns (four) than he has with one or fewer touchdowns (three). Meanwhile, on defense, edge rusher Cashius Howell's 11.5 sacks top the SEC and rank fourth-most in all of FBS. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Texas A&M picksAfter simulating Texas A&M vs. Miami 10,000 times, SportsLine's model is going Over on the total as the teams combine for 61 points.

Tether made a $1.2 billion offer to acquire a majority stake in the club, according to the statement, having already been minority shareholders. John Elkann, grandson of Gianni Agnelli and chief executive of Exor, the Agnelli family's holding company who is also facing criticism around Italy recently for the way he's handling the Italian club, said, \"Juventus, our history and our values are not for sale. Juve has been part of my family for 102 years. Over the course of a century, four generations have emboldened it, made it strong, taken care of it in tough times, and celebrated it in the many festive moments.

Paul claimed Joshua broke his jaw in his Netflix main event, a claim supported by a close-up of his teeth.Many analysts believed it would be a miracle if Paul lasted more than two rounds against Joshua. On Friday, Paul eluded the two-time unified heavyweight champion long enough to see a sixth round. Along the way, Joshua knocked down Paul four times before finishing him. During their post-fight interviews, Paul claimed his jaw was broken. A close-up video Paul posted online shows his teeth out of alignment inside his bloody mouth. \n\n\nJoshua's sixth-round stoppage arguably hurt his reputation more than it helped. Heading into the fight, Joshua told CBS Sports that anything short of a first-round knockout would be \"a failure.\" Ultimately, he struggled to land clean shots until Paul started slowing round in Round 4. Paul can hang his hat on lasting four rounds longer than former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou did against Joshua, while also avoiding getting knocked unconscious. However, Paul's performance, which saw him largely avoid Joshua at distance, clinch, and stall the fight by taking knees, won't do much to inspire confidence in his title ambitions. \nJoshua (29-4, 26 KOs) called for a long-awaited fight against Tyson Fury after Friday's win. Paul (12-2, 7 KOs) suffered his second professional loss, but still has ambitions to win a cruiserweight world championship.\n            \n    ",

It is also a major risk for Joshua, who is no longer at his peak but isn't ready to hang up the gloves yet.Both fighters are getting huge paydays, and bettors are looking for their own hauls, with 83% of DraftKings bets on a winner coming in on Paul and 95% looking for it to go the distance. A whopping 95% of bets made have the fight going Over 2.5 rounds.   Joshua is using this as a tune-up fight for a potential showdown with Tyson Fury next year, and he isn't taking it lightly. Early skepticism and rumblings that the fight is somehow not on the up-and-up have the former champ fired up. He says anything short of a first-round knockout would be a failure, and he even made controversial comments about killing his opponent in the ring.  The 36-year-old gives up eight years to Paul, but he is 5 inches taller at 6-foot-6 and weighs about 27 pounds heavier, with Joshua coming in just below the contract-stipulated 245-pound threshold. Joshua also has a 6-inch reach advantage and a massive experience edge on Paul. Joshua has a 28-3 professional record with 25 knockouts, and his three career losses have come to Oleksandr Usyk, Andy Ruiz Jr. and Daniel Dubois. His last fight was a fifth-round loss via knockout to Dubois in September 2024, and he needed elbow surgery following that fight. Joshua has also been in the ring with the likes of Wladimir Klitschko and Alexander Povetkin and has been in 13 world-title fights. In addition to holding the unified heavyweight title twice, Joshua won gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics when he edged Italy's Roberto Cammarelle in a super heavyweight bout in his hometown of London.  Joshua is hoping to avoid a major misstep as he eyes a chance to settle the question of who the best British heavyweight of the generation is. Assuming he wins Friday, Joshua expects to fight another tune-up in early 2026 before what he hopes is a fight against fellow two-time world heavyweight champion Fury this time next year.  There have been rumblings about the matchup for more than a decade, and a fight was agreed to in 2020 before Deontay Wilder threatened legal action that forced Fury to fight him instead. Talks are ongoing, and Fury has indicated he will come out of retirement again to face Joshua if the right deal can be reached.   Paul has the advantage of youth and has fought twice in the 14 months that Joshua has been out of action. He is 12-1 in his career with seven knockouts, but the 28-year-old has mostly faced retired UFC fighters and aging boxing stars. His only loss was by split decision against Tommy Fury in February 2023, and he has won six fights since then. He defeated a 57-year-old Mike Tyson by unanimous decision in a widely-panned fight last November, and Paul's most recent bout was a unanimous decision over 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in June.   A fight against WBA lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was expected in November, but unrelated Davis legal issues derailed those plans. Paul's other fights have included bouts with former UFC stars Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley.   Paul vs. Joshua will consist of eight three-minute rounds, and the fighters will wear 10-ounce gloves, the standard for heavyweight bouts. There are nine fights on the undercard, including four title fights in lower weight classes.

In order to hoist the CFP trophy at season's end, the title winner must win either three or four consecutive games against the fiercest competition the sport has to offer. It all culminates in the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship.Last year's winner, Ohio State, ran the table despite having to play in the first round. Now that the bracket has been reconstructed with a straight-seeding model for 2025, will one of the four teams to receive a first-round bye take advantage of needing just three wins instead of four to reach the mountaintop? No. 1 Indiana, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Texas Tech will have time to recharge and scout their potential quarterfinal opponents when the first round unfolds on Dec. 19 and Dec. 20.That first leg of the championship race features four on-campus games. No. 8 seed Oklahoma opens the action on Dec. 19 when it hosts No. 9 seed Alabama. And on Dec. 20, a trio of games pit No. 7 seed Texas A&M against No. 10 seed Miami, No. 6 seed Ole Miss against No. 11 seed Tulane and No. 5 seed Oregon against No. 12 seed James Madison.\nWhile three conference champions and a runner-up benefit from first-round byes, perhaps the mid-December start to the postseason will allow a contender further down the seeding list to shake off any lingering rust, calm the playoff jitters and build momentum for a run to the championship game.Upsets, at least from a seeding perspective, largely defined last season's playoff as the championship game featured the No. 7 and No. 8 teams in the bracket.

    "body": "\n        Welcome to what has long been viewed, not always incorrectly, as the pivotal stretch of the Premier League season. In a two and a half week stretch between Saturday and Thursday, January 8, the English top flight will jam five matchdays into its schedule with the FA Cup third round to follow. Under such intense pressure, the truth of who teams are might just emerge.Of course it really ought to have by now but for some of the biggest teams in England, recent weeks have thrown up intriguing but unanswered questions. Arsenal are wobbling but are they still the side that have been widely viewed as favorites to win the league? If not them, it couldn't be Aston Villa could it? And what of Manchester United? They're certainly not in the title race but who knows where they might be if they weren't frittering away so many leads. Let's dive into those topics below:1. Are Arsenal still title favorites?Take the temperature of the Arsenal fanbase and you would do well to find as much festive cheer as might be expected. Social media is rarely the most accurate barometer, but to take a lead off there you might believe that the title race is run, that all Mikel Arteta's side can do is stagger to the finish line in the knowledge that Manchester City will eventually click and restore their supremacy. Then you might check the bookmakers, who won't give you any price on the Gunners winning the Premier League that doesn't start with a minus. You could then cross-reference that with prediction models such as Opta's, which gives Arsenal a 65% chance of winning the league.Everyone without a dog in the fight is convinced that it is one that Arsenal should be heavy favorites for. And yet they just lost at Villa Park. They needed a last gasp own goal to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers, tracking towards the worst Premier League team ever. That doesn't seem like the form of title winners. Nor, of course, did Liverpool needing a late penalty to beat Southampton last season. Pep Guardiola put it best after a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace last weekend that was far more underwhelming than the scoreline might suggest. \"When we won 100 points and all the titles, for the amount of things we achieved we had a lot of games like today,\" he said. Even the very best teams have off days and this is not a season that will require centurion standards.\nArsenal have wobbled, that much is true, albeit only by the standards of title winners. Since the last international break, which they went into having been held at Sunderland, they have won three, drawn one and lost one in the Premier League. Their wobble, however, is eminently explicable. Injuries have hit them hard, the defense buckling just as the attacking numbers were trending upwards. Ben White has injured his hamstring, Jurrien Timber, Riccardo Calafiori and William Saliba have struggled with knocks but the most profound issue has been the absence of Gabriel, who Arteta said on Friday is \"not too far\" having returned to the training pitches from his thigh injury.Where Premier League opposition have had their touches in games against Arsenal with and without Gabriel this season. Note the slight uptick in penalty box touches since Gabriel's injury \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Gabriel is one of the best center backs in the world and his absence shines through in Arsenal's defensive metrics. Prior to the November internationals where he went down, Arteta's side were allowing opponents a frankly ludicrous 0.55 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) per game. Take their No.6 out and that trends to a 0.73, still the best in the Premier League by a vast margin. There are further issues up the field that stem from a team who miss their unbreachable foundations but the net sum of those is a five game sample size where Arsenal's npxG difference is basically neck and neck with Manchester City. For the season as a whole the Gunners' npxG difference is about 20% ahead of City's. If Arsenal get back to the best version of themselves, they should win the league.Of course they might not get back to the best version of themselves. Arteta has spoken with some nerves about the \"really dangerous circle\" of loading minutes on other players to mitigate for the absence of those with injuries, ominously warning that Saliba playing 90 minutes against Wolves was \"buying tickets for another injury.\" The biggest worry is that the raffle delivers their unlucky number. It might also be true that a style of play that has center backs holding the line on halfway and wingers tracking their full backs high and low puts undue pressure on Arsenal bodies -- hence Gabriel's thigh issue and Ben White's hamstring visibly going in a chaseback at the weekend -- but that seems intractable. Arteta's system wins games. He just has to hope it doesn't come at too great a cost.\nArsenal might have bought a gaudy level of depth, but the center backs who are good enough that they won't look like a drop off when Gabriel is out are not going to want to warm Arteta's bench for most of the season. The same is true of Saliba, Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice. Get and keep those players fit, using the squad to ease their minutes load, and Arsenal should be alright.2. Are Aston Villa title contenders?Sixteen games into the season, we are at the stage where the Premier League table shouldn't be lying. And yet it is a tricksy sort, the EPL. It would have you believe that right now Aston Villa are serious candidates to win a first English league crown since Diana and Charles were readying themselves for a wedding and Bucks Fizz were sweeping all ahead of them at Eurovision. However, while we may not have any xG data to hand for the 1980-81 First Division, it is hard to believe it would have painted quite as troubling a title assessment of Ron Saunders' as it does Unai Emery's.The headline number is that Villa, winners of 10 of their last 11 league games, rank 15th on npxG difference. Per game they are making chances worth 1.07 npxG and allowing shots worth 1.28. The immediate instinct is that these season wide numbers might change when you scrub out the first five games when the club were wracked with concern over their PSR position and grumbles over the dressing room. That is an indulgence that not every team should have afforded to it, but do so for Villa and it offers no greater explanation for why they are Europe's form side of late. Over the last 11 games their underlying numbers are just about average.\nWithin that sample are some quite excellent performances, none more so than their last gasp win over Arsenal, but this has also been a team that can go 79 minutes against West Ham and take four shots. They won that game because Morgan Rogers walloped the ball from 35 yards and Alphonse Areola was beaten. That is the story of the Villa surge. The foundation of the Gunners' title candidacy is their miserly defense. For Manchester City it is their ability to manufacture enough shots for the most deadly scorer in the game. Villa's is a story of spectacular shooting from outside the penalty area. Has that worked for anybody else? No, but maybe it will work for them.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Probably not though. Even the best offenses in the sport can't continually turn 2.3 xG into 11 goals, no matter the talent on their roster. And there is talent for Villa to call upon. Rogers is a prime example of this. Watch him leather one past Areola or see how his side-footed free kick at Elland Road seems to hang on the perfect trajectory and you could legitimately convince yourself he is a very good range shooter. You might want to see a bigger sample size but maybe we could give the youngster the benefit of the doubt and say there is something special there.And the very best do tend to get out in front of their xG. Take Lionel Messi: the very best. Over here at CBS Sports we have access to 192 games the great man has played in the Champions League, Ligue 1, MLS and the World Cup, among others. In those games Messi has taken shots from outside the area worth 21.93 xG. He has scored 37 goals. That is a 60% overperformance by probably the greatest to ever do it. Since the start of the previous Premier League season, Rogers is 400% up on his xG outside the box. As is apparent in the table above, he's not the only one. \nOf course two things can be true. Unai Emery can have a cadre of high quality ball strikers in Rogers, Emiliano Buendia and Matty Cash, to name but a few. That does not mean they have been transformed into 11 splash brothers, a side who can win the biggest prizes with range shooting. It is not as if Villa have unlocked anything different, or as if there have been any more than incremental adjustments by the coaching staff since their wobbly start to the season.In due course the thunderbolts that have turned one pointers against Leeds, West Ham and Wolves into wins will fly wide of the post. If nothing else changes Villa will drift back to who they are, albeit with the advantage of having accrued a quite ludicrous number of points of late.3. Do Manchester United have a problem holding leads?It is a sign of pleasant progress for Ruben Amorim that his troubles at Manchester United have gone from the macro to the relatively micro. No longer must he answer whether his system can work in the Premier League or whether he has the charisma, patience and internal goodwill for football's biggest rebuild job. Now the question is why when his team get into winning positions they can't hold on. West Ham and Bournemouth have both stolen points from losing positions at Old Trafford this month, the stream of goals scored by the latter in one of the season's outstanding games helping Manchester United to the worst goals record of leading teams. \nFourteen goals have been conceded while United are ahead -- Manchester City have the second worst record in that regard with 10 -- and their overall goal difference of minus seven is again the Premier League's worst. Then again at least some of that is explained by the vagaries of finishing fortune. Their xG difference when leading is almost exactly zero, they've just conceded more and scored fewer than the value of their chances.There probably is no reason to panic about United's approach when leading per se. Their problems in this regard are broader. Amorim's team do not really control games that effectively whatever the scoreline. Though they see a lot of the ball United are avowedly midtable in terms of pass completion and their average attacking sequence lasts 8.4 seconds, below league average and a long way off the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, all of whom keep the ball for an average of over 10 seconds. It is fair to say that United might be worse than most on this metric when in the lead. Most teams tend to keep the ball for less time when they're winning -- eventually it just makes sense to hoof for safety -- but while the league averages a nine percent drop off, United's is double that.This might point to something within the squad's psychological makeup that makes them less adept at sitting on leads but the reality might be more tangible. United concede when leading because they don't control games and they don't control games because in central areas possession is too volatile. No Premier League team has won the ball in the middle third than United's 344 and only four have conceded it more than 300 times. When you have high-stakes gambler Bruno Fernandes and ageing ball-winner Casemiro as your double pivot, this will happen. Fernandes in particular is second in the league for possession won in the middle third and fourth for possession lost.\nUnited might be an improved force, one tracking in the right direction over recent months under Amorim, but their defining force remains Fernandes (and rightly so). That means they will remain a team that can conjure something from nothing but who will also struggle to slow the pace and shut the game down.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Texas A&M will play host to No. 10 Miami in a first-round matchup of the College Football Playoff at Kyle Field with some pivotal stakes. The Aggies are fresh off a 11-1 season, the most wins for the program since 2012. However, Texas A&M struggled in its final regular-season game -- a loss against rival Texas. Miami started the 2025 season on fire, but had to recover after losing games to Louisville and SMU by a combined nine points midseason. The losses cost them a shot at playing for the ACC title, but blazing through the month of November was enough to deliver them their first College Football Playoff appearance as the final team in. Texas A&M and Miami have played five teams, including a recent home-and-home series in 2022-23. The Hurricanes won 48-33 in their most recent matchup, the second game for Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson. However, the matchup will look much different with Mike Elko now leading Texas A&M.   Miami vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  War in the trenches: Miami and Texas A&M come into the matchup boasting some of the top trench play of any teams in the playoff. Hurricanes offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa leads a unit that allowed only 11 total sacks this year. The Aggies were close behind at 12, both ranking top 11 nationally. But, Texas A&M also leads the nation with 41 sacks behind All-American defensive end Cashius Howell, and Miami had 34. The chess match between the lines will be the matchup of the weekend. Star receivers: Texas A&M invested heavily into its wide receiver corps and the unit has carried the program to new heights. Transfers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver each posted at least 50 catches for 800 yards, and others like Ashton Bethel-Roman and tight end Nate Boerkircher have each come up big in major moments. Few teams are built to win outside in, but the Aggies have that kind of ability. \nAll eyes on Bain: If the Heisman was given in September, Miami defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. might have walked away with it. The defensive end was unbelievable, wreaking havoc and making disruptive plays during a 5-0 start. However, both his production and grading have fallen off precipitously. Bain posted 1.5 sacks in the season finale against Pittsburgh; could he wake up in the season's most important moments?   Where to watch Miami vs. Texas A&M live  Date: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)  Miami vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  \nThe matchup between Texas A&M and Miami is a true heavyweight battle. Both teams have the upside to win the national championship if things break right, and the first round will be an important stress test. Miami quarterback Carson Beck has the experience edge, but Texas A&M's offense has an explosive component that will prove to be the difference in College Station. Pick: Texas A&M -3.5\n\n

The 2025 college football season was filled with drama and intense conference championship races, but now it's time to find out who the best in the nation truly is. Indiana's enters this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed on the heels of a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall very far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opens with four first-round games on Friday and Saturday before advancing to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma: 24Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Oklahoma finally took its rightful place back in the College Football Playoff in 2025 after a breakout season. The Sooners returned to the postseason tournament for the first time since 2019, and first time under fourth-year coach Brent Venables during a 10-3 campaign. The season was much-needed proof of concept for Venables, who posted losing seasons in two of his first three seasons. The Sooners fielded one of the best defenses in college football for the second straight season and flipped close-game luck in their favor. They pulled off historic wins over No. 15 Michigan, No. 4 Alabama and No. 14 Tennessee -- the latter two on the road. But like Oklahoma's four appearances in the CFP under Lincoln Riley, the season ended without a win in the postseason tournament. The Sooners blew a three-score lead in a 34-24 loss No. 9 Alabama on their home field. And like those other runs, Oklahoma was held back by glaring limitations on one side of the ball. The arrival of Washington State transfer quarterback John Mateer and offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle provided optimism as the Sooners hoped to grow from a bottom-tier SEC offense. But while there were signs of life, the offense ultimately remained a liability when competing on the national stage. \nOklahoma got off to a hot start, leading 17-0 after a few strong offensive drives. But after a stunning whiffed punt by Grayson Miller, the Sooners unraveled. Mateer threw a pick-six on the next drive and in fewer than six minutes of game time, Alabama tied the game. From there, Oklahoma put together one touchdown drive, and went three-and-out four times. The offensive issues have been a mainstay all season, even as the Sooners hired the well-respected Arbuckle. Oklahoma ranked No. 12 in the SEC in both total and scoring offense, despite often getting favorable field position and points from defense and special teams. The Sooners scored fewer than 17 points per contest in the final three games of the regular season. While they hit 24 on Friday, they scored just seven in the second half. Venables will have key questions to answer heading into the offseason, including where he wants to invest in the roster. But after reaching the playoff, it at least comes from a position of strength. \nMateer's inconsistencyOklahoma invested heavily in Mateer over the offseason, making him one of the highest-paid players in college football. His arrival did make a meaningful difference as the Sooners improved from No. 16 to 9 in passing offense. He made big plays in wins over Michigan and Tennessee, but also was stifled against Texas and in the second half of the loss to Alabama. Mateer underwent surgery for a hand injury in September, and his recovery certainly played a role in his inconsistency. However, he finished the year with 14 touchdowns to 11 interceptions, including two separate games with three picks. Top targets Deion Burks, Keontez Lewis and tight end Jaren Kanak are all out of eligibility after the season. Top receiver Isaiah Sategna could also look to the NFL after nearing the 1,000-yard plateau. Even if Mateer returns as expected, the Oklahoma passing game will look much different in 2026. \nIs the run game coming along?Since joining the SEC in 2024, Oklahoma's running game has been perhaps its most glaring issue. The Sooners averaged only 3.7 yards per carry over the past two seasons, and finished No. 13 in the SEC with only 123.8 yards rushing per game. There's been multiple factors that have led to the Sooners' struggles on the ground, including inconsistent running back identification and development. No running back on the roster posted more than 109 carries in the regular season, even after the Sooners invested heavily in California transfer Jaydn Ott over the offseason. The inconsistent personnel remains a major issue for running backs coach DeMarco Murray. But more than anything else, the offensive line has been a consistent issue since joining the SEC. The Sooners cycled through linemen in 2024 while fielding perhaps the SEC's worst unit. Late in the year, the unit has settled down and leaned heavily on a handful of underclassmen. The good news? Those young players appear to be the right ones. \nLeft tackle Michael Fasusi is a rising star and Jake Maikkula (who missed the Alabama game while recovering from an infection) has been one of the top graded players at center. Freshmen Eddy Piere-Louis and Ryan Fodje have also played major roles, including starting the playoff game. All four players are expected back in 2026. If they can take steps, Oklahoma should finally have a Sooner-level offensive line. The defense will remain electricWhen Venables was defensive coordinator at Clemson, his units were defined by constantly rotating bodies. After four years at Oklahoma, he's finally brought the Sooners' depth to that elite level. Heading into Friday, 20 different players recorded at least 200 defensive snaps. Fifteen cleared the 300-snap mark. Even though stars like safety Peyton Bowen and edge rusher R. Mason Thomas could head to the NFL, there's a whole new wave of playmakers waiting in the wings. \nSophomore defensive tackles David Stone and Jayden Jackson should emerge among the best in the sport, while defensive end Taylor Wein really came on across the season. Linebacker Owen Heinecke had a strong game, and cornerback Eli Bowen has another year of eligibility remaining. Last season, Oklahoma lost All-American safety Billy Bowman and linebacker Danny Stutsman to the NFL. The unit responded by taking yet another step forward. It's time to classify Venables' Oklahoma defenses as permanently good, regardless of personnel turnover. The final prognosisBy any measure, the Venables era at Oklahoma started off on the wrong foot with two losing seasons in three years. After posting a 10-win season and reaching the College Football Playoff, Venables is cemented as the long-term coach of the Sooners. From here, it's simply tweaking the formula. \nThe Sooners have recruited at an incredibly high level, and welcome in a top-15 signing class in 2026. They're positioned to break into the national elite in the 247Sports Talent Composite, and development on defense has been a mainstay. However, the glaring problem at Oklahoma remains the same as when it entered the season: Can Venables figure out the offense? There were steps in the right direction, but the Sooners are still far away from fielding a championship-level unit. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The time has nearly arrived for one of the most-anticipated boxing events of the year as we inch toward closing out 2025. The spotlight will be on Miami as Jake Paul takes on his literal biggest test yet when he steps in the ring with former unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. It all goes down on Friday night at the Kaseya Center and can be streamed live on Netflix.Paul has become one of boxing's biggest stars through careful matchmaking, expert promotion, world class training and solid athleticism. Over the last five years he's accumulated a 12-1 record by beating former UFC champions and stars with little boxing experience, smaller foes, and a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!Joshua, meanwhile, is one of the sport's most decorated champions of his era. He earned gold at the 2012 Olympics before turning pro and earning the unified heavyweight titles. While he has yet to secure the desired matchups against Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder, Joshua did have two chances against Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed crown, but came up short in both instances.\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"\nBet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Below is the complete fight card for Paul vs. Joshua along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul faces an enormous new challenge. On Friday, two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua tests Paul's resilience against a larger, more decorated boxer with athleticism to spare. Paul vs. Joshua headlines Netflix's latest boxing card from the Kaseya Center in Miami.Paul, to his credit, is fighting an uphill battle on Friday. The social influencer-turned-boxer made strides in the fight game by targeting the most popular opponents whom he had the greatest physical advantages over, namely, in terms of size, age, or both. Standing across from Paul on Friday is former heavyweight champ Joshua: a stronger, bigger, more powerful, and far more experienced foe. Joshua admits that anything short of a swift victory would be a failure on his part.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!\"Yeah, 100%. This is the Giants vs the Patriots 2007. I mean, the list goes on, but the odds are stacked against me,\" Paul said at the final press conference. 'There's no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it's this big of a difference in terms of skill, experience, resume, height, weight, etc. So this is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sports and you guys get to witness it.\"\nBet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The undercard features more fighters from under the Most Valuable Promotions banner. That includes recent signing Alycia Baumgardner, who looks to defend her unified junior lightweight titles against Leila Beaudoin in the co-main event. Baumgardner, 31, reached undisputed status at junior lightweight in 2023. She made three defenses of the crown before vacating the WBC title to take this fight. Plus, former UFC champions are set to clash when Anderson Silva, 50, battles Tyron Woodley, 43, at cruiserweight.\"I feel like for me, it's my chance to go forward to increase my legacy. And for once, it's an opportunity for me to fight somebody that brings my value up,\" Woodley said at the final press conference. \"Anderson, that's the type of excitement that I got when the fight was requested. And it didn't take me long. I really said yes almost before we even talked about it, so it's time to get it on. Can't wait.\" \nCBS Sports will be with you throughout the entire way on Friday, beginning with the start of the main card broadcast at 8 p.m. ET, so be sure to follow along with the live results and highlights.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Audric Estime wasn't supposed to be in this spot in Week 16. We wanted Alvin Kamara to be taking on the Jets, but he's out for the fourth game in a row with a knee injury. Then, we were hoping it would be Devin Neal, but he was placed on injured reserve after hurting his hamstring in Week 15 against Carolina.So here we are with Estime in this dream matchup. Can you trust him? I'm willing to take the chance on him in several DFS lineups.He's a great bargain at $5,000 on DraftKings and $4,900 on FanDuel. And he could be awesome against the Jets, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs in the past five weeks. Over that span, the Jets have allowed 14 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have at least 90 total yards (TreVeyon Henderson, Derrick Henry, Robinson, Achane, Jaylen Wright, and Travis Etienne). It could be amazing for Estime.\nBut is he even the best running back for the Saints? Estime will share touches with Evan Hull, and we'll see who coach Kellen Moore leans on in Week 16.In Week 15 against Carolina, when Neal was injured, Estime had three carries for 11 yards and three catches for 39 yards on three targets, while Hull had four carries for 12 yards. At least one Saints reporter expects Estime to start, and I'm willing to take a chance on him in several lineups.We'll see if it works out. But the opportunity and matchup are great, and Estime could be a standout Fantasy running back in Week 16 against the Jets.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 16, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule features just one game on Christmas Eve, and it takes place in the Aloha State. The Sheraton Hawaii Bowl 2025 will see the California Golden Bears facing the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Cal (7-5) is coming off a 38-35 win over SMU but has lost three straight bowl games.

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions, and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. To add to the good vibes, Mike Tomlin's defense is getting closer to returning their most important player.On Wednesday, star pass rusher T.J. Watt attended practice for the first time since undergoing lung surgery after a dry needling mishap, though he was listed as a limited participant. Coach Tomlin said that Watt's status for the Week 17 matchup against the Cleveland Browns is unclear right now, but this was clearly a step in the right direction.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" fellow pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"Two weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \n\"Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today.   He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt recorded 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday, or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak, in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Wednesday's Christmas Eve roundup just below. Yankees among teams interested in HaysVeteran outfielder Austin Hays is seeing his free agent market pick up. \nThe Yankees are among the teams with some level of interest in Hays, the New York Post reports. However, the Yankees would likely pursue Hays only if fellow outfielder Cody Bellinger, a core member of the Yankees last season and one of their top offseason targets, signs elsewhere. Hays has previously been reported to be of interest to the Mets and Royals. \nHays, 30, has a career OPS+ of 106 across parts of eight MLB seasons. Last season, he had an OPS+ of 105 for the Reds. He has a career WAR of 10.8, and in 2023 he earned his first and to date only All-Star selection as a member of the Orioles. For his career, Hays boasts an OPS of .819 against left-handed pitching. Marlins sign FairbanksThe Marlins have agreed to terms on a one-year, $13 million free agent contract with veteran reliever Pete Fairbanks, the Athletic reports. \nThe 32-year-old Fairbanks has served as the Rays' closer for the last three seasons, and earlier in the offseason CBS Sports ranked him as the No. 40 free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"Fairbanks was a late addition to the free-agent class when the Rays surprisingly declined his club option. He's always struggled with durability (this past season marked his first time clearing 50 innings in a year) and his strikeout rate is a shadow of its old self. That said, Fairbanks continues to possess a nasty slider and he should slot into a high-leverage role for someone.\"The Marlins were in need of high-leverage relief help, especially after Ronny Henriquez was lost to Tommy John surgery. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Things at the top of the NBA Draft Big Board are relatively stable from a month ago, but that may not last long. Questions about the durability (and availibilty) of Kansas' Darryn Peterson, coupled with the ascension of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and the exceptional play of Duke's Cameron Boozer have narrowed the gap for the No. 1  overall pick as we head into conference play.While those top three remain in a class among themselves, UNC power forward Caleb Wilson's consistency, athleticism, rebounding and versatile defensive tools are closing the gap. Meanwhile, Tennessee's Nate Ament has had some bumps in the road recently in the Volunteers' jumbo lineups, but is still the type of combo-forward that usually pans any well long-term in the association.Who's top point guard?There's also an interesting battle behind Peterson at the point guard position. Louisville's Mikel Brown is the most skilled of the bunch, while Houston's Kingston Flemings is the most explosive. Scouts are worried about Brown's durability and defense and still have questions about the sustainability of Flemings shooting. Arkansas' Darius Acuff meanwhile isn't the most explosive or skilled, but he very well may be the best college player.Flemings, who moved from No. 15 to No. 7 this month, isn't the only high-level athlete to make a jump. A month ago, it seemed almost aggressive to have Baylor's Cameron Carr on the fringe of the first round. That was until I got the chance to watch him live in Las Vegas at the Players Era and then it became clear that was way too low. With Carr's combination of length, athleticism, shot-making, and scoring, he's now played his way to the fringe of the lottery, even if he does have to keep building up his body.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Draft: 10 observations from a loaded Players Era event in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington's Steinbach moves upThe most notable riser in the frontcourt is Washington's Hannes Steinbach. The freshman from Germany has real size and strength with great hands and a soft touch. He's a high-volume rebounder and showing some flashes of being able to stretch the floor. Steinbach's understanding of the nuances of ball-screen play is also exemplary. The way the NBA is now trending back towards bigger frontlines is also relevant, since he fits better in that better then he does four around one schemes.\nNew to the Big BoardThis iteration of the big board also includes some new names. Texas Tech's Christian Anderson and Duke's Patrick Ngongba are both making their debut, and making it in first-round territory. Questions about Anderson's size will linger, but his skill and productivity are undeniable. For Ngongba, the lack of lateral quickness will remain a concern, but the shot-blocking and floor-spacing is intriguing enough to compensate when he's healthy. Other notable newcomers include Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson (30), Wake Forest's Juke Harris (40), and Alabama's Amari Allen (44).\nBig Board Top 101Darryn PetersonKansasPG6-6205Fr2AJ DybantsaBYUSF6-9215Fr3Cameron BoozerDukePF6-9250Fr4Caleb WilsonNorth CarolinaPF6-10215Fr5Mikel BrownLouisvillePG6-4190Fr6Nate AmentTennesseePF6-10207Fr7Kingston FlemingsHoustonPG6-4190Fr8Jayden QuaintanceKentuckyC6-10255So9Koa PeatArizonaPF6-8235Fr10Thomas HaughFloridaSF6-9215JrThe Big Board has been updated to include the top 60 NBA Draft Prospects\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe University of Hawaii football team rarely has had to travel for a bowl game, as 23 of the 26 contests in which it appeared were played in the Aloha State. That advantage hasn't exactly translated to success, as the Rainbow Warriors went 10-13 in those bowls.Hawaii (8-4) has the opportunity to improve its record in local bowl games on Wednesday as it takes on California (7-5) at 8 p.m. ET in the 2025 Hawaii Bowl at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex in Honolulu. The Rainbow Warriors, who appeared in now-defunct bowl games in their home state such as the Poi Bowl, Pineapple Bowl, Aloha Bowl and Oahu Bowl, have played in the Hawaii Bowl nine previous times -- most recently in 2019, when they posted a 38-34 victory over BYU.The Rainbow Warriors are 5-4 in the Hawaii Bowl and 12-14 overall in their bowl appearances after defeating Houston 28-14 in the 2020 New Mexico Bowl. California, which saw its bowl record fall to 12-13-1 with its 24-13 loss to UNLV in last year's LA Bowl, is making its second appearance in a bowl game held in Hawaii, with its first being a 42-38 loss to Navy in the 1996 Aloha Bowl. This year's Hawaii Bowl takes center stage on Wednesday, as there are no games on the NBA, NHL and college basketball schedules. The Rainbow Warriors are 1.5-point favorites against the Golden Bears in the latest consensus college football odds, with the over/under set at 51.5.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 24. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchHawaii Bowl: Hawaii vs. CaliforniaTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Honolulu | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: California -105 | Expert: Hawaii +1.5 (-110, Jeff Hochman)Both teams ended their regular seasons on a high note, as Hawaii defeated Wyoming 27-7 and California edged then-No. 21 SMU 38-35. This essentially is a home game for the Rainbow Warriors, who won six of their seven contests in Honolulu this year. The Golden Bears split their six road contests in 2025, with one of their victories coming in overtime against then-No. 15 Louisville. Cal quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who is a native of Hawaii, is 18th in the nation with an average of 259.8 passing yards and has thrown for more than 300 yards in each of his team's last two wins. The freshman set a season high with four touchdown passes in the regular-season finale, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees him doing enough to pick up a victory in the Hawaii Bowl as the Golden Bears win in 59% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman (+542 on his last 16 college football against-the-spread picks) likes the fact that Hawaii is third in the country in red-zone scoring and has a plus-3.6 point differential with QB Micah Alejado, who is ninth nationally with 283.2 passing yards per game. Hochman managed to clock in early on the Rainbow Warriors and got them at +1.5.Looking aheadNFLLions at VikingsTime: 4:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Minneapolis | TV: Netflix | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Lions -7.5 (-105) | Expert: Over 44.5 (-105, R.J. White)This is a must-win game for the Lions, whose hopes of making three consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 1993-95 are hanging by a thread. Detroit has lost three of its last four contests and needs to win out while the Green Bay Packers lose their final two games in order to earn a wild card berth. The Lions dropped a 27-24 decision to Minnesota at home in Week 9, and the Vikings enter the rematch with a three-game winning streak that has followed a four-game slide. Max Hosmer will be under center for Minnesota in place of J.J. McCarthy (hand), and the SportsLine Projection Model believes that will be a significant advantage for the Lions and is leaning toward a cover by Detroit. SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White (+458 on his last 33 NFL over/under picks) thinks the Lions will produce points as usual and the Vikings will do enough against Detroit's banged-up secondary for the Over to hit.Broncos at ChiefsTime: 8:15 p.m., Thursday | Location: Kansas City, Mo. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Chiefs +13.5 (-112) | Expert: RJ Harvey Over 14.5 carries (-114, PropBetGuy)Kansas City's nine-year reign atop the AFC West is over and Denver already has secured its second straight playoff berth after enduring an eight-year drought. The race for a new division champion got tighter last week as the Broncos were beaten 34-20 at home by the Jacksonville Jaguars to end their 11-game winning streak and shrink their lead to one game over the Los Angeles Chargers, who topped the Cowboys 34-17 in Dallas for their fourth straight victory. The Chiefs have lost four in a row and are down to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun as Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew are done for the season with knee injuries. Denver will be eager to atone for last week's performance and move closer to securing their first AFC West title since 2015, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't feel a blowout will occur as its simulations have the Chiefs covering the spread 60% of the time. Broncos running back RJ Harvey had only seven carries against Jacksonville after reaching double digits in each of his previous four outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (43-25, +1433 on his last 68 NFL player prop picks) expects his workload to be much heavier this week.NBASpurs at ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Thunder -9.5 (-106)The NBA gave its fans a nice present when it scheduled a matchup between the top two teams in the Western Conference on Christmas Day. San Antonio has used a seven-game winning streak to get within 3 1/2 games of Oklahoma City, which won 24 of its first 25 games -- including 16 straight from Nov. 7-Dec. 10 -- but has lost three of its last five. Two of those defeats came against the Spurs, who ended the Thunder's lengthy winning streak with a 111-109 triumph in Las Vegas on Dec. 13 in the NBA Cup semifinals and cruised to a 130-110 victory at home two days ago. Stephon Castle was a major offensive contributor for San Antonio in both games, as he was one of three members of the team with 22 points in the first win and scored 24 on Tuesday. Reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is second in the league in scoring with an average of 32.5 points, led all players in both contests with 29 and 33 points. The Thunder haven't lost back-to-back games since Apr. 4-6 of last season and have dropped three to the Spurs in one campaign only once since 2010-11. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Thunder answering the bell in a big way Thursday as they cover the large spread in 62% of its simulations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Something serious is happening in San Antonio, where the Spurs handed the Thunder a 130-110 loss on Tuesday to move into sole possession of the Western Conference's No. 2 seed at 22-7. The Spurs have now given OKC half of its four losses this season, both coming over the last 10 days. The Thunder, who lost just once through their first 25 games, have actually lost three of their last five, with the other defeat coming at the hands of the Timberwolves, who have very quietly won 10 of their last 12. If you truly want to believe OKC is beatable, this is your time as the ease of their early schedule turns upside down. Zooming out, the consensus remains that the top of the Western Conference belongs to the Thunder, Nuggets and Rockets. The Lakers are a wild card. The Timberwolves are trying to knock on the door. But at the moment, the Spurs are the team that is threatening to kick the damn thing down, if they haven't already. Would it be easier to slap the \"few years away\" tag on the Spurs? Sure. Give them time, everyone would like to say. Think long term. Let the supporting cast develop. Hell, let Victor Wembanyama develop. The guy is barely old enough to drink legally.\nBut what if this is really happening right now? Take an honest look at this team and find a reason why they can't beat anyone in a seven-game series that doesn't include \"they're just not ready.\" Do they not have a superstar? Do they not have a second offensive star? Are they not deep enough? Not versatile enough? Do they not have the sixth-best shooting percentage (including a top-10 3-point percentage) in the league? Do they not have multiple ball handlers and playmakers? Do they not have a top-five offense and defense? OK, you got me. They're sixth in defense. Seriously, what non-narrative, strictly basketball argument can you make that Spurs aren't an elite team? If you've got one, I'd love to hear it. Until then, let's talk about why this bright future everyone likes to put off in the distance has actually already arrived. Wemby changes everythingWe know how much Victor Wembanyama changes a basketball game, and yet I'm not sure we are ready to fully accept how much that changes a postseason outlook that we still want to believe is about experience over all else. A lot of people said the same thing about the Warriors in 2015. The masses just weren't ready to see what Stephen Curry was doing and how much it was changing everything we knew about the game. \nIndeed, Wembanyama warps defensive space in the same way Curry does offensive space. The range from which he can destroy your offense is a geometric anomaly. Jump shooters have to change their entire calculus when he's closing out. Drivers require multiple extra steps of separation to avoid erasure, and they're still looking over their shoulder. Wemby doesn't just blocks shots (incidentally, his streak of 101 straight games with at least one block ended on Tuesday); he scares you into not even taking them. To say this changes everything is an understatement, and it's also to say nothing about Wemby's own offensive dominance, where he shatters everything you thought you knew about spacing and potential ground coverage. Giannis has given us a taste of this, but not before Wembanyama did you ever have consider the possibility that a guy might take a roll pass from the top of the circle and easily get home without taking a single dribble. Since his return from a month-long calf-strain absence, Wembanyama has been coming off the bench and has only played 20 minutes per game, and still he averaged 17.8 points, 9.2 rebounds and two blocks on 56% shooting over his first six games back (this includes the NBA Cup championship that doesn't technically count toward stats). \nThere isn't a single other player in the league who has met these statistical bars this season, and this guy has come back from a month off to do it in 20 minutes a night off the bench. Per 36 minutes (roughly what he played in seven November games), Wembanyama has averaged 31 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists and 3.5 blocks on 56% shooting, including 42% from 3, in his five official December games. All told, he's the only player in the league averaging at least 23 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three blocks, and he's clearing those numbers comfortably. He is truly matchup proof. Put a big man on him and he's making him look foolish with his handle and array of shot making (ask Anthony Davis, one of the better big man defenders in the world, who tasted the full seasoning of Wemby's 40-piece cooking in the season opener). Put a small defender on him (as has been a frequent strategy), and he's rising up for jumpers with an shot-contest imperviousness that makes Kevin Durant jealous. On top of it all, the guy might be one of the league few truly competitive psychopaths. Victor Wembanyama is a monster. We know this. What we didn't know, or at least what we weren't so sure about, was just how good the rest of the Spurs were going to be. \nAn elite support staffPrior to the season, you didn't have to be a basketball savant to look at the Spurs' roster and point to a lot of really good players outside of Wemby, but when they went 9-3 while Wembanyama was out with a major win over the Nuggets, it was a real eye-opener. This team is a lot more than just Wembanyama. Stephon Castle is making 60% of his 2-pointers and looks like a Jimmy Butler in the making. When he and Wemby have been on the court together, San Antonio has outscored opponents by more than 14 points per 100 possessions with what would rank as the No. 1 defense in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. De'Aaron Fox averaged 25.5 points and 6.8 assists on 48/40/83 shooting splits in the month Wemby was out. He is the second star you need in a postseason series where every opponent is going to do everything in its power to limit Wembanyama. Devin Vassell is having one of the best seasons you've likely heard nothing about. There are two kinds of good shooters in basketball: Those who look to shoot, and those who can't wait to shoot. Vassell can't wait. He hunts shots like prime Klay Thompson. He's shooting 40% from 3 on seven attempts a night and has the league's 13th-highest \"Win probability added\" number, both overall and in the Clutch, via Inpredictable. Harrison Barnes leads the league with 35 corner 3s and is shooting 40% from beyond the arc overall. He is a perfect 3-and-D role player until you start thinking that's all he can do, at which point he overpowers you with back-to-the-basket force, show-and-go drives and crafty interior footwork. Luke Kornet is what Isaiah Hartenstein is to the Thunder: The No 2 big who is actually a No. 1. Scorers are shooting over four percentage points worse when defended by Kornet -- a number right in line with Anthony Davis -- and when Kornet has been with the starters in place of Wembanyama the Spurs have won those minutes by over 11 points per 100 possessions, per CTG.Keldon Johnson should be in Sixth Man of the Year conversations. He is pure energy and has been incredible getting downhill as a powerful paint scorer. His 57% mid-range clip is top 10 among wings. His 132.7 points per 100 shot attempts ranks in the 93rd percentile, per CTG. He went for 25 on five 3-pointers in the Tuesday win over OKC.  Dylan Harper is going to be an absolute stud when he starts to shoot and score more efficiently, but in the meantime he's already a major impact player as basically a third point guard. The No. 2 overall pick can get two feet in the paint whenever he wants. He's strong. Forceful. Over San Antonio's last two NBA Cup elimination games he combined for 45 points on 8-of-12 3-point shooting, then he turned around and was one of the best players on the floor against OKC with only four points, tallying 10 assists and five steals with zero turnovers in 20 minutes. All of this speaks to a level of versatility that makes San Antonio a scary postseason threat. It would be one thing if Wembanyama had to play superman at 21 years old over night, but he doesn't (even if he's sort of a superhero just in his natural state). That would burn out. But the Spurs can beat you a bunch of ways with a bunch of different catalysts. Consider that on Tuesday night the Spurs got 12 points from Wemby, six points from Fox, four points from Harper, and beat the best team in the world by 20 points. Over their last eight games, they have had seven different leading scorers. Eight guys are averaging double-digit points. Nine are playing at least 20 minutes a night. \nJeremy Sochan might be their best perimeter defender and is barely a rotation player because the Spurs don't have to forfeit offense for defense, or vice versa. Everyone they put on the floor can do everything. In a postseason setting, to have three primary ball handlers, all of whom share that duty when they share the floor, and at least four premium individual shot creators is a luxury very few teams enjoy. The Spurs can play small. They can do the two-big thing -- with Wembanyama and Kornet on the court they are outscoring opponents by 7.8 points per 100 possessions with an basically impenetrable 100.9 defensive rating, per CTG. Again, I defy anyone to find me a reason that the Spurs shouldn't be considered a legitimate threat to beat any team in the world in a seven-game series. That's not to suggest they will win the whole thing, or hell, even get out of the first round. The Western Conference is a bloodbath. It's just to say they're just as capable as any non-OKC team and, well, they've beaten OKC twice with a chance to do it again on Christmas. \nThe Spurs are, right now, one of the five best teams in the league without a question, and if you're a top five team, you are, by any definition, ready. The fact that they're going to be even better in the years to come is another, even scarier story. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, South Carolina's women's basketball team made a stunning announcement: French phenom Alicia Tournebize has signed with the school and will join the team after the holiday break. Tournebize, a 6-foot-7 center who has been playing professionally in France for Bourges Basket, will be eligible to play immediately. \"Alicia has an incredible skill set and basketball IQ,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said in a press release. \"She has great touch around the rim, can shoot it out to the 3-point line and is a shot blocker. We're excited that she and her family chose to bring her game to Columbia, and the FAMS are going to enjoy what she adds to our team on the court and off.\"Ahead of South Carolina's return to action on Dec. 28 against Providence, let's take a closer look at this unique midseason acquisition. Who is Tournebize, and how could she help the Gamecocks' title hopes? The basicsPosition: CenterHeight: 6-feet-7Previous club: Bourges BasketCountry: FranceAge: 18Tournebize has been a name to watch among international prospects for a few years, but she really burst onto the scene this summer due to her breakout performance for France at the FIBA U18 Women's EuroBasket tournament. She averaged 12.1 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks on 54.9% shooting to help France win the bronze medal, and was named to the All-Star Five. \nDuring the bronze medal game against Belgium, she threw down a huge two-handed slam that went viral. \nTournebize has been playing professionally for Bourges Basket, who participate in La Boulangère Wonderligue (the top professional women's basketball league in France) and EuroLeague (a pan-European competition to crown the best team on the continent, akin to the Champions League in soccer). Due to her age and inexperience, Tournebize played sparingly for Bourges this season in both the LBW and EuroLeague. Her stats were almost identical in both competitions: 7.6 minutes, 2.9 points, 1.7 rebounds in the LBW and 7.3 minutes, 2.4 points and 1.9 rebounds in EuroLeague. \nWhy now?Player developmentWe don't have a specific answer from Tournebize, who was not quoted in South Carolina's press release, and only gave a brief quote in Bourges' press release that did not address her decision-making process. \"Bourges has helped me grow, both on and off the court. I am leaving today with everything I have learned here and with the desire to proudly represent the colors of my training club,\" Tournebize said, as translated into English. A statement from the club, again translated into English, does note that the move was made to \"prioritize the player's development. Here's Bourges' statement:\n\"This decision, which was carefully considered and reached through respectful dialogue, reflects the shared desire of both parties to prioritize the player's development while preserving the club's sporting integrity, in accordance with the mutual commitments set out in a settlement agreement.\"As previously mentioned, Tournebize was playing limited minutes for Bourges this season, and it's difficult for teenagers to earn more substantial roles overseas. At South Carolina, there's a clear pathway for Tournebize to become one of the Gamecocks' key players -- if not this season, then certainly in years to come. Staley is also one of the best coaches in all of basketball, and has a proven track record of developing bigs into top WNBA draft picks. Tournebize will have a chance to follow in the footsteps of A'ja Wilson, Aliyah Boston and Kamilla Cardoso. \nFamily historyIt's also worth noting that Tournebize's mother, French legend Isabelle Fijalkowski, came over to the States and played college basketball for Colorado before going on to the WNBA. Tournebize's mother would have been able to advise her on the benefits of playing college basketball. Potential payday?In terms of money, South Carolina's release stated that Tournebize was on a \"training-intern contract.\" It's unclear how much she was making for Bourges, but the nature of her status as a \"training-intern\" suggests it wasn't a lucrative deal. There are restrictions on international student athletes' ability to make money through NIL deals and direct payments from schools, but it is now possible, if complicated, for them to get paid. Depending on what South Carolina is able to work out, it is possible Tournebize could earn more in Columbia than she was in France. \nWhat does Tournebize bring to the Gamecocks?SizeTournebize's size is an obvious benefit. At 6-foot-7, she will immediately be the tallest player on the team, and one of the tallest players in the country. Per CBB Analytics, there are currently only six Division I women's basketball players standing 6-foot-7 or taller. Sania Feigin graduated and the Gamecocks are missing both Ashlyn Watkins (away from basketball) and Chloe Kitts (torn ACL) this season, which has decimated their frontcourt depth. Madina Okot and Joyce Edwards are the only players above 6-foot-1 who play significant minutes. Due to injuries, the Gamecocks have often had only eight available players, and simply having another player who can contribute will be a big boost. (South Carolina's 17.5 bench points per game ranks 198th in the country.) That Tournebize will help their frontcourt depth is even better for Staley. \nTournebize is slim, and may struggle at times to deal with more physical players in the paint. A full offseason with South Carolina will help change that moving forward, though. AthleticismTournebize moves very well for her size, and can get up and down the floor. She's also agile with good footwork and lateral mobility, which helps her in halfcourt situations on both sides of the ball. And, of course, there aren't many players throwing down dunks like she did this summer for France. Paint presenceTournebize's size makes her a real presence in the paint on both sides of the ball. At U18 EuroBasket this summer, she scored efficiently around the basket, and was fourth in rebounds and fourth in blocks for the tournament. Again, she needs to become stronger, but her height and length will help her make an immediate impact. \nMid-range gameTournebize rarely steps behind the arc, but she is comfortable in the mid-range, where she has a smooth jumper. For a team that takes 62.4% of its field goal attempts in the paint, having a big who can provide any kind of spacing is going to be helpful. \nTournebize is only 18 years old, and will be adjusting to a new country, a new coaching staff, new teammates and a new league. She's not going to step on the floor and immediately start dominating, and she may not even play that much, especially initially. However, Staley wouldn't have brought her over midseason if she didn't think she could help, and adding a player as talented as Tournebize is a real boost for the Gamecocks. Other title contenders are not making this sort of addition ahead of the new year. The 12-1 Gamecocks, who lost in the national championship game last season, are ranked No. 3 in the country and are one of the main contenders looking to knock UConn off its throne.  \nHow does this affect Tournebize's WNBA Draft prospects?One of the more interesting aspects of this move is that it actually delays Tournebize's WNBA draft eligibility. Under the current rules -- which could be subject to change in the new collective bargaining agreement -- international prospects must turn 20 in the year in which the draft takes place, while domestic prospects must turn 22 in the the year in which the draft takes place. Once Tournebize begins playing in the NCAA, that will make her a domestic prospect. \nIf Tournebize had stayed overseas, she would have been eligible for the 2027 WNBA Draft. Now, barring any changes to the rules, she'll have to wait for the 2029 WNBA Draft. Has this ever happened before?While Tournebize is the most high-profile example, she is not the first international player to sign with a school during the middle of the season. Auburn added Chinese guard Yuting Deng in January just last season (Deng has since transferred and now plays for Baylor), and Egyptian center Jana El Alfy joined UConn in January of 2023, though she did not play with the team until the following season. Furthermore, two Australian prospects, center Callie Hinder (Arizona) and forward Zoe Jackson (Indiana) will join their respective schools this January, though both plan to redshirt and will not play this season. There are also examples of this happening on the men's side of college basketball. Israeli center Yonatan Levy joined UW-Green Bay in January last season (he has since transferred to Pepperdine) and Russian big man Kirill Elatontsev will suit up for Oklahoma starting in January. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've got a full slate of games on tap for Week 17, including three games on Thursday for Christmas and two games on Saturday. A full slate of games means a jam-packed injury report, unfortunately; and because it's late in the season, the reports are even deeper than they would be earlier in the year.In the space below, you will be able to see game statuses for the Thursday kickoffs, as well as updates on key players from the initial injury reports for Saturday and Sunday's slates of games.All NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders (+8.5) (Thursday)Commanders: Nick Bellore (concussion), Jayden Daniels (left elbow), Marcus Mariota (right hand/quad), Daron Payne (back), Laremy Tunsil (oblique) OUTWashington is down to Josh Johnson as its starting quarterback. It will be without important pieces on the offensive and defensive lines. Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings (+7.5) (Thursday)Lions: Avonte Maddox (back/illness), Giovanni Manu (knee) OUT; Marcus Davenport (shoulder), Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest), Khalil Dorsey (illness), Tom Kennedy (abdomen), Christian Mahogany (fibula), Alim McNeill (abdomen), David Montgomery (illness), Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee), Amik Robertson (hand), Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) QUESTIONABLEVikings: T.J. Hockenson (shoulder), Ryan Kelly (concussion), Jordan Mason (ankle), J.J. McCarthy (right hand) OUT; Brian O'Neill (heel) QUESTIONABLEThe Lions seemingly have half their roster listed as questionable here, including two important offensive linemen, their top wide receiver and an important running back. They're also banged up on all levels of the defense.\nMinnesota's offense is extremely banged up heading into this game. Max Brosmer is starting in McCarthy's place and he could be without two starting offensively linemen, in addition to two of his key weapons.Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs (+13.5) (Thursday)Broncos: Karene Reid (hamstring), Nate Adkins (knee), Pat Bryant (concussion), Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) OUTChiefs: Jake Briningstool (hamstring) OUT; Jaylon Moore (knee), Derrick Nnadi (illness), Nikko Remigio (knee), George Karlaftis (illness), Nick Bolton (illness) QUESTIONABLEThe Broncos will be without one of their rotational receivers as well as one of their premier linebackers but should remain heavily favored in large part due to Kansas City's volume of injuries.Kansas City placed by Rashee Rice, Tyquan Thornton, Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson all on injured reserve. The Chiefs are depleted all over the place and appear to have an illness sweeping through the defensive side of their locker room.\nHouston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5) (Saturday)Denico Autry, Trent Brown and Aireontae Ersery remained out of practice on Wednesday. Azeez Al-Shaair tremained limited, while Kamari Lassiter and Derek Stingley Jr. upgraded to limited participation. Dalton Schultz and Woody Marks got in full practices.Kimani Vidal, RJ Mickens and Jamaree Salyer remained out of practice on Wednesday. Mekhi Becton and Bud Dupree were limited.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season has been full of drama, but that drama might not carry over into the final week of the season. Heading into Week 17, there are still four playoff spots up for grabs and seven division races that haven't been decided, which seems like a recipe for a dramatic finish over the final two weeks. The problem for the NFL is that there's a nightmare scenario where almost every division race comes to an end and every playoff spot gets clinched in Week 17 and it's a scenario that's not too far-fetched. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there has never been a season where EVERY playoff spot and EVERY division was clinched before the final week of the season, so this would definitely be an unwanted situation by the NFL. Let's break down the NFL's nightmare scenario: AFC WESTThere are two notable games with playoff implications in the AFC West this weekend: Broncos at ChiefsTexans at ChargersHow the division race could end this week: A Denver win on Christmas Day combined with a Chargers loss to Houston would clinch the AFC West for the Broncos. \nAFC NORTHThere are two games in the AFC North that could lead to the division race ending: Ravens at PackersSteelers at BrownsHow the division race could end this week:  A win by Green Bay would clinch a playoff spot for the Packers AND it would also clinch the AFC North for the Steelers. That seems like the kind of result that would cause a nightmare for the NFL, so let's assume that happens. AFC SOUTHThere are two big games happening in the AFC South in Week 17: Texans at ChargersJaguars at Colts Breakdown: In our nightmare scenario for the NFL, we have the Texans beating the Chargers, so there's no way the Jaguars would be able to clinch the division in Week 17. \nAFC EASTThe Patriots could win the AFC East this week. Let's check out the two games that will have an impact on the division race: Patriots at JetsEagles at BillsHow the division race could end this week: If the Patriots beat the Jets and the Bills lose to Philadelphia, then New England will clinch the division title, and that's exactly what we're going to have happen in our nightmare scenario. Now, let's head to the NFC. There are only three division races going on in this conference because the Eagles have already clinched the NFC East. \nNFC NORTHThe Bears are the only team that has clinched a playoff spot in the NFC North, but that could change this week: Bears at 49ersRavens at PackersHow the division race could end this week: The Bears will win the division with a win over the 49ers while the Packers can clinch a playoff spot with a win over the Ravens. In our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Bears beat the 49ers and the Packers beat the Ravens. (The Lions are still alive in the playoff race, but we're not going to worry about them here. If they lose to the Vikings on Christmas, they'll be eliminated. Even if they win on Christmas, they'd still be eliminated on Saturday if Green Bay beats Baltimore). NFC SOUTHThere are two huge games happening in the NFC South this week: Seahawks at PanthersBuccaneers at DolphinsHow the division race could end this week: The Panthers will win the division with a win over the Seahawks combined with a Dolphins win over the Buccaneers and for the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll assume that happens. \nNFC WESTThe NFC West already has three playoff teams and all three teams can still clinch the No. 1 overall seed. Here's a look at the big games in this division in Week 17: Seahawks at PanthersBears at 49ersRams at Falcons Breakdown: For the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Seahawks and 49ers both lose while the Rams win. If all of this happens, six of the eight division races would be decided and all 14 playoff spots would be clinched, which would certainly be a nightmare scenario heading into Week 18. \nHere's what the playoff standings would look like if our nightmare scenario played out in Week 17:  AFC1. Broncos -- AFC West winner2. Patriots -- AFC East winner3. Jaguars -- AFC South leader4. Steelers -- AFC North winner5. Texans -- Clinched playoff spot6. Chargers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Bills -- Clinched playoff spotNFC1. Bears -- NFC North winner2. Rams -- NFC West leader3. Eagles -- NFC East winner4. Panthers -- NFC South winner5. Seahawks -- Clinched playoff spot6. 49ers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Packers -- Clinched playoff spot\nThe NFL doesn't announce the Week 18 schedule until Week 17 is over and with this scenario, it would be almost impossible to come up with an entertaining schedule for the final week of the season. The league needs a doubleheader for Saturday and a prime-time game for Sunday, but there wouldn't be a single game with a \"win-and-in\" scenario. The No. 1 seed in both the NFC and AFC would be up for grabs, so the NFL would likely focus on those. You could put Chargers-Broncos in the Sunday night spot because Denver would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed, but if the Patriots and Jaguars both lost earlier in the day, then the game would mean nothing to Denver. You could put Seahawks-49ers on Sunday night, but if the Rams beat the Cardinals earlier in the day, then L.A. would clinch the NFC West and the Seattle-San Francisco game would only be for wild card seeding. \nYou could put Lions-Bears on Sunday night. Assuming our nightmare scenario plays out in Week 17, the Bears would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed. The NFL doesn't like to put an eliminated team in the Sunday night slot, but it's not unprecedented. In 2022, the Lions were already eliminated but they got scheduled in the Sunday night game against a Packers team that needed a win to get to the playoffs. The Lions had nothing to play for, but they still managed to pull off a 20-16 stunner that kept Green Bay out of the postseason. Of course, the problem with putting Lions-Bears on Sunday night would be that if the Rams lost to Arizona, then the Bears would have already clinched the top seed heading into the game and they'd have nothing to play for. If there aren't any great options, the NFL could always just scrap the Sunday night game and that's exactly what happened in 2017, so there is precedent for that (You can read about the details of that situation here). Last year, the final game was between the Lions and Vikings with the winner earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC and the loser getting stuck in the wild card round. The Lions ended up thrashing Minnesota 31-9 to earn the NFC's only bye. A similar scenario could play out this year if both the Seahawks (at Panthers) and 49ers (vs. Bears) win on Sunday. If that happens, the NFC West and No. 1 seed would be on the line when the two teams meet in Week 18. You can bet the NFL would love to see that scenario and not the nightmare one I put together here. \n            ",

Among other things, we were asked what storylines we're most interested in following as this season progresses.One of my answers: Kentucky.The Wildcats beat Bellarmine 99-85 Tuesday to extend their winning streak to four games, improve to 9-4 on the season and remain No. 21 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan is No. 1 for the 15th consecutive day. That's the good. But the bad, or at least the concerning, is that just three days after starring in the second half of UK's 78-66 win over St. John's in the CBS Sports Classic, Jaland Lowe, the team's best point guard, was once again sidelined by a shoulder injury that dates to the preseason and has now resulted in the transfer from Pitt missing seven of Kentucky's first 13 contests.According to coach Mark Pope, the move was precautionary more than anything else -- and Pope added that he expects Lowe to \"play every game\" moving forward, starting with the SEC opener at Alabama on Jan. 3. But the truth is that nobody can, with any degree of certainty, predict how Lowe's season will unfold. Remember, he tried to play in the first half against UNC, entered the game a few minutes after tip-off but then exited abruptly after reaggravating it just seven seconds later.Lowe missed the rest of the half.\nAt the risk of sounding hyperbolic, how Lowe's shoulder holds up really could be the difference between the Wildcats making the 2026 Final Four or them struggling through parts of the SEC schedule. So, yeah, that'll be one of the biggest storylines to follow as the calendar flips to January -- whether UK can find a groove with Lowe consistently running things, or if he's in and out of the lineup too much to matter.

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the Court Report, Matt Norlander's in-season college basketball notebook feature that provides insider information and a deeper look at the trends and things to know around the sport. Consider this edition a bonus present under your proverbial college hoops tree, especially amid a light week for games. Merry Christmas! The further we get into this spectacular season, the more I'm convinced the quality at the top of men's college basketball is deeper and more impressive than any season in the past decade, if not more.It's easy to get that impression when you see Michigan routinely dismantling teams by 30, if not 40 points; or Iowa State handing a robust Purdue team the program's worst home loss ever; or Arizona becoming the only squad in history to win five of its first nine games against ranked competition; or Duke and BYU combining to go 23-2 behind the phenoms who might be the top two picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. There's Gonzaga's return to supremacy with its 12-1 run out of the gate, an introduction matched by UConn's restoration to elite-level play with its own 12-1 start. North Carolina is also 12-1 heading into 2026, putting on its best nonconference showing since the 2008-09 team won the national title -- and doing so with Caleb Wilson, its best freshman since Cole Anthony. \nHouston? Very much good enough to win it all after falling one shot short in April. Speaking of teams making recent Final Fours, Purdue getting back for the second time in three years wouldn't shock anyone who's paying attention. Also in the Big Ten: Michigan State sits at 11-1 and has one of the three best point guards in college basketball, Jeremy Fears. Vanderbilt and Nebraska -- Vanderbilt! And Nebraska! -- are undefeated and look headed toward special campaigns as well.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Fred Hoiberg's Huskers the feel-good story of season; Boozer-Yax NPOY race heats up\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's been a conspicuous lack of upsets, but the exchange for that is a run on high-end teams that might give us the most competitive season in recent history. As Christmas arrives, there are six undefeated groups and 21 more one-loss teams still on the books. In addition to the attractiveness of so much winning from so many interesting teams over the past seven weeks, there's data to back up the idea that we're in the midst of an unusually strong season at the top of college basketball.  \nAs of Christmas, seven teams boast an adjusted efficiency margin of 30.00 or better at KenPom.com (with two more, Vanderbilt and Illinois, clearing the 29.00 threshold). And while intra-conference play promises to shave off some of the sweetness on some of these teams over the next 10 weeks, there's still a realistic chance that 2025-26 will yield the strongest group of national title contenders since at least 2014-15. That's when Kentucky made it to the Final Four with an undefeated record and the Wisconsin team that upset Kentucky fell to Duke in the NCAA title game. Those three teams in addition to 33-3 Villanova, 34-4 Arizona and 30-4 Virginia all wound up above +30.00 in adjusted efficiency margin. Kentucky's undefeated push into April overshadowed the fact that all six were viable national title contenders.This season looks primed to produce even more. For reference, here's how many teams finished above +30.00 in adjusted efficiency margin at KenPom since '14-15. 2014-15: 62015-16: 12016-17: 12017-18: 12018-19: 52019-20: 12020-21: 22021-22: 12022-23: 02023-24: 32024-25: 62025-26: 7 as of Christmas; TBD by AprilLast season was the mighty SEC's doing as much as anything, and you can make the case that this year is merely competing with what we saw a season ago in terms of might at the top ... until you realize this season is outpacing 2024-25's impressive output. \nOn Christmas Day in 2024, the top 10 teams in the AP poll weren't winning as much or by more on average than this season's cream of the crop. Right now, the collective record for the AP's top 10 teams -- Arizona, Michigan, Iowa State, UConn, Purdue, Duke, Gonzaga, Houston, Michigan State and BYU -- is 113-7. A year ago at this time the AP's top 10 were 105-13, a win percentage difference of .53 points. And a year ago on Christmas there were four teams at +30.00 in efficiency margin, not seven, and only five at +29.00 or better instead of the nine we've got as of today. Going all the way back to the start of this century, here's how the top 10 teams in the AP poll aggregated in wins and losses after seven full weeks/at the start of Week 8 in each of their respective seasons. This year has provided the fourth-most wins to this point in the calendar by the top 10 AP teams since 2000-01.\n                                                                    CBS Sports research\n                                                            Losses are sure to come in sporadic doses for the top teams, but every indication to this point is that we can and will have more than just two or three \"great\" groups. A common and lazy lament in many recent seasons by some pundits was to suggest college basketball lacked any great teams; now we seem to have been gifted a bevy of them.\nI have more good news: Beyond the strength at the top, college basketball also has a chance to have its best offensive season ever. The sport's 365 schools are combining to average 78.1 points per game, a number that will naturally drop over the next three months. Conference play leads to fewer possessions and tighter whistles, which will bring down scoring. (Happens every season.) Still, the scoring record is in sight, as is efficiency. Teams are pacing to score more points per possession this season than ever before. It's been a dream start so far. I think — I hope! — the patterns persist through January, February and into March.As we ready for league play, I think the list of schools that can win a national championship — teams truly capable of winning six games in the Big Dance, a massive ask — fills up to 12, an abnormally high number for this time of year. That figure could whittle by four or five come March, and it easily could see three or four candidates not on my list now vault into the discussion before long. But heading into 2026, my dozen-deep ranking of title contenders reads: Michigan, Arizona, Iowa State, UConn, Purdue, Duke, Houston, Gonzaga, Michigan State, Illinois, BYU and North Carolina. \nThose 12 are a combined 132-11. A remarkable group. You'll notice there's not an SEC team in there. At least not yet. I'm just as surprised as you are. So let's talk about that next.  After epic '24-25, the SEC has taken big step backThe SEC falls behind the Big 12, Big Ten and ACC in wins vs. ranked competition this season. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The SEC's collective 2024-25 season was so impressive, it almost definitely cannot be matched in the decades to come. The league sent 14 of its 16 teams to the NCAA Tournament, in addition to having two No. 1 seeds; it put seven teams in the Sweet 16; saw its two 1-seeds (Auburn, Florida) make the Final Four; and Florida won the national championship. That kind of run is almost impossible to duplicate. And the grandiosity of it all is what's making this season's SEC look so down in comparison.\nMissouri's humiliating no-show loss Monday night to Illinois (91-48, the largest margin in the history of that rivalry) in the annual Braggin' Rights game was the league's 50th nonconference defeat through the first 49 days of the season. Last season, the SEC lost 23 non-con games TOTAL — including all postseason play — leading to a staggering 185-23 record and an .889 win percentage. We will never see a league-wide success rate like that again. This season, the SEC has a .742 win percentage (144-50 overall) and its impotency against ranked teams and fellow high-major schools is worrying evidence against the league's chances of getting more than eight or nine into the field come March. A year ago, the SEC finished with 73 wins against high-major opponents. This year, the SEC's record vs. the other four Power Five leagues sits at 35-47. When you filter through for games vs. AP Top 25 teams at the times of those games, the SEC is in fifth in win percentage. Here's how the high-majors stack up vs. ranked opponents:\n» Big 12: 13-13 (.500)» ACC: 10-19 (.345)» Big Ten: 13-26 (.333)» Big East: 5-13 (.278)» SEC: 9-26 (.257)In Quad 1 games, the SEC is an ugly 15-36, even falling behind the ACC's 16-31 mark through Christmas week. Undefeated Vanderbilt is the only team above .500 against Q1 competition (3-0). And as for 12-0 Vandy, it has to be rated as the best SEC squad so far. But the Commodores haven't been given top-10 respect yet because they're yet to defeat a top-30 team. At KenPom, their non-con SOS is 86th. Far from awful, but also far from the high end of toughest schedules in the sport. The irony of the SEC clearly going through league-wide regression is KenPom nevertheless still (narrowly) rating the league No. 1. Here's why: Predictive models have preseason biases still having some (but not that much) influence seven weeks into the season. We call those \"priors,\" and in a month, they'll be phased out. When you filter the results purely based on win expectancy at Torvik, the SEC comes in at No. 3, slightly ahead of the ACC, thanks to not having any outright terrible teams.\nThe biggest knock on the league right now is, unlike the other four power conferences, I don't know who is a true national title contender at this stage. A year ago, you could've made a case for five or six. Now ... pick one? Vanderbilt, Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky -- would you take any of them right now to win at least four games in the NCAA Tournament, let alone six? I'm fascinated to see how this league plays out over the next nine weeks. I do think at least one SEC team emerges as a legitimate national title contender by the end of January. Dybantsa's dynamite December spikes his NPOY caseA week ago, right here at the Court Report, I laid out the compelling case Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg was building to compete with Duke's Cam Boozer for national player of the year. Well, AJ Dybantsa wasn't going to lurk on the outskirts any longer. The BYU stud freshman is now also officially in the mix after an outstanding December that ended in exclamation-point fashion Monday night (BYU's next game is Jan. 3 at Kansas State). Dybantsa became the first freshman this century to post a triple double with at least 30 points after he finished with 33 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and a pair of steals against lowly Eastern Washington, which 1-11 vs. D-I teams.  Even despite the awful competition, Dybantsa's performance was fitting after he vaulted himself to non-negotiable First Team All-American status over the past six games. BYU general manager Justin Young tweeted Dybantsa's December stats, which are the best of any player in the sport this month. Dybantsa's averages in the past six games: 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 2.3 steals, 65.9 FG%, 78.0 FT%, 2.5 turnovers, 29.4 3-pt% and just one foul in 193 minutes (!!) on the floor. \nAccording to Opta Stats, Dybantsa is \"the only Division I or NBA player in the last 30 seasons to have a calendar month\" with a minimum of five games played to average at least 25.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and shooting 65.0% or better from the field, all while not losing a game. Dybantsa is turning into the most dangerous scorer in college basketball. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            His talent and potential were obvious more than two years ago, when he was a rising junior who led the EYBL in scoring. He is delivering — exceeding, actually — on the hype. I caught Dybantsa in person earlier this month after BYU set a program record by overcoming a 22-point halftime deficit to beat Clemson at MSG. That was his official coming-out party for college basketball. Now he's positioning himself to jockey with Boozer, Lendeborg and anyone else (Joshua Jefferson, Caleb Wilson, Braden Smith, JT Toppin) that wants to join the party for NPOY. The one stat that's not yet getting enough attention, but will if it remains true by mid-January, is Boozer (23.3 ppg) and Dybantsa (23.1) are now 1-2 in scoring. Yes, nationally. That's a great development for the marketability of college basketball, especially since both players are vying for No. 1 overall pick status on teams capable of winning the national title.  I can't get enough of this season and the megawatt star power it's providing.   Norlander's news + nuggets  • Wrote above on Dybantsa, but another player who had a huge December for a national title contender was Gonzaga's Braden Huff. In five games, including three vs. power-conference teams, he averaged 24.4 points and 5.4 rebounds on absurd shooting splits: 53-of-74 (71.6%). He dropped a career-high 37 against Campbell on Dec. 17. If Huff is going to move into 15-plus points every night no matter what, then he and Graham Ike will be the best big man duo in college hoops.  • Best non-Gonzaga team outside the power-conference structure heading into January is Utah State. The Aggies are 10-1 and fall between 18th and 31st in every NCAA teamsheet metric. The 100-58 bludgeoning of a solid Colorado State team last weekend was a signal that this group is good enough to push for a legitimate seed (the 4-6 range) in March.   • Another mid-major to watch for that's quietly getting it done is Tulsa. Eric Konkol's group finished non-con at 12-1, its lone loss by one point at Kansas State. This is the best team in the American, and a big year is overdue; Tulsa hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game since 2003.  • Did you know: Not only are Iowa State, Vanderbilt and Nebraska flawless in men's hoops so far, but they're the only three schools with undefeated records in both men's and women's hoops. The four programs are a combined 73-0. I do wonder if this is the first time we've ever had three schools in men's and women's hoops all make it to Christmas without losing a game. • A tragic story over the weekend: Austin Peay canceled its game against UMKC after the team bus driver died during pre-game meal. The Govs will now go 20 days between games against a Division I opponent, the longest gap of the season -- and the longest since the 2020-21 COVID-impacted season. • Bill Self says out loud what most presumed was the case: Darryn Peterson's family is dictating when he'll return again. I know KU fans are growing tired of the waiting game, but my guess is he plays for the Jayhawks in their next game (Jan. 3 Big 12 opener at UCF). • On Monday, the Kansas City Chiefs announced approved plans for their new covered football stadium, with the debut set for 2031. I hate how the NFL is trying to make open-air stadiums outdated concepts. There is a college basketball angle to this, though: I can almost guarantee you that we'll have a Final Four at this stadium no later than 2035. • Speaking of new sports arenas, North Carolina is still not sure where its basketball teams will play in the 2030s and beyond. There is a debate over whether to refurbish the Dean Dome or build a shiny new arena that would be off-campus. More than 100 former players have signed a letter that, among other things, states, \"We further wish to honor Dean Smith's request that our cherished basketball brand and legacy always remain on campus.\" • I grew up reading Andy Katz's work at ESPN.com and I love that he's tapping back into that spirit more and more by writing for Seth Davis' HoopsHQ site. Here's his latest, on Indiana State coach Matthew Graves' return to coaching after having triple bypass heart surgery in October.• I was on hand in Jersey on Saturday to see Houston humble Arkansas, and my biggest regret on this Christmas Eve is not knowing only a few days ago that the commercial below existed. A friend texted me this on Tuesday; I only wish that I could have asked Kelvin Sampson and John Calipari about it. The two have coached more than 2,200 games, but only twice against each other. Yet, in 1995, they were highlighted in a commercial for Degree deodorant. I need this commercial recreated in 2026 with Sampson and Calipari, for sure, but let's also toss in Dan Hurley, Scott Drew and, why not, Sean Miller. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas — Players all around the NFL found out they made the Pro Bowl for the 2025 season on Tuesday, and the Dallas Cowboys ended up with five amid a 6-8-1, postseason-less year.Quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver George Pickens, left guard Tyler Smith, defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and kicker Brandon Aubrey were the five to earn the individual All-Star accolades for the Cowboys. Given how the year has gone on the field, Prescott wasn't in a celebratory mood when discussing the honor despite producing like a top-five quarterback a year removed from a season-ending hamstring injury in 2024.\"It's cool. It's something good within the season. Understanding every year I work my tail off to try to be the best quarterback I can for this team. Ultimately, I feel like I'm judged off of wins. I didn't get it done this season. However, the individual numbers, performance record, allowed an individual accolade, but that's 100% still a team deal,\" Prescott said Tuesday. \"When you're the quarterback of this team, to be able to put up numbers like that, you've got to have receivers like George, CeeDee, Ferg, the rest of the guys. And you've got to have a great offensive line. ... My success, that accolade, is 100% with each and every one of those guys in there. It's pretty cool to be a Pro Bowler, but at the end of the day, it's not what we're going for.\"\nDak PrescottNFL rankCompletion percentage 68.5%5thPassing yards4,1752ndPassing TD283rdExpected points added (EPA)/dropback0.177thPassing first downs2022ndDallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones took accountability for the Cowboys' 30-year Super Bowl drought after the team's Week 16 defeat against the Chargers on Sunday. A year like 2025 has everyone from top to bottom in Dallas looking in the mirror.\"I'll admit that the Cowboys management has played a big role (in the 30-year Super Bowl drought),\" Jones said postgame. \"But seriously, I'm very disappointed that the way we're structured, and my role, puts us here tonight. I'm tremendously disappointed.\"The 2025 season marks just the third of Prescott's 10-year career in which he will have played at least 12 games and missed the playoffs, along with 2017 and 2019. He'll be 33 years old at the start of the 2026 season, and he knows he's on the back nine of his NFL career. That's why Prescott plans to seek more input with Jones and the Cowboys' front office when it comes to communicating exactly what he feels the team needs to thrive going forward.\"We won't be back here in this spot. I feel like the last few times I've probably said that were playoff losses, right? So each year has its own troubles. ... I'm going to do my damnedest just controlling what I can, and you know as you get older, having more input, having more say-so and being asked more questions from the front office, maybe there's a little bit more that I can do. It's not just physically or me getting better at my game. Maybe it's speaking up and saying that, 'This will help, or I think this can help.' So, whatever it takes, I'm going to do my damnedest and make sure that I'm influencing and encouraging everybody else around me -- not just players -- to do the same.\"  Here's a look at three moves Prescott could influence once Dallas enters the offseason in two weeks.Re-signing WR George Pickens\nNew Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens broke out in his first year in Dallas at age 24, playing like a top-five player at his position while catching passes from Prescott. The Dallas duo has connected for 13 plays of 25 or more yards this season, tied for the third most in the NFL, and now they'll head to the Pro Bowl together.\"Super explosive,\" Pickens said of the connection he built in Year 1 with Prescott. \"I feel like that's one of the biggest things when you look back on the year, even though it's not over. Just look at the explosive plays that me, him, CeeDee [Lamb], Flo [Ryan Flournoy], everybody produced on offense. Javonte [Williams], too.\"Pickens' career year came at the perfect time, with the 2022 second-round pick set to become a free agent next offseason upon the expiration of his rookie deal.\"It improves my career, but as far as contractually, I can just wait until the offseason,\" Pickens said of making the Pro Bowl. \"Trying to finish up this season on a positive note.\" George PickensNFL rankCatches888thReceiving Yards1,3423rdReceiving TD97thReceiving First Downs693rdCatches of 25 yards or more  13T-3rdPickens would like to remain in Dallas, so Prescott will certainly look to make sure Jones knows he wants his co-No. 1 receiver back with the Cowboys for the foreseeable future. The success Pickens experienced in 2025 has enticed him to want to make Dallas his long-term home.\"Definitely, like I always said, the guys here, I feel like you can't get that everywhere,\" Pickens said. \"I kind of have been at other places -- top 30 visits when I was coming out in the pre-draft -- the guys here and the culture here are just a little different.\"Re-signing RB Javonte Williams\nDallas made 25-year-old running back Javonte Williams its first free agent signing in 2025, inking him to a one-year, $3 million deal in March. They got him at that price because he hadn't quite looked the same since a gruesome knee injury that resulted in multiple torn ligaments in 2022 with the Broncos. However, he fully bounced back from the effects of that injury to produce like a top-10 running back. Williams is certainly someone everyone involved with Dallas' offense would like to have around again in 2026.\"He certainly earned the right to be the bell cow here,\" coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"We like him in that role.\"Williams said last week that he's found a \"very special\" fit in Dallas. That's a fit Prescott would certainly like to remain going forward, given Williams is one of three players -- along with Tony Dorsett (1977) and Ezekiel Elliott (2016) -- to produce 1,000 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns in their first season with the Cowboys.\"You don't always want to just follow money and things like that,\" Williams said. \"You want to go somewhere where you can succeed and be a part of something that's special. I feel like it's very special here.\"Javonte WilliamsNFL rankCarries2397thRush yards1,1476thRush TD10T-7thRush first downs63T-4thKeeping Tyler Smith at left guard\nWith 2024 first-round left tackle Tyler Guyton sidelined with an ankle injury since Week 13, Dallas has had All-Pro left guard Tyler Smith protecting Prescott's blind side for the team's final three games of 2025. It's an arrangement the Cowboys are experimenting with to see if they may want to keep Smith in that role in the future, even though they made him the NFL's highest-paid interior offensive lineman this offseason with a four-year, $96 million contract extension.Guyton did play right tackle at Oklahoma, and current Cowboys right tackle Terence Steele leads the NFL in quarterback pressures allowed (42) this season, according to TruMedia. Dallas could save as much as $14 million if it designates Steele as a post-June 1 release. It is also worth noting Smith was a college left tackle at Tulsa.\n\"If you watch the way [Smith] played and how these guys functioned, we know he can play out there. We're not surprised. I'm not surprised,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \"At the end of the day, we made the move because we thought it gave us the best chance to win the next three games. That's the way it's going to be for these next two games now. We'll evaluate everything. It's no different from scheme. We'll evaluate everything.\"Smith earned the third Pro Bowl selection of his four-year career in 2025, as he was Pro Football Focus' sixth-highest-graded run-blocking guard with a 79.8 grade. He's all for being a team player, but he'd appreciate continuing to play the position that made him a second-team All-Pro in 2023 and a Pro Bowler again in 2025.\"Bro, I'm an All-Pro guard, bro. You feel me? That's the simple truth that we're just looking at stuff, purely off facts,\" Smith said Tuesday. \"So we'll see what happens. We'll have those conversations. Got to see where everybody's head is at.\"  At 6-foot-6 and 332 pounds with 34-inch arms, Smith feels his best position is guard. That's something Prescott may need to help Smith relay to Schottenheimer and Jones this offseason.\n\"I'm a strong guy obviously. I think I'm strong. I feel like a lot of the strengths that I have as a player are very good for me at the guard position,\" Smith said. \"I think I've had great vets around at the guard [Zack Martin] and tackle position [Tyron Smith], and I think that's really helped me be successful at both. But I really just think my strength and a variety of other things help me when I'm inside.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's Christmas Day tradition continues this year with a five-game slate featuring some of the best teams and players in the league, including the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder and reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander trying to avenge some recent losses against the up-and-coming San Antonio Spurs, led by Victor Wembanyama. Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, De'Aaron Fox, Jalen Williams, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, LeBron James, Luka Dončić, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards are some of the other stars who will be in action throughout the day. The action will tip off with a Madison Square Garden matinee featuring the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers, and conclude with a Mile High matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets. Before you settle in for 12 hours of hoops, let's take a closer look at the slate with an X-factor to keep an eye on and a bold prediction for each game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Cavaliers at New York KnicksTime: 12 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free) Odds: Knicks -6 | O/U: 238.5 (via FanDuel)X-factor: Jaylon TysonTyson didn't play much as a rookie, but he's quietly become an important piece for the Cavs this season. He's averaging 13 points, 5.4 rebounds and two assists on 52.4/45/78.4 shooting splits in 19 starts. He's fourth on the team in minutes and has been their best 3-point shooter thus far. \nDuring this chaotic season in Cleveland, Tyson has been one of the few constants. He's also been unafraid to speak his mind, and called out the team earlier in the season for a lack of effort. \"We're not hungry enough,\" Tyson said after their loss to the Celtics on Nov. 30. \"I feel like teams want it more than us, there's a target on a lot of our guys' backs, and it's everyone's job to say, 'you wanna come at us, let's go.'\"Tyson and the Cavaliers will have a chance to respond on Christmas. Bold prediction: The Cavaliers will winIt's crazy that this qualifies as a bold prediction, but the Cavaliers have been the most disappointing team in the league. After winning 64 games last season, they're just 17-14 and stuck in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. While they've had major injury issues, poor health doesn't explain everything that's gone on in Cleveland this season. This remains one of the most talented rosters in the league, and the Cavs are only two games back of the No. 3 seed in the crowded middle of the pack in the East. Their Christmas showdown with the Knicks is the perfect opportunity to snap out of their funk, pick up a signature win and start climbing back up the standings. They'll enter the game off the back of consecutive victories (albeit against the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans) where they put up 139 and 141 points, respectively, which should give them a real confidence boost. \n\n        \n            \n                Can the Cavaliers -- the NBA's most expensive team -- snap out of their funk?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Antonio Spurs at Oklahoma City ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Thunder -9.5 | O/U: 233.5X-factor: Luke KornetThe Spurs gave Kornet a four-year deal in free agency to steal him away from the Boston Celtics and shore up their frontcourt situation behind Victor Wembanyama. That was hailed as a smart move in the offseason, and looks even better now. Kornet slid into the starting lineup while Wembanyama was out with a calf injury, and has remained in that role as the Spurs work the French phenom back slowly. Kornet is averaging career-highs of 8.2 points, 6.7 rebounds, two assists and 1.4 blocks per game, while shooting 63.5% from the field. He doesn't put up huge numbers, but he's always in the right spot and making smart, connective plays. Somehow, he also seems to be good for one highlight reel play each night. In the Spurs' win over the Thunder on Tuesday, he threw down an alley-oop over Chet Holmgren. \nBold prediction: There will be multiple technical foulsFamiliarity breeds contempt, as the saying goes, and this will be the third matchup between these teams in the last two weeks. The first two have been competitive, physical affairs won by the up-and-coming Spurs. There's also some real animosity between Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren. \nThe Thunder are going to be back at home on national TV looking for revenge and to snap their first skid (2-3 in their last five games) of the season. It would not be a surprise to see some emotions boil over on Christmas. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Mavericks at Golden State WarriorsTime: 5 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Warriors -8 | O/U: 227.5X-factor: Ryan NembhardRyan Nembhard, the younger brother of Pacers point guard Andrew Nembhard, went undrafted this year despite leading the NCAA in assists last season. It hasn't taken him long to prove that every single team besides the Mavericks made a mistake by passing on him. After playing sparingly early in the season, he earned the starting point guard role the day after Thanksgiving and hasn't given it back. He's averaging 10.9 points and seven assists on 51.5 shooting, including 48.6% from 3-point range as a starter, and is coming off an 11-point, seven-assist effort in the Mavericks' victory over the Thunder, during which he played all but eight seconds of the fourth quarter. \nBold prediction: Stephen Curry scores 40 pointsIt's unbelievable that Curry is still carrying such a burden for the Warriors and scoring so efficiently while doing so. In NBA history only four other players -- Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Alex English -- have averaged at least 20 shots per game after turning 35. None of them have been as efficient as Curry, who is shooting 39.8% on 12.3 3-point attempts per game, and boasts a 64.2% true shooting percentage.Curry has always had the ultimate green light, but this season, in particular, he can do whatever he wants. Jimmy Butler doesn't seem super interested in shooting, Brandin Podziemski is their third-leading scorer at 12.4 points per game and Draymond Green has more turnovers (75) than made baskets (72). Curry already has four 40-point games this season, and a showcase game on Christmas against the No. 1 pick is a perfect time to add another one. He's certainly going to take enough shots to get there. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Rockets at Los Angeles LakersTime: 8 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Rockets -3.5 | O/U: 229.5X-factor: Reed SheppardAfter a strong start to the season, the Rockets have lost four of their last five games to fall to 17-10 and sixth place in the Western Conference. Their lone win during that skid came against the Nuggets when Reed Sheppard hit a career-high six 3-pointers en route to 28 points, his second-highest scoring game of the season. \nSheppard, the No. 3 pick in last year's draft, barely played as a rookie, but has been thrust into a big role this season due to Fred VanVleet's injury. Boasting extreme confidence in his shot, Sheppard has been lighting it up from behind the arc. He's making 43.5% of his 6.3 3-point attempts per game, and leads the Rockets with 73 makes from long distance. In fact, he's made nearly a quarter of their 3s on the season. The Rockets are dead last in 3-point attempts per game (30.2), and are perhaps overly reliant on Sheppard to provide an outside threat that opponents have to respect. Despite some inconsistent production from the second-year man, Houston has a 121.9 offensive rating with Sheppard on the floor and a 115.7 offensive rating when he sits. The Rockets are 5-2 when Sheppard scores more than 15 points and 12-8 when he does not. If they want to beat the high-powered Lakers, they may need a big night from Sheppard. \nBold prediction: This is the last time LeBron plays on ChristmasNo one has played on Christmas Day more often than LeBron James, who is making his 20th appearance on the holiday. Earlier this month, he made it clear that he's had enough of the occasion. \"I'd much rather be at home with my family,\" James said earlier this week. \"But I mean, it's the game, it's the game I love. It's the game I watched when I was a kid on Christmas Day, watching a lot of the greatest play the game on Christmas. It's always been an honor to play it. Obviously, I'm gonna be completely honest, I would like to be home on the couch with my family all throughout the day. But my number is called -- our number is called, so we have to go out and perform and I look forward to it.\"James has not announced any retirement plans, but given his age (he'll turn 41 next week), growing injury issues due to sciatica and these comments, it's fair to wonder if this is the last time we'll see him suit up on Christmas. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Timberwolves at Denver NuggetsTime: 10:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Spread: Nuggets -4 | O/U: 238.5X-factor: Tim Hardaway Jr. Hardaway was one of the Nuggets' many veteran additions during the offseason, and has been a perfect fit alongside Nikola Jokić. He's shooting a career-high 41.7% from 3-point range on six attempts per game, is the team's leading scorer off the bench and has appeared in every game this season. Hardaway has been a constant source of production for the Nuggets while Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun have been sidelined, and has helped the team maintain a 21-8 record, which is good for third place in the Western Conference. If they want to get back on track and take down the Timberwolves after a narrow loss to the Mavericks on Tuesday, they'll need another strong showing from Hardaway, who has had at least 20 points and six 3s in each of his last two games. Bold prediction: Anthony Edwards is going to put someone on a posterEdwards said earlier this month that he doesn't consider himself a superstar. \"I don't think it's no pressure. I don't think I'm under a spotlight. I don't really think I'm a superstar,\" Edwards said. \"I think to some people I may be. But to myself, I'm really not. So I don't really put no pressure on myself. They got other guys in the league for that.\"\nHowever he categorizes himself, he's one of the game's best players and thrives under the bright lights. He'll be eager to put on a show on Christmas, especially against another Western Conference contender. Don't be surprised if he tries to put someone on a poster in the process. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The idiom, \"All good things must come to an end\" is applicable to the 2025 Kansas City Chiefs. For the first time since quarterback Patrick Mahomes became a starter in 2018, the road to the Super Bowl doesn't go through the Chiefs in the AFC. A stranglehold on the AFC West is over after nine straight division titles. Not only is Kansas City missing the playoffs but is assured of the first losing season during Andy Reid's 13-year tenure as Chiefs coach. With a 6-9 record, a top 10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft is a distinct possibility. Here's a look at what lies ahead for the Chiefs.Travis Kelce's potential retirementTravis Kelce is a first ballot Hall of Famer when the five-year waiting period is over once he hangs up his cleats. The 36-year-old contemplated retirement after the 2024 season. His return was motivated by trying to avenge a lopsided loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.Although Kelce is clearly on the decline, he still ranks among the top 10 for tight ends in receptions (seventh), receiving yards (third) and touchdown catches (tied for 10th) this season. Kelce's 68 catches for 803 yards with five touchdowns in 15 games would be a career year for a lot of tight ends. He was just named to the Pro Bowl for the 11th straight time. Kelce intends on disclosing his plans to the Chiefs by early March, which is before 2026 free agency begins. The two-year, $34.25 million contract, averaging $17.125 million per year, Kelce signed in 2024 expires at the end of the league year on March 11. Kelce playing a 14th NFL season in 2026 would be a surprise.\nPatrick Mahomes' recoveryMahomes, who has been the gold standard for quarterbacks over the last few seasons, tore the ACL and LCL in his left knee late in the fourth quarter of Week 15's contest against the Los Angeles Chargers. If Mahomes' recovery goes according to plan, he should be ready for the start of the 2026 regular season. Adrian Peterson tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee on Christmas Eve during Week 16 of the 2011 season. He didn't miss any games in 2012. In fact, Peterson had a career year. He finished nine yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards.There isn't any reason to think that Mahomes won't continue to be an elite quarterback once he is healthy. Joe Burrow tore the ACL, MCL, PCL and meniscus in his left knee 10 games into his rookie season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2020. He led the Bengals to the Super Bowl the following season.Salary capThe Chiefs have one of the NFL's most daunting salary cap situations for 2026. There are $346.507 million of 2026 cap commitments with 41 players under contract, according to NFLPA data. That's the NFL's third most 2026 cap obligations behind only the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings. Kansas City has a league-low $148,405 of existing 2025 cap space that can be carried over to the 2026 league year, which also begins on March 11. Under offseason accounting rules, only the top 51 salaries (i.e.; cap numbers) matter.\nThe 2025 salary cap is $279.2 million, which is a 9.32% increase from 2024. Similar growth would put the 2026 salary cap in the $300 million to $305 million range. The Chiefs should have approximately $357.5 million of 2026 cap commitments with the full complement of players.Mahomes has the NFL's second largest 2026 cap number at $78,213,888. The $56.75 million he is scheduled to make for 2026 is most for any player next year. Mahomes' cap figure is untenable with an overage that could be upward to $60 million depending where the 2026 salary cap sets. A contract restructure like this year's in which Mahomes' entire 2025 compensation minus his league-minimum salary and workout bonus were converted into signing bonus would create $43.56 million of cap room.\nDefensive tackle Chris Jones' $44.85 million cap hit is the league's second most for a non-quarterback and tops for a defensive player. Ideally, this number will be kept intact considering Jones will be 32 next season and his salary guarantees run out after 2026. Jones has rebounded from a slow start to play close to his usual All-Pro level recently.The most likely result is some sort of salary conversion will take place with Jones. The $35.1 million Jones is making in 2026 consists of a $19 million base salary, $16 million third day of the 2026 league year roster bonus due on March 13 and a $100,000 workout bonus. Just Jones' $15 million March roster bonus was converted to signing bonus this year. The Chiefs would pick up $10,666,666 of 2026 cap space by repeating the same with Jones' 2026 roster bonus. Adding dummy or voiding years in salary conversions is something the Chiefs largely refrain from doing. Jones' contract expires after the 2028 season.\nOffensive guard Trey Smith is another prime restructure candidate. He has a $24.25 million 2026 cap number with a $20 million salary. Lowering Smith's $19.75 million base salary to his $1.215 million league-minimum salary will create $12,356,666 of 2026 cap space considering he is under contract through the 2028 season.Right tackle Jawaan Taylor hasn't come close to living up to the four-year, $80 million contract he was given in 2023 free agency. Removing his $27,396,668 cap number from Kansas City's financial equation will free up $20 million of cap room. Jaylon Moore, who is the NFL's most expensive swing tackle with the two-year, $30 million contract, averaging $15 million per year, he signed as an unrestricted free agent in March, could take Taylor's place on the right side of the offensive line.Cornerback Kristian Fulton is another likely cap casualty. He has been a disappointment after joining the Chiefs in March on a two-year, $20 million deal. Fulton is making $10 million, of which $5 million is fully guaranteed, on a $13 million cap number in 2026. The Chiefs would pick up $5 million of cap space by releasing Fulton, who has been a healthy scratch for a majority of the season.\nFree agencyThe Chiefs have 22 other unrestricted free agents besides Kelce, including linebacker Leo Chenal, safety Bryan Cook, running back Kareem Hunt, edge rusher Charles Omenihu, running back Isiah Pacheco and cornerback Jaylen Watson. Assuming Kelce reitres as expected, the Chiefs don't have his obvious successor on the roster. Potential replacements in free agency include Isaiah Likely, David Njoku and Kyle Pitts. Likely's days with the Baltimore Ravens are probably coming to a close after Mark Andrews recently signed a three-year, $39.267 million contract extension, averaging $13.089 million per year. The presumption was Likely, not Andrews, would be the recipient of a contract extension in Baltimore given the former is an ascending 25-year-old player who is nearly five years younger than the latter. Likely's asking price was surely higher than the deal Andrews signed.Njoku's preference is to play his entire career with the Cleveland Browns. He may be expendable in Cleveland with 2026 third-round pick Harold Fannin Jr.'s emergence at tight end. Fannin's 70 catches, which are tied for fifth among tight ends, are a Browns single-season rookie receptions record. The Andrews deal might be a good barometer for Njoku considering he is in the final year of a four-year, $54.75 million contract, averaging $13,687,500 per year, he signed in 2022 as a franchise player. Njoku, who turns 30 in July, is one of the NFL's better tight ends at picking up yards after the catch.\nPitts is having his best season since he had 1,026 receiving yards as a rookie in 2021 and was selected to the Pro Bowl. The Falcons placing a franchise tag on the 25-year-old isn't out of the question. If Pitts hits the open market, a long-term deal should be less than the $17.125 million per year Kelce has been making.The running game needs an upgrade. Hunt and Pacheco are collectively averaging 3.8 yards per carry. The last time the Chiefs had a 1,000-yard rusher was in 2017 when Hunt led the NFL with 1,327 yards.The Chiefs reportedly tried to acquire Breece Hall, who has an expiring contract, from the New York Jets at the Nov. 4 trade deadline. Hall, who has dual-threat capabilities, is on the verge of his first 1,000 rushing yard season. \nThe 2022 second-round pick likely will be looking to get in the same salary stratosphere as James Cook and Kyren Williams, fellow running backs from the 2022 draft, in free agency. Williams signed a three-year, $33 million extension, averaging $11 million per year, with the Los Angeles Rams during the preseason. Cook's four-year, $46 million extension, averaging $11.5 million per year (worth up to $48 million with salary escalators), from the Buffalo Bills came several days after Williams' deal.Backup quarterback as an insurance policy could take on additional importance because of Mahomes' injury. Besides current Chiefs backup Gardner Minshew, Joe Flacco (Bengals), Marcus Mariota (Washington Commanders), Kenny Pickett (Las Vegas Raiders), Tyrod Taylor (Jets) and Carson Wentz (Vikings), who was Mahomes' backup in 2024, are the best of the bunch.The Chiefs made a nominal investment in Minshew signing him to a one-year, $1.17 million deal worth up to $8 million through incentives in March. The base value that the majority of these other backups have played under this season is between $4.25 million and $8 million.\nThe Chiefs have a history of letting cornerbacks walk in free agency. Kendall Fuller and Charvarius Ward departed for the Washington Commanders and San Francisco 49ers, respectively, as free agents in 2020 and 2022. L'Jarius Sneed went to the Tennessee Titans in 2024 via trade after being designated as a franchise player.Watson's fate in Kansas City may be intertwined with fellow cornerback Trent McDuffie, who was a 2022 first-round pick. The Chiefs extended the contract of their other 2022 first-round pick, edge rusher George Karlaftis, in July while McDuffie continued to play on his rookie deal. McDuffie, who is scheduled to play 2026 under a $13.632 million fifth-year option, will likely want top of the cornerback market money similar to Sauce Gardner and Derek Stingley Jr. Gardner is the NFL's highest-paid cornerback at $30.1 million per year. He received a four-year, $120.4 million extension with $85,653,473 of guarantees where $45,153,473 was fully guaranteed at signing from the Jets in July before being dealt to the Colts at the trade deadline.\nStingley became the NFL's first $30 million defensive back in March. The Houston Texans signed Stingley to a three-year, $90 million extension with $89,026,026 in guarantees, of which $48,026,026 was fully guaranteed at signing.It may make sense for the Chiefs to quickly trade McDuffie with an unwillingness to get in this salary territory. The Chiefs would be hard-pressed to get a comparable return as the Jets received from the Indianapolis Colts for Gardner. Part of the reason the Jets were able to get two first-round picks and a player (wide receiver Adonai Mitchell) was because he had already signed an extension. The Colts have Gardner for the next five years (through the 2030 season) for just under $131 million.The team acquiring McDuffie would be giving up significant draft capital in addition to signing him long term. Nonetheless, the Chiefs should be able to get a first-round pick and other considerations for McDuffie. It could cost the Chiefs half as much per year to retain Watson instead. The chances of both cornerbacks being on the Chiefs in 2026 are remote.OutlookThe Chiefs are at a crossroads. There will be stiff competition for supremacy in the AFC West from the Denver Broncos and the Chargers on a go-forward basis. Both teams have a young nucleus. Mahomes' abilities should allow the Chiefs to remain competitive though.The New England Patriots are also going to be an obstacle to returning to the Super Bowl. Under new coach Mike Vrabel, the Patriots have rebounded from three straight losing seasons to make the playoffs. Quarterback Drake Maye, who was 2024's third overall pick, is an MVP candidate this season. He is just scratching the surface of his talent.\n            ",

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who both left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings in December.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Valdez and Suárez would slot in toward the front of any rotation.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

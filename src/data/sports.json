    "body": "\n        The top NBA rookies and sophomores will be on display in the 2026 Rising Stars game on Friday as a part of All-Star Weekend. G-Leaguers will also compete in the four-team tournament in which the semifinals consist of teams playing to reach 40 points, with those winners then playing in the Rising Stars Championship Game to 25 points. The three teams of NBA players are coached by Hall of Famers Carmelo Anthony, Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter, with Team G League led by Austin Rivers.  The Rising Stars 2026 will begin at 9 p.m. ET from the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. Team Melo is the +140 favorite in the latest 2026 Rising Stars odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, followed by Team T-Mac at +175 and Team Vince at +320. Team Austin is the biggest longshot in the field at +900.

The three teams of NBA players consist of a mix of rookies and sophomores, with the G-League squad having only players in the NBA's developmental league. All three of the tournament games will be played to a Final Target Score, rather than over a specific period of time. \nThe first two games will be played to 40, with the final played to 25 to determine the Rising Stars Challenge champion. The first matchup at 9 p.m. ET is Team Carmelo Anthony (-4.5, O/U 73.5) vs. Team Austin Rivers, followed by Team Tracy McGrady (-2.5, O/U 74.5) vs. Team Vince Carter. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can check out the latest Kalshi promo code CBSSPORTS to get a $10 cash bonus after making $10 in trades:Top 2026 NBA Rising Stars predictionsBarner is fading Team Vince (+240), as it has the least accomplished roster of players amongst the three squads featuring NBA players. Team T-Mac has the experience edge over Vince Carter's squad in that the former has the most sophomores, with five second-year players compared to Team Vince having just three. Meanwhile, Melo's team has the reigning Rookie of the Year in Stephon Castle, plus the size edge in 7-foot-2 center Donovan Clingan.\nTeam Vince lacks the caliber of those two squads and has just two players who were top-10 draft picks in V.J. Edgecombe and Egor Demin. Melo's team has four top-5 draft picks, while T-Mac has four top-6 draftees. There's a sheer talent gap between Vince Carter's squad with those two others, and even in an exhibition game like the Rising Stars Challenge, that gulf should be apparent on the scoreboard. See more predictions at SportsLine. How to make 2026 NBA Rising Stars picksBarner has studied the NBA Rising Stars game from every angle and found a critical X-factor that makes one of these teams a must-back on Friday night. See who it is over at SportsLine.Who wins the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, and which critical X-factor do you need to know about? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Barner's pick for the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, all from the expert who has crushed his NBA picks, and find out.\n2026 NBA Rising Star odds, rostersSee picks at SportsLine.Team Melo (+140)Stephon Castle (San Antonio Spurs)Donovan Clingan (Portland Trail Blazers)Reed Sheppard (Houston Rockets)Ace Bailey (Utah Jazz)Dylan Harper (San Antonio Spurs)Jeremiah Fears (New Orleans Pelicans)Collin Murray-Boyles (Toronto Raptors)Team T-Mac (+175)Kon Knueppel (Charlotte Hornets)Kel'el Ware (Miami Heat)Tre Johnson (Washington Wizards)Jaylon Tyson (Cleveland Cavaliers)Zaccharie Risacher (Atlanta Hawks)Cam Spencer (Memphis Grizzlies)Bub Carrington (Washington Wizards)Team Vince (+320)VJ Edgecombe (Philadelphia 76ers)Derik Queen (New Orleans Pelicans)Matas Buzelis (Chicago Bulls)Kyshawn George (Washington Wizards)Cedric Coward (Memphis Grizzlies)Egor Demin (Brooklyn Nets)Jaylen Wells (Memphis Grizzlies)\nTeam Austin (+900)Jahmir Young (Sioux Falls Skyforce)Yang Hansen (Rip City Remix)Sean East II (Salt Lake City Stars)Ron Harper Jr. (Maine Celtics)Yanic Konan Niederhauser (San Diego Clippers)Alijah Martin (Raptors 905)Tristen Newton (Rio Grande Valley Vipers)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Life comes at you fast in the world of high-major college basketball. One minute you're alone atop the SEC standings and the next you're suddenly on the NCAA Tournament bubble. This is the situation Texas A&M (17-7, 7-4 SEC) finds itself in as it plays at No. 19 Vanderbilt on Saturday.The Aggies are on a three-game slide that includes losses against Alabama and Missouri that came by a combined four points. Looking at those results, you can easily play the \"what if\" game with Texas A&M. What if it hadn't been forced to play at Alabama during Charles Bediako's five-game stint back with the Crimson Tide? Could playing Bama without Bediako could have tipped the scales in A&M's favor during what turned out to be a 100-97 loss?What if the ending of an 87-82 double-overtime loss at Tennessee had gone just a little bit differently? A road win over Tennessee or Alabama would have given A&M a ton of resume fortification.  The maddening part is that A&M is good enough that it could have won those games. Their fast-paced, high-pressure, 3-point oriented style under first-year coach Bucky McMillan is working, and it has the Aggies averaging out around 30th overall nationally in the predictive analytics used by the selection committee.Where A&M is now lacking is in the resume metrics that are often used along the tournament's cut line. With a profile in the mid-to-high 40s there, A&M needs to start adding to the win column as it seeks to recover from a lackluster nonconference performance. \"Buckyball\" wasn't yet a well-oiled machine in early November, and A&M didn't get any significant resume-padding done before league play began.\nAs a result, it's getting a little close for comfort at Texas A&M. Here's the breakdown of this weekend's games involving bubble teams including a  \"double bubble\" showdown between TCU and Oklahoma State with both teams vying for a berth in the NCAA Tournament.Check out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hub                                  All times ET                      Bubble teams in action this weekend\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      CalEntering the weekend: Next Four OutSaturday at Boston College | 12 p.m. (ACC Network)\nThe first leg of Cal's northeastern ACC swing resulted in a 107-100 double-overtime loss at Syracuse. The defeat is clinging narrowly to Quad 1 status for now, but a loss at Boston College would be far more costly. Even on the road, facing the Eagles (9-15, 2-9 ACC) slots in as a Quad 3 affair for the Bears, who have dropped a whopping 16 spots at KenPom since briefly rising to No. 54 last week.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Oklahoma StateEntering the weekend: Next Four OutSaturday vs. TCU | 12 p.m. (ESPN2)The Oklahoma State wave quickly receded after an initial surge brought by a Feb. 4 win over BYU. Coming off a 37-point loss at Arizona and a Tuesday loss to Arizona State, the Cowboys need to get right. Home games against TCU on Saturday and Kansas on Wednesday will be challenging, but they are winnable games against quality opponents that could push the Pokes back in the right direction.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    TCUEntering the weekend: Last Four InSaturday at Oklahoma State | 12 p.m. (ESPN2)TCU edged Oklahoma State 68-65 in the first meeting on Jan. 20 as the Horned Frogs snapped out of a 1-4 start to Big 12 play. Beating the Cowboys was the beginning of a 4-2 stretch that could become a 5-2 stretch if TCU is able to complete a sweep. Tuesday's upset of Iowa State adds to a Nov. 27 neutral-site win over Florida in demonstrating this team's potential.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas A&MEntering the weekend: Last Four InSaturday at Vanderbilt | 1 p.m. (SEC Network)Seeing Texas A&M among the Last Four in could understandably be jarring for Aggies fans who saw their team atop the SEC standings earlier this month. First-year coach Bucky McMillan is doing great work, but the Aggies have ended up on the wrong side of too many close games, and that has dinged up their resume a bit. While predictive metrics such as a No. 35 KenPom ranking are still in A&M's favor, a No. 45 WAB ranking tells us A&M is losing its margin for error.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia TechEntering the weekend: First Four OutSaturday vs. Miami | 4 p.m. (ESPN2)Virginia Tech's 76-66 win at Clemson on Wednesday is worth significantly more in WAB than any other victory amassed by the Hokies (17-8, 6-6 ACC) this season. A home loss to Florida State would give it all back. That's basically the story for the rest of Virginia Tech's season, as there are should-win home games of little value (FSU, Wake Forest and Boston College) alternating with high-end road showdowns with lots of value (Miami, North Carolina and Virginia).\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      VCUEntering the weekend: First Four OutSaturday vs. Richmond | 6 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)\nVCU has won eight in a row, but its at-large chances might all come down to whether it can pull a road upset of Saint Louis on Feb. 20. In the meantime, it faces a crosstown rivalry showdown with a Richmond team that just snapped out of a six-game losing streak by pulling an upset of Atlantic 10 stalwart George Mason. The Rams cannot take this one lightly.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Ohio StateEntering the weekend: First Four OutSaturday vs. Virginia | 8 p.m. (Fox)Ohio State finally has a Quad 1 win. Of course, it's not because of some new victory the Buckeyes picked up. It's because their Dec. 6 victory at Northwestern now counts as a Quad 1 victory based on where the Wildcats stand in the NET (for now, anyway). Beating Virginia on a neutral floor would give Ohio State the sort of resume boost it needs to pair with a predictive analytics profile hovering around 40th nationally. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      MissouriEntering the weekend: Last Four InSaturday vs. Texas | 8:30 p.m. (ESPN2)Missouri squeaked out an 86-85 win at Texas A&M on Wednesday to reach 17-7 and 7-4 in the SEC. A year ago, winning even just six SEC games was good enough for guaranteed NCAA Tournament admission. But the league isn't as strong this season, and the Tigers have a ton of ground to make up after playing a horrible nonconference schedule.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Diego StateEntering the weekend: First Four OutSaturday vs. Nevada | 10 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)San Diego State's next six games are projected as either Quad 2 or Quad 1 opportunities, which offer the Aztecs a chance to leave a late impression. If this team misses the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2019, it will look back and rue a Nov. 18 double-overtime home loss to Troy. Overcoming that Quad 3 defeat without any high-end victories to tout is going to require significant win volume from SDSU.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Saint Mary'sEntering the weekend: Last Four InSaturday at Pacific | 10:30 p.m. (ESPN2)If Saint Mary's makes the Big Dance as an at-large team, it may want to consider writing a thank-you note to Virginia Tech. A victory over the Hokies from Nov. 27 in the Battle 4 Atlantis is doing overtime in propping up the Gaels' resume. The Hokies' rise in the NET has resulted in Saint Mary's finally having a Quad 1 win (for now). Though they have 17 low-end Quad 3/4 victories, the Gaels still rate as a top-40 team in metrics used by the committee.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Santa ClaraEntering the weekend: No. 11 seed (projected WCC champion)Saturday vs. Gonzaga | 10:30 p.m. (ESPN)If the season ended today with someone other than Santa Clara winning the WCC Tournament, the Broncos would have roughly a 50-50 chance of making the field, per the CBS Sports Bracketology model. The Broncos are in possession of an interesting tournament profile that places them around 40th overall in both resume and predictive metrics. But with just one Quad 1 win and an ugly Quad 4 loss to Loyola Chicago back in December, things are tenuous. Beating Gonzaga would do wonders, as it would give Santa Clara another statement win to go along with its Jan. 17 victory over Saint Mary's.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seton HallEntering the weekend: Next Four OutSunday at Butler | 6 p.m. (FS1)Seton Hall has been fading, and that's a shame because this team could be America's team in the NCAA Tournament. Coach Shaheen Holloway — formerly of Saint Peter's lore — gets his team to play lockdown defense, and the Pirates have one of the sport's most fun point guards in the undersized Adam \"Budd\" Clark. Losing here would be unadvisable in what's shaping up as a fringe Quad 1 or 2 game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Zac Gallen is heading back to the desert. Gallen and the Arizona Diamondbacks are closing in on a one-year contract worth $22.025 million, according to a report from The Athletic. About $14 million would be deferred. The deal matches the $22.025 million qualifying offer Gallen rejected in November. The team has not yet announced the signing, which is pending a physical.Gallen, 30, is coming off a 2025 season in which he didn't live up to his established standards, hence settling for a one-year contract despite finishing in the top 10 of the National League Cy Young voting three times in his career.   \nFor his career, Gallen has pitched to a 119 ERA+ and an FIP of 3.65 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Over that span he's compiled a WAR of 20.7, and he's topped 30 starts and 180 innings in three of the last four seasons. Gallen spent the last six seasons and change with the D-backs, who acquired him from the Miami Marlins in July 2019 in exchange for Jazz Chisholm Jr.  Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Gallen as the No. 18 available free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up:  \n\"Gallen salvaged what he could with a good 11-start closing stretch, but an otherwise miserable walk year makes him feel like a strong candidate to accept the qualifying offer (if one is tendered) and try again in 2026. Otherwise? He's a candidate to sign a one-year deal elsewhere and modify his arsenal in an attempt to push back against a trend that has seen his performance slip in each of the past two years.\" \t \tBefore Gallen's return, FanGraphs estimated Arizona's 2026 payroll at $173 million. That is just south of the franchise record ($177 million in 2024), so Gallen will push the club well into uncharted payroll territory. The D-backs will neither gain nor forfeit draft picks to re-sign their own qualified free agent.  Arizona brought Merrill Kelly back earlier this offseason, and now they've reunited with Gallen. Those two will join lefty Eduardo Rodriguez and righties Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt in the rotation. Corbin Burnes, last offseason's big free-agent splash, is expected to return from Tommy John surgery at midseason.  The D-backs went 80-82 last season and missed the postseason by three games. They sold at the trade deadline, most notably sending Kelly to the Texas Rangers and Eugenio Suárez to the Seattle Mariners, though they kept Gallen. \nGallen was originally drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. He went to the Marlins with Sandy Alcantara as part of a December 2017 deal that sent Marcell Ozuna to St. Louis.  \n            ",

Among the allegations made by federal prosecutors is that Clase partook in an illegal gambling scheme during a 2024 playoff game.Clase and teammate Luis Ortiz have been on the restricted list for the Guardians since last July while under investigation. Ortiz has since asked for his case to be severed from Clase and has claimed that he was an unknowing victim in the scheme that was being headed up by Clase. Clase is alleged to have thrown balls on purpose (ball/strike prop bets were available at some sportsbooks) in a list of 15 different examples, ranging from 2023-25. One that stands out in the indictment is a pitch from the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 2024 ALDS against the Tigers. The Guardians won that game 7-0 and Clase retired all three batters he faced in the ninth inning, but the first pitch Clase threw was a ball to Tigers hitter Matt Vierling that bounced in front of the plate.Further, the allegations note that there were at least three other times when Clase intended to throw a ball on purpose but didn't get into the game. \nVia The Athletic: Robinson Vasquez Germosen was charged with five federal counts by prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York. They allege that he worked with Clase and, later, Ortiz to rig pitches during Guardians games so that they and others could win money betting on them. He is also accused of lying to federal agents during an interview as part of the investigation. Vasquez was arrested in December and released on $100,000 bond.The allegations note that Clase and Vazquez would use coded language to communicate on the pitch-fixing. Such as: \"Throw a rock at the first rooster in today's fight,\" from Vasquez and \"Yes, of course, that's an easy toss to that rooster,\" from Clase (The Athletic). \nClase's trial is set for May 4. Expect him to remain on the restricted list until the conclusion of the trial. A lifetime ban from baseball is a potential outcome if he's found guilty. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am leaderboard is littered with the biggest names in golf, but after two rounds it's Akshay Bhatia who holds a share of the lead heading into the weekend. Bhatia has gone bogey-free around Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill over the first two days of play, following up a 65 at Pebble Beach on Thursday with an 8-under 64 at Spyglass Hill on Friday. Bhatia's iron play has led the way, as is often the case for those that succeed on the small greens at Pebble Beach. He's third in strokes gained on approach through the first two rounds. The young lefty's game has been sharp tee-to-green, and even when he's had the occasional miss, he's a perfect 6-for-6 getting up-and-down. That's the recipe for success at this event, and as the professionals lose their amateur partners for the weekend and get to focus solely on playing Pebble Beach, Bhatia will look to continue his incredible ball-striking performance. The light winds and soft greens on the California coast have created ideal scoring conditions, so even with a bogey-free performance so far, Bhatia has company at the top in the form of Ryo Hisatsune. The young Japanese star is continuing his stellar form early in the season, and while he did cool off a bit on Friday after his first-round 62 put him in another early lead, he was able to put together a solid 67 to remain in a share of the lead.\nLeading the charge from the chase group is Rickie Fowler, who matched Bhatia's 64 at Spyglass to get to 14 under heading into the weekend. Fowler is now in position to contend for his first victory since 2023, and is looking to continue a solid start to 2026. Fowler hasn't traditionally thrived at Pebble Beach, but he's been the best player in the field this week with his irons, gaining 4.8 strokes on approach so far. The 37-year-old highlighted that he feels better physically this year than he did in 2025 when he battled a shoulder injury, but was able to secure a top-50 position and a spot in all of the Signature Events this year. \"My shoulder was bad all last year so I was just trying to manage and get through as best that I could. I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top-50, so that was a nice bonus,\" Fowler said. \"So that was what I was trying to work towards to, like I said, earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.\" \nThat extended time off certainly seems to have paid off with a pair of top 20s to start the season and now a late tee time on the weekend at Pebble Beach. Fowler will need to keep up the strong iron play on Saturday and Sunday if he's going to contend for the win, but he's been lights out attacking soft greens thus far. The time to get the course was certainly the first two days, as the forecast calls for winds to pick up starting on Saturday afternoon and continue blowing 17-21 mph throughout Sunday's final round -- with some rain to add to the misery. For the leaders, that'll make it a challenge to hold up in rapidly changing conditions, but it will also make it harder for the chase pack to go low around them. The leadersT1. Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune (-15)Bhatia had a rocky start to 2026 with a pair of missed cuts, but he found something in Phoenix last week with a T3 and has carried that form into Pebble Beach. A two-time winner on the PGA Tour, we've seen that when Bhatia gets hot, he can go on a tear. Given the scoring to start the week at Pebble Beach, that'll be a must, as he's going to need to keep the pedal down to pick up the biggest win of his young career. \nHisatsune meanwhile has been on a tear for the last three weeks, and he continues to build confidence in his ability to contend with the best. After a T2 at Torrey Pines and a T10 at TPC Scottsdale, he keeps putting himself in position and learning how to handle the nerves on the weekend. The putter has been leading the way this week, and he seems extremely comfortable on poa greens that can give some players fits. We'll see if that holds up on the weekend, but a late tee time should feel like part of the routine after his last two weeks. The challenge for both Bhatia and Hisatsune will be holding off the best field of the young season with the weather expected to shift dramatically over the course of the weekend. Other contendersT3. Rickie Fowler, Sam Burns (-14)T5. Min Woo Lee, Sepp Straka, Jacob Bridgeman (-12)T8. Tom Hoge, Jake Knapp (-11)T10. Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Fitzpatrick, Keegan Bradley, Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and two others (-10)T17. Rory McIlroy, Chris Gotterup, Tommy Fleetwood and two others (-9)T34. Scottie Scheffler and 10 others (-6)\nBurns joined Fowler at 14 under, and in news that will come as a surprise to no one, it's a hot putter that has Burns in contention. Straka had a top 10 at Pebble last year and is in position to back that up again in 2026, joining Min Woo Lee in the top five. The group at T10 features some big names, but even in a sea of other major winners, Spieth is the player most are watching with interest this weekend. We haven't seen him anything close to his peak in some time, but any signs of life from the three-time major winner spark hope that he might be returning to top form. A bit further off the pace is Chris Gotterup, who finally cooled off a touch and is going to need a big Saturday effort if he's going to capture his third win of the young season. Defending champion Rory McIlroy is also at 9 under heading to the weekend, and will feel like he left a few shots out there on Friday that would've made him an even bigger threat to repeat. \nThen there's Scottie Scheffler, who is nine shots off the pace, but similar to last week in Phoenix, he bounced back from a rough Thursday to surge up the leaderboard with a Friday 66. He'll need to produce something magical to get in the mix late on Sunday, but after almost pulling off a huge come from behind victory a week ago, it's impossible to write him off. Updated 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds, picksAkshay Bhatia (+340)Rickie Fowler (11/2)Ryo Hisatsune (11/2)Sam Burns (6-1)Sepp Straka (14-1)Min Woo Lee (16-1)Jake Knapp (20-1)Rory McIlroy (22-1)Jacob Bridgeman (22-1)Xander Schauffele (25-1)If the winds pick up, this tournament could shift considerably, and it's going to be critical for players to get out to fast starts in their third round before it becomes a battle to hang on through difficult weather on Sunday. I tend to trust those leaning on ball-striking over putting when things get tough, which points me to Fowler and Straka of the guys just off the lead. I also don't hate sprinkling some of the pre-tournament favorites like McIlroy and Scheffler at longer odds, because there's certainly the potential for the top of the leaderboard to come back a bit in tougher conditions the elite players may handle a bit better. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- The opening night of the 2026 NBA All-Star weekend is in the books. Team Vince, coached by Vince Carter, defeated Team Melo, coached by Carmelo Anthony, in the NBA Rising Star Challenge title game behind a standout performance from VJ Edgecombe. The 76ers star guard was named MVP of the event.This marked the fifth consecutive year that the top rookies, sophomores and G League players were split into different teams during the four-team event. The first team to 40 points in the semifinals advanced to the title game, while the first to 25 points captured the championship. Edgecombe scored the game-winning free throw to give Team Vince bragging rights. Team Melo advanced to the title game after Dylan Harper, the No. 2 overall pick from the 2025 NBA Draft, knocked down a mid-range jumper over older brother, Ron Harper Jr.Edgecombe scored the most points of any player in the semifinals. He finished with 17 points and six rebounds during Team Vince's win over Team T-Mac, coached by Tracy McGrady. Egdecombe, the No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft, has been one of the biggest stars among all first-year players.\n\n        \n            \n                Everyone seems to be paying attention to NBA tanking -- yes, even the lottery picks themselves\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are the biggest winners and losers from the opening night of NBA All-Star weekend.Winner: Edgecombe steals the showEdgecombe might not be participating in tomorrow's dunk contest -- although he should be, and would have a good chance of winning the event. Edgecombe did ball out in the Rising Stars Challenge. The 76ers star scored 17 points in the semifinals and six in the title game. Edgecombe's play style as a high-flyer made him a perfect candidate to have a standout performance. It was appropriate that he got the final shot to send his team to the championship game.\nLoser: Fans miss out on watching FlaggLess than 24 hours before the Rising Stars Challenge, Flagg was ruled out due to a mid-foot sprain. Flagg, the No. 1 pick from the 2025 NBA Draft, has been putting up video game-like numbers as of late. He became the first teenager in NBA history to record back-to-back 30-point double-doubles last month. He also scored 49 points against the Hornets, which was the most by a teenager in NBA history. It shouldn't be long before fans get to watch play Flagg play on the final day of the event -- the actual All-Star Game. It wouldn't be surprising if that happens as soon as next season.\nWinner: Yang Hansen shines in opening gameOne of the biggest stars of the first semifinal game of the night was Yang Hansen. The No. 16 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft came off the bench and scored 10 points for Team Austin that was coached by Austin Rivers. Considering that Hansen is averaging just 7.5 minutes per game in his rookie season with Portland, this was the kind of performance that he could build upon in the remainder of the season.\nLoser: Ron Harper Jr. gives up game-winner to younger brother One of the top storylines of the first game of the evening between Team Melo and Team Austin was the battle between the Harper brothers. Ron Harper Jr., on the Maine Celtics, had to guard his kid brother, Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs, on what would be the final possession of the game. The younger brother will be earning bragging rights in his household, as Dylan knocked down a go-ahead jumper to send Team Melo to the title game.\nWinner: The format worksThe four-team Rising Stars format should stay a fixture of All-Star weekend. Sure, several parts of NBA All-Star need an overhaul, but all three games Friday night were competitive, fun and had star power. That's exactly what you need in an event like this. Edgecombe said it best when getting interviewed by an in-arena reporter. He said he wanted to win the event. Clearly, Edgecombe and others took pride in this game. It was refreshing to watch.\nLoser: Title game ends in not-so-dramatic fashionWhile the Rising Stars title game was full of entertainment, the ending was not so dramatic. On the final offensive possession, Edgecombe got fouled trying to score at the rim. Edgecombe proceeded to knock down both free throws to give his team a 25-24 win. You hate to see a game as competitive as that one end without someone scoring a field goal.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        A U.S. district court judge issued a ruling on Friday in favor of Brian Flores, Steve Wilks and Ray Horton that will allow their racial discrimination lawsuit against the NFL to go to court after an initial motion to move some of the proceedings to arbitration was granted in 2023. District Judge Valerie Caproni in the Southern District of New York wrote in the ruling that \"the NFL's unilateral control over the dispute resolution process is the fatal flaw\" in their argument that the matter should remain under the umbrella of the arbitration process. Given Flores, Wilks and Horton are suing the NFL and multiple teams for racial discrimination and retaliation, the judge ruled that the NFL's arbitration process, which is controlled by commissioner Roger Goodell, \"does not provide a forum in which Plaintiffs can effectively vindicate their rights.\" Flores' claims in the lawsuit are against the Miami Dolphins, New York Giants and Houston Texans, while Wilks' claims are against the Arizona Cardinals and Horton's are against the Tennessee Titans. \nFlores, the defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings, sued the NFL and those three teams in January 2022 after he had been fired as head coach of the Dolphins. He claimed the NFL is \"rife with racism,\" specifically in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.\"The court's decision recognizes that an arbitration forum in which the defendant's own chief executive gets to decide the case would strip employees of their rights under the law,\" said attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and David E. Gottlieb in a statement. \"It is long overdue for the NFL to recognize this and finally provide a fair, neutral and transparent forum for these issues to be addressed.\"  \nAs a result of the ruling, the case will now move to trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Friday, April 3 in New York. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- For better or worse, tanking and the draft lottery are hot topics in the NBA as we enter All-Star Weekend. Less than 24 hours before the NBA Rising Stars Challenge, the Utah Jazz and the Indiana Pacers were fined by the NBA on Thursday night.The Jazz were hit with a $500,000 fine, while Indiana was fined $100,000 related to the management of their respective rosters in recent games. If you thought the tank last year for Cooper Flagg was worth monitoring, this year will be an even bigger story because of the blue-chip talent at the top. Duke's Cameron Boozer, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Kansas' Darryn Peterson project as the top three picks in this summer's draft, and each of them can represent a foundational building block for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Mock Draft: Where college stars like Cameron Boozer, Caleb Wilson figure to go\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, this year's NBA rookie class, headlined by names like Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, VJ Edgecombe and Kon Knueppel, makes it one of the strongest classes in years. The term \"Capture the Flagg\" took over social media in the months leading up to the lottery, which was won by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas entered the draft lottery with just a 1.8% chance of landing the top pick.With the draft lottery and the race to the bottom of the standings being such a hot topic among NBA fans, some players admitted to keeping tabs on what was happening toward the bottom of the NBA standings before they were drafted. Others, when asked, said they blocked it out.\n\"I ain't going to lie, I did,\" Edgecombe said when asked if he followed the NBA standings. \"Early in the season, I wasn't really hooping. They had me in the honorable mention for Freshman of the Year and stuff like that. ... I did, not going to lie. I was looking.\"Coming out of Baylor, Edgecombe was a projected top-five pick, but it was unclear exactly where he would land on draft night. After the 76ers moved into the top three and passed on the chance to select Ace Bailey, who reportedly canceled his pre-draft workout with the 76ers, Philadelphia landed on Edgecombe.That's part of the reason why this topic has extended to the All-Star Game. A team like Jazz dropped all the way to pick No. 5 last year after finishing with the worst record in the league. Utah selected Bailey at No. 5. Utah owes its 2026 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it finishes outside of the top eight in this year's lottery.\n\"My head was just down, focusing on the main thing, being in the NBA,\" Bailey said on whether he paid attention to the standings. \"That was my main goal. Had my circle around me blocking out the outside noise.\"A player like Brooklyn's Egor Dёmin, who had a wide range of where he might get picked in the months leading up to the draft, also paid attention to what was going on in the NBA before he entered.\"I was really trying to stay present,\" Dёmin said. \"As big as the NBA is, standings and other stuff, it's just popping out. Even if you're trying not to see it, you're going to still see (the standings).\"\nSince the draft odds were flattened in 2019, the team that finished the season with the worst record in the association has never landed the No. 1 pick. In 2024, the Hawks had just a 3% chance of landing No. 1. That draft was more of a mystery than last year and 2026. There wasn't a clear-cut top prospect that teams were necessarily tanking for, which led to drama on draft night.The biggest college star leading up to the 2024 NBA Draft was Reed Sheppard, who was selected by the Houston Rockets at No. 3. Houston held the Brooklyn Nets pick and moved up from having the ninth-best odds at No. 1 to inside the top three on lottery night. The NBA standings and the tank race that year were \"hard to not ignore\" for Sheppard.\n\"It's definitely hard to not ignore,\" Sheppard said. \"I was trying to focus on the season and not trying to get caught up in everything. Social media, you're going to see things. Your friends, they're going to send you stuff.\"With this year's race to the bottom of the NBA standings being one of the most competitive and interesting in quite some time, it's safe to say some of the best (future) draft picks of tomorrow will be following along, too.\n            ",

The All-Star Celebrity Game is set Friday night in Los Angeles, and the rosters were unveiled earlier this month.One of the teams will be coached by the Giannis Antetokounmpo, his brothers and Dodgers star Mookie Betts). The other team will be coached by Anthony Anderson, Chris Brickley and Lethal Shooter. Among the biggest stars playing in the games are NFL receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown of the Detroit Lions and Keenan Allen of the Los Angeles Chargers. Former NBA players Jeremy Lin, Tacko Fall and Jason Williams will also play -- Lin and Fall are on the same team, which feels like it could be a significant advantage.Current NBA owners Mat Ishbia (Phoenix Suns) and Rick Schnall (Charlotte Hornets) will go head-to-head, with Ishbia, a former player at Michigan State, getting to relive the glory days. From the music world, GloRilla and Mustard will take the court alongside TV and movie stars Simu Liu and Keegan-Michael Key. \nWhere to watch NBA All-Star Celebrity GameTime: 7 p.m. ET | Date: Friday, Feb. 13TV channel: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)The full rosters for both teams in the 2026 All-Star Celebrity Game can be found below.Team AntetokounmpoCoaches: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo, Mookie Betts\nKeegan-Michael KeyRome FlynnDylan WangShams CharaniaJenna BandyRick SchnallTacko FallJeremy LinGloRillaCafuAmon-Ra St. BrownTeam AndersonCoaches: Anthony Anderson, Lethal Shooter, Chris BrickleySimu LiuCody JonesBadshahAndre De GrasseTaylor Frankie PaulMat IshbiaJason WilliamsNicolas VansteenbergheMustardAdrien NunezKeenan Allen\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When the World Baseball Classic begins next month, Puerto Rico will be without several key players for insurance reasons. Infielders Carlos Correa and Francisco Lindor, and right-hander José Berríos, are unable to participate in the WBC because they were unable to secure insurance. Puerto Rico's roster will be very short-handed this spring. Music superstar and fellow Puerto Rican Bad Bunny really wanted Correa to represent their country in the WBC, so much so that he offered to pay for an insurance policy.  \"It means a lot that he's that involved,\" Correa said Friday, according to the Associated Press. \"He tried to do everything  possible. I wanted to play and make sure that I was going to go out  there and play for Team Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico. The fact that he did  that means a lot in how much he cares for the country, how much he  cares for the fans back home. I'm deeply grateful that he tried that  hard.\" Ultimately, Correa did not take Bad Bunny up on his offer because the insurance provider was not approved by Major League Baseball or Scott Boras, Correa's agent. Both MLB and Boras advised Correa against taking Bad Bunny's insurance. \"I could not sign my life away with something that three people that I trust are telling me not to do,\" Correa said, per the Associated Press. \nThe offer extended to Lindor as well, per Héctor Gómez. The Mets star has since suffered a hamate injury, which would have kept him out of the tournament anyway. Correa, 31, had surgery to repair a broken tibia in 2014 and had contracts with the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants scuttled during the 2023-24 offseason because of concerns about his ankle. Plantar fasciitis in both feet have limited him in recent years as well. Correa played 365 of 486 possible regular season games from 2023-25. This year Year 4 of the six-year, $200 million contract Correa signed with the Minnesota Twins in Jan. 2023, after his deals with the Mets and Giants fell apart. He was traded back to the Houston Astros at last summer's deadline. Every player who participates in the WBC must be insured by a provider approved by MLB and the MLB Players Association. \nBad Bunny, who was born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is one of the most streamed artists on the planet. He performed at Super Bowl LX last weekend. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training opened for all 30 MLB teams this week with the annual pitchers and catchers reporting dates coming and going. Most of the free agents are settled in either new homes or back with their same team. Still, a few notable names remain and especially with the litany of early injuries, there will continue to be trades. Let's gather the news and rumors of the day here. Cubs, Miller close to dealThe Cubs and free agent reliever Shelby Miller are \"nearing a multi-year deal,\" according to Fansided.Miller, 35, was a first-round pick all the way back in 2009. His career as a starter was finished a while back, but he pitched to a 2.74 ERA and 1.04 WHIP with 54 strikeouts in 46 innings in relief last season for the Diamondbacks and Brewers. He was a trade deadline acquisition for the Brewers and was roughed up a few times in his month for the ballclub before an elbow injury ended his season. He's expected to miss all of the 2026 season, which is why this is a multi-year deal. The Cubs are going to have him rehabbing in house with eyes on the 2027 season.\nBlue Jays, Astros swing dealThe Blue Jays have traded for outfielder Jesús Sánchez with the Astros getting outfielder Joey Loperfido, both teams announced. Sánchez, 28, hit .237/.304/.395 with 1.3 WAR in 134 games last season for the Marlins and Astros. Loperfido, 26, returns to the Astros organization, where he was drafted and developed until heading to the Blue Jays in the Yusei Kikuchi trade at the 2024 deadline. In 41 games for the Jays last season, he hit .333/.379/.500 with 0.6 WAR.Reds add first base depthFree agent first baseman Nathaniel Lowe has signed with the Reds, reports MLB.com. The 30 year old is coming off a down 2025 season in which he hit .228/.307/.381 with 18 homers and 84 RBI. In the previous three seasons he hit .277/.360/.438 (126 OPS+), so the Reds will be hoping for a bounce-back. \nAngels bringing Taylor backThe Angels and veteran utility man Chris Taylor have agreed to a minor-league deal, per the New York Post. Taylor, 35, started last season with the Dodgers -- where he'd spent the overwhelming majority of his MLB career -- but finished with the Angels after the Dodgers released him. In 58 games between the two stops, he slashed .186/.256/.301.\n            ",

They are coming off a much-needed 85-82 overtime win over No. 5 Illinois, which ended a two-game skid for Michigan State.The Badgers (17-7, 9-4) also are coming off an overtime victory over Illinois, a 92-90 decision in Champaign on Tuesday. Wisconsin is tied for sixth in the Big Ten. The Spartans are 2.5-point favorites over the Badgers.While Michigan State vs. Wisconsin is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule and the NBA's Rising Stars.

Even though they have two road wins (Michigan and Illinois) better than any other team's, Greg Gard's men aren't even among the 10 teams also \"receiving votes\" in the AP Top 25 poll. The Badgers feature a very good back-court in Nick Boyd (20.2 points per game) and John Blackwell (18,7) that would be the envy of many teams. Led by those two, Wisconsin averages 121.7 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom, which ranks 28th in the country. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says the Badgers have a 59.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Wisconsin +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"If the Badgers are a step faster on offense and Jeremy Fears can cut through the Wisconsin defense like Keaton Wagler did, there's a real bucket-for-bucket game script that could take us Over this total,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchRising StarsTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Expert: Team Melo +230 (Mike Barner)The NBA will showcase its best young talent on Friday when the Rising Stars competition takes place at the Intuit Dome. The mini-tournament will feature three teams of the league's rookies and sophomores and one team comprised by G-Leaguers. In the first semifinal, Team Austin will face Team Melo. Team Vince will take on Team T-Mac in the second semifinal, with the two winning teams squaring off in the final. Star rookie Cooper Flagg, who was originally set to play for Team Melo, will miss the game because of an ankle sprain, but Barner still likes the team to win the competition. \"(Ace) Bailey replaces Flagg, and he has been playing well heading into the break, averaging 15.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.6 three-pointers over his last 17 games,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa StateTime: 1 p.m. Saturday | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa State -6.5\nWill he play or won't he? That the question surrounding Kansas Jayhawks star and potential No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson every game now since he has been in and out of the lineup for much of the season, sometimes mysteriously, with various ailments (cramps, hamstring and flu, among other things). When he has played, he has been great (20.5 points per game in 13 starts). And when he hasn't played, the Jayhawks (19-5, 9-2 in Big 12) still have been very good, knocking off No. 1 Arizona on Monday. But on Saturday, Kansas goes on the road to face the fifth-ranked Iowa State Cyclones (21-3, 8-3), who rank sixth in the country in defensive efficiency (92.0 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Cyclones have a 60.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Iowa State -6.5.No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 FloridaTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kentucky +11.5\nThe lead in the SEC will be on the line when the Florida Gators and Kentucky Wildcats collide on Saturday at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (18-6, 9-2 in SEC) lead the conference by one game over the Wildcats (17-7, 8-3) and Arkansas Razorbacks (18-6, 8-3). Florida has emerged once again as the best team in the SEC. Over their last four games, the Gators have outscored opponents by an average score of 92-65. But on Saturday, they face a Kentucky team that is on its own roll, having won eight of its last nine. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance the Wildcats cover this large spread and assigns a C grade to Kentucky +11.5.No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 ArizonaTime: 6:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas Tech +9.5\nThe top-ranked Arizona Wildcats will look to bounce back from their first loss of the season when they host the Texas Tech Red Raiders on Saturday at the McKale Center. On Monday the Wildcats (23-1, 10-1 in Big 12) failed to execute in the second half and lost at Kansas. Meanwhile the Red Raiders (18-6, 8-3) are coming off a 34-point victory against Colorado, which prompted Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle to rip into his team. While the Wildcats figure to have the advantage on the glass, Texas Tech leads the conference and ranks seventh in the nation in 3-point makes per game (11.5), while Arizona ranks 336th (5.9) in that category.

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Michigan faces UCLA Saturday on CBS in a clash of Big Ten foes. This will be the 13th matchup between Michigan and UCLA since the turn of the century, with both programs having six wins against each other during that stretch.  The Wolverines (23-1) are off to their best 24-game start in school history, but are coming off an upset scare against Northwestern. Michigan trailed by as many as 16 points on the road before storming back in the second half to seal an 87-75 win over the Wildcats. Michigan's lone loss came against Wisconsin last month at home.  UCLA has won five of its last six games after starting 4-3 in Big Ten play. The Bruins are coming off a 77-73 win over Washington after guard Trent Perry dropped 23 points. UCLA heads into the weekend 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings.   The Wolverines hold a 2.0-game lead over Illinois for first place.    Michigan vs. UCLA: Need to know  Michigan could make race for No. 1 interesting: Michigan is the projected No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections. The Wolverines jumped to No. 1 overall after Arizona lost to Kansas earlier this week. With Arizona dropping its first game of the season, the AP Top 25 poll on Monday should be interesting. Arizona has been the consensus top-ranked team for several weeks. It wouldn't be surprising to see Michigan get some consideration for No. 1.  \nCan UCLA get Donovan Dent going? The key to a potential upset for UCLA will be Dent. The former New Mexico star has had an up-and-down season with the Bruins after transferring in last offseason. Dent is having one of his best stretches at UCLA after recording at least 10 assists in three consecutive games. He played all 40 minutes against Washington and finished with 17 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.  Aday Mara faces his old team: A storyline to monitor will be Mara, who played the first two seasons of his career at UCLA, facing his old team. Mara played limited minutes under coach Mick Cronin at UCLA but has found a consistent role with the Wolverines. Michigan coach Dusty May has routinely deployed two-big lineups in his rotation. With Mara assuming a more prominent role, he has become one of the nation's best defensive players.    Where to watch Michigan vs. UCLA live  Date: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 12:45 p.m. ET  Location: Crisler Center -- Ann Arbor, Michigan   \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Michigan vs. UCLA prediction, pick  \nFor the first 30 minutes of game time against Northwestern, Michigan looked vulnerable. Then, the Wolverines flipped the switch and looked like the team ranked No. 2 in the country. This game will be a tougher challenge for Michigan than its last matchup against Northwestern. Still, I expect Mara to have a big game against his old team and star forward Yaxel Lendeborg to have a bounce-back performance on offense after scoring just 35 points total in his last three games. Pick: Michigan -15.5\n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -15.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

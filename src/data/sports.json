A Monday MRI revealed that Bryce Young suffered a high ankle sprain, and he is expected to miss at the very least the Week 8 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, per NFL Media. Young completed 15 of 25 passes for 138 yards and one touchdown on Sunday before exiting the contest. Veteran Andy Dalton, who completed 4 of 7 passes for 60 yards, replaced him. Dalton projects to start in place of Young this week. The \"Red Rifle\" is in his third season with Carolina and he started six games, winning just one of them. In 12 total games played with the Panthers, the 37-year-old Dalton has thrown for 1,468 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions.This is a tough break for Young, who is coming off what was just his second career win on the road. So far this season, the former No. 1 overall pick has completed 61.6% of his passes for 1,288 yards, 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. Young's four victories this season match the amount of wins he had in 2024. \nThe Panthers are above .500 for the first time since 2021, but it will reportedly be up to Darnold to keep the winning streak alive. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The latest entry into the Kawhi Leonard cap circumvention saga has arrived. When Clippers owner Steve Ballmer did an interview with ESPN,  he denied any wrongdoing, and disputed the fact that he arranged a \"no-show\" endorsement deal between Leonard and the now-bankrupt company Aspiration. Ballmer also said in that interview that Aspiration was the one to reach out about doing an endorsement deal with Leonard, saying, \"At that time, we hadn't introduced Kawhi to Aspiration. We were done with Kawhi. We were done with Aspiration. The deals were all locked and loaded. Then they did ask to be introduced to Kawhi. Under the rules, we can introduce our sponsors to our athletes. We just can't be involved. We made an introduction.\" However, a report from The Wall Street Journal contradicts Ballmer's claim that Aspiration reached out for a deal with Leonard. Per The Wall Street Journal: \"In December 2021, Sanberg told a high-ranking Aspiration executive that the Clippers had approached him about doing a deal with Leonard, their injured star. The executive recalled Sanberg saying: 'This is important to the Clippers.'\"  \tThe deal was pushed through by Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg despite disagreement from executives within the company, with one executive saying, \"...You can't just commit to a $48M spend without talking to people in the company. I don't get it.\" \nAnother executive said committing that much money to Leonard didn't make sense because, \"Kawhi is a regional star. He doesn't have the charisma of a Steph Curry, LeBron [James] etc.\" By the WSJ's reporting, the fact that the Clippers approached Aspiration about a deal with Leonard directly contradicts Ballmer's comments. And it will almost certainly raise some eyebrows in the league office as the NBA continue its investigation. The investigation stems from a March 2025 bankruptcy filing of Aspiration, which received $50 million in funding from Ballmer. According to the reporting from investigative journalist Pablo Torre, Leonard received a four-year, $48 million deal from Aspiration, but did essentially no promotion work in return. The league is investigating to see if this \"no-show\" deal was used to funnel money to Leonard in a way to circumvent the salary cap.  \nThe NBA hired New York-based law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to conduct the investigation. It's unclear how long this investigation will take, or what punishment -- if any -- will come of it. But if the league deems that the Clippers did circumvent the salary cap with this endorsement deal, then a variety of penalties could be levied upon the Clippers. Los Angeles could receive monetary fines, loss of draft picks, or in the most extreme case, Leonard's contract with the team could be voided, which would make him a free agent. \n            ",

Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of 6) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span.

    "body": "\n        If looking for ranked contests to make Week 9 college football picks on, you'll have to look at the SEC, as the conference has all three such matchups. No. 3 Texas A&M vs. No. 20 LSU (+2.5), No. 8 Ole Miss vs. No. 13 Oklahoma (-4.5) and No. 10 Vanderbilt vs. No. 15 Missouri (+3) will help shape the conference's hierarchy, but there are intriguing matchups outside of the SEC.

UW will host this contest, which is important to note as the Huskies have been one of the best home teams versus the spread under Jedd Fisch. Since he took over last year, Washington is 7-3 ATS at home and 6-2 versus the line as a home favorite. Illinois was embarrassed with a 53-point loss at Indiana earlier this year, and the Illini are coming off an 18-point loss -- and failing to cover -- at home versus Ohio State on Saturday. Add in that Washington has defeated Illinois in four straight meetings, and the model has the Huskies (-4.5) covering almost 60% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Colorado (+14.5, 50.5) covers against Utah in nearly 60% of simulations Saturday at 10:15 p.m. ET. The Buffs upset then-No. 22 Iowa State in Week 7 before their bye, and Colorado is 3-1 ATS following a bye under Deion Sanders. On the other hand, Utah is just 1-5 ATS with a rest disadvantage over the last four seasons, and the Utes lost their AP ranking with a defeat to BYU on Saturday. Utah's once vaunted defense has been exploited in recent weeks as it's allowed an average of 204 rushing yards, and forced zero turnovers, over the last three weeks.

    "body": "\nEach Sunday during the season, I will preview some of the bigger college football games early in the week, give my initial lean, and recommend to either bet it early or wait for a better line. Just for clarification, I will always mention if I already bet the game personally so there is no confusion. My official Week 9 plays will be out later in the week and I will also post all my picks in the SportsLine Discord as soon as I bet them. This article is more about giving advice so you can get the best number in the higher-profile games every Saturday. Here are my early thoughts on the Week 9 matchups.South Carolina +13.5 vs. Alabama\nThis is an interesting game for Alabama. The Crimson Tide have beaten ranked opponents four weeks in a row with wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee. Now Alabama hits the road to face struggling South Carolina as a 13.5-point favorite. The problem for the Gamecocks right now is an offense that can't score points. Then again, when a team hires Mike Shula to be its offensive coordinator, that is an inevitable outcome. Shula's predictable play calling has led to South Carolina averaging just 11 points against SEC opponents not named Kentucky. As we get deeper into October, betting certain spots can be profitable. This looks like one of them to me. It's really tough for college kids to get up for games five weeks in a row. There is no question Alabama is the better team here, but South Carolina is getting the Tide at the perfect time right before their bye week. Shane Beamer is always dangerous as a home dog and I expect the Gamecocks to play their best game of the season. I haven't bet this one yet but I have a strong lean to South Carolina +13.5. We have seen early money come in on the Gamecocks, so I would expect the number to dip a bit. Grab South Carolina early if you like the underdog in this matchup.Bet: South Carolina +13.5Texas -6.5 vs. Mississippi State\nWhat is going on with Texas? The Longhorns continued to look like a mess on offense last week against SEC bottom feeder Kentucky. Texas needed overtime to reach 16 points while Arch Manning went a miserable 12-of-27 for 132 yards. While I certainly don't trust the Longhorns right now, I do believe it might be time to buy low on Texas here given the matchup. Mississippi State is much improved this season under head coach Jeff Lebby. The Bulldogs are 4-3 with losses to Tennessee in overtime and Florida by two. Mississippi State is 3-1 as an underdog and I expect it will be a popular play again this week. The thing that concerns me with the Bulldogs in this matchup is while the defense has improved, it's still not to the level of teams like Oklahoma and Florida. The Bulldogs gave up 30+ points to both Tennessee and Texas A&M. I can see Manning and the Texas' offense having some success on Saturday and the Horns' defense is still one of the best in college football. I recommend waiting if you like Texas this week. I don't see this number moving a lot, although I believe it could go down to 5.5 with all the early money coming in on the home dog.Wait: Texas -5.5 or betterMemphis +3 vs. South Florida\nSometimes college kids look ahead to a more important game and get caught. That was the case with Memphis last week. The Tigers went on the road to play a UAB team that just fired its coach with a huge game on deck against South Florida. So, what happened? Memphis lost outright as a 21.5-point favorite. This week sets up as a great spot to back a quality Memphis team at home coming off an embarrassing loss. Remember, the Tigers may have lost to UAB but they also upset Arkansas. While I like this spot for Memphis, we have to monitor the health of starting quarterback Brendon Lewis throughout the week. Lewis injured his leg late in the fourth quarter against UAB and was replaced by true freshman AJ Hill. Lewis was on crutches after the game, so it doesn't look like he will play. However, Hill is a highly-touted prospect who was competing with Lewis for the starting job deep into the summer. I expect this number to jump significantly during the week. I wouldn't be surprised if USF reaches -6.5 once we get more news on Lewis. If you like USF on Saturday, I would bet them as soon as possible. I don't see a scenario where the line goes under three given Memphis' uncertainty at quarterback. There is no need to rush if you like Memphis here. Let the number continue to climb and wait for it to reach +6 or better. Even with Lewis likely out, I have a strong lean to the Tigers at that number.Wait: Memphis +6 or better\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys players were practically begging new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus to use more man coverage through the first six weeks of the 2025 season. Dallas was a top five defense built on generating quarterback pressure and takeaways under former defensive coordinator Dan Quinn while running man coverage on 33.8% of their defensive plays from 2021 to 2023, the third-highest rate in the NFL in that span. After Dallas ranked 31st in scoring defense (30.7 points per game allowed) and last in the entire NFL in total defense (411.7 total yards allowed) through the first six weeks while running zone coverage on a league-high 87.2% of defensive snaps in 2025, Eberflus relented. The Cowboys ran man coverage at a season-high 49.2% rate on Sunday, per TruMedia, against Quinn's Washington Commanders, and Dallas' defense had their best performance under Eberflus in a 44-22 Week 7 victory. That 49.2% man coverage rate is the highest in the NFL in Week 7 entering \"Monday Night Football.\" How stark of a shift did Eberflus make with his defense? Dallas' next highest man coverage rate of the season was 14.1% in Week 5 at the New York Jets, a 37-22 Cowboys road win. \"It was just all on the same page, getting our details. We were able to play fast out there,\" All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland said. \"We showed who we are out there. It was a great day. ... As a cover guy, I like to be playing man.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys' Jerry Jones avoids providing direct answers about Trevon Diggs' home accident\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's an exciting room in there, and they should be excited,\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame. \"Obviously every Cowboy fan should be excited how that defense played, and they really did some impressive things out there.\"Communication breakdowns in the secondary were at the core of Dallas' defensive issues, and that led to the Cowboys surrendering 49 explosive plays through the first six weeks of the season -- the second-most in the league behind only the Miami Dolphins' 50 entering Week 7. Much of that had to do with zone in a new system with Bland confirming it's easier to communicate and be on top of the details when playing man coverage. As a result, Dallas surrendered just seven explosive plays on Sunday, the team's third-fewest this season. \"Yeah because it's less things you have to look at,\" Bland said when asked if the details are easier to stay on top of in man. \nCowboys defense this seasonWeeks 1-6Week 7 vs. WASPoints per game allowed30.7 (31st)22Total yards allowed411.7 (Last)341Yards per play allowed6.2 (30th)5.3Pass yards per game allowed269.5 (Last) 205Rush yards per game allowed 142.2 (29th)136Third-down conversion rate allowed53.2% (Last)43.8%QB pressure rate38.6% (11th)45%Sacks11 (T-22nd)4Passer rating allowed116.9 (Last) 69.7Takeaways4 (T-26th)2Zone coverage rate87.2% (1st)47.6%  Man coverage rate7.9% (Last)49.2%Blitz rate22.4% (26th)42.5%Eberflus didn't just get more aggressive with his coverage plans, he did so as well with his aggression regarding the blitz: the Cowboys' 42.5% blitz rate in Week 7 tis their highest of the season by a wide margin. The next closest blitz rate Eberflus has dialed up was back in Week 3 against his former employer, the Chicago Bears, in Week 3: 28.6%. Dallas' 45% quarterback pressure rate in Week 7. Naturally, the Cowboys racked up four sacks by four different players -- linebacker Kenneth Murray, linebacker Shemar James, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney and edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku -- for their second-highest sack total of the season behind only their five of New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields in a 37-22 Week 5 road win.\"I feel like he's doing a great job trying to get everybody on the same page, talking to the players and seeing what we look to do and seeing what we're seeing,\" Bland said of Eberflus. \"I think he's doing a good job of that. It just brings a level of confidence that we have a coach who is confident in us and can see what we see. It gives us the confidence to go out there and play for him.\"  Coordinator (Season)Man Coverage RateZone Coverage RateBlitz RateQB Pressure RateDan Quinn (2021–23)33.8% (3rd)63.0% (28th)30.2% (10th)41.4% (1st)Mike Zimmer (2024)26.0% (15th)70.2% (15th)32.7% (10th)36.2% (9th)Matt Eberflus (2025)13.7% (29th) 81.7% (4th)25.4% (21st)39.6% (11th)However, that doesn't mean Eberflus' preferred zone coverage doesn't have a time or place with players. Bland's 68-yard pick-six of Commanders backup quarterback Marcus Mariota came in zone, and that play made Bland's six career pick-sixes both the most by any NFL player in his first four seasons as well as the most career pick-sixes in Cowboys history.  \n\"We were just in a zone, the [running] back leaked out late and didn't see me. Mariota didn't see me in the open space, so I was like 'I got to get this one,'\" Bland said. \"Even though the sun was bleeding in my face a little bit, but it was good. ... It was more so 'don't drop it' because I felt like it was just me and the end zone.\"\nThe more Eberflus can adjust his man and zone coverage blend more closely balanced, the more Dallas' defense will be able to drop the hammer on opposing offenses. \"He's the kind of guy you want to be, and he exudes confidence to the players,\" Jones said of Eberflus. \"I was proud of the way he as well as [head coach] Brian [Schottenheimer] came up with that game plan. Credit goes to the head coach who spent a lot of time on that side of the ball this week along with 'Flus. Made an adjustment certainly gives us a lot of hope as we look to the future as to how this defense can play as we evolve.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With nine AP Top 25 teams losing in a wild Week 8, the path to the College Football Playoff remains chaotic. Few elite teams are separating themselves from the pack, while for others, the road is closing fast as losses pile up. Every misstep matters and margin for error is vanishing quickly for those that entered the 2025 season with hopes of postseason contention -- including Miami, whose loss to Louisville has thrown the Hurricanes' CFP chances into the fast lane of potential uncertainty.Only Ohio State and Indiana are nearing lock status for a CFP spot, while surging Alabama is staking a strong claim with its six-game win streak. The SEC remains deep, with more than half the league still holding a realistic path to a playoff bid. How many spots will the ACC or Big 12 get as top contenders continue to beat each other up?There's also renewed focus on Notre Dame, which continues to see its chances of an at-large bid increase. Whether the Fighting Irish can avoid another loss could determine if the Big Ten or SEC gets an additional spot in the playoff. So, which Power Four teams are clearing traffic and which are stuck in a jam as the final stretch begins? This fifth edition of the College Football Playoff Traffic Report gives an updated snapshot of where each Power Four team stands on the road to the playoff, organized by tiers:\n🚀 On cruise control🟢 In the driver's seat🟡 Bumper-to-bumper🔴 Sitting on the shoulder⛔ Out of the raceThe latest report identifies 25 teams most likely to make the CFP, highlighting those still in contention while flagging programs running low on margin for error -- or already off the playoff path.Let's take a look at the road to the CFP ahead of Week 9.\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Texas A&M, Alabama rise into top five amid shakeup in college football rankings\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n🚀 On cruise controlLook elite, have a clear path and have a lot of margin for errorNo. 1 Ohio State (7-0): The Buckeyes haven't faced much resistance so far in Big Ten play, and quarterback Julian Sayin looks more and more like a Heisman Trophy contender each week. Ohio State heads into a bye week before the final stretch, with a road trip to Michigan standing as the only real obstacle in its path of an undefeated regular season.\nNo. 2 Indiana (7-0): There won't be any distractions about Curt Cignetti's future now that he's locked in with a new massive contract, allowing full focus on a potential return to the CFP. While resurgent UCLA shouldn't be overlooked, the five remaining Big Ten opponents on Indiana's schedule are a combined 14-21 (.400), giving the Hoosiers a clear runway toward another postseason push.No. 4 Alabama (6-1): The Crimson Tide sit in a much more comfortable position now than they did a month ago. Alabama rolled through a gauntlet of four straight AP Top 25 opponents and look like the front-runner in the SEC. Kalen DeBoer has quieted any early-season doubters, and with one of the league's softest remaining schedules, the Tide are firmly back in control of their CFP destiny.No. 3 Texas A&M (7-0): The Aggies are one of just five remaining undefeated Power Four teams but face the toughest closing stretch of that group, with each of their final three road games coming against current AP Top 25 opponents. Texas A&M has been tested on the road, winning its only two trips by a combined four points. Still, Mike Elko and Co. look every bit in control of its CFP path, leaning on an elite defensive front to stay in the CFP hunt.\n🟢 In the driver's seatControl their path, but still vulnerable -- one or two unexpected hiccups could matterNo. 5 Georgia (6-1): At some point, it feels like the Bulldogs' second-half heroics are living on borrowed time. The win against Ole Miss marked the third time in five SEC games that Georgia has erased at least a touchdown deficit after halftime. While it keeps finding ways to respond under pressure, there's certainly some vulnerability if those slow starts continue against top-tier competition.No. 6 Oregon (6-1): It was obvious the Ducks played with some pent-up frustration at Rutgers, just a week removed from their first loss of the season to Indiana. Oregon showed its still an elite outfit. There's little resistance left on the schedule with no current AP Top 25 teams remaining, but road trips to Iowa and rival Washington still carry trap-game potential.\nNo. 12 Notre Dame (5-2): The Fighting Irish have been in must-win mode since mid-September after opening the season with consecutive losses. They delivered in the pouring rain against rival USC, likely their only remaining chance to notch a ranked win and keep their CFP hopes alive -- which isn't good for any others hoping to get an at-large bid.No. 7 Georgia Tech (7-0): Raise your hand if you had Georgia Tech as the last remaining unbeaten ACC team at the start of the season. (No, you didn't.) The Yellow Jackets still have company atop the conference standings, but their remaining league opponents are just 5-10 (.333) in ACC play. If Brent Key's group can avoid a slip-up, that regular-season finale against Georgia could decide far more than just Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.No. 11 BYU (7-0): All that preseason hype surrounding Texas Tech and Utah, and now it's BYU that controls its own destiny for a spot in the CFP. But the Cougars will have to prove it the hard way, with their next four opponents -- at Iowa State, at Texas Tech, TCU and at Cincinnati -- all sitting at 5-2 or better. It's the second toughest stretch left for any unbeaten team in the country.\nNo. 13 Oklahoma (6-1): The Sooners face one of, if not the toughest closing stretches in the country. Each of their last five opponents ranks in the current AP Top 25, leaving little room for error. Oklahoma found its lost run game at South Carolina, but it'll need to rely on a defense that has surrendered double digits just three times this season to navigate the gauntlet and keep their CFP hopes alive.No. 9 Miami: (5-1): Just when the Hurricanes seemed on a clear track for the CFP, an interception streak returned to haunt Carson Beck in a loss to Louisville. With one mulligan already used, Miami risks slipping late in the season, much like last year when two November losses ended its playoff hopes.No. 14 Texas Tech (6-1): Even after spending a fortune on talent, the Red Raiders were reminded that games are still decided on the field. They erased a 12-point fourth-quarter deficit before giving up a late touchdown in a loss at Arizona State. The Big 12 is unpredictable, so one loss isn't fatal -- but Texas Tech can't rely on paychecks to carry them through the stretch run.\nNo. 8 Ole Miss (6-1): The Rebels knew coming into this crucial two-game stretch that they needed to at least split matchups against Georgia and Oklahoma to keep their CFP hopes firmly within reach. After suffering their first loss of the season in Athens, the upcoming game versus the Sooners is now potentially a must-win.No. 10 Vanderbilt (6-1): Diego Pavia is going to carry the Commodores as far as his legs and arm can take them. There's still plenty of work to overcome, with key games against Missouri, at Texas and at Tennessee looming on the schedule. But purely on vibes, Vanderbilt has the resilience to keep the CFP conversation alive if Pavia continues to play at this level.No. 15 Missouri (6-1): Eli Drinkwitz has the Tigers in position to be in the CFP conversation down the stretch, but he has to finally win against AP Top 25 SEC opponents. Missouri has dropped each of its last four such games, and with upcoming matchups against Vanderbilt, Texas A&M and Oklahoma, there's little room for error -- a couple slip-ups could derail a playoff push.\nNo. 16 Virginia (6-1): The Cardiac Cavaliers? Each of Virginia's past three games have been decided in either overtime or by fewer than three points. That's not necessarily an ideal way to win, but each victory brings the Cavaliers closer to a major breakthrough under coach Tony Elliott. They also have one of the easiest remaining slates in the ACC.🟡 Bumper-to-bumperAlive, but their path is crowded, narrow or highly dependent on othersNo. 22 Texas (5-2): Let's be honest, the Longhorns offense stinks, and it's likely to cost them a shot at returning to the CFP for a third consecutive season. While the Texas defense remains one of the best in the nation, the three remaining games against current AP Top 10 opponents feel more like obstacles than opportunities.No. 17 Tennessee (5-2): Both of the Volunteers' losses this season came against teams currently ranked in the top five of the AP poll. But Tennessee still doesn't have a ranked win on its resume, and the opportunities are dwindling. With upcoming matchups against Oklahoma and Vanderbilt, every remaining game feels like a must-win if the Volunteers want to stay in CFP contention.\nNo. 19 Louisville (5-1): That win at Miami could prove invaluable later in the season if the ACC comes down to tiebreakers. Louisville doesn't have another ranked opponent on the schedule, but a head-to-head showdown at SMU in November could have major implications for the conference title race.No. 21 Cincinnati (6-1): The Bearcats are quietly one of the hottest teams in the country, riding a six-game win streak. While Cincinnati controls its own destiny in the Big 12 race, its remaining slate is among the toughest in the conference, with road trips to Utah, BYU and TCU all posing major tests.No. 20 LSU (5-2): Barring a significant turnaround in the final stretch, it appears unlikely LSU can climb its way back into the CFP picture. The Tigers' best win so far is at Clemson to open the season -- which doesn't carry much weight this year.\nNo. 25 Michigan (5-2): The Wolverines are on the road for three of their next four games, a tough stretch with Sherrone Moore holding just a 2-5 record away from Ann Arbor as Michigan's coach.No. 24 Arizona State (5-2): The Sun Devils made a statement that they aren't going to give up their title as reigning Big 12 champions easily with a stunning win over Texas Tech. Now, with the easiest remaining schedule in the conference, the path is opening for Arizona State to make a late push toward the CFP.SMU (5-2): How's this for consistency? The Mustangs haven't lost a regular-season conference game since November 2022, riding a 20-game winning streak. SMU is also a perfect 11-0 in the regular season against ACC opponents since joining. However, both Miami and Louisville are still on the schedule, providing stiff tests before a legit consideration for the CFP again.No. 23 Illinois (5-2): The Fighting Illini could make a strong case for an at-large CFP bid if they avoid another loss in their final five games. The only blemishes on Illinois' resume are losses to the current top two teams in the country -- Ohio State and Indiana -- but putting their fate in the committee's hands is always unpredictable.🔴 Sitting on the shoulderTechnically alive, but path is long, risky or dependent entirely on outside chaosACC: California, Duke, PittsburghBig 12: Baylor, Houston, Iowa State, TCU, UtahBig Ten: Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Northwestern, USC, WashingtonSEC: None⛔ Out of the raceEffectively eliminated or realistically cannot make the playoffACC: Boston College, Clemson, Florida State, North Carolina, NC State, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Wake ForestBig 12: Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, UCF, West VirginiaBig Ten: Maryland, Michigan State, Penn State, Purdue, Rutgers, UCLA, WisconsinSEC: Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi State, South Carolina\n            ",

White said. \"Patrick Mahomes got whatever he wanted through the air, and it could be a similar situation this week with potential MVP Baker Mayfield coming to town. Despite losing another receiver to injury on Sunday, Mayfield threw two long TDs and had no issue putting up points on a solid 49ers defense. With the Bucs' quality rush defense, I don't think the Lions will be able to salt away this game, and I trust Mayfield to keep his team close in the second half.\"Bet Lions vs. Buccaneers at FanDuel, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Game: Seattle Seahawks vs. Houston Texans (10 p.m. ET)The Pick: Under 41.5 (-115)Houston's defense held Baltimore to just 10 points two weeks ago prior to its Week 6 bye, as safety Jalen Pitre had a pair of interceptions. Seattle's defense is coming off a strong showing of its own, holding Jacksonville to 273 yards, including 59 rushing yards. The Seahawks had seven sacks and forced three consecutive fourth-quarter punts. Both teams rank inside the top six in the NFL in points allowed per game. The model has the Under cashing in 60% of simulations.Bet Seahawks vs. Texans at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins plus three free months of NBA League Pass:More NFL best betsEvery NFL game simulated 10,000 timesBlue Jays vs. Mariners best betsGame: Toronto Blue Jays vs. Seattle Mariners, ALCS, Game 7 (8:08 p.m. ET)The Pick: Under 7.5 runs (-110)\"Certainly not naive to how high-scoring this series has been, but Game 7s usually are low scoring simply as both teams can throw a parade of arms out there with the season on the line and no usage worries,\" SportsLine handicapper Matt Severance said. \"Just quickly looking from the LCS Round (both), five of the past six Game 7s, for example, would land Under this. What's the O/U of total pitchers we may see here? 15.5? Randy Johnson and Dave Stieb may each throw a third of an inning.\"Bet Mariners vs. Blue Jays at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the promo code CBS20X:More MLB best

Monday Night Football begins with Lions vs. Buccaneers at 7 p.m. ET and will conclude with Seahawks vs. Texans at 10 p.m. ET, and Game 7 of the ALCS in the MLB Playoffs will be sandwiched in between, with Blue Jays vs. Mariners starting at 8:08 p.m. ET.Picks from all three games are among our MLB and NFL best bets at BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts Get the newest BetMGM bonus code and take advantage of one of the best sportsbook promos. Get started now:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 42-25 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also entered the ALCS and NLCS rounds of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season.   Anybody following its picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Monday's MLB and NFL best bets at BetMGMOver 52.5 points in Lions vs. Buccaneers (-110)Seahawks -3.5 vs. Texans (-105)Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (+110)Combining these three picks into a Monday MLB and NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +682 (risk $100 to win $682). Bet it at BetMGM here:Over 52.5 points in Lions vs. Buccaneers (-110)These two teams were top four in the NFL in scoring last season and they were both top six in scoring entering Week 7, with Detroit averaging 31.8 points per game and Tampa Bay averaging 27.5 points per game despite an injury-ravaged season. The Buccaneers are hopeful that Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka (both battling hamstring injuries) will be able to play tonight and that certainly lends itself well to scoring. The Lions and Bucs rank 20th and 22nd in the NFL in scoring defense so far and the model predicts that the Over hits in 58% of simulations. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Seahawks -3.5 vs. Texans (-105)\"The Texans looked fantastic in their two games before the bye, but both came against broken offenses that couldn't move the ball. The Seahawks have been anything but, ranking first in yards per play with an elite passing attack that has a chance to beat Houston's pass defense in a strength vs. strength matchup,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The major edge is on the other side of the ball, as the Seahawks also have an elite defense while the Texans offense looked awful prior to its uncompetitive matchups.\" Back the Seahawks at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (+110)\"Recency bias can be hard to overlook in a crucial game seven to decide who goes to the World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays have captured that with winning three out of the past four games over Seattle. In fact they had game five in their grasp as well before a five run eighth inning from the Mariners,\" SportsLine handicapper Zack Cimini said. \"The turn of events was sparked in game three by Shane Bieber but look for this Mariners team to respond as they did in the ALDS against Detroit in game five. Seattle heads to the World Series.\" Back the Mariners at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Want NFL picks for Week 7?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets. Now, get against the spread, total and money-line picks for every NFL game on the Week 7 schedule, all from the model that's simulated every game 10,000 times. Also at SportsLine:You can also see weekend MLB picks from legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall, who is 181-167-3 (+2944) over his last 351 MLB picks. See his best bets right here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Monday Night Football will feature its fourth doubleheader of the 2025 NFL season when the Detroit Lions host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 7 p.m. ET, and the Seattle Seahawks host the Houston Texans at 10 p.m. ET to conclude the Week 7 NFL schedule. The Lions (4-2) are coming off a 30-17 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday Night Football, while the Buccaneers (5-1) defeated the 49ers, 30-19, last week. The Seahawks (4-2) defeated the Jaguars, 20-12, last week and the Texans (2-3) are coming off a bye. Houston defeated the Ravens, 44-10, in Week 5. The Lions are favored by six points, according to the latest NFL odds, and the Seahawks are three-point favorites. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Buccaneers vs. Lions and Texans vs. Seahawks.

Before their 30-17 loss to the Chiefs, Detroit scored at least 34 points in four straight contests, averaging 40.3 points per game during that span. The Lions return to Detroit this weekend, where they have a 52-21 victory over the Bears and a 34-10 win over the Browns this season. Detroit covered the spread in both of those matchups. It's also difficult to find a team facing more skill-position injuries than Tampa Bay, which will be without Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) and Chris Godwin (fibula). Rookie sensation Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) is reportedly unlikely to play, leaving Tampa Bay short another receiver. With all that, the model projects the Lions to cover the spread in 51% of simulations.Over 52.5 pointsBaker Mayfield hasn't had his full complement of playmakers all season, and still, Tampa Bay is sixth in scoring, averaging 27.5 ppg. Tampa Bay has scored at least 25 points in four straight games, and three of their last four games totaled at least 56 points. Mayfield completed 17 of 23 passes for 256 yards and two touchdowns with Kameron Johnson, Sterling Shepard, Cade Otton and Tez Johnson all having at least 45 yards, as Mayfield has proven he can elevate lesser-accomplished pass-catchers. Meanwhile, the Lions have the No. 2 scoring offense (31.8 ppg) as they've scored at least 34 points in four straight games. Tampa Bay's last four games have finished Over their over/under, and 12 of 17 Tampa Bay regular-season games went Over last year. The model projects the Over to hit in 61% of simulations.Seahawks vs. Texans betting preview, picksTexans (+3)Houston has the rest advantage coming off the bye and is coming off a pair of dominant victories. The Texans defeated the Ravens. 44-10, in Week 5 after a 26-0 victory over the Titans the week before. Houston has the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL, allowing just 12.2 ppg, and no team has scored more than 20 points against the unit this season. Seattle is 4-2 this season, but two of its four victories have come in one-score games, including a three-point victory against the Cardinals. With two weeks for the talented Houston defense to prepare for Seattle, the model projects the Texans to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.Under 41 pointsThe Houston defense is certainly a significant reason for the model favoring the Under, but Seattle also has one of the top scoring defenses in the NFL, allowing 19.5 ppg, the sixth-lowest in the NFL. The Seahawks are coming off a 20-12 win over the Jaguars last week, and they've allowed 20 points or fewer in five of six games this season. The only team to go Over that total was Tampa Bay, which is sixth in the NFL at 27.5 ppg this season. Tampa Bay was also the only team to reach 20 points against Houston this year. But with no Baker Mayfield in sight for the latter half of Monday Night Football, the model projects the Under to hit. The Under has hit in four of five Texans games this season, while also cashing in two of the last three Seattle games. The model projects the Under to hit in 60% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Tampa Bay is 5-1, including 3-0 on the road, this season, and the Mariners have won two of the three games played in Toronto in the ALCS entering Game 7.

Tampa Bay has scored at least 30 points in back-to-back games, as even with various wide receiver injuries, Baker Mayfield continues to raise the talent around him. The Lions are coming off a 30-17 loss to the Chiefs, and Tampa Bay should be able to use that film to gameplan ways to shock the Lions. Tampa Bay is the underdog for a reason, as the Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last year and have won each of their home games this season, but the model projects Tampa Bay to win in 37% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 30.3%. This is strong value for the model to view Tampa Bay as a best bet at DraftKings. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Texans (+140) to defeat the SeahawksHouston had one of the least efficient offenses in the NFL over the first three weeks, averaging 12.7 ppg during its 0-3 start. However, in recent weeks, the Texans have played offensively and defensively like a team that has made the playoffs in back-to-back seasons, outscoring opponents, 70-10. Houston is coming off its bye, so fatigue shouldn't be an issue for the No. 1 scoring defense (12.2 ppg) in the NFL this season. Seattle is off to a strong start at 4-2, but at +140 odds for Houston, the model projects the value in the Texans' direction. The model has Houston winning in 46% of simulations, compared to its implied odds of 41.67%. Back Houston at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Mariners (+109) to defeat the Blue JaysThe Mariners had a chance to close out Toronto in Game 6 but lost 6-2. But the model projects Seattle to capture that final victory to reach its first World Series in franchise history on Monday. Game 7 features the same pitching matchup as Game 3, which Toronto won, 13-4. But that doesn't guarantee a similar result for Monday. Shane Bieber held the Mariners to two runs in six innings on Wednesday, but he made just seven starts in the regular season following Tommy John surgery. Seattle starter George Kirby allowed eight runs in four innings in Game 3, but he allowed just three runs over 10 innings in his first two postseason starts. The Mariners closed the regular season as the hottest team in baseball, and the model projects that to carry into a winner-take-all Game 7. The model projects the Mariners to win in 53% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Mariners at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more NFL picks and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers sealed their 20-10 win over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night with a touchdown in the final three minutes of the game, but it's a score that probably shouldn't have counted. According to to former NFL referee Terry McAulay, who now works as a rules analyst for NBC, the 49ers should have been flagged for what appeared to be a blatant penalty on the play. With just over two minutes left to play in the game, the 49ers were leading 13-10 and they had a first-and-goal at Atlanta's 4-yard line. On the play, Mac Jones turned around and handed the ball to Christian McCaffrey, who looked like he was going to be stopped, but then multiple teammates pulled him into the end zone. The only problem with that is that it's illegal to pull your teammates. Let's check out the play. \nMcAulay was asked about the play during the broadcast and he made it clear that No. 75 (Connor Colby) should have been flagged for pulling McCaffrey into the end zone. \n\"It's illegal to lift or pull the runner in any direction,\" McAulay said. \"This should have been a foul for helping the runner, 10-yard penalty from the spot of the foul.\"If the 49ers would have been penalized, it certainly would have changed the game. The pulled started around the 2-yard line, so that's where the penalty would have been enforced. If the flag had been thrown, McCaffrey's score would have been wiped off the board and the 49ers would have faced a first-and-goal from Atlanta's 12-yard line. In that situation, there's no guarantee the 49ers would have been able to score a touchdown, and if they had been held to a field goal, the Falcons could have gotten the ball back trailing just 16-10. Instead, the 49ers got the score and that pretty much iced the game. \nOne reason the 49ers didn't get flagged is because pulling is a penalty that NFL officials almost never call. According to Football Zebras, the last time a player got penalized for pulling a teammate came all the way back during a playoff game in January 1991, so it's been almost 35 years. This is clearly a foul that's only going to be called in blatant situations, and McAulay thought this was one situation where the flag should have been thrown. McAulay spent 20 seasons as an NFL ref and during that time, he officiated three Super Bowls. \n            ",

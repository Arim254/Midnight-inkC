Smith-Njigba put together one of the most prolific seasons in recent memory en route to winning OPOY and also earned a first-team All-Pro selection in the process. He beat out fellow receiver, Puka Nacua of the Los Angeles Rams, for the honor.Smith-Njigba led the NFL with 1,793 yards receiving over the regular season, which also set a new franchise record. In fact, his receiving yard total blew the previous record held by DK Metcalf (1,303) out of the water. Smith-Njigba rewrote the record book while being the most involved pass catcher in the league this season, notching an NFL-high 36.2% target share. \nSmith-Njigba is just the sixth wide receiver to ever win Offensive Player of the Year since the award began being handed out in 1972. He joins Justin Jefferson (2022), Cooper Kupp (2021), Michael Thomas (2019), and Jerry Rice (1993 and 1987) as the only receivers to win the award. Of course, Smith-Njigba does have bigger fish to fry as his Seahawks are gearing up for a matchup with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX on Sunday. Already, he is just the fifth player to lead the league in receiving yards and reach the Super Bowl. Each of those prior four receivers ended up winning the Super Bowl, so this is potentially an encouraging sign for Seattle, if history is any indicator. \nPlayer (year)Lead the NFL in rec. yardsReached Super BowlSB resultJaxon Smith-Njigba (2025)YesYes???Cooper Kupp (2021)YesYesWonJerry Rice (1994)YesYesWonJerry Rice (1989)YesYesWonDrew Pearson (1977)YEsYesWonSmith-Njigba and the Seahawks will kick off Super Bowl LX against New England on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET. \n            \n    ",

Here's why and how to watch:Why are Milan and Christian Pulisic not playing this weekend? AC Milan won't be playing this weekend in Italy as the home stadium of the Rossoneri, San Siro, will host the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic games on Friday. AC Milan, currently second in the Serie A standings, five points behind Inter, were supposed to face Como this weekend, but as San Siro couldn't host soccer games for the last two weeks due to the opening ceremony, Massimiliano Allegri's team will meet Cesc Fabregas' Como on Wednesday, Feb. 18 at 2:45 p.m. ET. The Italian Serie A tried to play this fixture between AC Milan and Como in Perth, Australia, just like how LaLiga attempted to play Barcelona vs. Villarreal in Miami last year but then announced on Dec. 22 that \"plans for Perth to host the first ever official European league match for points outside its national borders are off, following the mutual agreement of Lega Calcio Serie A and the Western Australian Government. Both parties have come to this decision due to financial risks that could not be mitigated, onerous approval conditions, and last-minute complications beyond their control,\" they said. How to watch Juventus vs. Lazio, oddsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Allianz Stadium -- Turin Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Juventus -132; Draw +244; Lazio +395How to watch Serie A Matchday 24All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 6Hellas Verona vs. Pisa, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, Feb. 7Genoa vs. Napoli, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Torino, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 8Bologna vs. Parma, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Udinese, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Sassuolo vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Feb. 9Atalanta vs. Cremonese, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Cagliari, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Matthew Stafford has done it. He's the 2025 NFL MVP after edging out Drake Maye for the award. Stafford may have fallen short of a second Super Bowl, but this is a pretty nice consolation prize as he earned the award after becoming the first quarterback to lead the NFL in pass yards, pass touchdowns and TD-INT ratio since Tom Brady in 2007.The award also puts a bow on Stafford's career and if history is any indication, he's now a virtual lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He's the 15th QB in NFL history with an NFL MVP and Super Bowl title (as a starter). Ten of the other 14 already have gold jackets, while Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes will one day make it 13 of 14. The only Hall of Fame-eligible QB on this list who is not in Canton is Joe Theismann, whose career ended abruptly in 1985 after a gruesome leg injury.\n        \n            \n                Pro Football Hall of Fame 2026: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Roger Craig headline five-member induction class\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQBs with NFL MVP and Super Bowl titleIn Pro Football Hall of Fame?Matthew StaffordNot eligible yetJoe MontanaYesTerry BradshawYesBart StarrYesJohn ElwayYesPeyton ManningYesJohnny UnitasYesKen StablerYesSteve YoungYesBrett FavreYesKurt WarnerYesTom BradyNot eligible yetAaron RodgersNot eligible yetPatrick MahomesNot eligible yetJoe TheismannNoOf course, being in this list alone doesn't guarantee a QB makes the Hall of Fame. However, it was the only missing piece of Stafford's Hall of Fame resume, and now it is a critical addition that separates him from other quarterbacks he could find himself on the Hall of Fame ballot with in the next five to 10 years. It's going to be tough to judge quarterbacks like Stafford, Matt Ryan, Russell Wilson, Eli Manning and Philip Rivers once they collide on the ballot (if they do) as they've all compiled historic passing numbers in an era where passing numbers have become inflated. You won't find Cam Newton on the below \"bubble\" lists because his rushing stats make his best Hall of Fame case, but consider him another quarterback Stafford will have to top in the Hall of Fame voting process (Newton won an MVP and lost in the Super Bowl).Notable 2000s QBs on the Hall of Fame bubbleMVPTitlesPass TDPass YardsMatthew Stafford1142364,516Philip Rivers0042563,984Eli Manning0236657,023Russell Wilson0135346,966Matt Ryan1038162,792Breaking it down even further, Stafford hardly separates himself when you compare his annual rankings to those of these bubble quarterbacks. They were all great quarterbacks who found themselves near the top 10 of the NFL's annual passing leaderboards on occasion, but certainly not often enough to be a surefire Hall of Famer.  Notable 2000s QBs on the Hall of Fame bubble - passer rating ranksAvg Passer Rating RankTop 10sTop 5sMatthew Stafford1462Philip Rivers1075Eli Manning1910Russell Wilson9105Matt Ryan1362Stafford's average annual ranks for passer rating (14th), pass touchdowns (13th) and pass yards (11th) are more or less in the same ballpark as these quarterbacks.Notable 2000s QBs on the Hall of Fame bubble - pass TD and yards ranksAvg Pass TD rankTop 10sAvg Pass yds rankTop 10sMatthew Stafford136119Philip Rivers811713Eli Manning117107Russell Wilson108154Matt Ryan118811That makes his trophy case all the more important. Nobody on this list won both an MVP and a Super Bowl as he did.Second act for the agesI'm not sure what the Hall of Fame case would be against Stafford after this award. He could also return in 2026 and add to his resume. He's proved in five seasons with the Rams what he could have done in a decade plus with Detroit if he didn't have one of the worst supporting casts in the league (minus Calvin Johnson). He obviously never won a playoff game with the Lions and wasn't usually among the league's best quarterbacks on the stat sheet, but we can almost take that with a grain of salt now.He rivals Peyton Manning for the best second act by a quarterback in NFL history:Stafford is the first quarterback all-time to win his first MVP award and first Super Bowl title, both at age 34 or older. Stafford is the fourth quarterback to win an NFL MVP and Super Bowl after changing teams (Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Steve Young) Stafford is the oldest quarterback to win his first NFL MVP (37)Stafford is the oldest quarterback to lead the NFL in Pass TD for the first time (37)Stafford is the third player with three seasons with 40+ touchdown passes (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers)It's crazy to think that five years ago, Stafford was thought of as a compiler with a rocket arm that had never won a playoff game. Now, with all that talent and the right pieces around him, he has a Hall of Fame resume worthy of football immortality in Canton, Ohio.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The gambling scandal that has ensnared two Cleveland Guardians players has grown in scale. According to court documents filed on Thursday, Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase is accused by prosecutors of throwing pitches to benefit bettors in a total of 48 games in recent years, ESPN reports. Last year, Clase and a Cleveland teammate, right-handed starter Luis L. Ortiz, were indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. According to the Department of Justice, both pitchers \"agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types of pitches and speeds of pitches.\"The Department of Justice went on to allege that the pair made at least $450,000 by rigging outings and throwing specific pitches to the benefit of bettors placing wagers on the outcome of those pitches. Both Clase and Ortiz pleaded not guilty to those charges in November of last year. In that unsealed indictment, prosecutors listed nine occasions on which Clase was alleged to have thrown a suspicious  pitch. The Thursday filing, however, increases that total by more than five fold. Clase is alleged to have begun his illegal activity in May of 2023, and Ortiz is alleged to have joined the scheme in June of 2025 for a pair of games. Clase and Ortiz have been on administrative leave since late June of 2025 while Major League Baseball investigates. Clase, 27, has been one of the most dominant closers in baseball the last few years. He's a three-time All-Star, and in 2024 he finished third in the American League Cy Young vote. Ortiz, also 27, has made 50 starts and 25 relief appearances across parts of four MLB seasons. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on the charges of wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. \n\"Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,\" the closer's attorney told CBS Sports in a November statement when the charges were first announced. \"Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"\"Luis is and always has been a fierce competitor. He has always given his best effort in every inning of every game. Those who have played with him know this. And the government's investigation, including discussions with Luis' teammates, supports this as well,\" Ortiz's lawyer told CBS Sports in a statement around that same time. \"...There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court. The government's case is weak and circumstantial. He will defend himself, and he will prevail.\"Ortiz's lawyer also said that all payments and money transfers were \"for lawful activities.\"\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on May 4. \n            ",

At Thursday's NFL Honors, Vrabel was named Coach of the Year for the 2025 season after spearheading an eye-popping turnaround with New England. What Vrabel was able to accomplish in Year 1 with the Patriots was nothing short of remarkable. The franchise had endured back-to-back 4-13 seasons, which resulted in the team moving on from Bill Belichick after the 2023 campaign and then firing Jerod Mayo after a lone season in 2024. Vrabel became the first head coach to inherit a 13-loss team and win at least 13 games in his first year. So far, the Patriots have tallied 17 wins in Year 1 of the Vrabel era (including playoffs), which ties him with George Seifert for the most all time. If he wins Super Bowl LX, he'd own the record on his own with 18. Year (Team)CoachMost wins in Year 1 (including playoffs)2025 (Patriots)Mike Vrabel171989 (49ers)George Seifert172009 (Colts)Jim Caldwell16Beyond that, New England won the AFC East for the first time since 2019 and is now on the doorstep of a Super Bowl appearance. If the Patriots defeat the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, Vrabel would become the fifth coach to win a Super Bowl in his first season on the job. He's also just the third person to win the Super Bowl as a player and coach for any franchise and the first to do so with the same team. \nThis is the second time Vrabel has won the award, first claiming it in 2021 when he was head coach of the Tennessee Titans. This year, he beat out a group of finalists consisting of Liam Coen (Jaguars), Ben Johnson (Bears), Mike Macdonald (Seahawks), and Kyle Shanahan (49ers). \n            \n    ",

He joins Cam Newton (2011) as the only Offensive Rookie of the Year winners in Panthers history.The No. 8 overall pick out of Arizona, McMillan showed immediate promise as a lead wide receiver for Bryce Young and the Panthers, reaching 100 yards in his second NFL game. He found the end zone twice -- his first two NFL scores -- in a Week 6 win over the Dallas Cowboys. Overall, McMillan finished his rookie campaign with 70 receptions for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns.

    "body": "\n        In his third start of the season, Chris Gotterup has his eyes fixed on his second victory of the year. The free-swinging right-hander was flawless Thursday morning at the 2026 WM Phoenix Open as he navigated TPC Scottsdale in bogey-free fashion, signing for an 8-under 63.Gotterup's effort was good enough to give him a two-shot lead over Matt Fitzpatrick, who similarly reached 8 under before dropping a pair of strokes late in his round. A trio of young, budding stars in Michael Thorbjornsen, Nicolai Hojgaard and Pierceson Coody, along with Sam Stevens, sit one further back at 5 under.\"I think, to start the year, I really felt like I worked hard in the offseason to get ready for the season,\" Gotterup said. \"TGL in the offseason also, just getting used to the adrenaline rush you get inside there and being able to hit shots under pressure has helped me and my game. It's nice to start the year off on a good note.\"Gotterup played alongside world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who struggled to a 73, his first round over par since June 2025, and Jordan Spieth, who signed for a 70. Gotterup got things rolling in the middle of the back nine, starting his round on the par-4 10th. He rolled in an eagle putt from off the green on the par-5 13th and followed it with three straight birdie connections from the 6-10 foot range.\nThough he failed to get up-and-down short of the par-4 17th for a fifth straight par-breaker, Gotterup made up for it quickly by dialling in a 25-foot birdie bid on No. 18 to turn in 6 under. Moving to the more difficult front nine, Gotterup managed his game well. He took advantage of the lone par 5 (missing a 7-foot eagle putt) and once again summoned a birdie from distance on the par-3 7th for his final birdie of the day.\"I feel like I'm doing things well and thinking through things well, and I think that's the most important thing,\" Gotterup said. \"I wouldn't say today I drove it my best or did anything -- I putted great today, but I just was in the right spot when I needed to be. I drove it unbelievably and did good stuff there. It's nice to play well and also have other parts complement that. It's been nice to manage my game properly.\"Gotterup was chasing Fitzpatrick for most of the morning as the Englishman looked shot out of a cannon in the early going. Fitzpatrick played his first eight holes in 7 under and turned in 29 as the course record (60) crept into conversation. Like Gotterup, he added a birdie on No. 3, but unlike the leader, he was unable to run through the finish line and scored bogeys on Nos. 8-9.\n\"It's disappointing. I guess the way you got to look at it is if I started bogey, bogey, and you finish 6-under, you come off feeling like the greatest player in the world,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"You got to try and reframe it there. If someone would've said, 'Here is 6-under to start day,' and I can stay in bed, I would've snatched your hand off. I'm in a good position to start with and hopefully kick on.\"Gotterup and Fitzpatrick benefited from calmer conditions on Thursday as winds picked up and posed problems for players as the round progressed. Notable scores from the afternoon wave include Hideki Matsuyama's 68, Viktor Hovland's 69, Xander Schauffele's 71 and Brooks Koepka's 75.Leader1. Chris Gotterup (-8): Gotterup has now played nine rounds in 2026, and the scores read as follows: 63, 69, 68, 64, 68, 70, 70, 69, 63. All nine of these efforts have come in under par (even at the difficult Torrey Pines South Course) as the third-year PGA Tour member has come into the new year as a new-look player.\nThe 26-year-old is driving the ball great, but the iron play and course management have leapt forward. He's picking his spots wisely, playing to his strong points and never really gets out in front of himself. This can make up for deficiencies while also emphasising one's strengths.\"We went through some stats from last year, and obviously, I had a great year last year,\" Gotterup said. \"There were like two or three things that were kind of glaring in terms of losing shots in spots where if I didn't look at stats I probably would've said I did decent at. We worked on that, and that was really the only things … other than just normal practice. Those were things that I worked on to get ready for this year.\"\nContenders2. Matt Fitzpatrick (-6)T3. Michael Thorbjornsen, Nicolai Hojgaard, Pierceson Coody, Sam Stevens (-5)T7. Kevin Roy, Max McGreevy, Daniel Berger, Jake Knapp, Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen (-4)After splitting time between the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA Tour during his rookie season, Coody has started his sophomore campaign in stride. The righty has rattled off three straight top 20s with a runner-up result materialising last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.\nWith his start to the year, Coody commands the top spot in the Aon Swing 5, which would put him in the next two signature events -- the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Genesis Invitational -- but he is eyeing more, as a win would secure a whole lot more for the 26-year-old.\"It's certainly a different spot than I was in my rookie year,\" Coody said. \"I think I missed the first six cuts my rookie year. Last year, obviously, wasn't playing on the West Coast and didn't play in Florida, either, so I knew I was only going to start in the middle of the year essentially. \"Yeah, to be one up on the way I've started the last couple years feels really nice.

The Los Angeles Rams quarterback was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the 2025 season at the NFL Honors on Thursday night. This comes after a sensational season for the veteran quarterback, who also earned first-team All-Pro honors. Stafford beat out Drake Maye of the New England Patriots for the award by one first-place vote.After accepting the award, Stafford announced that he will be returning in 2026 after initial speculation that the veteran may retire, saying, \"I'll see you guys next year.\"Stafford now becomes the oldest quarterback to win his first NFL MVP award at 37 years old. His 46 passing touchdowns on the year not only led the NFL, but were a career high and set a new franchise record for Los Angeles. The veteran was just the fourth quarterback in the history of the league to have at least 45 passing touchdowns and under 10 interceptions in a season. QBs with 45+ pass TDs & under 10 INTs in a seasonSeasonMVP?Matthew Stafford 2025YesAaron Rodgers2020YesAaron Rodgers2011YesTom Brady2007YesMoreover, Stafford joined Tom Brady (2007) as the only players to lead the NFL in passing touchdowns, passing yards, and TD-INT ratio over the last 50 seasons.  \nWith those kinds of numbers, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that he finds himself the MVP of the league. \nWith this MVP award now on his résumé to pair with his Super Bowl LVI title, the next question surrounding Stafford is whether or not he has now propelled himself to one day being enshrined in Canton, Ohio, at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  \nQBs with SB title and MVP awardIn the Pro Football Hall of Fame?Matthew Stafford???Joe MontanaYesTerry BradshawYesBart StarrYesJohn ElwayYesPeyton ManningYesJohnny UnitasYesKen StablerYesSteve YoungYesBrett FavreYesKurt WarnerYesTom BradyNot eligible yetAaron RodgersNot eligible yetPatrick MahomesNot eligible yetJoe TheismannNoOf the 14 quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, along with an NFL MVP award, 10 have been inducted into the Hall of Fame, three are not eligible yet, and only one (Joe Theismann, who had a career-ending leg injury) has been rejected.\n            \n    ",

This comes after the Cleveland Browns pass rusher orchestrated a record-setting year, breaking the single-season sack record with 23. This is the second DPOY award Garrett has won in his career, with the first coming in 2023. Garrett's 23 sacks surpassed both Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021), who co-held the record at 22.5. On top of the sacks, Garrett had 33 tackles for loss, which were the second-most in the NFL over the last 25 years. His 39 quarterback hits also ranked second in the league in 2025. The former No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was heads and shoulders above the rest of his peers this season when it came to sacking the quarterback. Garrett had 6.5 more sacks than the next closest player this season (Brian Burns with 16.5). \nPlayer2025 NFL Sack LeadersMyles Garrett23.0Brian Burns16.5Danielle Hunter15.0Aidan Hutchsinson14.5Nik Bonitto14.0\nOne critique of Garrett breaking the sack record has been that the Browns pass rusher did have the luxury of an extra game with the NFL moving to an 18-week regular season (17 games) in 2021. However, as CBS Sports Research notes, Garrett actually had fewer chances to collect sacks this season than both Strahan and Watt. In 2025, the Browns faced 562 dropbacks, which was the third-fewest in the NFL. When Strahan broke the record in 2001, his Giants faced 576 dropbacks. As for Watt, his Steelers faced 649 dropbacks in 2021 when he tied himself with Strahan. That further highlights just how impressive and dominant Garrett was this season. \nGarrett beat out a group of finalists consisting of Will Anderson Jr. (Texans), Nik Bonitto (Broncos), Aidan Hutchinson (Lions), and Micah Parsons (Packers) for the award. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Just three days ago, it didn't seem like the Los Angeles Clippers were going to do much of anything at the trade deadline. They'd won 17 of their previous 21 games, the NBA's best record during that stretch, to totally turn around their season after a 6-21 start. If they were going to make any moves, they profiled as buyers as they climbed to ninth in the West with Kawhi Leonard playing at an MVP level. \"In our situation, I don't see much movement,\" coach Tyronn Lue had recently told reporters.That quote is now hilarious. Before Thursday's deadline, the Clippers traded their second- and third-best players. The front office completely reoriented the franchise, prioritizing the future over the remainder of this season. They were the kind of moves you'd expect from the most disappointing team in the league, not the hottest one. They were also two of the best trades that any team made at the deadline.I find every part of this strange, as I liked seeing Los Angeles turn into the type of team I thought it would be coming into the season. From that vantage point, it's a bit of a bummer to watch the organization pivot away from what was working. There is no way, though, that I can argue with what the Clippers did from a team-building perspective. They didn't just turn James Harden into an All-Star-caliber guard 10 years his junior; they convinced the Cleveland Cavaliers to send them a second-round pick for their trouble. And they didn't just turn Ivica Zubac into multiple picks in a deal with the Indiana Pacers; they turned him into a pair of good firsts, one of which is particularly interesting.\n        \n            \n                James Harden's early-exit legacy is likely cemented, but that doesn't make it any less complicated\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's start with the Harden trade. Unless Garland has the most persistent case of turf toe in history, the Clippers will look brilliant for buying low on him. Just last season, Garland had the best year of his career, averaging 20.6 points on 60% true shooting as an integral part of the league's top offense. After two-plus years of Harden running the show, it will be jarring to see this team with a lead guard who is active and dangerous off the ball. \nGiven concerns about durability -- he's played in only 26 games this season and has been out since mid-January, but told reporters in LA that he's \"ready to hoop\" -- and the defensive viability of a Garland-Donovan Mitchell backcourt, it's understandable that the Cavaliers, firmly in win-now mode (and convince-Mitchell-to-sign-an-extension mode) wanted to swap him for Harden. For a Clippers team that was ancient and light on draft capital, though, this was a no-brainer. They sidestepped extension discussions with a star who turns 37 in August and replaced him with a 26-year-old who will be a core player going forward.I am curious to see if the Clippers, who rank 30th in offensive pace, speed things up with Garland. The biggest question coming out of the deadline, though, is what will happen with the protected pick they received in the Zubac deal. The particulars are fascinating. In a throwback to the 2012 trade that sent Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets to the Toronto Raptors, the Pacers agreed to send Los Angeles their pick in this year's loaded draft with double protection, so it stays in Indiana if it falls between No. 1 and No. 4 or if it's No. 10 onward.This is a hell of a risk for the Pacers. If the lottery lands them between No. 5 and No. 9, they'll have to send the draft pick that was supposed to be their reward for a \"gap year\" to Los Angeles. And if doesn't, then the outcome isn't necessarily bad for Los Angeles: It will immediately turn into to an unprotected 2031 first-round pick. (There are, obviously, a wide range of outcomes. If Indiana wins the lottery and pairs Kansas star Darryn Peterson with Tyrese Haliburton, I'd bet against them sending the Clippers an awesome pick in 2031.) At the moment, the Pacers have the NBA's third-worst record; if that holds, Los Angeles will have a 47.9% chance of getting the pick, per Tankathon.\n\n        \n            \n                Ivica Zubac trade grades: Winner of Pacers, Clippers deal will be decided on lottery night\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nZubac, 28, is an excellent player and an incredible development story. The Clippers stole him from the Los Angeles Lakers at the 2019 deadline, and since then he's improved as a rim protector, a post-up threat, a passer and a finisher. He earned a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team last year, and he'll feast as a roll man next to Halliburton next season. That said, one could make the case that the aforementioned pick alone would be worth giving him up. In addition, the Clippers got Indiana's unprotected (!) 2029 pick, plus wing Bennedict Mathurin and big man Isaiah Jackson. (They also sent wing Kobe Brown to the Pacers.)Mathurin was a popular Most Improved Player candidate coming into the season, but, in the last year of his rookie contract, he failed to convince the Pacers that they needed to keep him around. He has upped his 3-point rate, though, and is averaging 17.5 points on 58.6% true shooting, both career highs. The former No. 6 pick is still just 23 years old and a talented bucket-getter, and the Clippers will get to spend some time with him before deciding how they want to approach his restricted free agency. They did Indiana a favor by taking on Jackson's contract, which doesn't expire until 2028, but he at least gives them another big body with Zubac walking out the door.Like all trades involving picks, young players and injury concerns, there are a lot of variables here, and the protected Pacers pick is an unusually wild one. We don't need the benefit of hindsight, though, to know that, value-wise, the Clippers crushed this deadline. Until now, they were at the end of an era that began with the arrival of Leonard and Paul George in 2019, trying to make the best of the situation without sacrificing flexibility. Now they've started to build something new.\n            ",

Bowl Season executive director Nick Carparelli said last season that bowl games will always have their place, but their total number will be dictated by the number of interested participating teams.\nMore than a half-dozen programs declined bowl opportunities in December, including Notre Dame. There were even a couple games that featured five-win teams as there was a shortage of programs who met the minimum six-win eligibility requirement.\"The bowl system is a market-driven system. Through the 100 years of bowl games, no one has ever dictated how many bowl games there are,\" Carparelli told The Athletic. \"They've been strictly a function of host communities that want to host them and teams that want to participate. If at any point in time, the institutions decide as much as we love the bowl system, we may want to participate at a different level, then the bowl system will adjust accordingly.But no one's in a position to say what the number is, or to make any of those decisions. The market will dictate it.\"An increasing number of player opt-outs in non-CFP games is an obvious issue from a competitive standpoint, not to mention bowl practices getting in the way of recruiting.\nBowl games aren't often seen as the \"reward\" they once were for an admirable finish, especially with college football's all-in push toward the playoff.\n            ",

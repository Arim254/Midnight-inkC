    "body": "\n        The final two UFC title defenses of 2025 are set to go down on Saturday at UFC 323 in Las Vegas. In the main event, bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili will look to pick up his fourth win of the year when he faces former champion Petr Yan in a rematch.If Dvalishvili can defeat Yan, he would set the record for the most consecutive bantamweight title defenses at four and become the first champion to defend a title four times in a calendar year. Yan is a dangerous opponent, with sharp boxing and strong takedown defense, but sits as a +330 underdog.In the co-main event, dominant flyweight champion Alexandre Pantoja will put his belt on the line against rising 24-year-old star Joshua Van. Pantoja is making the fifth defense of the title he won in July 2023. Van is 3-0 in his breakthrough 2025.\n        \n            \n                Merab Dvalishvili, UFC's ironman, isn't human, he's a 'Machine' as he attempts to make history\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities that you can consider before hitting the sportsbooks.\nUFC 323 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookMerab Dvalishvili -425 (c) vs. Petr Yan +330, bantamweight titleAlexandre Pantoja -238 (c) vs. Joshua Van +195, flyweight titleTatsuro Taira -122 vs. Brandon Moreno +102, flyweightsPayton Talbott -278 vs. Henry Cejudo +225, bantamweightsJan Blachowicz -135 vs. Bogdan Guskov +114, light heavyweightsGrant Dawson -218 vs. Manuel Torres +180, lightweightsChris Duncan -166 vs. Terrance McKinney +140, lightweightsMaycee Barber -180 vs. Karine Silva +150, women's flyweightsFares Ziam -135 vs. Nazim Sadykhov +114, lightweightsMarvin Vettori -115 vs. Bruno Ferreira -105, middleweightsJalin Turner -298 vs. Edson Barboza +240, lightweightsIwo Baraniewski -192 vs. Ibo Aslan +160, light heavyweightsMansur Abdul-Malik -1150 vs. Antonio Trocoli +650, middleweightsMairon Santos -258 vs. Muhammad Naimov +210, featherweightsUFC 323 predictions, picksWith such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse, Shakiel Mahjouri, Michael Mormile and Brandon Wise.

That has been the reality for the bantamweight division throughout most of the last seven years as Dvalishvili has run off 14 consecutive wins. While the well-rounded Yan was compromised in their first meeting in 2023 due to an injured hand, so was Dvalishvili, who has a history of persevering through physical setbacks. The recharged Yan might have the power and takedown defense to provide resistance (and this being Dvalishvili's fourth fight of 2025 needs to be acknowledged) but until another 135-pound fighter can prove he can go 25 minutes with Dvalishvili and not be overwhelmed by the volume of strikes and endless takedown attempts in order to drain their gas tank, it's not time to pick against the champion. Brookhouse: Dvalishvili is a pain to deal with; that much is obvious. But he's also so good at what he does that there's no real way to gameplan against him. Yan stuffed a ton of Dvalishvili takedowns in their first fight, but he still got blown out on the scorecards. Where the mystery lies is in whether Dvalishvili will be compromised by a fourth camp and weight cut in this calendar year. If Dvalishvili comes in as his normal self, it seems like it's going to take a home run shot from Yan that stops Dvalishvili immediately to get the victory. How has that worked for anyone recently against the champ?\nMahjouri: Recency bias is a messy thing. Alex Pereira's revelation that he was compromised in his first fight against Magomed Ankalaev, and his subsequent return to form in the rematch, has led some to put too much stock in Petr Yan's injury claims. Yan recently claimed he fought Dvalishvili with an injured hand the first time. However, people forget that Dvalishvili also allegedly had a hand injury. The point is: fighters rarely compete at 100%. Injuries are worth factoring, but we must first and foremost observe the data. The data shows that Dvalishvili is the superior fighter. Dvalishvili overwhelmed Yan the first time, and he's only improving. A second win over Yan means that Dvalishvili will have defeated the top four bantamweight contenders in less than a year. By contrast, while Yan has certainly regained momentum on his three-fight win streak, none of the people he beat are on par with the three UFC champions -- Aljamain Sterling, Sean O'Malley, and Dvalishvili -- that he lost to. It's great to see Yan find his groove, but he's here mostly so that Dvalishvili can make history as the first champion to make four successful defenses in one year.Alexandre Pantoja vs. Joshua Van predictionsCampbell: At 24, Van represents an incredible story as he seeks to become the second-youngest champion in UFC history. But what Van doesn't yet know about facing an elite and experienced fighter such as the pound-for-pound ranked Pantoja is simply too much to overcome at such a young age. Look for Pantoja to mix the threat of the takedown with his technical striking to navigate some hairy two-way exchanges early before settling in and using Van's aggressiveness against him. A late-round submission isn't out of the question for the accomplished flyweight king as he defends his title for the fifth time. Mahjouri: Saturday's co-main event has many thrilling contrasts: experience vs. youth, grappling vs. striking, and underappreciated excellence vs. the hot new thing. Pantoja is a beast who's quietly put together a flyweight resume second only to Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. He has the most overall wins, finishes, and submissions, and the second-most title fight wins in flyweight history. The champ pairs an in-your-face brawling style with great wrestling and even better back control. His rear-naked choke is particularly deadly, and he's never been finished in 35 professional fights. If there's someone who can crack that legendary chin, especially with Pantoja at 35, it's the challenger. Van is arguably the best pure striker in the division who's roared to title contention with five wins in under 12 months. His takedown defense could use work, but he's terrific at getting to his feet quickly. This fight comes down to whose strong defensive game crumbles first: Pantoja's chin or Van's ability to get off the mat. Pantoja's pace is another important factor, considering Van has never fought for more than 15 minutes. There's a strong case to be made for either fighter, but Pantoja's pace and experience should get him a decision win or late submission.\nBrandon Moreno vs. Tatsuro Taira predictionsBrookhouse: Moreno may have had a small skid in losing split decisions to Alexandre Pantoja and Brandon Royval back-to-back, but the two wins that followed proved Moreno is still a handful for anyone in the flyweight division. Taira is a fun and exciting fighter and has the pop in his strikes, so this is not an easy fight for Moreno, but I do believe that proven high-level experience is always a factor to take into consideration. Moreno is 31, which isn't young in the lightest division, but he's not showing signs of his best days being behind him. The way Moreno can navigate tricky situations against even the best fighters in the world is a special trait. Taira might be able to explode his way to a victory, but I'm riding with the proven veteran in this one.Mahjouri: Moreno is about to make himself an undeniable contender after consecutive split decision losses to Pantoja and Brandon Royval. The former two-time flyweight champ has done this by turning away each rising young star put in front of him. Taira is another in that new wave of flyweights trying to replace the old guard. Moreno is so well-rounded, blending elusive striking with a dogged wrestling game. Taira is very offensively oriented, leaving major gaps in his striking and takedown defense. Moreno, who has never been stopped in 33 pro fights, should feast on that for 15 minutes. Who wins UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

Las Vegas will see Max Holloway defend the symbolic \"BMF\" championship against Charles Oliveira. UFC CEO Dana White announced the fight at the UFC 323 press conference on Friday.Holloway had already established a sure-fire Hall of Fame resume when he added the BMF belt to his mantle. One of the best action fighters of the era, Holloway won the featherweight championship with a TKO victory over Jose Aldo in June 2017. He made four successful defenses of the belt before dropping the title to Alexander Volkanovski.Holloway's only losses in the past decade have come against the elite of the elite, with a loss to Dustin Poirier, three losses to Volkanovski and a loss to Ilia Topuria, all in championship bouts. Holloway avenged the loss to Poirier in his most recent fight, taking a decision at UFC 318 to retain the BMF title he won with an iconic knockout of Justin Gaethje at UFC 300.Holloway is the only fighter to have successfully defended the BMF belt.EventWinnerLoserUFC 244Jorge Masvidal (vacated BMF title upon retirement)Nate DiazUFC 291Justin GaethjeDustin PoirierUFC 300Max HollowayJustin GaethjeUFC 318Max HollowayDustin PoirierOliveira is a former lightweight champion, winning the vacant title at UFC 262 after Khabib Nurmagomedov retired as champion. Oliveira successfully defended the title with a win over Poirier before missing weight for a fight with Gaethje and being stripped of the belt.\nOliveira has gone 3-3 over his six most recent fights, including losing lightweight title matches against Islam Makhachev and Topuria. Despite a recent uneven run, Oliveira is one of the most exciting fighters in the sport, having won 18 fight bonuses (including a record 14 Performance of the Night bonuses), holding the record for most finishes in UFC history (21) and most submission victories in UFC history (17).\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – No matter the nation, no matter its potential and no matter its baggage, national teams gather six months before a World Cup hoping for a favorable draw. As a selection of the USA's most prominent athletes randomly picked one country after another out of a bowl, though, it was hard not to feel like the U.S. men's national team received some version of a best-case scenario. There were no quote-unquote hard teams to face in the group stage, the natural result of earning a Pot 1 berth as a host nation. They also happened to draw teams they have very valuable – and very recent – experience facing.First came Australia, the team they beat 2-1 in October. Then came Paraguay, the team they beat 2-1 in November. At the end came a twist – a little slip of paper with four teams' names on it, the quartet set to face off in a playoff in March for one of the few remaining tickets to the World Cup. Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo make up three-fourths of that group while the fourth is Turikye, a team the USMNT played in a 2-1 loss in June.\"I think we can go into it with a good feeling,\" Christian Pulisic said hours after the draw. \"Obviously, we've played against these teams recently, which is not always the case, so we know, more or less, what they're going to look like and we know they're tough opponents as well. We're not going to take anyone lightly. They're all going to be tough games but I think it's great that we have that experience. Obviously, they played against us, too, so they're in the same boat but it's cool. It's cool that those friendlies and some of the other ones were able to prepare us for some of the teams we're actually going to play.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 World Cup draw winners and losers: USMNT's Mauricio Pochettino a clear winner; Netherlands get tough draw\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShould they face a familiar trio next summer, the group stage opponents perfectly serve as pinpoints for the team's progress in recent months as head coach Mauricio Pochettino finally morphs the team into his vision. One can almost pick out the 2-1 defeat in Connecticut against Turkiye as the exact point where things started to turn around for Pochettino's team – he had many fresh faces in the mix just before of the Concacaf Gold Cup, a month-long camp in which the head coach began to establish his principles. As games against Australia and Paraguay came along, Pochettino broke out varying versions of a back three that allowed the team to really shine and finish 2025 on a five-game unbeaten run.\n\"I think if you look at the friendly against Turkiye before Gold Cup, I think you saw a lot of fresh faces, also a lot of experience but also a lot of hunger,\" Chris Richards said. \"I think we still went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in Europe and got unlucky with two goals but definitely goals that we could avoid. I think it gave us a lot of confidence going into the Gold Cup and I think after that, playing teams like Australia, who are one of the top teams in their division, again went toe-to-toe and beat them and then Paraguay, you saw the same thing so I think it just shows that form the summer, from friendlies, that you can still improve but also with new faces being added in, with new systems, with new play styles, things like that. It shows that we are very versatile and that we're also a very tough team to play, regardless of who steps on the pitch.\"The fact that there's a lot of roster turnover and several different playing styles for Pochettino to realistically choose from makes the USMNT a tricky opponent, even for those who feel they have a sense of familiarity.\"I think it's good to have some different options, obviously depending on opponents, depending on how we want to play, who's available and I think we've done a good job of that,\" Pulisic said. \"I think we've shown we can play a few different ways so for me, I see that as a positive and makes it tougher for them. They're not going to know what to expect.\"\nThere is one difference that sticks out above the rest, though – the fact that the World Cup is a series of now-or-never opportunities that friendlies simply cannot replicate.\"I think we are going to play in different contexts, different circumstances and of course, the timeline is different,\" Pochettino said. \"We are going to arrive with the same confidence or form. That is why. The good thing that we compete[d] against Paraguay and Australia in a very good way, again, very good teams and of course, [there is] Turkiye, [could] be, but there's another three that are going to challenge Turkiye, too … but I think it's good, the reference, because we are going to feel that we can beat them but at the same time, when you beat someone or when you hurt someone, they are waiting for you. They could say, 'but now we will see.' When it's going to be serious, it's going to be the World Cup. That is why. Caution. We need to be [cautious].\"In the aim of being cautious, the USMNT will naturally begin scouting their opposition as soon as possible but the quirk of a lengthy qualification campaign means there is plenty of work for Pochettino and company to do.\n\"The problem is rather [than] to have three teams to scout, we have two plus four because we need to scout the four,\" Pochettino said. \"From here to March, we are going to amplify the numbers of teams that we need to observe because now we have, of course, Australia and Paraguay but we need to add another four teams, be prepared, all the analysts and to start to work now because we cannot wait until March and then start to work, no? We need to be ready from now.\"Pochettino was also surprisingly emotional about the fact that do-or-die moments do not exist solely for teams as a whole at World Cups, but for every individual that takes part in one.\"My dream always was to play in the World Cup, to play for my national team, Argentina, and be involved in a World Cup,\" he said. \"In some moments in my career, I was thinking it's not going to happen but [then] it happened and [at] 31 years old, I had the possibility to play at the World Cup and it disappeared so quick. I don't think that I [didn't] do everything and I didn't do enough with the possibility to do better but it's true that through my experience, because after that, I suffer a massive depression because it's like your biggest dream disappeared and then you feel that [there's] not going to be another possibility to be involved in this and that, for me, is the most powerful energy that I want to translate to the people, to the players. Please, do everything that you [can]. Be humble enough and try to build, with your teammates, a good energy, a good dynamic.\"\nCaution or not, the draw has provided the perfect foundation for the USMNT to pull off the groundbreaking performance they have always targeted next summer in the hopes of further accelerating the growth of soccer in a country that has been slow to embrace the world's most popular sport. There are officially no excuses they can pull from, especially as things trend in the right direction for them with a year-ending unbeaten streak. The onus is well and truly on the World Cup hosts to well and truly live up to the potential many had spotted in them years earlier.\"Potentially, we've played all three of these teams in the last six months but that can be a little bit of a false kind of sense of security,\" Tim Ream said. \"We need to make sure that we're preventing that kind of security and safety feeling from setting in and we have enough guys with enough experience who know how to keep pushing, keep pushing each other and keep pushing the team in the right direction knowing what we could possibly do but again, it's down to us and our work and our intensity and our focus.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Purdue and Iowa State have made it their personal mission to dominate nonconference play. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Purdue and Iowa State are a combined 99-9 against nonleague foes. That's the best two marks in the sport, and they both exited November without an L on the ledger.  That makes Saturday's tilt between No. 1 Purdue and No. 10 Iowa State a paradox unlike any other: unstoppable force meets immovable object between two undefeated teams who are built on retention.  Purdue retained its Big Three of Braden Smith, Trey Kaufman-Renn and Fletcher Loyer.  Iowa State retained its Big Three of Tamin Lipsey, Milan Momcilovic and Joshua Jefferson.  They play different ways, but Iowa State and Purdue share plenty of common ground.  \nOnly one will emerge unblemished, though.  Here is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup.     Where to watch Purdue vs. Iowa State live    Date: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Mackey Arena -- West Lafayette, Indiana \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  \tStreaming on Paramount+ Premium        Purdue vs. Iowa State: Need to know  Will Tamin Lipsey play?: That storyline is hanging over this top-10 duel. Lipsey suffered a nasty-looking leg injury late in regulation of Iowa State's victory over St. John's on Nov. 24. Less than two weeks later, Lipsey's status for Saturday's tilt is still up in the air, but he did practice on Friday, per CBS Sports' Jon Rothstein. Lipsey is one of the best point-of-attack defenders in the sport, and he had regained some of his offensive burst in the early-going. If he can suit up, we're in for a treat because Purdue's Braden Smith and Lipsey may be the best two point guards in America.  Joshua Jefferson versus Trey Kaufman-Renn is best on best: No high-major frontcourt player is averaging more assists than Joshua Jefferson (5.6 per game). He's fresh off back-to-back 10-assist showings in romps over Syracuse and Alcorn State, and Jefferson's assist rate has spiked all the way up to 28.3. Absolutely nutty stuff. How does Purdue take Jefferson away? Part of it could include making him work on the other end, defending Kaufman-Renn. The Purdue senior combines finesse with roaring power. Kaufman-Renn still has one of the best soft-touch push shots in the sport, but this year, he's become an utter madman on the glass against rival 4-men. But Jefferson isn't a slouch on the boards and craves physicality. The winner of this individual matchup could tilt the scales.   \nCorner treys incoming: Iowa State's havoc-wrecking pressure defense leads the entire country in turnover rate. They take the ball away better than anybody, but there are open corner 3-pointers to be found against the 'Clones if you can navigate the onslaught with smart big men. Kaufman-Renn is a willing playmaker and this could be a spot for \"Big Game Fletch\" to make another appearance. Fletcher Loyer is an utter deadeye this season, shooting over 49% from downtown. CJ Cox has drained 39% of his 28 3-point attempts. If Cox and Loyer are punishing this defense with corner treys, Iowa State is in hot water.    Purdue vs. Iowa State prediction, picks  \nIronically, Iowa State and Purdue were Oscar Cluff's two biggest suitors last spring in the transfer portal. Purdue won that recruiting battle, and Iowa State wisely pivoted to Virginia's Blake Buchanan, who has given the Cyclones plenty of good minutes this season. Lipsey (if he plays) versus Smith is the good stuff. Jefferson versus Kaufman-Renn is outstanding. But I wouldn't be surprised if the team who gets the best production from the 5-spot is the winner of this one. Can Buchanan stay out of foul trouble and keep Purdue off the glass? Can Cluff make wise decisions and score or distribute effectively?   In the past, Purdue has struggled with turnover-forcing defenses (Penn State comes to mind), but I think this group has more answers to the test this time around, especially since Cluff and Kaufman-Renn are sharp passers. Purdue has the bodies to throw at Jefferson, and Cox should be able to hang at the point of attack against Iowa State's guards. Milan Momcilovic has a real size advantage at the 3 for Iowa State. I wouldn't be surprised if there are some mid-post backdowns in the arsenal to hunt some of Purdue's smaller guards, but the Boilermakers' defense limits shots at the rim at a sky-high rate this season. If this turns into a jump-shooting contest, give me the home team. Iowa State is shooting a sizzling 43.3% from downtown this year (third-best in America), but I've seen way, way too many good-shooting teams walk into Mackey and miss jumpers to assume that will stick. Pick: Purdue -4.5  \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            PURDUE -4.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is finally done. After the best part of 90 minutes of preamble, musical interludes and detailed explanations of draw methodology, the great and good of U.S. sport were unleashed and delivered upon the world a set of fixtures that should be intriguing with the potential for several big matches early on in the tournament. It is worth noting from the outset that the jeopardy is not unduly high for a tournament where the group stage whittles 48 teams down to 32, but there will certainly be a few national team managers who want a word with Aaron Judge or Shaquille O'Neal after what just went down at the Kennedy Center.USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino is probably not one of those, however, and there seems to be no more obvious spot to start the quadrennial look at the winners and losers than with the nation who will play host to the bulk of this gigantic tournament:Winner: Mauricio PochettinoNow, of course, there are no easy matches in international football. I'm obliged to tell you that even though I know as well as the rest of you that the San Marino national team is a thing that exists. It's important to reaffirm that the other three teams in Group D will have made their way to the World Cup in a much more gruelling fashion than the USMNT did. Australia beat Japan and Saudi Arabia to get here. I'm not sure I'd fancy the U.S. to do that.And yet every potential group out there had its difficulties. A lot of them were more challenging than this. The U.S. had to get a European team but they didn't land the superstars of Norway, the battle-hardened vets in Croatian shirts or the probability that it'd be Italy in Inglewood. This could have been so, so much worse. \nAustralia were beaten 2-1 by a much-changed USMNT in Denver back in October. Paraguay lost by the same scoreline in Philadelphia the following month. Pochettino knows he can beat these teams and that was without the customary home nation bounce. \nThe team coming out of Path C of the European playoffs could be good. You would make Turkiye slight favorites ahead of Romania and then the winner of Slovakia vs. Kosovo. If it were to be Vincenzo Montella's men, then maybe they would also be confident of topping the group, a team that has won a knockout game at the European Championships is to be taken seriously, especially when they field talent on the level of Kenan Yildiz, Hakan Calhanoglu and Arda Guler. It is not like the U.S. are devoid of bright young things either, though, and with momentum finally swinging behind Pochettino, this is a group the hosts should be expecting to top.Now, don't get carried away. I'm delivering you this assessment from a nation who saw Algeria, Slovenia and the USA in their group in 2010 and pronounced it EASY (the y is for Yanks). If the last vestiges of England's golden generation can make fools of themselves, so can their counterparts across the pond. But the chances of a real pratfall on the biggest stage of them all have got that little bit smaller. That's the sign of a good draw.\nCall it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.Winners: The other hostsPochettino's counterparts in the other home nations should be pretty pleased too. Mexico get perhaps the most truly World Cup of World Cup groups. South Africa, South Korea, and maybe Denmark or the Republic of Ireland? That feels so 90s coded that I have to assume Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be making a cameo. It'll be tough for El Tri but there aren't any mega teams in the mix.There could well be for Canada, though. I really wouldn't take for granted that Italy will beat both Northern Ireland and either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina -- I'm convinced that the moment Spain beat the Netherlands in 2010 then the Azzurri took on through osmosis the role of European giants frittering away good but not great talent -- but they're the team you're penciling in to round out Switzerland and Qatar. The presence of the latter is probably good news for the Canadians given that eight of the 12 third-placed teams escape. Don't, however, rule out an upset for a side that has been together for a very long time with Jesse Marsch and has a few game changers. Now, if only Jonathan David could discover some form.\nLosers: ScotlandNow, of course, landing Brazil and Morocco is hardly ideal for Scotland, bringing back as it does the wrong sorts of memories of World Cups gone past. These three made up the bulk of Group A back in 1998, where the Scots' last stand on the World Cup stage ended in familiar fashion: they were credibly beaten 2-1 by reigning champions Brazil and then brushed aside in dispiriting fashion by Morocco.That could well happen again this time around. Morocco have the talent level to at least match their run at the 2022 World Cup. Brazil go into this tournament with the same expectations they have for every other one. You hire a coach like Carlo Ancelotti because you think that what's separating you from the biggest prizes is arched eyebrows and elite-level star maintenance.And yet my suspicion is that the one worry gnawing in the back of Scottish minds even amid the jubilation of being at a World Cup is in the other game. Haiti, playing at this tournament for the first time since 1974 and in pursuit of their first-ever points at the competition. Doesn't it feel a bit Costa Rica 1990 or a bit Iran in 1978? The story of Scotland at the World Cup too often is one of glorious failure against the best sides -- Archie Gemmill dancing through the Dutch defense -- but failure precisely because they made a mess of the games they might have won.\nWinners: Ticket holders Norway vs. FrancePeople going to these matches, you are in for a treat. There was a fear that expanding the tournament to 48 teams might dilute its quality and neuter its competitive stakes. The latter question remains up in the air but if there's anything at all riding on Norway's matchup with France, it'll be a cracker.On one side: Erling Haaland, Martin Odegaard and a group of young players who might be the coming forces of European football. Set against them, you would suspect, Didier Deschamps would gravitate towards a few veterans but he could still surround Kylian Mbappe with world-class talent of any age. This could well be the game of the league phase, the two best strikers in the world coming up against each other with elite supporting casts surrounding them.As for what the stakes might be, you'd assume they wouldn't be nothing. France, who will open up with a tricky clash against Senegal, will be extremely motivated to secure top spot given that it means avoiding another top-four seed until a potential semifinal with Spain. Meanwhile, Senegal's presence in the group alongside Iraq, Bolivia and Suriname shapes for a group that could go a bit six points for each of the top three, meaning wildness right through to the final minutes. And truly, isn't that what we all want?\nLosers: The NetherlandsThere's plenty of contenders for a group of death. Some will say England have been roughly done by with Croatia and Ghana. Perhaps it's the Franco-Norwegian one (but I've already used that for one of these points, so let's say no). Germany's and Brazil's look tricky too. The thing about those groups, mind, is that they mostly have pretty good top seeds. A key factor in what proves to actually be the group of death is often that it has a big team who look like they might be vulnerable.As such, it's Group F that looks quite interesting. The Dutch got hrough their group in qualifying quite easily but their player pool looks a little underwhelming when you get past the defenders. Then you look at a tricky start against Japan, whose abundance of talent perhaps hasn't yet dawned on the wider footballing public. Any team that has beaten Brazil in the last few weeks is eminently capable of a deep run. It is not quite as clear what Tunisia might do but they topped their group in qualifying without conceding a goal. The UEFA Path B winner will be one will be Ukraine, Poland, Albania or Sweden. All could beat the Dutch with the right performance. Imagine the latter of those four, spearheaded by Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak, actually clicked in the coming months.The sheer abundance of qualifying spots for third placed teams means it's hard to believe that there is a group capable of dealing a mortal blow to a big team. If there is, however, it might just be Group F. With quite a few of the wrong breaks, it could be one that has the Netherlands at the bottom of it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- When Zac Taylor was finalizing his coaching staff following the 2020 NFL season, he reached out to Ben Johnson and offered him a job, but here's the twist: Taylor wanted the offensive-minded Johnson to coach on the defensive side of the ball.That might sound a little bizarre, but there's an explanation behind it. Taylor and Johnson entered the NFL together in 2012 when both of them were hired to serve on Joe Philbin's staff with the Miami Dolphins. It was the first NFL coaching job for both guys and they ended up working together for four seasons. Although they went their separate ways following the 2015 season, they almost reunited a few years later in Cincinnati. Taylor had just finished his second season coaching the Bengals, and at the time, he was hoping to add Johnson to his staff. Johnson had just finished his second season in Detroit, but his future was up in the air, because the head coach who had hired him (Matt Patricia) had just been fired. From 2012 thru 2020, Johnson always coached on the offensive side of the ball, but the Bengals didn't have any openings on that side of the ball, so Taylor offered to bring in Johnson as a quality control coach on the defensive side of the ball. \n\"He was out [in Detroit] and we didn't have any openings on offense,\" Taylor said of Johnson. \"After the 2020 season, we hadn't yet hired [quality control] coaches on defense. We did not have an offensive opening so I just wanted to get him on the staff. So we both knew he could come in on defense and help the defense. That was the only opening we had.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 14 picks: Our experts face off on Joe Burrow vs. Josh Allen, other crucial matchups\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJohnson was an offensive quality control coach for the Lions in 2019 before being promoted to tight ends coach in 2020 with Detroit. In the NFL, asking an offensive minded coach to go to the defensive side of the ball doesn't always work out, but Taylor was confident that Johnson would have been able to easily pull it off. \"He was just really smart that way where that translates -- in a [quality control] coach sense -- to any side of the ball,\" Taylor said. \"You don't always want to have guys to do that, but Ben could have done it.\"\nIf Johnson had been hired, Taylor said that he wouldn't have been a defensive coach for very long. \"We would have eventually got him over to offense when it made sense,\" Taylor said. In the end, Johnson ended up staying in Detroit and that's because the Lions ended up hiring someone he was familiar with: Dan Campbell. Johnson coached with Cambell from 2012 thru 2015 on the same Dolphins' coaching staff that also included Taylor.\nAfter serving as the tight ends coach in 2020 under Patricia, Johnson stayed on in the same role in 2021 with Campbell. After that, he was promoted to passing game coordinator in 2022, and then he was moved up to offensive coordinator in 2023, and the rest, as they say, is history. There's a bizarro world where Johnson takes the Bengals' job and eventually gets moved over to the offensive side of the ball where he helps Taylor design plays for Joe Burrow, but that didn't happen. Instead, we're in a world that's equally bizarre where Johnson has the Bears as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC heading into Week 14. Johnson has the Bears at 9-3, which includes a 47-42 win over Taylor's Bengals in Week 9 that was one of the wildest games of the season in the NFL. Although Taylor and Johnson didn't end up coaching together, Johnson does have a Taylor on his coaching staff: Zac Taylor's brother, Press Taylor, is the passing game coordinator for the Bears. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another day, another cluster of players gathered atop the leaderboard at the 2025 Hero World Challenge. Akshay Bhatia, Hideki Matsuyama, Wyndham Clark, J.J. Spaun and Cameron Young make up the five-headed monster sitting at 10 under midway through the proceedings at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas.Bhatia bounced back from a bogey on his penultimate hole with a birdie on his last to join the four others on top. This as world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler stumbled slightly with a double bogey on No. 16 due to a wayward drive, dropping from 11 under to 9 under, where he ultimately finished.Scheffler sits in a tie for sixth place alongside Alex Noren and Sepp Straka, while Justin Rose matched an opening 68 with another on Friday to get within two of the lead heading into the weekend.\"I think you can always take good momentum from playing well,\" Scheffler said. \"I wouldn't look too far into it if I didn't have a good week this week, I wouldn't really try to carry that momentum even further. But overall, I feel like it's a good place to kind of see where my game's at and then kind of get ready for the season. It feels like a good warmup event.\"\nMaking the biggest move of the bunch was Scheffler's Ryder Cup teammate, Young, who followed up an opening 70 with a second-round 64 -- the lowest of the 20 players in Round 2. The big-hitting right-hander cruised into his day before finding another gear around the turn, playing Nos. 12-17 in 6 under. If not for a bogey on the last, Young would have fired a sub-30 score on his second nine.\"Made a couple putts late, but it is just one of those courses where, I actually said it to Kyle yesterday, I felt like we played pretty well and comfortably could have shot 4, 5, 6 under, and the scoring made 2 [under] feel kind of bad yesterday,\" Young said. \"But the reality is, day to day out here, you just can have runs of holes where it starts to feel easy, and it's not that different to yesterday. I feel like I played pretty similarly and just made a couple putts down the stretch.\"Young's co-leader, Clark, mentioned he has not putted well through two rounds, and the statistics back up his thoughts as he ranks 16th out of 20 players with the putter in hand. Coincidentally, it is another co-leader in Spaun who ranks last in the field, making the current U.S. Open champion a dangerous proposition moving forward if he figures that club out.\nFor Clark, however, his play all stems from what he does with his full swing. Noting he has started working with a swing coach for the first time in a long time, the three-time PGA Tour winner is making sure to bring only one swing thought to the golf course, leaving the rest for the driving range. And so far, it has been a thought that has worked for him.\"Right now, I just have one swing thought when I play,\" Clark said. \"Like when I'm on the range, I'm thinking of a couple things that I want to do, and then while I'm playing, I'm just thinking about the heel leading the toe coming in so I have an open face. It's just one simple thought, and that's what I'm going with.\"The Year of Young?A breakout star coming out of the Ryder Cup, Young has kept his game in good order over the last two months. The Wyndham Championship winner is among the leaders in the Bahamas, and he has a chance to follow in the footsteps of prior tournament champions, using this event as a springboard for their upcoming year.\nIn 2022, Hovland won this tournament the year before his FedEx Cup victory, while Scheffler used this week to test out a couple of tweaks in his game ahead of his all-time campaigns in 2024 and 2025. Young appears to have a similar mindset on these 72 holes and how valuable they could prove despite their laidback nature.\"It certainly can. I'm kind of not using the week as practice, but I'm using the week to try to build on some things that we've been doing and less so looking at the results just because I haven't played any competition in the last couple months,\" Young said. \"So, it's more just an opportunity to keep building on what we were doing mentally. I don't think the result is necessarily going to dictate the outcome. I think it's going to be more kind of how we go through our process and how we attack the golf course.\"Possible bookendsMatsuyama made noise in the opening week of the year with a record-setting performance at the Sentry en route to victory ... and then was not heard from since. Without a top 10 finish in his PGA Tour season after his victory at Kapalua, the man from Japan aims to bookend his 2025 in style with another win this week.\nWhat has been interesting about Matsuyama's play through 36 holes is the way in which he has gotten the job done. He tops the field in terms of driving accuracy and is inside the top five of putting -- thanks in large part to his Friday showing -- while checking in near the bottom in terms of iron play, where he typically thrives.\"I've been working on everything … we won the first in Hawaii, but didn't play well the rest of the season,\" Matsuyama said. \"So, trying to play well [the] next two days and looking forward to next season.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NBA champion Elden Campbell has died at 57 years old. The 15-year NBA veteran spent nine years with the Los Angeles Lakers, four years with the former Charlotte Hornets, as well as stops with the Detroit Pistons, the former New Orleans Hornets, Seattle SuperSonics and former New Jersey Nets.Campbell's Dec. 1 death was the result of a drowning, Broward County chief of investigative services Thomas Steinkamp said to People. The Broward County Sheriff's Office said the death was accidental.A first-round draft pick, Campbell was selected 27th overall by the Lakers in 1990. He blossomed into a 15 points per game scorer on a team with Shaquille O'Neal and a rookie Kobe Bryant during the 1996-97 season. He was an integral two-way player on those early-to-mid '90s Lakers teams, and was the second-leading scorer for the team during the 1994-95 playoffs.Though Campbell is most well known for his time with the Lakers, he won a championship with the Pistons in 2004, where he beat his former team during the NBA Finals. \nPrior to starting his NBA career, Campbell was a standout college player at Clemson, where he was a two-time All ACC player, and led the Tigers to what is still their only regular season conference title during the 1990 season. Campbell averaged 16.4 points during that season and led the ACC in blocks per game in three out of his four years. During his senior year, Campbell helped lead Clemson to a Sweet 16 finish.Campbell is still Clemson's all-time leading scorer with 1,880 career points, and is second in total blocks. Cliff Ellis, who was Campbell's coach at Clemson, expressed how important the big man was to the Tigers' success.\"I am deeply saddened to learn of Elden Campbell's passing,\"  Ellis said in a statement via the Los Angeles Times. \"Elden was a great player for four years, especially in 1989-90 when he was a major reason we won Clemson's only ACC regular season championship. ... But most of all, Elden was an outstanding, giving person. This is a sad day for the Clemson family.\"\nNBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, who played two seasons with Campbell, shared his thoughts about his former teammate's death on social media. \"I just received devastating news that my former Lakers teammate and friend Elden Campbell has passed away. He was such a gentle soul. As a basketball player, he was extremely athletic. I loved throwing lobs to Elden because he could jump out the gym and had so much talent! Cookie and I are praying for his family and Lakers Nation as they mourn during this difficult time. Rest in peace Big E!\"The Lakers also shared their condolences with a social media post.\nSeveral of Campbell's former teammates took to social media to express their sadness over the news, including Cedric Ceballos. \"This one hurt to the bone,\" Ceballos wrote on an Instagram post with a picture of Campbell. \"Grew up as kids together.\"\nCampbell was a member of the 2025 Southern California Basketball Hall of Fame, and was named to Clemson's Hall of Fame in 2000.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan appeared in court Friday to testify against NASCAR in an antitrust trial. The Basketball Hall of Famer, who co-owns the NASCAR Cup Series team 23XI Racing with driver Denny Hamlin, was called to the witness stand at a North Carolina federal courthouse and spoke out against the racing company's business model.23XI joined Front Row Motorsports to allege that NASCAR committed antitrust violations, and both teams refused to sign the company's new charter agreement which began in the 2025 season. The teams claim that NASCAR's charters are monopolistic and seek changes to the business model.\"Someone had to step forward and challenge the entity,\" Jordan said to the jury. \"I sat in those meetings with longtime owners who were brow-beaten for so many years trying to make change. I was a new person, I wasn't afraid. I felt I could challenge NASCAR as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.\"The charter system is similar to the franchise model used by other American sports leagues, and it guarantees participation in races and revenue from those races. 23XI and Front Row argue that the revenue model is not viable, though, and they claim that the terms of the charters create a monopolistic environment wherein NASCAR holds exclusivity clauses and tight control over many aspects of the series.While teams asked during negotiations for the renewable charters to become permanent, NASCAR refused. Teams were given just six hours in September 2024 to sign extensions. 23XI and Front Row were the only two to refuse.\n\"One, I didn't think it was economically viable,\" Jordan said, explaining why his team refused to sign. \"Two, it said you could not sue NASCAR. That was an antitrust violation, I felt. Three, they gave us an ultimatum I didn't think was fair to 23XI.\"Jordan and Hamlin formed 23XI in 2020 with Bubba Wallace as their first driver. They secured three full-time entries over the ensuing years, but rather than renewing for the seven-year period, they entered a legal battle with NASCAR.\"I wanted a partnership and permanent charters wasn't even a consideration,\" Jordan said. \"The pillars that the teams wanted, no one on the NASCAR side even negotiated or compromised. They were not even open-minded to welcome those conversations, so this is where we ended up.\"\nIf 23XI and Front Row win the trial, the ramifications for NASCAR could be severe. Not only would it likely owe damages, but it could be forced to significantly change its business model. If the court rules in favor of NASCAR, however, it could seek buyers for the charters that 23XI and Front Row declined to renew without making drastic changes.\n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.               What do the numbers mean?             \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                          To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                          If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                      Ready to get off on the right foot?

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.             What do the numbers mean?            \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                        To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                        If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                    Ready to get off on the right foot?

    "body": "\n        Michigan State is the latest school to receive a massive donation to its athletic department. Acrisure co-founder Greg Williams and his wife, Dawn, made a $401 million commitment with $290 million of that sum designated for MSU Athletics, the university announced Friday. It is the largest gift in school history and sets the Spartans up to be competitive in the revenue-sharing era of college sports.The donation pushes Michigan State closer to the $1 billion goal associated with its athletics fundraising campaign. In an age where athletes can earn money directly from their school, financial support is as important as ever.The cash influx also comes at a pivotal time for Michigan State, which just completed a football coaching change and seeks to reestablish itself as a Big Ten contender under Pat Fitzgerald. And while Tom Izzo said this spring that he has no plans to step away from the basketball court in the near future, the donation could help his eventual successor usher in a more modern recruiting approach.\n        \n            \n                Michigan State hires Pat Fitzgerald: Spartans act quickly for next coach after firing Jonathan Smith\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"In today's evolving college athletics landscape, this is a monumental day in the history of Michigan State Athletics,\" Michigan State athletic director J Batt said. \"Greg and Dawn's commitment will provide the resources required for new levels of competitive excellence and student-athlete opportunities. We're eternally grateful for their incredible generosity, dynamic leadership and trust.\"\nWith the increased importance of athletic investment in the revenue-sharing era has come with a wave of historically large donations at numerous prominent universities. Kansas received a $300 million gift in August to fund its football stadium project and athletic programs, and Illinois secured a $100 million donation in September. Both are believed to be among the largest gifts ever given to college athletic departments.A running start on roster construction for Pat Fitzgerald?Michigan State's football recruiting efforts took a dive during the two-year Jonathan Smith era but could rebound as a result of the coaching change and financial commitment. If the Spartans become more prominent players in the NIL and revenue-sharing world, Fitzgerald could attract more blue-chip talent to East Lansing than his predecessor, who never signed a class better than No. 42 in the 247Sports team recruiting rankings.The Spartans this year posted their fourth consecutive losing record, marking the program's worst stretch since 1979-83. The Big Ten is more competitive at the top now in the wake of conference expansion, and if Fitzgerald is to launch Michigan State into the league's most elite tier, it will take work to climb out of the hole the Spartans dug to start the decade. Investment into the program should help in that regard.\nBasketball program set for success in eventual post-Izzo eraIzzo, now 70 and in his 30th season on the job, is unabashedly committed to his principles, and while he says he is not opposed to change, his stances on the transfer portal and NIL are more conservative than some of his counterparts across college basketball. The more traditional approach works for Izzo, who won the Big Ten last year and appears this season to be poised for another run at the conference title and perhaps a Final Four.Not everyone can win the way Izzo does, though. The Spartans have taken just seven transfers since 2019 and no more than three in a single cycle. Whenever he retires -- and that day may not come for some time -- his eventual successor will likely have to adopt a more modern recruiting strategy. That requires money, and lots of it. NIL and revenue-sharing budgets this season exceeded $10 million in the most extreme cases.The Williams' donation ensures that Michigan State basketball can spend with the richest programs in the country -- if it wants to. That is a major win for Izzo's successor, and perhaps Izzo will continue to adapt to the modern landscape and put the money to good use himself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CBS will be the place to have your TV set on Saturday for college hoops. An incredible day of action kicks off at noon ET with No. 1 Purdue and No. 10 Purdue followed by another ranked-on-ranked tilt -- this one from Indiana, America -- as No. 6 Louisville faces No. 22 Indiana in Gainbridge Fieldhouse.The sixth-ranked Cardinals are coming off their first loss of the season on Wednesday on the road at Arkansas and looking to shake off the funk after getting blitzed on the boards and giving up countless second-chance opportunities. The 22nd-ranked Hoosiers, meanwhile, are out to prove they belong back among college basketball royalty after a hot start that has included wins over Marquette and Kansas State. They, too, are coming off their first loss earlier this week but will be back in familiar territory in a de facto home game that, officially, is being deemed a neutral site game. Where to watch Louisville vs. Indiana live  Date: Saturday, December 6 | Time: 2:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gainbridge Fieldhouse -- IndianapolisTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    Louisville vs. Indiana: Need to knowComing off losses: Louisville opened its season 7-0 with wins over Kentucky and Cincinnati, among others, before its 89-80 loss Wednesday at Arkansas. The Cardinals trailed the entire game. Indiana also opened its season 7-0 and also lost its first game of the season Wednesday, 73-64 at Minnesota. The Hoosiers missed six of their seven final shots from the field in the loss and were on the losing side of the rebounding battle 40-25.\nStrength vs. strength: Louisville's mighty offense vs. Indiana's mighty defense could and should be the central plotline of this game and the major battle that decides this one. Louisville is scoring 125.4 points per 100 possessions, fourth nationally, with an offense that is among the most heavy 3-point attacks in the country. Indiana's no slouch itself on offense but it is its defense, which is top-10 in effective field goal percentage defense and top-five in 2-point percentage allowed, that has been its secret weapon. IU's defense is 17th in adjusted efficiency metrics at KenPom.Depth aplenty: Louisville has four players averaging double figures on the season led by Ryan Conwell and his 19.5 PPG average -- eclipsed by an even deeper top-half rotation by Indiana that has five players averaging double figures in scoring. IU's leading scorer Tucker DeVries (yes, coach Darian DeVries' son) leads the team at 16.8 PPG. He's one of two starters averaging 40% or better on 3-pointers this season.  Louisville vs. Indiana prediction, picks\nI was fully prepared to lay the points with Louisville as a narrow road favorite but 5.5 seems like a touch too high of a number for what is effectively an Indiana home game. This won't be an easy win for Louisville if it gets it, either, because this hot IU start is not some mirage. Hoosiers are very good and Darian DeVries can coach. I'm taking Louisville to win in a close one, but as far as the spread is concerned I'd take the points on the home dog.

    "body": "\n        The wait is finally over. After a supersized 2026 FIFA World Cup draw that pushed broadcast windows to the limits, we now know the official teams and groups for next summer's tournament. The global event will be hosted in North America by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and begins on June 11. All draw predictions are now a thing of the past, and all the hypotheticals are faded into dust now that the draw is complete. The three hosts have some level of pressure on them, especially the U.S. men's national team, as the instant reaction is that they lucked into a favorable draw. What does the path look like for Mexico moving forward? Let's break down Group A:Mexico's World Cup opponents Group AMexicoSouth KoreaSouth AfricaThe winner of FIFA playoffs: Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, IrelandSo El Tri went ahead and found themselves in a puzzler of a group. Maybe they could be considered favorites in this one, but perhaps not.Mexico, having the honor of being one of the hosts, means that they were already honored with a bit of luck, being placed at the top of Group A. As a host nation, they were spared facing many of football's giants in Brazil and Argentina, or European titans in France and Spain, as a reward. However, it also means that it leaves more question marks about their form and how it could look against teams that could be considered underdogs. It's definitely not the group of death, but it's also not quite a group of life. \nEl Tri themselves in the group against South Korea, South Africa, and the eventual winner of the FIFA playoff winner D. The future winner means either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, or Ireland will join Group A for the 2026 World Cup. There are plenty of teams that will hold Mexico's hand down the tournament memory lane.The order of the draw means Mexico will host South Africa on June 11 as the first game of the 2026 World Cup. It's a throwback to the 2010 World Cup opener, where the two sides ended in a 1-1 draw, but these are different teams from back then. South Africa will arrive confident, fresh off AFCON, with an impressive goalkeeper in Ronwen Williams. It could be a bit of a trap game for Mexico as the first match of a group stage is often the most nervy and often difficult for even the group favorites (just ask Argentina). Whoever ends up winning the European playoff, this group will be difficult for El Tri. They have often struggled to get wins against European teams, despite the historic 2018 win against Germany, and they lost 4-2 to Switzerland earlier this year. \nDenmark, Ireland, and Czechia will be steadfast in their approaches as they'll be the final matchday competition, and that's where things always get spicy. Each are three programs that are no strangers to World Cups, with Denmark in more recent tournaments, while North Macedonia would be World Cup debutants, and it's always the newcomers who have the most to prove. So who could be the team to rival Mexico for a spot out of Group A?South Korea once againIf the home opener tests Mexico's tournament stomach, South Korea will be a battle of overall tactical quality. Not only did the two teams face each other to a 2-2 stalemate in September, but Mexico defeated South Korea 2-1 in the 2018 World Cup. The Taegeuk Warriors returned some of the favor in 2022 when they advanced to the knockouts from their respective group, while Mexico was eliminated in theirs. They are led by the iconic captain Son Heung-min, who now plays in the United States in MLS, and other European-based stars, including Kim Min-jae and Lee Kang-in.\nThey do not have to carry the burdens of home soil, and they might even have some home crowd favor, as Mexico is known for having a significant Korean population with several cultural hubs across Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Anything can happen, but this matchday two head-to-head could very well determine the first-place winner of the group. What's nextMexico will open the World Cup against South Africa on June 11, and five days later, face South Korea, before closing out the group stage against either Denmark, Ireland, Czechia, or North Macedonia. Ultimately, the draw was about as kind to Mexico as they could've hoped. Now they have to face the reality of their form. With six months in front of the World Cup, there is a path back toward the knockout rounds, a level they failed to reach in 2022.However, the pressures of playing at home and a nation begging for the team to rekindle belief in the squad, combined with the threat of three other ambitious opponents, mean El Tri can only go as far as they will take themselves. They now know the streets of the group stage; next will be to take the first steps of the journey. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Brendan Allen has crushed Reinier de Ridder's immediate hopes for a UFC middleweight title shot. De Ridder needed an impressive performance to justify a shot at Khamzat Chimaev. Instead, Allen, a short-notice replacement, played spoiler in Vancouver on Saturday. Allen and De Ridder were competitive foils for each other, strong grapplers with in-your-face striking. The difference was Allen's ability to do damage from superior positions. When De Ridder was on top, he'd prioritize control and submission attempts that didn't make it far. When Allen was on top, he'd bludgeon De Ridder with hard strikes. Fatigue was another significant factor. De Ridder was preparing for the endless cardio of Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez, yet slowed down much quicker than Allen, who stepped in on four weeks' notice. De Ridder fought well in Round 1, but Allen took over with progressively more dominant rounds from there. De Ridder was visibly tired after the end of Round 3 where he slowly got to his feet to return to his corner. When he did the same after Round 4, referee Jason Herzog threatened that he'd stop the fight if he didn't get to his corner. When he did, his coaches asked him if he was OK to continue and de Ridder shook his head no. The fight was officially ruled a TKO win for Allen. Post-fight, Allen called out former UFC middleweight champion Dricus Du Plessis.\nThe win over De Ridder (No. 4) could leapfrog Allen (No. 9) over Hernandez (No. 6) in the official UFC middleweight rankings, despite Hernandez beating Allen in February. At the very least, it goes a long way to improve his standing after recent losses to Hernandez and Imavov. Saturday's conclusion also clears the way for Imavov (No. 2) to challenge Chimaev after beating Caio Borralho in September. Imavov is on a five-fight winning streak and, with De Ridder no longer in the running, stands as the most qualified candidate for a middleweight title shot.\nAllen (26-7) is coming off consecutive wins over De Ridder and Marvin Vettori. De Ridder (21-3) suffers his first UFC loss after going 4-0 since signing with the promotion in November. Before joining UFC, De Ridder was a two-division ONE Championship titleholder.\n            \n    ",

Just a serious deal where we were concerned enough to take him and get him checked.\"\nWesco was serving as Clemson's primary returner because typical return specialist Antonio Williams Jr. recently returned from a hamstring injury. Prior to exiting the game, Wesco, a former top prospect out of Midlothian, Texas, returned two kicks for 43 yards and four punts for 21 yards. He did not record any stats on offense. Wesco, who has 31 catches for 537 yards and six touchdowns this year, entered the 2025 season as one of Clemson's top offensive weapons after a breakout freshman campaign. \nThe 6-foot-2 Wesco finished his first year of college football with 41 receptions for 708 yards and five touchdowns, averaging 17.3 yards per catch. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nTwo teams struggling near the bottom of the English Premier League table face off on Monday when Brentford hosts West Ham. It's been an abysmal start for West Ham, who enter Monday 19th in the Premier League standings. Brentford isn't much better, either, sitting 16th.  Kickoff from Craven Cottage in London is set for 3 p.m. ET. In the latest West Ham vs. Brentford odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, West Ham is +150 on the money line (wager $100 to win $150) while the Brentford is +185. A draw is priced at +240, and the total is 2.5 (Over -105, Under -120). Before locking in your bets for West Ham vs. Brentford, you'll want to see what expert Martin Green has to say about this match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for West Ham vs. Brentford on Monday.West Ham vs. Brentford picksBoth teams to score and Over 2.5 goals -120 (0.5 units)West Ham draw no bet -125 (0.5 units)Jarrod Bowen to score or assist +120 (0.5 units)West Ham will try to drag themselves out of the relegation zone when they face Brentford at the London Stadium on Monday.The Hammers are 19th in the Premier League table after losing five out of seven games so far this season. They fired manager Graham Potter last month, and new boss Nuno Espírito Santo is now trying to turn things around.His teams tend to be disciplined in defense and dangerous on the counterattack, so he should be able to steer them out of relegation danger. However, the Hammers desperately need a morale-boosting win, so they should be fired up for this clash with Brentford.Bowen is West Ham's main goal threatJarrod Bowen has cemented his status as West Ham's star player this season. The Hammers' captain has scored three goals in seven games, and he always looks dangerous down the right flank.Fellow forwards Niclas Füllkrug, Crysencio Summerville, and Lucas Paquetá have struggled, so Bowen has been carrying his team in the early weeks of the campaign. He has the pace, movement and finishing ability to cause problems for Brentford in this game.Füllkrug is now injured, so Callum Wilson could deputize. Wilson is an experienced forward, who scored 89 Premier League goals during previous stints at Bournemouth and Newcastle.However, Nuno left him on the bench in West Ham's last game – a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal. The West Ham manager opted to send on young striker Callum Marshall instead.Marshall had never previously made a senior appearance for West Ham, so that represented a vote of no confidence in Wilson. Nuno could entrust Marshall with leading the line against Brentford, or he may opt to deploy Paquetá or Bowen as a false nine instead.Either way, West Ham will be understrength in attack, so there will be even more responsibility on Bowen's shoulders.Nuno is also trying to toughen up West Ham's defense, but he has a lot of work to do. The Hammers have only kept one clean sheet in seven games this season, and they've conceded an average of 2.29 goals per match. That suggests they will struggle to keep Brentford at bay in this game.Brentford struggle on the roadBrentford were dealt a triple blow in the summer. Long-serving manager Thomas Frank left to join Tottenham, bringing an end to his seven-year reign.Star forward Bryan Mbeumo moved to Man Utd, and striker Yoan Wissa then forced through a transfer to Newcastle. Mbeumo and Wissa were two of the deadliest forwards in the Premier League last season, scoring a combined 39 goals.The Bees could now be dragged into a relegation battle. They're currently 16th in the table, with two wins, a draw, and four defeats from seven games. That leaves them just three points clear of West Ham, so this is a big game for both teams.Brentford have also kept just one clean sheet in seven matches so far, so this promises to be a high-scoring game. The Bees clearly miss Mbeumo and Wissa, but Brazilian striker Igor Thiago has stepped up. He's scored four goals in seven matches, and he looks capable of exploiting West Ham's defensive weaknesses.It could be a tight game, but home advantage may ultimately swing things in West Ham's favor. Brentford don't travel well: they've lost all three of their away games so far this season.West Ham have also lost all of their home matches, but this represents a golden opportunity to turn their faltering season around. Nuno has won three of his six games against Brentford as a manager, so he knows how to get the job done against the Bees, and he could steer West Ham to a much-needed victory on Monday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        For the second straight campaign, Lionel Messi is closing out the season on a high note with a hat trick as Inter Miami defeated Nashville SC 5-2 on Saturday night. Due to FC Cincinnati also winning on Decision Day, that means that the Herons can't climb above third in the Eastern Conference and will set them up for a rematch facing Nashville in a best-of-three series in the opening round.With Messi scoring a hat trick and Sam Surridge also scoring for Nashville, that could be a blockbuster of a playoff series as Miami will have the added mental boost of defeating Nashville to close out the season. Not only has Lionel Messi likely secured the Golden Boot with his 29th goal on the season (Denis Bouanga would need five to catch him for Los Angeles FC as he has 24 currently), but he has also likely secured a second consecutive league MVP award with his 19th assist alongside that (including secondary assists). It's the second-best single-season goal contribution season behind only Carlos Vela's 34 goals and 15 assists in 2019, which shows the historic nature of what we're experiencing watching the Argentine number 10.\nThe season hasn't gone according to plan for Miami as they've yet to win a knockout tournament, but winning the MLS Cup would be able to turn things into a success for Javier Mascherano and the Herons. After being knocked out in the MLS Cup playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United last season, which caused an entire overhaul of the team and the coaching staff, getting past Nashville will be critical. \nFor anything that Miami want to do, Messi will be critical to it as they'll look to send Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba into retirement on the right foot. They're quite familiar with B.J. Callaghan's Nashville side, having squared off six times since the beginning of 2024. They've played in pressure scenarios with the Herons, defeating Nashville in the 2023 Leagues Cup final to win the tournament and getting past Nashville in the knockouts of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup. Nashville will be aware of that history and looking to do the domestic double after winning the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup for the first time in their history, so the winner of this series will be a formidable opponent for whoever they face in the knockout rounds, but get the popcorn ready because this will be worth watching.\nThe first round of the MLS Cup playoffs will take place from Oct. 24 to Nov. 9, giving both teams a bit of time to rest. Miami will host the first and last matches, with the middle fixture being in Nashville, and the first team to two wins will advance to the conference semifinals.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The AFC West race heats up in Week 7 with several key battles, including a matchup between longtime bitter rivals when the Chiefs take on the Las Vegas Raiders in Kansas City. The Chiefs (3-3), who are third in the division, are just one game out of first place. The Chiefs have won the division in each of the past nine seasons. Other AFC West teams in action include the Denver Broncos (4-2), who play the New York Giants (2-4) at Denver, and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-2), who play the AFC South-leading Indianapolis Colts (5-1) in Los Angeles. The Chiefs are 11.5-point favorites over the Raiders (2-4) in the biggest of the Week 7 NFL spreads, the Broncos are 7-point favorites over the Giants and the Chargers are 1-point favorites over the Colts, who are tied for the best record against the spread (4-2) in the league this year.How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 7?

Looking further ahead, however, the Dodgers -- in keeping with so much of recent history -- may be in the mix for the most coveted free agent of the class. This time around, the New York Post reports that the Dodgers are expected to pursue outfielder Kyle Tucker, who hits the market this winter. \nThe 28-year-old Tucker is coming off a strong season for the Chicago Cubs, who acquired him via four-player trade last December. In 136 games, he put up an OPS+ of 143 with 22 home runs, 25 stolen bases, and a WAR of 4.5. Tucker might have found himself in the National League MVP discussion, but a finger injury followed by a calf strain played a role in his declining numbers later in the season. For his career, the four-time All-Star has an OPS+ of 140 across parts of eight MLB seasons, seven of which came with the Houston Astros. The Dodgers could use an upgrade at a corner outfield spot, and that's especially the case if Teoscar Hernández continues to show signs of offensive decline. This season, Dodger left fielders -- the disappointing Michael Conforto got the bulk of the playing time there -- combined to bat just .229/.317/.385, less than optimal production for such a bat-first position. Tucker would certainly provide a significant upgrade over that (he could man left or Hernández could shift from right to left), and the Dodgers, of course, have the resources and ownership commitment to secure his services – even if the bidding reaches $400 million or more.\nThat said, the competition for Tucker will likely be significant, as he's likely going to be the most hotly pursued free agent of the coming offseason. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots are in a position they haven't been in for a while -- first place in the AFC East. They look to keep that divisional lead this week when they face the Tennessee Titans, who just happen to be the former team of current Patriots current coach Mike Vrabel.But the biggest news out of Tennessee this week wasn't the Vrabel homecoming, it was the firing of head coach Brian Callahan. The Titans interim head coach is Mike McCoy, the team's senior offensive assistant. Bet Patriots vs. Titans at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:The Patriots currently sit at 4-2, coming off a win over the New Orleans Saints. The Titans are 1-5, coming off a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Patriots are undefeated on the road this season (3-0).Here's how to watch the game live, along with odds for the matchup.\nWhere to watch Titans vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Nissan Stadium -- Nashville, Tennessee TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports App Odds: Patriots -7; O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)    Titans vs. Patriots: Need to knowThe Titans coaching carousel. The Titans hired Vrabel in 2018 and not long after he won Coach of the Year in 2021, the team fired him and hired Callahan, who lasted just 23 games in Tennessee. Now, right after they fired their coach, the Titans are hosting their former coach who is in the process of turning a team around, something Tennessee fans may find difficult to watch.Drake Maye makes history. Drake Maye joined elite company last week when he joined Patrick Mahomes and Dan Marino are the only quarterbacks under 24 to record at least 200 passing yards and a passer rating of over 100 in five straight games. Maye looks like the real deal and he's only strengthening his bond with his receivers. Heading into Week 7, Maye has 1,522 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions. Cam Ward may have a challenging day. Ward joined a long list of other first overall selections who had their coach fired midseason. Ward is only a few games into his NFL career, but that doesn't mean people don't expect him to be a star already. Immediate success has become something demanded in the league, but Ward will likely need more time. The 2025 No. 1 overall pick has yet to prove whether he can be \"the guy\" for Tennessee as his stat line -- 55.5 completion percentage, 1,101 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions -- would indicate. This defense will not be an easy one for Ward to face and with Calvin Ridley's health in question, it could be a long day for the offense.\nTitans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots have the benefit of facing a team in their first week with an interim coach. While this firing should light a fire in the Titans' locker room, the Patriots have the clear upper hand. I expect Maye to continue his impressive campaign and put up solid numbers this year. Pick: Patriots -7, Over 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Thomas Frank has taken Tottenham by storm with the team in a European spot in the league while also getting the job done in Champions League play. But they've been far from pretty while doing it, relying on set pieces and the defense digging in to find success. It's a marked departure from the team under Ange Postecoglou, while a similar departure has been happening in the front office, where Daniel Levy no longer serves as chairman after stepping down last month.How to watch Tottenham vs. Aston Villa, oddsDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 9 a.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonTV: USA | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Tottenham +105; Draw +250; Aston Villa +260But while this year of change has started off well for Tottenham, it feels like everything is balanced on a razor's edge. Despite their standing in the Premier League, Tottenham's expected goal difference is -1.39, which is good for 12th in the league. While they've been putting the ball in the back of the net fine, Frank's team has overperformed on the defensive end, allowing five goals from an expected eight.Over the course of the season, things like that can catch up to a team, especially when playing multiple times per week due to Champions League commitments. Improvements in net by starting keeper Guglielmo Vicario can only go so far, but weeks like this one are what can show what Tottenham are made of. \nComing off the international break, they'll have a tough matchup hosting Aston Villa before then travelling away to face Monaco in Champions League play. Needing all three points in both matches, Frank needs to look for more avenues to pull creativity out of his squad. Mohammed Kudus and Pedro Porro are leading the way with 1.85 and 1.30 expected assists to begin the season, respectively, in all competitions, but Xavi Simons has yet to get going.With James Maddison injured, Tottenham's hopes hinge on the Dutchman bringing his form from RB Leipzig to North London, and if it doesn't happen, a long slide down the table could be coming. Goals from Mickey Van De Ven and Richarlison have been able to prop up the team so far, but it's not sustainable. If Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha can't get the ball to the attackers for consistent build-up, Frank may need to fiddle around with things. \nTottenham are riding a fine line, but they've yet to prove that things have improved from last season to a degree that will see them make the Champions League again. This team won't finish 17th in the league again, but if they want to make the top four, an evolution needs to take place in midfield over the next few weeks, or they'll come crashing back to earth.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in a long time, there has been genuine excitement around the Denver Broncos and their full capabilities. After returning to the playoffs for the first time in nearly a decade last season, the Broncos have started this campaign by putting up a 4-2 record, which has been built largely thanks to their current three-game winning streak. Under coach Sean Payton, the Broncos have built one of the NFL's fiercest and most punishing defenses, but the introduction of stability at quarterback through 2024 first round pick Bo Nix has been a key ingredient in Denver's success.In some ways, the Broncos' lead is one that the New York Giants are trying to follow. After naming 2025 first round pick Jaxson Dart their starting quarterback, the Giants have won two of their last three games and are coming off one of their biggest wins in years, having dominated their longtime tormentors in the Philadelphia Eagles thanks to the play of Dart as well as rookie running back Cam Skattebo. Despite a 2-4 record, the Giants have begun to show what they can be capable of on their best days, as the energy Dart & Skattebo have infused into the offense has complemented a ferocious Big Blue pass rush very well.Bet Giants vs. Broncos at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:With their eyes towards making potential runs into what lies beyond mid-October, the Broncos and Giants will meet this Sunday at Mile High for a Week 7 matchup pitting two of the NFL's most prominent upstarts against each other.\nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Giants liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -7; O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Broncos vs. Giants: Need to knowGreat on great. One of the keys to the dominance of Denver's defense has been the emergence of linebacker Nik Bonitto as not just one of the best young pass rushers in the NFL, but also a potential Defensive Player of the Year candidate. After earning Pro Bowl and Second-Team All-Pro honors as a rookie in 2024, Bonitto currently leads the NFL with eight sacks and has recorded sacks in four games in a row, including the Broncos' nine sack performance last week against the New York Jets. However, Bonitto hasn't reckoned with an offensive lineman quite like Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas, who has greatly elevated Big Blue's line since he returned to the lineup in Week 3 after recovering from a Lisfranc injury suffered a season ago. Thomas has returned to playing at an All-Pro level, as he has been dominant on tape and not allowed a single pressure in 86 pass-blocking snaps according to PFF. The Bonitto-Thomas matchup could go a long way towards deciding this game, and Broncos left tackle Garett Bolles also projects to have his hands full with a Giants pass rush featuring another prospective Defensive Player of the Year candidate in Brian Burns, who boasts seven sacks already this season.Giants defensive changeup. After repeated lapses early in the season by the Giants defense, defensive coordinator Shane Bowen had been the subject of great criticism for running a vanilla scheme lacking in both disguises and aggression alike. But against the Eagles, the Giants defense suddenly played a much more dynamic and aggressive game, a change which apparently occurred after its players pushed Bowen to do so. It worked wonders, as the Giants stifled a star-studded Eagles offense by stopping the run, forcing two takeaways, and holding them to just 1 of 9 on third down. Should Bowen continue to call his defense that way, the Giants' dominance could carry over into this week, as the Broncos' offense was held largely in check and limited to just 13 points and 246 total yards by the Jets just a week ago.\nBroncos vs. Giants prediction, pick\nDespite the Giants' victory over the Super Bowl champion Eagles, oddsmakers continue to lean heavily in the Broncos favor as Denver is favored by -7 in this matchup. Despite that, the spark that Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo have been for the Giants opens up a world of week-to-week possibilities for them, including this week considering how the Broncos looked far from unbeatable against the lowly Jets. For the first time in some time, it feels like anything is possible for the Giants, including this week. Pick: Giants +7; Under 40.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers can cross one item off of their checklist this Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. If they can defeat the struggling Cardinals, the Packers will get their first road victory of the season after losing in Cleveland in Week 3 and tying the Cowboys in Dallas in Week 4. After not winning either of their last two games before their Week 5 bye, the Packers got back to their winning ways last Sunday, defeating the Bengals behind a big performance by Josh Jacobs, who scored two touchdowns while tallying 150 all-purpose yards. Bet Cardinals vs. Packers at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Speaking of a win, the Cardinals haven't had one of those in quite some time. After a 2-0 start, Arizona has dropped four straight one-possession games that includes last week's four-point loss to the surging Colts, who were spearheaded by running back Jonathan Taylor's 123 yards that included the game-winning score. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Packers vs. Cardinals liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Arizona TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Packers vs. Cardinals: Need to know The Cardinals are on the mend. Injuries have been one of the biggest reasons for the Cardinals' current four-game skid. But while the Cardinals had 12 players on this week's injury report, many of those players appear to be trending up in terms of their current injury situations. Among those players is Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who missed Arizona's Week 6 loss with a foot injury, but started the week as a limited practice participant. So did Cardinals second-year receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., who exited last Sunday's loss and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. Staying on schedule. While they are roughly average in most major categories, the Cardinals have been very good on both sides of the ball on third down. Arizona's offense is sixth in the NFL on third down, while it's defense is currently ranked seventh. Green Bay has actually been even better on third down this season, as they are first on offense and sixth on defense on third down. \nThe power of Love. Packers quarterback Jordan Love appears to be primed for a big game as the Cardinals' defense is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed. Love has been extremely accurate this season; he's completed at least 72% of his throws in all but four of his five starts. Packers have a big edge. Green Bay has a sizable advantage when it comes to the running game. Jacobs is coming off his best game of the season and appears primed for his first 100-yard game of the 2025 campaign. Conversely, the Cardinals has yet to fill the void left by James Conner's season-ending injury. Murray is currently the Cardinals' leading rusher with 175 yards. Packers vs. Cardinals prediction, pick \nArizona is better than its record, but until they prove that they can close out games, it's going to be hard to pick them in any game, especially one where they are a clear underdog. The Packers should win this one while leaning on their Pro Bowl running back. Pick: Packers -6.5; Over 44.5\n            ",

This go around, it'll be the Los Angeles Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars squaring off as the action moves from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (the site of the first two London games) over to Wembley Stadium. For the Jags, playing in London is old hat, and this game will mark the 11th time they've played at Wembley Stadium in the franchise's history. In those prior instances, Jacksonville has gone 5-5 at the facility, but the team is 7-6 all time in international games. Meanwhile, the Rams are 2-2 in their four international regular-season games. Both clubs come into Week 7 with a 4-2 record and fighting for first place in their respective divisions. For the Rams, they are looking to win their second game in a row after taking down the Ravens, but will have to do so without star wideout Puka Nacua, who is sidelined due to an ankle injury. As for the Jaguars, they are looking to bounce back from an upset loss at home to the Seattle Seahawks. Before we jump further into this matchup, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this international contest.Where to watch Rams vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 9:30 a.m. ETLocation: Wembley Stadium (London)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Rams -3, O/U 44.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 7 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Click here to get started.   \nKey questions\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Who will step up in Puka Nacua's absence? Nacua suffered an ankle injury in last week's win over the Ravens and has since been ruled out for Sunday's matchup. Naturally, this is a massive blow to Los Angeles' offense as Nacua's 54 receptions led the NFL while his 616 yards receiving were the second most. Davante Adams will ascend as the No. 1 option for Matthew Stafford, and the veteran is currently averaging 15.2 yards per reception (career high) coming into Week 7. Beyond Adams, receivers Jordan Whittington and Tutu Atwell could see a bump in targets, along with running back Kyren Williams and tight end Tyler Higbee. Will Los Angeles' unusual travel plans hinder its performance? The most common practice for teams taking part in these international games has been for them to arrive earlier in the week to get acclimated to the time change. However, the Rams are taking a different approach. They are arriving in London on Saturday morning, just a day before they kick off their matchup with Jacksonville. It'll be interesting to see if jet lag becomes a factor early in this matchup for Los Angeles. Has Brian Thomas Jr. turned a corner? It was a quiet start for the Jaguars promising second-year receiver, catching just 12 passes for 164 yards through the first month. However, Thomas Jr. has started to look like his old self. In his last two games, he has either matched or exceeded that prior production, posting 12 catches for 170 yards to go along with a receiving touchdown. If this is a sign that the 2024 first-round pick is coming into form, it'll make Jacksonville's offense that much more challenging for the Rams secondary. Will the dam break on the Jacksonville offensive line? Trevor Lawrence was sacked seven times during last week's loss to the Seahawks, which was a season high. Lawrence had been sacked a total of six times combined before Week 6. If leaks are starting to drip along the Jaguars offensive line, the offense could be in for a rude awakening against the Rams front. Los Angeles boasts a pass-rushing duo of Byron Young and Jared Verse that can wreck games at a moment's notice. Young has 7.5 sacks (second-most in the NFL) on the year, while Verse has 31 pressures (third-most). X factor\nMatthew Stafford has been dialed in through the early portion of the season and enters Week 7 as the league leader in passing yards per game (280.7). In the last three games in particular, Stafford has kept the football out of harm's way with zero interceptions over that stretch, while tossing seven touchdowns to go along with a 315.0 passing yards per game average. Jacksonville is allowing 256.3 passing yards per game this season (bottom five in the NFL), so Stafford should continue to have success through the air, even without Nacua in the fold. However, where he may run into trouble is in the turnover department. The Jags lead the NFL with 14 takeaways this season, which includes 10 interceptions. So, this is a strength vs. strength matchup, and whoever wins the turnover battle will most likely win the game. Rams vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nWhile the travel quirk and the absence of Nacua scare me a bit, I still think this is a game Los Angeles should pull out. I have my questions about Lawrence, and if the offensive line is in the midst of a slump, Jared Verse and Co. could completely stifle the offense. Meanwhile, the Rams offense has enough playmakers to get by for a game without Nacua, albeit with him being arguably the best receiver in the NFL. While Nacua's absence is the most notable, don't sleep on Jacksonville being without Devin Lloyd. The linebacker leads the NFL with five takeaways this year, which slows one of the key strengths of the Jaguars defense. \nPrediction: Rams 24, Jaguars 20 | Rams -3, Under 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

But both games were one-score affairs, and Las Vegas is coming off its best defensive performance of the year. The Raiders sacked Cameron Ward six times, and two belonged to Maxx Crosby. Crosby's six career sacks of Mahomes are most of any player, and Las Vegas will need him to have another big impact in order to pull off the upset.Here's how to watch this divisional showdown, as well as odds, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium -- Kansas City, MissouriTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -11.5; O/U 45.5 (via FanDuel)Chiefs vs. Raiders: Need to knowRashee Rice returns for the Chiefs. After a six-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy stemming from a hit-and-run crash in 2024, Rice will suit up for the first time this season and also the first time since tearing his ACL. Before that injury, though, he was blossoming into a star: In three full games in 2024, he had 24 catches for 288 yards and two touchdowns. Rice provides the Kansas City offense with a YAC machine and a physical presence over the middle.Mahomes rounding into MVP form. Mahomes and the Chiefs offense got off to a slow start amid myriad issues, including a poor running game. Over the past three weeks, though, the Chiefs are third in yards per game, and Mahomes has thrown for eight touchdowns and just one interception and added two rushing touchdowns. In fact, Mahomes leads the team with 222 rushing yards this season. The offensive line has been better, the rushing game has been better, and now they're adding Rice to the mix.Can Geno Smith reign it in? Smith has the most interceptions (10) in the NFL this season. He also has the most interceptions in the last two seasons, last three seasons and last four seasons. He is an ultra-aggressive thrower, and that backfires on him a lot. Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo is known to bring blitzes at unexpected time; can Smith beat it?Chiefs vs. Raiders pick, prediction\nIt's hard for me to believe in the Raiders too much considering their only win in the last month was a grind-it-out affair over a team that fired its coach two days later. The Chiefs are at home, they're getting their best wide receiver back, and Mahomes is back to looking like his usual self. The Raiders have done a good job playing the Chiefs tight, even when significant underdogs, recently, but it won't be enough to pull off an upset.

    "body": "\n        There's no conference with smaller margins than the Big 12. Look no further than Tempe to illustrate that point.No. 7 Texas Tech looked like a true national championship contender ahead of a road showdown against Arizona State. The Red Raiders had beaten Big 12 opponents -- all with winning records -- by an average margin of 24.3 points per game. Arizona State, for its part, was coming off a 32-point road loss to Utah and had won three-point squeakers in its other two Big 12 matchups. Yet down went the Red Raiders: Arizona State 26, Texas Tech 22. The circumstances weren't ideal for Texas Tech, which played without starting quarterback Behren Morton. But the Red Raiders, thanks to the tens of millions they spent in the portal, were supposed to be able to overcome injuries thanks to the depth they created via the transfer market. They were the one Big 12 team that stood above the rest from a talent and depth perspective. But it wasn't enough to beat Arizona State, which put together a game-winning drive in the final minutes to pull the upset, largely thanks to the star duo of quarterback Sam Leavitt and wide receiver Jordyn Tyson. That pair connected four times on the final drive for 55 yards, including a 33-yard completion on fourth down to extend the game. \nThe loss doesn't knock Texas Tech out of the College Football Playoff race, nor does it eliminate its path to Arlington for the Big 12 title game. It does, however, put over half the conference in play to earn a spot in Arlington. That is not an exaggeration.BYU and Cincinnati are the only Big 12 teams without a loss, and the Cougars have one of the toughest games of the season on Saturday night against Utah. \nThere's a real chance that by Sunday morning Cincinnati, which draws Oklahoma State this week, will be alone atop the league -- just like everyone expected. Look at all the team's that will have two or fewer losses in conference play ahead of Week 9: BYU Texas Tech Cincinnati Houston Utah Arizona State Iowa State TCU Baylor Kansas State KansasThat's 11 teams! Only the SEC can claim anything close to that sort of parity. But even that league still has teams that are expected to separate. Georgia and Alabama's talent usually wins out in the end. \nBut now that Texas Tech has a loss, everyone in the Big 12 looks beatable. Cincinnati posted wins in the final minutes over Kansas and Iowa State. BYU has one-possession wins over Colorado and Arizona. The Sun Devils, as mentioned before, have a pair of one-possession wins over TCU and Baylor. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is a contender. Texas Tech's loss does, however,  put the Big 12 in danger of being a one-bid league for the playoff. Even if Texas Tech runs the table -- still very possible -- it seems likely whoever else makes it to the Big 12 championship game will have at least two losses, and a three-loss Big 12 runner-up is not getting into a 12-team bracket. But that's a concern for later if you're Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark. For now, the Big 12 is the most competitive and unpredictable autonomy league in a season nation-wide that's already been defined by parity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff rankings are guaranteed to see one of their biggest shake-ups of the season after a Week 8 that threw the entire AP Top 25 poll into a blender.Some of it was inevitable, as every AP Top 25 team was in action this weekend, and the teams that finished No. 26 (Michigan) and No. 27 (Washington) faced each other. In total, Week 8 featured five ranked-on-ranked matchups and nine total losses by ranked teams. So when the new AP Top 25 is released on Sunday, expect plenty of movement in the rankings.As for the headliners, it's hard to get past what Clark Lea has done at Vanderbilt -- and what the Commodores are set to do on Sunday -- following their win over LSU. According to our research, Vanderbilt has never been ranked higher than No. 10 in the AP Top 25 poll, and our projection is that they'll land higher than that as one of the top one-loss teams in the poll.\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Miami, Texas Tech lose grip in College Football Playoff picture, Georgia Tech flourishes\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's how we expect the new AP Top 25 to look on Sunday after Week 8: 1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): If the Buckeyes want to boast that they have the best defense in the country, there is certainly more evidence for it in Saturday's 34-0 win at Wisconsin. Ohio State is allowing 5.9 points per game this season and has yet to give up 17 in a single game, helping balance what it already a hyper-talented offense that seems to be getting more comfortable each week with Julian Sayin at quarterback. \n2. Indiana (3): We are starting to see some seriously award-winning work from Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who threw for 332 yards and four touchdowns in a 25-point win against Michigan State the week after winning on the road at Oregon. It's hard to win over first-place votes from a conference rival, but the move to No. 2 alone will make more program history as the highest-ever AP Top 25 ranking for Indiana football. 3. Texas A&M (4): Some seriously inclement weather conditions preceded a high-scoring back-and-forth at Arkansas, but the Aggies held strong with answers at every turn to improve to 7-0 on the year.  4. Alabama (6): It's just a slight bump in the rankings but it's a big hurdle to cross for an Alabama team that is clearly in the mix for title contention here in 2025. The Crimson Tide handled business against rival Tennessee and now prepares for its home stretch of the season looking to secure the College Football Playoff bid that eluded Kalen DeBoer a year ago.  \n5. Oregon (8): This is a great response from the Ducks after last week's loss to Indiana, as Oregon had to bounce back and travel across the country to New Jersey for a quick turnaround against Rutgers. The 56-10 result speaks to the focus of an Oregon team that's not going to let one loss impact the rest of the season, and it will keep them safely inside the top 10 heading into Week 9. 6. Georgia (9): The 2025 edition of Kirby Smart's Bulldogs aren't winning games the way we're accustomed to seeing from his title-contending program. Shootout victories against Ole Miss on Saturday and Tennessee earlier this season show that the Dawgs can win lots of ways and that could be a benefit to achieving their ultimate goal in the 12-team College Football Playoff era. 7. Vanderbilt (17): As we mentioned earlier, history is set to be made as Vanderbilt will almost certainly set a new school record for highest-ever AP Top 25 poll ranking. The ceiling for Vanderbilt's rise will be Alabama, the only team that it's lost to this season, but the floor is LSU's previous ranking just on the outside of the top 10.  \n8. Ole Miss (5): Losing a close back-and-forth game on the road to Georgia isn't going to come with too much punishment from the voters, but there will be a downgrade for the Rebels. 9. Georgia Tech (12): Brent Key's group is set to break into the top 10 after holding through a slow start in Durham and pulling away for an impressive win against Duke.  10. Miami (2): We are projecting that Miami hangs on inside the top 10 in part because of the head-to-head win against Notre Dame, which continues to hold value as the Fighting Irish surge continues.  \n11. Notre Dame (13): Marcus Freeman's team was ready for the elements on Saturday night and the Fighting Irish battled through the wind and rain for a hard-fought win against USC to improve to 5-2 on the year. 12. Oklahoma (14): The Sooners needed a strong bounce back after the Red River Rivalry loss to Texas and they got it with a 26-7 victory at South Carolina. It was a win that affirmed, if nothing else, that this years Oklahoma team will be led and driven by its defense as they applied relentless pressure to help keep South Carolina from ever threatening for an upset at home. 13. BYU (15): The Cougars are set to move up after a huge rivalry win against Utah. \n14. Missouri (16): The Tigers held on in double overtime and escaped with a win at Auburn to improve to 6-1 on the season.  15. Tennessee (11): The Volunteers boast another quality loss resume that voters will have to consider after a 37-20 loss at Alabama. There are no wins against teams that are close to being in the top 25 but it's also a team that only has lost against Georgia, by three, and the Tide, on the road. 16. Virginia (18): Consider this an avoided disaster for Virginia, which escaped with a 22-20 win against Washington State thanks to a game-winning safety. The Wahoos were coming out of an off week hoping to be healthier and ready for a run at the ACC Championship, but Washington State continued its recent run of putting a scare in power conference opponents and pushed UVA to the brink. As it is, Virginia improves to 6-1 overall holds on to its spot in the top 25. \n17. South Florida (19): The Bulls showed no signs of a hangover from last week's key win in Denton, throttling FAU 48-13 to improve to 6-1 overall and remain undefeated in conference play.  18. Texas Tech (7): There is obviously going to be a drop for Texas Tech following the road loss to Arizona State, but the damage could limited by the fact that it was just the first loss of the season for the Red Raiders. A head-to-head win against Utah provides some cushion in terms of where they land on the fall, as does the confidence that voters had when putting them firmly in the mix for a top-five spot one week ago. 19. Texas (21): Voters didn't get much in terms of reasons to believe in Texas as a top 25 team from their Week 8 performance, because a 13-10 overtime win at Kentucky does not line up with the quality win the Longhorns logged against Oklahoma last week. There could be some shuffling on the ballots as all positions are up for grabs, but in the consensus we're going to guess not much change in the pecking order among two-loss teams. \n20. Cincinnati (24): The Bearcats backed up their recent success with no signs of a letdown, handing Oklahoma State a 32-point defeat in Stillwater. 21. Louisville (NR): There is only one loss on Louisville's resume and it's against Virginia, so the Cards are going to break into the rankings and be set by the Wahoos status after taking down Miami on Friday night. 22. Illinois (NR): The Fighting Illini were off in Week 8 but after being No. 26 in last week's balloting should have a clear path into the top 25 as one of the top two loss teams in the country. \n23. Michigan (NR): The Wolverines bounced back from last week's loss to USC with a win against Washington, which was previously the No. 28 team in voting points in last week's ranking. 24. Arizona State (NR): On one hand, the Sun Devils are 5-2 with losses to two teams, Utah and Mississippi State, who both lost on Saturday. But on the other, this is also a group that just handed Texas Tech its first loss of the season. So while all of the head-to-head matchups don't line up exactly, there's enough quality to the profile to get Arizona State back into the top 25 after taking down the Red Raiders. 25. LSU (10): This is a complex resume for voters to parse, because while LSU has lost close games to a couple of ranked teams (Ole Miss and Vanderbilt) on the road, it also doesn't have a bevy of quality wins to justify a top 25 ranking. Ultimately our projection is that the quality losses do enough work to avoid falling all the way out of the rankings but this is a team that will be on the chopping block for many voters' ballots.  \nProjected to drop out: No. 20 USC, No. 22 Memphis, No. 23 Utah, No. 25 Nebraska \n            ",

Not only losing to Liverpool but being dominated in UCL play shows how far that Madrid have to go in order to realize their full potential. Kylian Mbappe has been scoring for fun with 19 goals in all competitions this season, but it hasn't been enough to make up for their defensive issues.How to watch Olympiacos vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 26 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium -- Piraeus, GreeceLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Olympiacos +475; Draw +400; Real Madrid -222Pick: Real Madrid 3, Olympiacos 1Since kicking off November by defeating Valencia, Real Madrid have failed to win their last three matches, scoring two goals while allowing three. With an away trip to Greece to face Olympiacos, the expectation will be for Los Blancos to win, but this won't be an easy match. Olympiacos are unbeaten in their last nine home European matches after drawing PSV 1-1 on Matchday 4. They've been a team that looks to press sides and keep up intensity which can give Real Madrid issues.With injuries in defense, Aurelien Tchouameni may be called upon at center back, which will have Olympiacos striker Ayoub El Kaabi liking his own chances of finding the back of the net. Combined with Chiquinho and Daniel Podence, the Greek side have a strong counter attack which can make the opposition pay, and Real Madrid will be hurting in net without Thibaut Courtois, who adds to their injury list. It's quite a number of players who won't be available for that one.Real Madrid injuriesName PostionInjuryAntonio RudigerCenter backHamstring injuryDani CarvajalRight back Knee injuryFranco MastantuonoRight wingPubic bone inflammationEder MilitaoCenter backMuscular injuryThibaut CourtoisGoalkeeperStomach fluDean HuijsenCenter backMuscular injuryDavid AlabaCenter backMuscular injuryDespite heavy investment in the squad during the summer, Real Madrid are out almost an entire defense for this critical match. While they should have enough to win, these are the type of matches that show what they're made of. When he was in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, Alonso proved time and time again that it didn't matter if he had his starters because any member of the squad was ready to step up and get the job done. \nThis is a quality that has yet to translate to Real Madrid in the early stages of his management. The highs have been high, and this is a club that can compete with the best sides in the world, but in building consistency, they need to win matches like this emphatically. One part of doing that has been accomplished in having Mbappe play like a proper nine, but in winning without his center backs, Alonso will be able to accomplish another critical task in controlling a match from start to finish in a hostile environment. While that's easier said than done, to win the Champions League, it's what you have to do.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- This is still not a conversation CeeDee Lamb is used to having. Through the first four years of his sensational career, the Dallas Cowboys All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb had never registered double-digit drops. But last year, with quarterback Dak Prescott knocked out of the 2024 season halfway through the year, Lamb hit a career-high 11 drops, per TruMedia. From the jump in 2025, drops have been an issue for Lamb. And through 11 games now, No. 88 is already up to eight of them -- tied for the most in the NFL. Six of those drops came in the two matchups with the Philadelphia Eagles. Lamb had four on 13 targets in Dallas' Week 1 loss in Philadelphia and two more on 11 targets in Sunday's come-from-behind win to set up a colossal Thanksgiving Day showdown vs. the Kansas City Chiefs. \nOne of Lamb's drops on Sunday came at the worst possible time. Dallas faced a third-and-goal from the one in a 21-21 game with 3:50 left on the clock, and Prescott hit a diving Lamb in the right corner of the end zone. However, the football bounced up off his forearm and then to the ground for an incompletion. Prescott threw another incompletion on the ensuing fourth-and-goal.Asked Tuesday what his conversations are like with Prescott amid his current struggles, Lamb's answer was simple.\"You just find ways to get better. You want to be solution oriented and not really much to dwell on the problem. Granted, we know the problem, I need to catch the f---ing ball,\" Lamb said. \"Other than that, man, we'll be fine. When I do catch it, be ready.\"\nMemorably, Lamb after his Week 1 struggles vs. Philadelphia had said, \"I need to catch the damn ball.\" The situation has now been escalated. Given no player has totaled more catches (404), receiving yards (5,402) or receiving touchdowns (33) from Prescott in his 10-season career than Lamb has, the Cowboys quarterback expects a \"huge game\" from his top target on Thanksgiving Thursday against the three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs (6-5). He alluded to Lamb producing 112 yards while catching 9 of his 11 passes with just one drop in Dallas' 40-37 Week 2 overtime win over the New York Giants the week after the four frustrating drops in Week 1 as a proof of concept. \"Just go back and look at the career, right,\" Prescott said. \"Any game that maybe he's not done to his standard or had a drop there or been a frustrating game, the way he's responded has been unquestionable.\" \nPrescott is not likely to directly address the drops with Lamb in the lead-up to Thursday because he feels like the two giving the storyline more oxygen could potentially do more harm than good. \"I'm not going to panic, and he shouldn't panic,\" Prescott said. \"It was one game. It was a frustrating game. But other than that, it's not like the guy can't go win a game by himself. \"I'm not going to make a bigger deal out of it. I think sometimes people do, media does, in a sense, and that creates anxiety and pressure on a guy that doesn't belong. I don't even know if that's a conversation that we're necessarily going to have. It wasn't his best game. He knows that. He's well aware of that. His standard and his expectations, there's no doubt in my mind the way that he'll respond will be great.\"\nWhile some who watched Sunday's game on TV appeared to think Lamb yelling and gesturing after his end zone drop and on the sideline felt Lamb was taking out his frustration on Prescott or his teammates, Lamb made it clear that wasn't the case. He says the issue is \"all on me.\"\"It's really just a lack of focus on my end, honestly, just thinking and doing two before one,\" Lamb said. \"There's been plenty of that going on and by that, I'm thinking about my next move before catching the ball and things of that nature. It's not really much on anybody else but myself and I've never been one to point the finger but yeah, it's all on me and I got to handle that.\" Other Cowboys fans have theorized the drops are because Lamb is struggling to cope with fellow Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens statistically outshining him thus far this season with consecutive 140-yard games in wins at the Las Vegas Raiders and against the Eagles the last two weeks. It doesn't sound like that's the case, at least when CBS Sports asked Lamb about Pickens' eruptions the last two weeks. \n\"He needs to go get another one, and I'm a fan of it, I've I've done it,\" Lamb said. \"I know he can do it again, and I know he will, and he's doing it with flying colors. Man, I'm proud of him.\" Prescott currently views one-on-one throws to both Pickens and Lamb as clear-cut matchup advantages for him dropping back to pass at the moment, Lamb's struggles be damned. \"I have so much confidence in our guys going and making the play,\" Prescott said. \"I said before, it's not even a 50-50 ball. The favor lies in our hands. I've just got to give them an opportunity and I tell them when we break the huddle, throughout this game and this process, we've just got to run. You run hard and you show and you make it obvious to me that it's one-on-one down the field, you're going to get the opportunity.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Chiefs vs. Cowboys prediction: Can Patrick Mahomes keep pace with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas head coach and play- caller Brian Schottenheimer made it clear to the world on Tuesday that his gameplan won't change because of what happened with Lamb in Week 12. No. 88 will have plenty of plays on his call sheet as Prescott's first read as always. \"He loves the bright lights,\" Schottenheimer said. \"He's an incredible football player and he's got that look in his eye that means business. It's the same look he had after the first Philadelphia game. I think I let the cat out of the bag a little, but there will be plenty of balls going to 88 on Thursday afternoon.\"    What does that look in Lamb's eye mean? He's feeling like his dog days are about to be over. \n\"It's not really anybody in my way -- I'm the only one guarding myself, I feel like,\" Lamb said. \"We are going to fix that. ... As far as Schotty calling my number, he knows I'm always out there. I'm always available for him and Dak and to build that confidence. Let's get to it.\"\n            ",

The Hurricanes and Wolverines are the only squads within that group still in contention for an auto-bid as potential conference champions, albeit slim.None of these aforementioned top-20 teams control their own destiny and need the chaos route to unfold to be in the mix. During a season of parity, however, who's to say that doesn't happen this week?Texas hosts unbeaten SEC frontrunner No. 3 Texas A&M on Friday night, while No. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 15 Michigan and No. 11 Miami vs. No. 22 Pittsburgh kick off at noon ET Saturday, giving way to No. 14 Vanderbilt vs. No. 19 Tennessee in the afternoon. By Saturday evening, we'll know how many of these bubbles have burst and where things stand in the playoff conversation.Let's get into best-case scenarios and paths for teams on the bubble to make the playoff.\n\n    \n                                        \n    MiamiUnlike at-large hopefuls Vanderbilt or Texas, the Hurricanes can still get to their conference championship game with a shot at a potential auto-bid, but they're going to need assistance this weekend.A win over Pittsburgh coupled with losses by Virginia (to Virginia Tech) and SMU (to California) clinches an appearance in the ACC title game. Then, a win in that one on Dec. 6 would push Miami to, at worst, the No. 11 seed in the final bracket.If the unlikely ACC Championship Game scenario does not come to fruition for the Hurricanes, a win over Pittsburgh coupled with three losses from the following grouping -- Oklahoma (to LSU), Notre Dame (at Stanford), Alabama (at Auburn), BYU (to UCF), Utah (at Kansas) -- would be enough to warrant an at-large berth. This is where the head-to-head win over the Fighting Irish, for the first time this season, could come into play.If Miami fails to win the ACC, the Hurricanes need to get to No. 10 in the final rankings to garner the \"last team in\" designation and there's currently three teams ahead of them for that -- realistically five if you consider the No. 11 and No. 12 seeds as placeholders for the ACC and Group of Six champions.\n    \n                                        \n    VanderbiltAs terrific as Diego Pavia and the Commodores have been this season, the road losses to Alabama and Texas will likely keep them out of the playoff unless there's chaos involving the handful of teams ahead of them on the bubble.If Vanderbilt squashes Tennessee and adds another ranked win to its season total, they would need losses from Utah, Alabama and BYU to have a legitimate shot at appearing toward the front end of the \"last team in\" conversation. Like Miami, Vanderbilt needs to get to No. 10 in the rankings to reach the bracket since the Nos. 11 and 12 are going to conference champions. It would boost Vanderbilt's chances if Miami beats Pitt and somehow reaches the ACC Championship Game and wins.We don't think it would happen, but there's a chance the committee would rank Texas higher than Vanderbilt should both win this weekend despite the Longhorns finishing 9-3 and the Commodores 10-2. That's due to Texas beating Vanderbilt earlier this month and holding a 24-point lead in the contest entering the fourth quarter.\n    \n                                        \n    TexasAnyone think Texas regrets scheduling Ohio State this season? That opening loss coupled with the road gaffe at Florida is why the Longhorns are on the outside looking in with no real path to reach the bracket. As the preseason No. 1, missing out on a 12-team playoff following consecutive semifinals appearances is a bitter pill to swallow on the Forty Acres.\nIf Texas beats Texas A&M and disrupts the SEC Championship Game picture this weekend, Steve Sarkisian will improve his record with the Longhorns to 2-5 against top-6 opponents. That'll provide the committee with another data point involving Texas -- a third ranked win -- but it's likely not enough after the 25-point loss at Georgia this month tanked the Longhorns' stock in the top 25.If Texas beats Texas A&M, Tennessee beats Vanderbilt, Auburn beats Alabama, Pitt beats Miami, Kansas beats Utah and UCF beats BYU, there's a chance to get the No. 10 seed. The rest of rivalry weekend would need to go chalk, but a Stanford win over Notre Dame would help, too. Unfortunately, there's not going to be a three-loss team in the playoff this season unless Alabama beats Auburn then loses the SEC Championship Game.\n    \n                                        \n    MichiganA win this weekend over the top-ranked and unbeaten Buckeyes would be college football's single-most impressive feat of the season and would give the committee something to chew on when stacked against other potential 10-2 finishers, namely Oklahoma, Notre Dame, Utah, Miami and others.A win over Ohio State coupled with an Oregon loss at Washington put the Wolverines in the Big Ten Championship Game and represents a bid-stealing opportunity of sorts for what we project will be a fifth SEC team. If Michigan fails to play for a Big Ten title but beats the Buckeyes, that's going to hold serious weight during the committee's final meeting. Michigan's lone losses came to ranked Oklahoma and USC on the road, but the Wolverines would need to jump more than a half-dozen spots in the at-large conversation to get into the bracket. We think they would with a win over Ohio State.Oklahoma's the only team in the at-large grouping the Wolverines could not pass with a win over Ohio State if the Sooners beat LSU this weekend by virtue of a head-to-head result from September. That leaves Notre Dame, Alabama, Utah, BYU, Ole Miss, Utah and Vanderbilt as the teams Michigan would be compared to -- and potentially leap. Losses by several of those teams this weekend would certainly help Michigan's case and make it easier on the committee.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

I ran a lot, I scored a lot of goals but above all, I've always had pretty good vision of the game and since I was a little kid.\"I don't know, watching Messi especially, he made different passes because I've seen a lot of players who are very good at passing who made long passes but Messi made passes that were almost a goal and I would learn from that. I've seen [Luka] Modric make passes with the outside of the foot. Those are things I really liked and found more interesting than dribbling because they're somewhat more clever.\"\nYamal is also renowned for his goalscoring ability, currently standing at 37 goals in 144 games for club and country in his short career. The 18-year-old said there are four goals that stick out in his mind as favorites but he singled out two, the first being his goal in Spain's 2-1 win over France in the semifinals of Euro 2024, a tournament his side went on to win.\nThe second was just this month in Barcelona's 3-3 win at Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League, a stellar strike taken with the inside of his foot.\n\"If I had to choose only one, I think in terms of importance and beauty, it'd be the goal against France at the Euros and I also really like the one against Brugge.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lamine Yamal's star power is such that the spotlight is permanently fixed on him, earning his role as the focal point of Barcelona's attack and the attention of an audience, both in a stadium and in front of a screen, when he takes to the pitch. It makes complete sense, then, that Chelsea would fixate on the 18-year-old as he arrived at Stamford Bridge for a high-stakes UEFA Champions League encounter, a win thrusting either side back into the conversation for a top-eight berth in the league phase and direct passageway to the round of 16. The Blues' focus was not misguided – the hosts successfully neutralized Yamal en route to a 3-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday, their most impressive result of their Champions League campaign.Barcelona can point to different anomalies that worsened the deficit – Jules Kounde's comical first-half own goal kicked off a bad day that only got worse with Ronald Araujo's second yellow card just before halftime. The astounding thing about Chelsea's performance, though, is that those abnormalities merely accentuated the difference between the two sides. By the time Araujo's 44th-minute red card had permanently given the Blues a personnel advantage on the field, the damage was already done.\nChelsea played a fairly even first half with Barcelona, only slightly behind them in terms of possession, touches and attempted passes. There was one key difference – the Blues' high-intensity approach was built with limiting Barcelona's high-caliber attack in mind, especially with Robert Lewandowski returning to the fold after a months-long injury spell. The visitors had just three shots by the time the halftime whistle blew, their lowest first-half shot total all season long.Unsurprisingly, limiting Yamal was instrumental in unraveling Barcelona. The 18-year-old had just 64 touches, the fewest he has had in a single match between LaLiga and the Champions League this season, completely limiting his capacity to launch Barcelona's attack. He had a below-average passing night with a 72.2% passing accuracy from 36 passes, far below his season average of 80.8%. Again, this was not merely a result of playing down to 10 in the second half – his 32 first-half touches were on par with his season average and the same goes for his 18 passes before the break. The Blues were not simply trying to push him off the ball; a handful of players took turns marking him in groups, closing off his passing lanes. His passing accuracy stood at 66.7% in the first half, though, making it one of his worst halves this season from that perspective.There was another teenager who stole the spotlight instead – Chelsea's Estevao, three months' Yamal's senior and in the midst of a breakout season. He nabbed the Blues' second in the 55th minute, dribbling past Barcelona's Alejandro Balde before making his way into the box and scoring from a tight angle, the latest in a month full of stellar finishes. The Brazil international notched his ninth goal for club and country in a month and became the second youngest player to score in each of his first three Champions League starts, behind only Kylian Mbappe.\nThe comparisons to some of the game's greats do not end there. Estevao earned the praise of Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher post-match, who whittled off names like Diego Maradona and Robert Pires in their analysis. Carragher also compared the 18-year-old to Henry in his ability to dazzle, the pair impressed by Estevao's ability to dribble past whichever player is in front of him on the wing.\n\"Even if you watch football, even great teams, they'll only have one player on the team who can really dribble,\" Carragher said on the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show. \"I think most players will get it and pass it and when you've got someone who can do it – that's why we love Maradona … Even though we've all played at the top level, we know how difficult it is to dribble through players. That's why [Henry is] revered as the greatest player to play in the Premier League, because you've scored goals and you've done things that no one else can do. People can score a great goal or could be lucky or could be quick or could defend or could play a nice pass. We can all do that. We've all done that on occasions but if you can't dribble, you can't dribble. You can't go past players and that's [why] I think it's so special so see somebody have that.\"Estevao and his teammates may have had the benefit of playing against Barcelona's perennially leaky defense but Tuesday's goal was not a one-off. He scored a very similar strike in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, shortly before the Blues' 2-1 win in Philadelphia would mark Estevao's final game for his boyhood club Palmeiras.\n\"The first quality of the kid is to dribble. Why are you going to take that away?\" Henry said. \"If I don't make you run and I pass the ball all the time, it's an easy job for you as a right back or a left back. Let him cook. Let him play. We need to enjoy these types of players or these types of games.\"\n            ",

After conceding the opening goal to the home side and a difficult first half in Norway, American international Weston McKennie put the Bianconeri ahead with their second goal following Lois Openda's equalizer.Just when the match seemed on Luciano Spalletti's side, Juventus conceded a late penalty that Sondre Fet converted for the Norwegians. But in stoppage time, Jonathan David delivered the decisive goal, finishing a rebound off an extraordinary solo run by Kenan Yıldız to secure the win. McKennie, on the other hand, finally scored his first goal of the 2025-26 season, grabbing a well-placed header in this Champions League clash.The American international took advantage of a wonderful assist made by Italian midfielder Fabio Miretti, restoring Juventus' lead on a difficult pitch as the Bianconeri faced Bodo/Glimt amid challenging weather conditions. Let's take a look at the goal scored by McKennie: \nThis is the eighth goal scored by McKennie in the Champions League, after the one scored when he was playing for Schalke 04 during the 2018-19 season, before the six scored at Juventus in four Champions League campaigns played at the Italian club. Strangely enough, it was the first goal of the season for the USMNT midfielder, who has been heavily affected by Juventus' challenging start that ultimately led to Igor Tudor's dismissal and the appointment of Spalletti as the new head coach.\nTuesday's win against Bodo/Glimt is a crucial step for the team coached by Spalletti as the Bianconeri were still looking for their first Champions League win of the season after three draws against Borussia Dortmund, Villarreal, Sporting CP and one defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid. Juventus are still in the middle of the standings, hoping to end up in the top 16 and to play the playoffs in February before the knockout stages but the victory in Norway becomes a turning point ahead of their European run. Despite the managerial change, Juventus are still struggling and only won two of the five games since Spalletti was hired. It's still early in the season, but signs of improvement are emerging for Juventus, who remain firmly in the race in both Serie A and the Champions League.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        If No. 7 Ole Miss beats Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl on Friday to finish its regular season at 11-1, the Rebels are headed to the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history as one of the selection committee's seven at-large picks.They've earned it -- even if that means taking the field for the first round without the coach who helped lead them there.Don't buy the doomsday scenarios suggesting Lane Kiffin's potential departure to LSU will keep Ole Miss out of the 12-team bracket. While that would be a new \"data point,\" according to committee chair Hunter Yurachek. An 11-win SEC team isn't getting tossed aside.It would be unfair to penalize the players after a terrific three-month stretch. The reward is a playoff appearance.\n\"We didn't have any discussion about Ole Miss and their coach,\" Yurachek said, while acknowledging it could factor into seeding if Kiffin leaves. \"That was all about Oregon and their performance against USC. Their strength of schedule continues to climb. The committee's been waiting for them to have a signature win.\"Kiffin deflecting the spotlight and boosting his players ahead of the widely projected conclusion that he's on the way out. While his offensive acumen is notable -- and he has schematically set transfer quarterback Trinidad Chambliss up for tremendous success -- he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass, made a tackle or raced to the end zone.\"They're the ones making the plays, not me,\" Kiffin said during an appearance on ESPN last week. \"All this success, all this credit and these things, it's because of the players and the assistant coaches putting it all together and making this stuff happen.\"\nThat covers every base in describing Ole Miss as one of the nation's \"best teams,\" which is the committee's mission during deliberations. However Ole Miss' seeding could be impacted by Kiffin's exit, a source close to the committee told CBS Sports last week.Among the four principles the committee uses to split otherwise comparable teams, \"other relevant factors\" can include the \"unavailability of key players and coaches that may have affected a team's performance during the season or likely will affect its postseason performance.\" That could be viewed as a negative for the Rebels.The Florida State precedent was set in 2023 when the committee excluded the unbeaten Seminoles after Jordan Travis suffered a season-ending injury.\n\"I feel they aren't nuked like FSU,\" the source said.The final voting process includes seven rounds of ballots. Members first select a pool of six teams to evaluate, then rank them in groups of four across four rounds before finishing the final three rounds in groups of three. In the second round of voting, the four teams slotted at Nos. 5-8 -- the first-round home-game seeds -- are determined. This is where a potential Kiffin departure could come into play.Ole Miss isn't jumping No. 5 Texas Tech or No. 6 Oregon if those two win out. No. 8 Oklahoma could strengthen its case to push ahead of the Rebels if it throttles a bowl-bound LSU -- a common opponent for both.The plot thickens if Ole Miss loses at Mississippi State and joins the logjam of 10-win teams in the at-large mix. Here's a look at both scenarios for the Rebels based on intel we've received and what could unfold.\nIf Ole Miss beats Mississippi StateA source close to the committee says the Rebels can punch their playoff ticket in Starkville with a win, though seeding could be affected if Kiffin leaves afterward and takes his coordinators with him. That concern becomes moot if Ole Miss announces Saturday that Kiffin has signed an extension -- first-round home game secured.If Ole Miss loses at Mississippi StateThe Rebels would finish 10-2, along with Oklahoma, Notre Dame and Alabama if those teams win as favorites entering conference championship weekend. Toss in BYU and Utah and there's two more additions to that at-large grouping with Cougars being an 11-win team.Entering rivalry week, CBS Sports projects five locks in the 12-team playoff bracket — Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M, Georgia, the Big 12 champion (Texas Tech or BYU), Oregon, the Group of Five champion (Tulane or North Texas) and either the ACC champion or a second Group of Five conference champion. That leaves four spots for others.Final projectionNo matter Kiffin's final decision, we're expecting the Rebels to find a spot in the 12-team bracket with an Egg Bowl victory. Continuing hypotheticals here, Oregon beating Washington on the road would assure the Ducks are ahead of Ole Miss in the final rankings and the Rebels could move further down the top 10 if Alabama upends Auburn and then beats Texas A&M in the SEC Championship Game. We project the final seed for a first-round home game to come down to Notre Dame (10-2) and Ole Miss (11-1).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A college football program accustomed to losing hit a new low on Tuesday.Massachusetts completed its worst season in program history with a 45-14 loss to Bowling Green to finish 0-12 on the year. The Minutemen became the 23rd FBS program since the turn of the century (excluding the shortened 2020 COVID season) to finish the year winless. Tuesday's loss sealed the sixth winless season in program history -- but the previous five featured schedules with eight games or fewer. According to CBS Sports research, UMass went 0-4 in 2020, 0-7-1 in 1927, 0-4-1 in 1896, 0-2 in 1882 and 0-1-1 in 1880. The Minutemen posted five 1-11 seasons since beginning FBS play in 2012, but had never gone 0-12 before 2025. With UMass finishing this season without a win, it marked the second consecutive year that a MAC program finished 0-12. Kent State endured the same misery just last season. Excluding 2020, the last time different teams from an FBS conference went winless in consecutive seasons happened in the late 1990s and also involved the MAC. Northern Illinois finished 0-11 in 1997, Kent State went 0-11 in 1998 and Ball State and Buffalo both went 0-11 in 1999.UMass, in its first season under coach Joe Harasymiak, began the season with a 42-10 loss to Temple before losing its next game in heartbreaking fashion. UMass led by as many as 17 points against Bryant, an FCS program, before squandering a late lead. Bryant kicked a 25-yard field goal with no time remaining to seal a shocking 27-26 comeback win.\nWinless FBS seasons since 2010YearTeamRecord2025UMass0–122024Kent State0–122019Akron0–122017UTEP0–122015UCF0–122015Kansas0–122013Miami (OH)0–122013Georgia State0–122012Southern Miss0–12That game was the closest loss UMass had all season. In total, 10 of UMass' 12 losses were by double-digits. Eight of those losses were by at least 20 points and the team's average margin of defeat was 27.2 points. UMass also had a chance to secure its first win against Buffalo. After intercepting a pass while leading 21-20 with just over a minute remaining in regulation, UMass was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, which moved the ball back to its own 10-yard line. Buffalo forced a punt and scored a go-ahead touchdown with 19 seconds remaining to seal a 28-21 win.This season was full of change for UMass. This marked the program's second stint as a member of the MAC after spending the previous nine seasons operating as an FBS independent. The Minutemen fired former coach Don Brown after he went 6-28 and replaced him with Harasymiak, who spent the previous three seasons as the defensive coordinator at Rutgers and had a 20-15 record in three seasons as the head coach at Maine from 2016-18.Heading into the offseason, UMass will have to retool its roster to avoid another disastrous season. Since leaving the MAC the first time back in 2016, the Minutemen have won at least four games only twice. The last season with four wins was in 2018, which marked the final year of Mark Whipple's tenure at the school.\nUMass has the No. 103-ranked 2026 recruiting class in the 247Sports rankings heading into the week before the calendar flips to December. The Minutemen currently have 16 commitments in that class after finishing the 2025 recruiting cycle ranked No. 118 in the team recruiting rankings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Twenty years ago, Mike Gundy took over Oklahoma State and built one of the most electric programs in the sport. For years, Gundy's teams were defined by dynamic quarterback play and high-flying receivers. During the descent that ended his career, Gundy lost his way. The greatest coach in program history was fired on Sept. 23 in the midst of an 11-game losing streak against FBS opponents. In his final two games, Oklahoma State scored 15 points. By hiring Eric Morris, the Cowboys have found the perfect successor to bring the program back. Morris, the coach at North Texas, was named the next coach at Oklahoma State on Tuesday. He will reportedly stay with the Mean Green through a potential College Football Playoff appearance after leading them to a historic 10-1 campaign. \nMorris's offensive innovation echoes the best of the Gundy era. He's won at multiple levels despite facing resource disadvantages. This year, he has the Mean Green at the top of the competitive American Conference. And based on his track record, Morris has a case as the best pound-for-pound quarterback developer in college football. Early in his career, Morris worked under fellow Texas Tech legend Kliff Kingsbury in Lubbock, including a five-year stint as Patrick Mahomes' offensive coordinator. As a coach at tiny FCS Incarnate Word, Morris led the Cardinals to a conference championship in his first year. Then, he discovered Cameron Ward -- a future No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft -- as a zero-star out of a run-based high school offense. In recent years, Morris identified John Mateer as a little-known recruit out of DFW. He helped reboot Chandler Morris's career and earn him a major offer from Virginia. Drew Mestermaker is his newest success story, and maybe his greatest. \n\n        \n            \n                Meet Drew Mestemaker: North Texas QB enjoying breakout after never starting varsity game in high school\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe redshirt freshman had never been a full-time starter since freshman year of high school, but Morris brought him in as a preferred walk-on. Now, he leads the nation in passing with 3,469 yards, 26 touchdowns and four interceptions on 9.7 yards per attempt. Mestermaker was already poised to become one of the hottest names in the transfer portal. Now, after his massive breakout season, Oklahoma State will get the first crack. And by the way, Mestermaker isn't the only player with Power Four upside that Morris can bring with him to Stillwater. True freshman running back Caleb Hawkins has already rushed for 1,030 yards and 19 touchdowns; he's from Shawnee, Oklahoma. Receivers Wyatt Young and Miles Coleman have multiple years of eligibility remaining. On an Oklahoma State roster with plenty of holes, having an offense to import brings plenty of excitement. \nOklahoma State has not produced an NFL draft pick at receiver since Tylan Wallace in 2021. They haven't produced a drafted quarterback since Mason Rudolph in 2018. The Cowboys are dead last in the Big 12 in offense, and haven't even been top half in the league since 2020. Against FBS opponents in 2025, North Texas leads the nation in points per drive (3.88) and yards per play (7.4). They're top-five in success rate (55.1%), yards per pass (9.6) and explosive play rate (16.6%). Fireworks are coming back to Boone Pickens Stadium. However, there's one thing that really sets Morris apart -- his ability to do more with less. Across his coaching career, Morris has never spent time at an advantaged program. North Texas ranks among the lowest in the American in revenue sharing, and UIW is one of the lowest-funded programs in the FCS. Yet, he still won. \nAt Oklahoma State, he will feel something brand new: an advantage. The Cowboys are fully funding revenue sharing and will enter the market as buyers. The facilities and stadium are strong. Pairing those resources with his Texas ties should immediately overhaul recruiting. North Texas general manager Raj Murti has already emerged as a star for building a championship-level roster on a shoestring budget.There are still complications. The Big 12 is littered with offensive-minded coaches who never figured out the defensive side. First-year defensive coordinator Skyler Casity has stabilized the unit at UNT, but Morris faces difficult decisions there. Additionally, the Big 12 is uniquely equipped to defend the Air Raid after decades of exposure dating back to Mike Leach. Morris will have to find the next wrinkle. But across stops, he has always found a way.Eighteen years ago, Gundy became a national star when he beat his chest and delivered the famous line: \"I'm a man, I'm 40.\" Now, at the same age, Morris arrives in Stillwater with a strong résumé and a clear-eyed view of the modern sport.\nNo one will ever replace Gundy, but Morris brings many of his greatest qualities, with a contemporary understanding of college football that can push Oklahoma State into the future.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The lights are out, and the confetti has been swept away from the 2025 NWSL Championship podium in San Jose. The 2025 NWSL season is officially over and in the history books, with the league's signature parity on full display, and now comes the offseason. It's the time of year when fans hang onto any exciting rumor about their club and hope against all hope that there will be compelling headlines. It's also the time when we constantly look too far ahead and teams bookmark and screenshot plenty of regular analysis in preparation to utilize it as preseason fodder and reframe it as top-tier \"haterade.\" So, let's give everyone what they want and put together a way-too-early NWSL Rower Rankings for the offseason.The 2025 NWSL season concluded with three different title-winning teams: the Washington Spirit (2025 Challenge Cup), the Kansas City Current (2025 NWSL Shield), and Gotham FC (2025 NWSL Championship). Placing those teams in early rankings might be the only easy part; the real challenge will be with every other club, especially with new two new expansion teams entering the league with Denver Summit and Boston Legacy.As front offices shift their focus towards building for the 2026 season, let's get to ranking:\n1. Kansas City CurrentAny team that had the season they did and still has the back-to-back Golden Boot winner and MVP in Temwa Chawinga is going to have a pretty big jump on the rest of the league. Yes, they got bounced early in the playoffs, but that's just good ol' fashioned NWSL chaos. What they accomplished during the regular season to win the league (clinching the NWSL Shield and playoff birth in record time) could very well be something we never see again.2. Gotham FCNothing like setting yourself up for success in the big moments because Gotham is built for high stakes. Gotham's incredible postseason journey saw them knock off the NWSL Shield-winning Kansas City, then defeat the defending 2024 champion Orlando Pride. They did all that on the road before finally besting the Washington Spirit squad in the final and will have plenty of pieces to run it back in 2026.3. Washington SpiritThe club had an impressive season despite coming up short again in the NWSL Championship, but the Spirit's season was all about the climb back. They quickly got some revenge in the 2025 Challenge Cup when they won against Orlando Pride, and they showed off how deep of a roster they have as Trinity Rodman and Croix Bethune worked their way back into form. Now the Spirit are on the clock when it comes to the Rodman free agency sweepstakes. \n4. Orlando PrideThe group's regular season took a hit after losing Barbra Banda midseason, but it came back to life a bit with a new record signing in Jacqueline Ovalle. Brazilian international Marta gave us another season to believe in, and though they came up short in the playoffs, they're still a top club to go up against.5. Portland ThornsPlenty counted out the Portland Thorns, but they showcased team resilience with midfielder Sam Coffey setting the tone. Their third-place finish showed that no matter the changes, the franchise find a way to stay a contender. A brand new contract for midfielder Olivia Moultrie is already a great sign for next year.6. San Diego Wave FCThe Wave brought in a new head coach with Jonas Eidevall and added some exciting internationals in Kenza Dali, Gia Corely, and Perle Morroni, and the moves paid off with another playoff berth. They hit a bit of a scoreless skid later in the season, and it bit them in the end, but the squad has more to build upon for next year now.\n7.  Seattle Reign FCThe Reign frustrated the league with their fluctuating five-back system and rode the storm toward a fifth-place finish and another playoff spot. Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey showed she's here to stay in the keeper of the year conversation, and if a comeback season is on the horizon for Mia Fishel, watch out for the Reign.8. Racing Louisville FCThe Kentucky side finally got to check off a big box as a franchise, making the playoffs. After joining the league in 2021, they were the only team post-expansion era (2015) that had yet to reach the NWSL postseason. Head coach Bev Yanez and her scrappy roster did the thing; now it's on the franchise to make sure they're still pouring in the resources to stay competitive.9. Utah Royals FCThe Royals have been a second-half team for their first two seasons of existence, and it hasn't worked out. Once again, they made things interesting down the stretch of the 2025 season, but they just haven't figured out how to chip away at the long year in NWSL. They focused on rebuilding under coach Jimmy Coenraets, and they made a lot of money ($600,00) during the Ally Sentnor trade, so plenty of eyes will be on what's next.\n10. Houston DashThis is another team that just dug a hole too deep for themselves, so their fun second-half season streak didn't lead to the postseason. It was a challenging year for the Houston Dash, who seemed to struggle to find a consistent rhythm all year. I don't think they really need to retool, but they could use another piece in the mix.11. North Carolina CourageIt's incredible to see what the squad was able to manage despite such a high and low type of season. A big trade for Jaedyn Shaw that didn't work out, a midseason culture change, and an injury to Ashley Sanchez. The bright spot was Japanese international Manaka Matsukubo, who won NWSL Midfielder of the Year and Best XI honors. Will she stay in North Carolina with a year on her contract?12. Angel City FCThe club struggled with coaching and roster changes throughout the season. The franchise said farewell to its best player in Alyssa Thompson via transfer to Chelsea FC, and later celebrated the retirements of Christen Press and Ali Riley. Rookie Riley Tiernan was an exciting goalscoring surprise, but her production faded down the stretch, and the club with big valuations will need a new big signing this offseason.\n13. Bay FCThe Northern California side just never looked like a group that was going to compete for a title, let alone a playoff spot. Former head coach Albertin Montoya just never figured out how to make large transfer fee forwards work. Despite being second in the league in shots (76), Racheal Kundananji only scored four goals this season, and the club eventually parted ways with Asisat Oshoala on a transfer after zero goals in 12 games.14. Chicago Stars FCOne head coaching dismissal, three interim coaches, and a partridge in a pear tree. Interim Ella Massar was the most effective of the three, getting the group on a long unbeaten run with exciting come-back equalizers. They missed Mallory Swanson a ton, and they'll need to figure out how to keep Sentnor or show they're not allergic to making a meaningful offseason signing.15. Denver Summit FCThere's not a ton to consider on the pitch for the Denver Summit, as they haven't played a game yet. They're going to be led by Nick Cushing, who once led Manchester City women and NYCFC. They've already signed some familiar NWSL names in Ally Watt, Megan Reid, and Kaliegh Kurtz. Oh, there's also a rumor that they may be interested in Colorado native and U.S. women's national team forward Sophia Wilson.\n16. Boston LegacyUnfortunately, Boston are the same expansion boat. For now, they're the only team at the moment to break the trend of hiring European men into head coaching roles, and they managed to hire a European woman to lead the club in its inaugural season. A former player, Portugal's Filipa Patão, will lead the group in 2026, and NWSL fans will be familiar with at least one of their signings in Bárbara Olivieri.\n            ",

Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of Six) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span. That number will skyrocket this fall and winter.  \nCBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.

    "description": "\nThe 2025 NFL season moves to Week 13, which brings about three Thanksgiving games, a Black Friday contest, 11 Sunday affairs, a Monday night showdown",
    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL season moves to Week 13, which brings about three Thanksgiving games, a Black Friday contest, 11 Sunday affairs, a Monday night showdown featuring two teams who have met in the Super Bowl twice and, surprisingly, no teams on a bye. While division matchups like the Detroit Lions taking on the Green Bay Packers and the Cincinnati Bengals battling the Baltimore Ravens will get the most attention, bettors might want to look elsewhere when building their best NFL money line parlays.If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 13, you need to see what SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has to say. He's put together two money line parlays for Week 13, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 13 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 12, NFL betting chalk had another solid performance going 10-4. NFL betting favorites have won 124 out of 177 games in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 season, achieving an overall success rate of 70.0%. This figure continues to creep up to last year's mark of 71.8%. What does this mean for Week 13? Will the dogs bark as they usually do in Week 13. Take a look at Jeff's top money line parlays featuring favorites and underdogs.Buffalo Bills over Pittsburgh Steelers\nAaron Rodgers is expected to play after missing last week with a fractured left wrist, though he practiced in a limited capacity. While Mike Tomlin stated they have \"great optimism\" regarding his availability, a broken left wrist to Rodgers' throwing hand introduces a tangible accuracy risk, particularly on throws requiring full wrist extension (vertical throws, sideline throws). I want to fade the aging Rodgers as the season progresses.Buffalo is ranked first in pass defense in the NFL, allowing just 168.2 yards per game, a statistical outlier that reflects both tactical design and personnel, and sixth in opponent passer rating (84.2). The Bills have allowed only 12 passing touchdowns through 11 games, ranking among the league's most efficient coverage units. I don't see any wide receivers on the Steelers' roster that intimidate me. On the flip side, Pittsburgh is ranked 31st, allowing 258.7 receiving yards per game. The Bills should have a lot of success through the air, which will open up their run game even more with James Cook (1,084 yards and seven rushing TDs) leading the charge.Josh Allen is 4-1 straight-up against the Pittsburgh Steelers in his career, including 31-17 as 10-point home chalk in last year's playoffs. He's been \"money\" after a loss, going 80-35. You know what to do.Seattle Seahawks over Minnesota Vikings\nI will keep this brief: The Seahawks rank first overall in DVOA (Defense-Adjusted Value Over Average), placing them among the most efficient NFL teams in the past 50 years. According to DVOA research, only three teams since 1978 have performed better through eight games than Seattle's current pace -- the 2007 Patriots, 1991 Redskins, and 1985 Bears -- all of which reached the Super Bowl. Seattle's offensive DVOA ranks fourth and defensive DVOA also ranks fourth. The combination is elite.In contrast, the Vikings' offense has been inconsistent and their defense has deteriorated significantly. The Vikings are 4-6 and have lost five of their last six games, with their offense failing to score 20 points in four of those six losses. The Vikings' trajectory in this matchup is decidedly downward. It's so bad in Minnesota right now the Vikings have seen enough of J.J. McCarthy (concussion?) and could turn to Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie, for his first NFL start. Mike Macdonald scheming against a rookie QB making his first career start on the road will not end well for the Vikings.Los Angeles Chargers over Las Vegas Raiders\nFresh off a bye, the Chargers should be refueled and revitalized for the stretch run. Yes, they have suffered numerous injuries on their offensive line but I'm trusting head coach John Harbaugh to have a solid game plan with two weeks to prepare. I also love their defense against a struggling Raiders offense that averages just 4.6 yards per play (30th).The Chargers' defense ranks fifth overall in total yards allowed (286.1 per game) and fourth in passing yards allowed (172.3 per game). They rank fifth in third-down defense (35.4%) and sixth in red zone defense (52.8% TD rate), indicating elite efficiency across situational football. This is a top-10 defense operating at high efficiency, and the Chargers' coaching staff is smart enough to know to double-team Brock Bowers.The Raiders organization is in complete disarray entering this game, having fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly on Nov. 23. This decision followed a disappointing 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns, which dropped Vegas' record to 2-9. Head coach Pete Carroll could be let go at the end of the season. I will be shocked if the Chargers don't win this game by at least a touchdown.Week 13 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Cleveland Browns over San Francisco 49ers\nI don't think the 49ers have the better QB right now. Brock Purdy still looks rusty (three interceptions on MNF) and will play his first cold-weather game in possibly wet conditions. Shedeur Sanders' historic first start -- becoming the first Browns QB since 1999 to win his inaugural game -- creates psychological momentum favoring another start. Sanders completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. More importantly, he demonstrated elite efficiency on explosive plays, with a 19% explosive pass rate, second only to Dillon Gabriel's Week 7 performance this season. Against a 49ers defense susceptible on third downs, Sanders' ability to extend plays through scrambling and find big plays becomes increasingly valuable. Cleveland's offense looked more energized than at any point this season.The 49ers will be playing at 10 a.m. (body clock) on a short week. The weather forecast looks wet and cold, which the home team is more accustomed to playing in. Cleveland's defense ranks among the league's most fearsome pass-rushing units. Myles Garrett leads the NFL in quarterback pressures, and the Browns' secondary features elite cornerbacks Denzel Ward and Martin Emerson Jr. The Browns rank third in sack percentage (10.31%) and third overall in defensive pressure, creating problems for any quarterback. The 49ers have not had their bye week yet, which means they will play 13 consecutive weeks. I really like the Browns on the money line in this spot.Tennessee Titans over Jacksonville Jaguars\nTennessee has covered the spread in three consecutive games despite losing all three contests. This trend of covering reveals a Titans team that has become competitive in close-game situations. Home environments historically amplify this tendency. When you see a team covering spreads in three consecutive games, it's a sign victory is on the horizon. The Titans have a good chance to win outright against a Jacksonville team that owns a +1.5 point differential along with a -0.2 net yards per play. The Titans look much more competent since Brian Callahan's termination, which has coincided with Cam Ward's improvement with each game.Trevor Lawrence has proven to be an inconsistent quarterback who struggles with ball security. In his most recent outing against Arizona, he threw for 256 yards with three touchdowns but also had three interceptions -- a dangerous ratio for an offense expected to dominate a bottom-tier defense. His season-long EPA per play of -0.04 ranks him among the least efficient qualified passers in the league. More concerning for Jags fans, Lawrence has exhibited turnover-prone tendencies throughout the season, creating opportunities for defensive exploitation that Tennessee can capitalize on.The Titans lost both games against Jacksonville in 2024 by deficits of four and seven points, despite having a significantly weaker QB room. I will gladly back the home divisional dog at +250 on the money line in this spot.New York Giants over New England Patriots\nThe stage is set for one of the biggest upsets in MNF history. While the Patriots enter Week 13 with an NFL-best 10-2 record and riding a nine-game winning streak, the 2-10 Giants possess a perfect storm of advantages that could shock the football world at Gillette Stadium.The most intriguing factor favoring a Giants upset is the catastrophic injury situation facing New England's offensive line. The Patriots lost both starting left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson in their Week 12 victory over Cincinnati, leaving the entire left side of their protection scheme in shambles. This marks the most significant disruption to New England's offensive line all season, as their starting five had played together in 11 of 12 games. Most NFL games are won in the trenches, and the Giants have a slight edge now. Jaxson Dart is expected to return and his mobility can exploit this Patriots' defense.New England's nine-game winning streak looks impressive at first glance, but there's more to the story than meets the eye. Digging a little deeper, you'll find some cracks in the armor. Of the 10 wins, six have been by just a single possession. Three of those have come in the last four games. The Patriots recently eked out a 26-20 win against Cincinnati, where they found themselves down 10-0 early on and only pulled through thanks to a defensive touchdown. We know the Giants have a long history of upsetting the Patriots. I expect this money line to drop as the week progresses, so bet it ASAP.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Thanksgiving week in MLB rumors isn't usually a big one, but moves can happen. In fact, the Red Sox acquired Sonny Gray from the Cardinals in a trade this morning. Maybe we'll see another big move or two. You never know. In the meantime, let's round up all the rumors for the day right here. Imai prefers to 'take down' DodgersDon't expect incoming Japanese right-hander Tatsuya Imai to join the Los Angeles Dodgers now that he's been posted by his NPB team, the Saitama Seibu Lions, for MLB consideration. Rather, Imai said during an interview with former MLB/NPB pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka that he cherishes the idea of beating the Dodgers and their collection of Japanese stars -- Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Roki Sasaki.\"Of course, I'd enjoy playing alongside Ohtani, Yamamoto, and Sasaki,\" Imai said, according to MLB.com, \"but winning against a team like that and becoming a world champion would be the most valuable thing in my life. If anything, I'd rather take them down.\"\nImai, 27, would probably find it in his heart to change priorities if the Dodgers made the best offer. Still, it's a fun wrinkle in his free agency. Imai is considered one of the better starting pitchers on the market after a NPB send-off season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 24 outings. CBS Sports ranked him as the 12th-best player on the market.D-backs 'actively listening' on All-StarThe Diamondbacks have had issues with second baseman Ketel Marte, notably late last season when some teammates were reportedly frustrated with him for he took some time off after his home was burglarized. Around the same time, Marte's name started to pop up in trade rumors. That's still apparently the case, as the \"Diamondbacks are actively listening,\" according to MLB Network. \nMarte, 32, made the All-Star team for the third time this past season and won his second Silver Slugger. In 126 games, he hit .283/.376/.517 (145 OPS+) with 28 doubles, 28 homers, 72 RBI, 87 runs and 4.4 WAR. He'd fit nicely on just about any team, as long as they could make room at second base. He's locked up through 2030 on a relatively club-friendly deal that'll pay him $15 million next season.Red Sox, Realmuto connectionThough a new catcher hasn't been said to be high on the Red Sox's list of priorities this offseason, they've shown interest in free-agent catcher J.T. Realmuto, per The Athletic, which added:\nThe usual caveats apply. It is early in free agency. Teams are touching base with a large number of players. The best guess with Realmuto is that he will still re-sign with the Philadelphia Phillies, his team since 2019.In 134 games last season, Realmuto hit .257/.315/.384 (91 OPS+) with 12 homers, 52 RBI, 57 runs and 2.5 WAR. We won't likely see him come close to returning to the 6.5-WAR season he posted in 2022, but he's still a quality backstop, even headed into his age-35 season. As things stand, the Red Sox catchers are Carlos Narváez and Connor Wong.Marlins, Stowers far apart on extension talksThe Marlins and All-Star outfielder Kyle Stowers talked extension earlier this offseason, but there was no traction due to the two sides being very far apart, according to The Athletic. In fact, it sounds like the Marlins were offering about half of what Stowers' agents were asking. Stowers' side was reportedly looking at Bryan Reynolds' extension (eight years and $106.5 million) as a guide in asking for around $100 million. The Marlins were instead looking at the Cedanne Rafaela deal of eight years and $50 million. By my count, that's a $50 million differenceStowers, 27, had a breakout season in 2025. He hit .288/.368/.544 (149 OPS+) with 25 home runs, 73 RBI and 3.6 WAR in 117 games.\n15 teams on Helsley, who could convert to SPFormer Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, who disappointed for the Mets after being traded there last season, has upwards of 15 teams with interest in him as he weighs trying to convert to a starting pitcher, reports The Athletic. Mike Axisa of CBS Sports examined Helsley along with two other possible reliever conversions this morning.Helsley, 31, was one of the best closers in baseball in 2024. He was good with the Cardinals before the trade last season. With the Mets, he posted a 7.20 ERA and 1.80 WHIP in 22 appearances. He's never started an MLB game and has appeared 297 times in relief, pitching to a career 2.96 ERA with 377 strikeouts in 319 ⅔ innings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alex Rodriguez is on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot again this year. It's his fifth time on the ballot, and he has yet to get to 40% of the vote in his previous four tries. The threshold for induction is 75%, so it doesn't look like he'll make it. Like Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds before him, A-Rod is statistically one of the greatest players in MLB history. But his ties to PEDs are keeping him out of Cooperstown. This week, A-Rod joined Stephen A. Smith's radio show and pointed out some hypocrisy that he sees on display with the Baseball Hall of Fame. Coming on the heels of a comment about Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, A-Rod replied with the following (via Awful Announcing): \"All of this stuff you're talking about was under Bud Selig's watch,\" Rodriguez said. \"And the fact that those two guys are not in, but somehow, Bud Selig is in the Hall of Fame, that to me feels like there's a little bit, some hypocrisy around that.\"Unfortunately, the voting body that put Selig in the Hall of Fame isn't the same one that passed on Bonds and Clemens (and  Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire) and is passing on A-Rod. Selig was inducted into the Hall of Fame after getting enough votes from the 16-person Today's Game Era Committee. \nThe vote most fans pay heavy attention to each year is the BBWAA vote, which only considers players and never includes executives. It's still difficult to argue with A-Rod here. If we don't have Bonds and Clemens in the Hall of Fame, why should Selig be in it? He took over as acting commissioner in 1992 and was finally made full-time commissioner in 1998, serving through the 2015 season. MLB embraced all the attention from the home run chase between McGwire and Sosa in 1998 and celebrated Bonds' 73 home runs in 2001. The league was actively looking the other way on PEDs until putting together the Joint Drug Agreement in time for the 2004 season. We could also point out Selig was involved in the owner collusion scandal in the 1980s, which resulted in the involved owners having to pay $280 million in damages to players. \nThe game certainly grew under Selig's watch, but he was part of the administration that reaped the rewards from the extra attention gained during the steroid era and then also an administration that made PED offenders pariahs once there was a testing system in place. He should not be a Hall of Famer. There are some voters, such as myself, who won't vote for players who tested positive and/or were suspended for PEDs once there was a system in place, but if not, everyone is fair game to vote in. That means I would have been a yes for Bonds, Clemens, Sosa and McGwire, but I'm a no on A-Rod. I would have been a strong no on Selig, notably for the collusion case. The bottom line is, yes, A-Rod is correct regarding how it looks hypocritical with Selig in the Hall of Fame, it just isn't as simple when it comes to what group deserves the blame for said hypocrisy. It wasn't the BBWAA. It was the people who voted for Selig in 2016 for the 2017 Hall of Fame class.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There were no changes within the top five of this week's College Football Playoff Rankings, but there was still notable movement. Oregon climbed one spot to No. 5 after its statement win against USC. That pushed Ole Miss down to No. 6 despite the Rebels maintaining a strong résumé.Further down the list, Miami rose to No. 12, keeping its postseason hopes alive. However, that still leaves the Hurricanes on the outside looking in for an at-large bid, meaning their most realistic path to the playoff likely requires winning the ACC Championship Game, even though the chances of getting to Charlotte are slim. Meanwhile, Utah slipped to No. 13 following a narrow escape against Kansas State -- a game in which the Utes surrendered a staggering 472 rushing yards, raising concerns for the selection committee despite the victory.At the top, nothing has changed regarding the four programs currently projected to earn first-round byes in the new 12-team playoff format: No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Indiana, No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 Georgia remain firmly in place.This bracket is a projection heading into Week 14. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the fourth CFP Rankings release. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            There are still two more sets of CFP Rankings to come: next Tuesday's release ahead of conference championship week, followed by the final Top 25 and official 12-team playoff bracket, which will be unveiled on Sunday, Dec. 7.Who will represent the ACC?Although Miami is the highest-ranked ACC team in the eyes of the selection committee, plenty must break the Hurricanes' way for them to even reach the conference championship game. They would then have to win it to claim the league's automatic bid. As it stands, both SMU and Virginia control their own destiny entering the final week of the regular season. If they hold serve, they'll meet in Charlotte, with the winner expected to move into the projected No. 11 seed.For Miami to have a real shot at reaching the title game, it needs outside help. In the ACC race, the Hurricanes are rooting for at least two of the following three teams to take a loss before the dust settles: Duke, SMU and Virginia. Only then would a path open for Miami to claim the league's automatic berth.\nStill, by jumping ahead of Utah in the latest rankings, Miami has moved closer to at-large contention. But chaos elsewhere remains essential -- scenarios such as Alabama losing to Auburn in the Iron Bowl, Ole Miss falling to Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl or an LSU upset of Oklahoma. Even one of those may not be enough, especially with BYU sitting at No. 11 and positioned to grab the final at-large spot.Ole Miss in danger of losing first-round home gameWith Ole Miss slipping to No. 7 in the latest rankings, the program now sits uncomfortably close to falling out of the No. 5-8 range needed to host a first-round College Football Playoff game. A loss in the Egg Bowl to Mississippi State -- or movement around them in the rankings -- could easily push Ole Miss into road-game territory for the opening round.What complicates everything is the uncertainty surrounding Lane Kiffin. His future has become the most talked-about storyline of the season, as he remains linked to both LSU and Florida in what has become a high-stakes coaching pursuit. Kiffin has dodged questions publicly, but the situation has turned into a full-blown saga.\nThat instability matters. The selection committee has historically taken late-season uncertainty into account -- just ask Florida State in 2023. With the Egg Bowl looming, Ole Miss has little margin for error. A misstep on the field or further off-field distractions could not only cost the program a coveted first-round home game but, in a worst-case scenario, even jeopardize its spot in the 12-team playoff altogether.\n            ",

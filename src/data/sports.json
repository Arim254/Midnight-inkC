    "body": "\n        The American Express 2026 is the second event of the PGA Tour season, but the first to feature the reigning four-time Player of the Year in Scottie Scheffler. He and the rest of the field will tee off on Thursday from La Quinta Country Club, and Scheffler could figure into several PGA props or a golf parlay. He's the +280 favorite, per the latest 2026 American Express odds, despite never previously winning across five starts at this event. Thus, seeking out others to either top the leaderboard or have high finishes could be part of an American Express longshot parlay.Andrew Landry has both a victory and a runner-up at this tournament, and he's at +30000 to simply record a top-10 finish, per the latest golf props. That could be a standalone bet or one leg in what could be a lucrative PGA Tour parlay. From outright winners to top 10 finishes to even wagering on there being an ace, there are lots of options to consider. Before making any 2026 American Express picks or golf parlays, you need to see this PGA Tour parlay from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times. It has locked in betting picks to form a 5-leg golf parlay that pays out nearly $70,000 for a $10 bettor. See the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top 2026 American Express   parlay, PGA Tour picksFor the American Express 2026, one of the picks featured in the model's 5-leg PGA Tour parlay is Kurt Kitayama to have a top 10 finish at +360. Kitayama is coming off his best season on tour as he picked up his second victory and finished a career-best of 35th in the final standings. For the third straight year, Kitayama notched four top-10 finishes, including at a pair of courses that check in at under 7,300 yards at TPC Deere Run and TPC Southwind. That's relevant for the American Express, as La Quinta Country Club is just 7,060 yards, making it the fourth-shortest course in use for the 2026 season.\nHis length off the tee works in his favor on short courses as Kitayama ranked fifth in driving distance last season. However, he also has a nice touch with irons, as he was also in the top 10 on tour in strokes gained: tee-to-green. Kitayama played this event last year, and while he didn't have the best showing, he did shoot par or better in all four rounds. That experience should be invaluable this week as the model has him notching a top-10 finish (+360) despite his +4500 longshot odds to outright win. See the rest of the PGA Tour parlay legs here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make PGA Tour parlay picks The model has also picked an outright winner, plus a prop that returns +700 among its five PGA Tour picks for the 2026 American Express   parlay that pays almost $70,000 on just a $10 bet. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.\nSo, who will win the 2026 American Express, and what combination of PGA Tour props could unlock nearly a $70,000 payday on just a $10 bet?

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons found their new coach as they agreed to terms with former Cleveland Browns lead man Kevin Stefanski last week to replace Raheem Morris. With Stefanski now in the NFC South, it means he's going to face off against his former quarterback twice a year in Baker Mayfield, who now stars for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Stefanski and Mayfield spent the 2020 and 2021 seasons together in Cleveland, and it's safe to say that their time together with the Browns did not end on good terms. Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, spotted a social media post on Tuesday that claimed he failed the Browns during his four seasons with the organization and that he was a part of a \"dumpster fire\" of a quarterback room that Stefanski had to manage. Mayfield took exception and responded by firing a shot at his former coach: \"Failed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can't wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\"\nMayfield has a point. He wasn't exactly a \"dumpster fire\" failure in Cleveland. In 2020, he led the Browns to an 11-5 record, which resulted in their first playoff appearance since 2002 and helped the franchise win its first playoff game since 1994. Cleveland hasn't won a playoff game since that wild card victory the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, Mayfield went 6-8 as the starter the following year as he tried to fight through a shoulder injury. That offseason, the Browns opted to join the Deshaun Watson sweepstakes and sent the Houston Texans a package of draft picks that included three first-round selections in exchange for Watson, who received a record five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract. It's regarded as one of the worst trades in NFL history, as Watson owns a 9-10 record as starter for the Browns, and hasn't played in more than seven games in any of the four years he's spent with Cleveland. \nMayfield apparently did not hear from Stefanski after the Browns ditched him for another quarterback, which clearly irked him. The quarterback struggled to find his footing after the breakup, as he was traded to the Carolina Panthers prior to the 2022 season and then released after just six starts. Mayfield finished the year with the Los Angeles Rams before the Buccaneers came calling with a one-year prove-it deal.In his first season with Tampa in 2023, Mayfield put up what were career-high numbers at the time with 4,044 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. It earned him his first multi-year extension, and Mayfield responded with another career year in 2024, throwing for 4,500 yards, 41 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. Since joining the Buccaneers, Mayfield is 27-24 as the starter, and has won the NFC South twice. \nUltimately, Mayfield can't be too upset with all that has happened. He got to watch his former coach be fired, and is in a much better place than the Browns these days. And on top of that, he'll now get to go against Stefanski twice per season. Buckle up. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a new era at Stamford Bridge and the Blues have taken a big bet by bringing in English manager Liam Rosenior to lead the club. Only 41, this is a tall task for Rosenior to come from Strasbourg to Chelsea, but history is also in his favor. Chelsea have twice won the Champions League in their history, lifting the trophy in 2012 and 2021. Each time, Chelsea changed their manager midseason and ended up winning the competition. With Rosenior replacing Enzo Maresca, the Blues are looking to secure a top-eight place in the league phase and direct passage to the round of 16 as they host former player David Luiz and Pafos on Wednesday.How to watch Chelsea vs. Pafos oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 21 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- LondonLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea -699; Draw +700; Pafos +1600Plenty is being said about Rosenior's experience, but in European soccer, he brings the same level of experience as Maresca, who led Chelsea to a Europa Conference League title and glory at the Club World Cup. Rosenior was managing Strasbourg in the Conference League this season before taking over the Blues, and despite only managing two matches so far, he was able to keep Chelsea competitive, facing Arsenal in a League Cup defeat before engineering a shutout victory over Brentford. But he's aware that, despite this being the first match that he'll manage in the Champions League, not much changes preparation-wise.\"I'm proud to be here [managing in the Champions League]. Like I've said before, my focus is on winning the game. My focus is on success here, so I'm preparing a game like we would any other game to make sure we put in the best performance to give us a chance of winning the game,\" Rosenior said in his pre-match press conference.A player who has already been key for the new manager is Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernández. He has a goal and two assists in two matches under Rosenior and seems set to be a central figure in what Chelsea will do moving forward, and Rosenior expressed how important Fernandez is to him. That should come as no surprise when Fernandez has been able to move from being a defensive midfielder to being a box-to-box midfielder or operate as a No. 10, all with amazing effectiveness. Along with Declan Rice and Bruno Guimaraes, Fernandez is one of the most well-rounded midfielders in the Premier League and in the world. If he can combine well with Cole Palmer down the stretch, the Blues can absolutely become a dark-horse contender to win this competition. \nRosenior teams have a reputation of being hard to break down defensively, so with his system coming into play, Chelsea just need a set attack that can make things happen. With Fernendez's versatility, they have a leg up. While the Blues will need to prove that they can take down teams like Arsenal in the future, showing that they're competitive now means there is another gear that Rosenior can help them unlock, but it all begins with defeating Pafos on Wednesday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The more they play, the more it seems to be Arsenal's year. The team coached by Mikel Arteta won 3-1 at San Siro against Inter on Tuesday on Matchday 7 of the Champions League, deploying another incredible performance that underlined once again why they are currently considered the best team around.With seven wins in seven games so far in the league phase of the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal are leading the standings and will likely end up as winners of the opening phase. After winning seven games in a row for the first time in their European history, scoring 20 goals and conceding just two, the Gunners look like the best team in the competition right now and could potentially win their first Premier League title in more than two decades as well. For that reason, it's hard to imagine them finishing the season without lifting at least one trophy in the coming months.\nThe game at San Siro showed, if possible, even more of their potential because of the choices made by Arteta in the starting 11. The Spanish coach decided to bench some of the key players of this team, including English midfielder Declan Rice and Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, who came off the bench and scored the goal to make it 3-1 in the second half. While Arteta's selections appeared focused on prioritizing the Premier League, along with the rotations, he is forced to make do with playing every three days, and this game also highlighted the gap between Arsenal and Inter, the 2024–25 Champions League finalists.\nIt's quite obvious that both teams are kind of safe, considering their league phase standings. Arsenal are expected to end up as the winners of the league phase, which means they will play at home all the second games in the round of 16. On the other hand, if Inter don't end up in the top eight and will need to play the playoffs, they should probably take more responsibility for the two 1-0 defeats against Atletico Madrid away and against Liverpool at San Siro in December, more than Tuesday's defeat against Arsenal. At the same time, there is a persisting issue when Cristian Chivu's side meet a strong team. The Nerazzurri struggled every match they played against a top team in both Italy and Europe, and this is becoming a major issue for them ahead of the crucial stint of the 2025-26 season. \n        \n            \n                Champions League burning questions: Arsenal and Inter's set piece clash, are Real Madrid still contenders?\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking to Sky Italy, Chivu showed his admiration for Arteta and the English side, saying, \"Arsenal impressed me more than any other team. They always make the right play and constantly cause you problems with Saka, they always make the right decisions. The Premier League is truly top in terms of intensity and in Italy we're not used to that. I'm trying to bring that aspect in, but it's not easy. We're trying to grow step by step, and we need to be convinced that we're doing the right things.\"\nIn Serie A, Chivu's side have struggled against top opposition, failing to beat Napoli (one loss and one draw) and losing to both AC Milan and Juventus. In Europe, after winning their opening four matches against Ajax, Slavia Prague, Kairat, and Union SG, they suffered defeats to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, and Arsenal. Next week, they will face Borussia Dortmund in what will be a crucial match to avoid the playoffs, something Arsenal won't need to worry about this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Illinois senior guard Kylan Boswell will miss at least a month with a right-hand injury, Illini coach Brad Underwood announced Tuesday. Boswell is Illinois' second-leading scorer and has transformed into one of the elite point-of-attack defenders in all of college basketball, who is capable of guarding Cooper Flagg, Purdue's Trey Kaufman-Renn, Northwestern's Nick Martinelli, Iowa's Bennett Stirtz and everyone in between. Boswell suffered the injury in Monday's practice.The timing is less than ideal for No. 11 Illinois, especially ahead with Saturday's highly-anticipated road tilt against No. 4 Purdue looming. Through two-plus months, Boswell was averaging 14.3 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists while shooting 82% at the charity stripe.\"Expecting a mid-February return to action for him,\" Underwood told reporters, via Illini Inquirer. \"Unfortunate. Feel terrible for Kylan as he's obviously a senior and he's having such a phenomenal year. It's the 'next man up' mentality with our team. It's exciting that we've been able to develop the depth. We'll see what that looks like as we move forward.\"It's a significant blow for Illinois' Big Ten Championship hopes. Illinois is part of a Big Five that has emerged in the Big Ten pecking order. Purdue and Nebraska are a perfect 7-0 with Michigan, Illinois and Michigan State nipping on their heels at 6-1. All five look like second-weekend contenders and worthy Big Ten winners. The calculus changes for the Illini without Boswell, who has been the leader of this club from the jump.\nIllinois has winnable home bouts looming like Maryland, Washington, Northwestern and Indiana, but life on the road in the Big Ten is especially brutal, especially without one of the premier defenders in the league. Can it stay in the race?Where does Illinois turn?Illinois' offense has been exceptional this year, rating No. 3 nationally in efficiency with a slick mix of size, shooting and offensive rebounding. Boswell is the glue of that unit. The 6-2 senior can get a bucket at all three levels, draw a ton of fouls and operate as a secondary playmaker. When Boswell has been on the floor, Illinois has a minuscule 13% turnover rate. When he sits, Illinois' turnover rate spikes to over 20%. Playing mistake-free basketball will be essential for Boswell's replacement to keep this train on the tracks.\nUnderwood doesn't have an easy plug-and-play replacement, but there are options aplenty. Junior sharpshooter Jake Davis will get some burn. Davis has just two turnovers this season, and he's shooting over 40% from downtown. Underwood could also trot out some more double-big lineups featuring Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic to counteract some of the double-big lineups that Purdue and Washington will present in the next nine days. \n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: How Duke's adjustments have it playing with confidence; building the All-Bench All-Stars\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course, Keaton Wagler and Andrej Stojakovic become even more essential. Wagler has been a revelation. The 6-6 point guard has emerged as the engine of the Illini. The Big Ten Freshman of the Year frontrunner will have even more on his plate as he navigates the vicious Big Ten. Stojakovic also has to return to early-season form offensively. Illinois had the depth to afford quiet offensive games from Stojakovic in wins over Northwestern and Minnesota last week. Those days are over. Without Boswell, Stojakovic will shoulder more defensive responsibilities. Underwood needs more from his star transfer on both ends immediately.Illinois could also tap the Mihailo Petrovic button. The Serbian point guard has not been a huge part of this rotation, mostly due to Wagler's emergence into a potential first-round pick and a flat-out star. Can Petrovic defend and play clean basketball? Is playing Petrovic and shifting Wagler to more of an off-ball role good for this club? \nLet the tinkering for the 15-3 Illini begin.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    IlliniInquirer brings fans trusted coverage from a dedicated team of insiders.

Among the holdovers, the following 12 players will remain on the ballot next year (listed with their vote percentage this year and how many years they've been on the ballot: Chase Utley, 59.1%, third yearAndy Pettitte, 48.5%, 8thFélix Hernández, 46.1%, 2ndAlex Rodríguez, 40%, 5thBobby Abreu, 30.8%, 7thJimmy Rollins, 25.4%, 5thDustin Pedroia, 20.7%, 2ndMark Buehrle, 20%, 6thOmar Vizquel, 18.4%, 9thDavid Wright, 14.8%, 3rdFrancisco Rodríguez, 11.8%, 4thTorii Hunter, 8.7%, 6thThe only first-year player on the ballot to get more than 5% of the vote was Cole Hamels, who debuted with 23.8%.Every other first-time candidate fell off the ballot after failing to receive 5% of the vote. \nAs for the players who will join the ballot next season, let's outline the possibilities, in order of how likely they are to make the Hall of Fame, according to, well, me.Buster PoseyDue to a lack of longevity, Posey doesn't have a slam-dunk Hall of Fame case. Though I'm very confident he'll eventually get in, I'm not sure it happens on the first ballot. I think he should get in rather easily and right away, but I'm just one of roughly 400 voters. In parts of 12 seasons, Posey hit .302/.372/.460 (129 OPS+) with 1,500 hits, 293 doubles, 158 home runs, 729 RBI, 663 runs and 45 WAR. He won Rookie of the Year in 2010, National League MVP in 2012 and three World Series titles as the Giants catcher (2010, 2012 and 2014). He was long known as a clubhouse leader and good framer behind the plate. He routinely threw out would-be basestealers at a far higher clip than league average, ending up catching 32.9% compared to a league average of 27.4%. He won a Gold Glove and five Silver Sluggers. \nThe eye test and \"fame\" test match up here. Posey was a huge deal and had the look of a Hall of Famer through much of his career. As relatively short as his career was, his counting stats on the offensive side might leave something to be desired for a power hitter, but keep in mind he was predominantly a catcher. The JAWS system has Posey 14th all time among catchers. There are currently 17 Hall of Fame catchers. Posey is a bit below the Hall of Fame standard here, but I think many voters will be willing to dip down there. In comparing Posey here to contemporaries, he's second behind Joe Mauer (seventh in JAWS), sitting ahead of players like Yadier Molina (22nd), J.T. Realmuto (26th, so far, as he's still active), Russell Martin (28th) and Brian McCann (35th). \nThe counting stats really might pose a roadblock here, at least temporarily, but Posey will eventually get into the Hall as a peak candidate. Jon LesterWe've been discussing for years why lowering the standards for Hall of Fame pitchers makes sense in light of the smaller workloads that starters accumulate these days. Lester might have an avenue here combining some old-school elements with new-school ones. In parts of 16 seasons, he won exactly 200 games with only 117 losses. He didn't win a Cy Young, but finished in the top four of voting three times, topping out at second in 2016. He won World Series with both the Cubs and Red Sox and that might earn him some bonus points on the fame factor. Speaking of bonus points, he was stellar in the playoffs. In 26 postseason appearances, Lester worked 154 innings, pitching to a 2.51 ERA with a 1.02 WHIP and 133 strikeouts. He won NLCS MVP in 2016 and threw some massive innings in relief in the Cubs' Game 7 World Series victory. \nIn the regular season, Lester worked 2,740 innings, striking out 2,488 while pitching to a 3.66 ERA (117 ERA+) with a 1.28 WHIP and 43.5 WAR. The JAWS system isn't too kind to Lester, as he sits 153rd all time among starting pitchers. He is ahead of Hall of Famers like Jack Morris, Jack Chesbro, Lefty Gomez and Catfish Hunter, though. To compare to current players, he's even with Gerrit Cole and ahead of Zack Wheeler, for the time being.Though there's a case here, it feels like an uphill battle. He's certainly at least one tier lower than Posey.\nThe next tier is Brett Gardner, Kyle Seager and Ryan Zimmerman. Gardner hit .256/.342/.398 (100 OPS+) with 1,470 hits, 251 doubles, 73 triples, 139 home runs, 578 RBI, 943 runs, 274 steals and good enough defense to help push him to 44.3 WAR. He's 39th among left fielders in JAWS. Seager in parts of 11 years hit .251/.321/.442 (112 OPS+) with 1,395 hits, 309 doubles, 242 home runs, 807 RBI, 705 runs and 37 WAR. He's 49th among third baseman in JAWS.Zimmerman, also a third baseman, sits 42nd at the position in JAWS. In his 16-year career, he hit .277/.341/.475 (116 OPS+) with 1,846 hits, 417 doubles, 284 home runs, 1,061 RBI, 963 runs and 40.1 WAR. After that, Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta probably gets on the ballot, as will Andrew Miller. Maybe Ervin Santana, Pablo Sandoval, Wade Davis, Joakim Soria, Dexter Fowler, Todd Frazier, Josh Reddick, Jordan Zimmermann and/or Asdrúbal Cabrera will make it, too. Some others eligible to be added to the ballot for the first time: Scott Kazmir, J.A. Happ, Jay Bruce, Jonathan Lucroy, Starlin Castro, Alex Avila, Wilson Ramos, Jon Jay and Neftali Feliz.The bottom line, though, is the new class for next season on the Hall of Fame ballot has one likely Hall of Famer in Posey and another in Lester who, likely in a best-case scenario, might sit around Mark Buehrle (20%) and Hamels (23.8%). After that, we're looking at a bunch of one-and-dones.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks have hit rock bottom. They were blown out Monday night by a Dallas Mavericks team that had seven players on the injury list, but still managed to cruise to a 114-97 win at Madison Square Garden. Fans rained down boos once again as the Knicks put together another pitiful performance, and coach Mike Brown said after the game that he understood the sentiment of the fans.\"I'm OK with the boos. If we're playing crappy, boo,\" Brown said. \"If I was in the stands, I'd probably boo, too. You pay hard money to come to the game.\"Following the loss -- the ninth in the Knicks' last 11 outings -- star guard Jalen Brunson called for a players-only meeting to talk about the struggles, per ESPN. Brunson reportedly urged his teammates to \"find answers\" instead of looking to the coaching staff to fix their problems.\n        \n            \n                Things can't get much worse for 'desperate' Knicks -- but will they get better at the trade deadline?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJosh Hart told reporters after the game that the team needs to do some \"soul searching\" amid a stretch of \"embarrassing basketball.\"\n\"I think we all need to do some soul searching, some looking in the mirror and figuring out what we're going to do individually, what we're going to do as a team, what our identity is right now,\" Hart said. \"Right now we're playing embarrassing basketball. We're not executing on the offensive end and defensively we've been abysmal. We've really been terrible defensively all year. At some point we have to look in the mirror and realize no one out here is feeling sorry for us. We have enough. We've shown that, we have to figure out how to get that sense of urgency.\"Brunson echoed Hart's sentiments after the loss, but said the soul searching \"should've started a couple weeks ago.\"\"We got to start tomorrow. We've got to figure this out fast,\" Brunson said. The Knicks have been abysmal since the calendar flipped, and if things don't get figured out quickly, you can forget an NBA championship, they might not even make the Eastern Conference finals with the way they've been playing. Some of their losses have been against tough opponents, sure. The San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons have been better than New York all season. But losing to the Sacramento Kings? Allowing 75 points in the first half to a Mavericks team that has no real offensive identity outside of giving Cooper Flagg the ball and seeing what happens? That's just embarrassing.\nThe Knicks have relied too much on their offense to win games. Through the first two months of the season, that was enough. They had a 21-9 record after a close win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Christmas. Since then, it's just been open season for any team they're playing against.Since the start of January, only the Utah Jazz, Brooklyn Nets and New Orleans Pelicans -- teams with a combined 36-93 record -- have been worse defensively than the Knicks. If the Knicks want to be taken seriously as a championship contender, they have to show more effort on the defensive end.Hart says the team has enough to right the ship, and maybe that's true, but if not this could prove to be the perfect moment for a trade to be made ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline. Things can't keep going in this direction. At 25-18, the Knicks are sitting third in the East, but things can go south in a hurry even in an inferior conference.\nThe Knicks need to find answers fast, otherwise this team will fall short of expectations yet again when the playoffs start.\n            ",

Diggs made three tackles in two games with the Packers, including seeing brief action in the 31-27 loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFC wild card round. \nDiggs, 27, enjoyed a fast start to his career that included leading the NFL with 11 interceptions in 2021, his second season. His early success led to the Cowboys giving him a five-year, $97 million contract heading into the 2023 season. \nA knee injury sustained in practice led to Diggs missing all but two games that season. He played in 11 games in 2024 but was sidelined for the final four games of the season after undergoing surgery on the same knee that he had injured a year earlier. \n        \n            \n                Why Cowboys chose to cut Pro Bowl CB Trevon Diggs now after 'accumulation of multiple factors' and what's next\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDiggs was placed on injured reserve this year after dealing with lingering concussion symptoms. He played in eight games for the Cowboys before being released on December 30. He was claimed by the Packers the following day. \nDiggs is now free to sign with anyone, including the four teams that will be playing this weekend in the AFC and NFC Championship games.

The team has conducted second interviews with defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, former Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and Los Angeles Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. McDaniel, 42, enjoyed a successful albeit short run as the San Francisco 49ers' offensive coordinator before becoming the Dolphins' coach in 2022. After having early success in Miami that included consecutive playoff berths, McDaniel's teams went a combined 15-19 over the past two seasons. Overall, McDaniel compiled a 35-33 regular season record and an 0-2 playoff record during his four seasons with the Dolphins.\nMcDaniel is part of a competitive group of coaching candidates, a field that (in addition to the names listed above) also includes Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who has conducted interviews with the Ravens and Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Manchester City's trip to Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday in the UEFA Champions League was a classic mismatch in a lot of ways, but the stakes are always a little different for City. Every defining feature of the team is rooted in an ability to overpower their opponents; the financial might of a nation-state makes that possible, but the glory days where they could barely put a foot wrong really creates the lasting image. Their period of incredible, undeniable dominance is not all that distant a memory, either, so much so that when Liam Gallagher opens the nostalgia-tinged classic \"Champagne Supernova\" by asking how many special people change and how many lives are living strange, it may as well be about the singer's beloved club.Even for City's well-documented faults, their capitulation in a 3-1 defeat at Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday felt like a new low. They unraveled completely above the Arctic Circle, each of their weaknesses fully exposed by an opponent with a lengthy list of disadvantages, chief among them the fact that they had not played a competitive match since Dec. 10. The hits came fairly quickly, too – Kasper Hogh had a brace by the 24th minute, while Jens Petter Hauge's 58th minute goal was enough to dig City into a hole they could not climb out of.\nGlimt have a reputation for being a tricky opponent but they were helped by the fact that City's injury crisis left them without several of Pep Guardiola's first choices in the back line. They took full advantage, overperforming their 1.35 expected goals tally from eight shots and racking up goals in a way City used to be known for. It is an impressive way for the team to notch their first-ever win in the Champions League, and even more impressive considering the fact that they were doomed to be eliminated with anything other than a victory.The fact that City even dug themselves into that hole, though, is remarkable in its own right, even if the reasons why are not all that difficult to identify. City's once-untouchable offense has been in noticeable decline for upwards of a year now and sputtered again on Tuesday, generating just 1.16 expected goals from 16 shots and a single goal from Rayan Cherki in the 60th minute along the way. Their overreliance on Erling Haaland continues to cost them; the Norway international was essentially removed from the game with just 14 touches over the course of the 90 minutes. He could not get on the scoresheet and is now on a four game cold streak, and now has just one goal in his last eight across all competitions. City have just three wins during that eight-match stretch, unable to keep the attack going on days Haaland is unable to contribute.\nCity seem to be well aware of these issues, too, already spending around $100 million on Antoine Semenyo to bolster their attacking operation and Marc Guehi to provide depth in defense, the pair merely the latest additions to a team that has been in transformation for a year now. Guardiola and company have fully embraced that this is a rebuilding season, something that is obvious in every way – the results and the performances demonstrate that in equal measure, and there have been plenty of days where it seems like they are on the right track. Cherki in particular has been a meaningful addition to Guardiola's squad, the fact that he scored on Tuesday perhaps a sign he can become a reliable attacker even on days the team's sum does not add up to its parts.The recognition that a rebuild was needed, though, has somehow made the growing pains all the more difficult. Even if Guardiola is still working out all the details for his new-look team, there may still be more work to do. Take, for example, Ballon d'Or winner Rodri – he was easily worthy of the accolade he won in 2024, the most essential player in Guardiola's most dominant version of City. He has yet to return to that level since recovering from a lengthy ACL injury, though, and had quite the lapse in judgement after picking up two yellow cards in quick succession in the second half.\nEven in a rebuilding phase, though, City were still good enough to string together a stronger performance on Tuesday, just as they could have in a 2-0 loss to Manchester United over the weekend. The poor run of form in the fall of 2024 that inspired a spending spree that has lasted a year – and show no signs of slowing down – has not really disappeared, a signal that perhaps lining up brand-new players is not the only fix to the team's longstanding issues. If that is the case, Guardiola has his work cut out for him.\n            ",

    "body": "\nSeparated by about 195 miles, the cities of Houston and San Antonio have a Texas-sized rivarly.You may hear a Houstonian ask, \"What's the best thing to come out of San Antonio?\" The answer: I-10. San Antonians tell that joke a little differently.That rivalry is only primed to intensify over the next few years because of the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs. Both teams are loaded with young, budding stars and valuable draft assets and are positioned to be contenders for years. They already are two of the best teams in the Western Conference, with the Spurs (30-13) sitting in second in the West and the Rockets (25-15) in fifth. On Tuesday, these teams will collide for the second time this season at the Toyota Center in Houston. San Antonio enters the game after winning three straight games, all at home. Meanwhile, the Rockets are 3-1 on their current five-game homestand.Houston is a 4-point favorite on Tuesday night.While Rockets-Spurs is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes six other NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Tuesday, Jan. 20. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchSpurs at RocketsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Rockets -168\nAfter struggling offensively for five games (103.4 points per 100 possessions), the Spurs busted out of their slump in their last three games (123.5) when beating the Bucks, Timberwolves and Jazz. But on Tuesday, San Antonio will be playing the second half of a back-to-back and will be on the road. The Rockets have been excellent at the Toyota Center this season, going 14-3. Houston is coming off a much-needed solid shooting performance on Sunday when it hit 50% of its shots from the field. Jabari Smith Jr. broke out of a prolonged shooting slump, nailing seven of his 13 3-point attempts en route to a game-high 32 points. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Rockets have a 74% chance to win and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to Rockets money line (-168).Lakers at NuggetsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 228.5 | Expert: LeBron James Over 22.5 total points -124\nGive David Adelman and the Denver Nuggets credit. They're 7-4 since Nikola Jokic went out with a hyperextended knee. Granted, three of those four losses were by 12 and 23 points (twice). The Nuggets' already challenged defense has slipped slightly over the last 11 games, allowing 117.3 points per 100 possessions, which is 24th in the NBA over that time. The Lakers are 2-5 over their last seven games and defense continues to be an issue; L.A. is giving up 118.5 points per 100 possessions over that stretch, which ranks 25th in the league. The SportsLine Projection Model sees a lot of points being scored on Tuesday. It says there's a 56.3% chance the teams combine for 229 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 228.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchLSU at No. 16 FloridaTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: LSU +16.5\nThe Florida Gators (13-5, 4-1 in SEC) are surging. After losing to Missouri in their SEC opener to drop to 9-5 on the season, the Gators have won four in a row, which includes three wins over ranked teams (Georgia, Tennessee and Vanderbilt). Florida has dominated the boards all season; the team leads the country in rebound margin (15.6 per game). LSU (13-5, 1-4) has the size to counter Florida's rebounding prowess. The Tigers rank fourth in the SEC in rebound margin (6.4). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 66% chance LSU covers and assigns a \"B\" grade to Tigers +16.5. Keep an eye on the status of LSU point guard Dedan Thomas Jr. (leg), who is listed as questionable.Indiana at No. 3 MichiganTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Ann Arbor, Mich. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Indiana +15.5\nPrior to Monday, Indiana was known as a basketball school. That has changed for obvious reasons, and the basketball team enters Crisler Arena on a three-game losing streak, having fallen to Nebraska, Michigan State and Iowa to sit at 12-6 overall and 3-4 in the Big Ten. Meanwhile, Michigan (16-1, 6-1) has stumbled only once this season. The Wolverines haven't been blowing out opponents like they did earlier in the year; they are 0-4 ATS in their last four games. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 63% chance the Hoosiers cover and gives a \"B\" grade to Indiana +15.5.No. 15 Vanderbilt at No. 20 ArkansasTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Fayetteville, Ark. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Vanderbilt +1.5\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks (13-5, 3-2 in SEC) have an issue at the start of games. In their last three losses—to Houston, Auburn and Georgia—they spotted their opponents first half leads of 21 (Houston), 17 (Auburn) and 17 (Georgia). That would be a risky strategy on Tuesday against the Vanderbilt Commodores (16-2, 3-2), who are ranked No. 12 by Kenpom and have the No. 4 offense in the country (127.1 points per 100 possessions). The Razorbacks are 281st in the nation in scoring defense (77.4 points per game). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Commodores have a 51% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to Vanderbilt +1.5.No. 4 Purdue at UCLATime: 10 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: UCLA +5.5\nWhat college basketball team has the best offense in the country according to Kenpom? Not Georgia (96.0 points per game). Not Miami of Ohio (93.9). Not Akron (93.6), Alabama (93.1) or Michigan (93.1). The best offense belongs to the Purdue Boilermakers (17-1, 7-0 in Big Ten), who are scoring 129.5 points per 100 possessions. However, they only rank 45th in the country in points per game (85.1) because they play at such a slow pace. On Tuesday, Purdue will face an even slower opponent, the UCLA Bruins (12-6, 4-3), who rank 151st in scoring offense (78.2). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Bruins have a 55% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to UCLA +5.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU coach Lane Kiffin previously credited Nick Saban with helping him make the decision to leave Ole Miss and take the LSU job in November, but has now shared details of the conversation he had with the former Alabama coach that led to his choice to head to Baton Rouge.Saban won a national title at LSU before an ill-fated NFL tenure with the Miami Dolphins prior to his legendary career with the Crimson Tide. Saban won six national championships and nine SEC titles over 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007-23.Kiffin served as Saban's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16, which included a national championship. Alabama fired Kiffin before the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship Game after he had accepted the Florida Atlantic job and was splitting time for each.\"When [LSU] came in and met with me, it was just different,\" Kiffin said Tuesday. \"The feeling was different and as I sat there and told the story at the press conference, I was torn. When I called Coach Saban and talked it through with him, he said, 'you know, Lane, you'll always regret if you don't go to LSU. It's the best job in America.' And when he said that, it really made the decision for me.\n\"As I've looked at it, it has pushed me. It has got me out of a comfort zone that we were doing amazing things but you come here and feel the power of the place and it drives you every day to even go to another level.\"\nSaban said on College GameDay after Kiffin's departure to LSU that his former play-caller was initially \"confused\" on what he wanted to do.\"I never tell anybody what they should do,\" Saban said on ESPN. \"I just try to bring some thought into it so that they can make good decisions for themselves and their family and their future.\"\nKiffin left the Rebels before the start of the playoff and was not allowed to coach Ole Miss in the postseason after a ruling by athletic director Keith Carter. The Rebels, with new coach Pete Golding (Kiffin's defensive coordinator in Oxford) leading the way, blew out No. 11 Tulane in the first round and upset No. 3 Georgia in the quarterfinals before falling to No. 10 Miami in the CFP semifinals.Kiffin went 55-19 over six seasons at Ole Miss. One of the highest-profile coaches in college football since joining the Rebels in 2020, Kiffin led the program to four 10-win seasons and three finishes of No. 11 or better in the AP Top 25. LSU, meanwhile, fired Brian Kelly after the eighth game of his fourth season on the job, opening the door for its pursuit of Kiffin. Florida also came after Kiffin, but LSU was the more attractive destination. And Saban's advice clearly held weight. \n\"You know, coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference, so I can't ... I can't really say exactly what he said, but I'll say I think the world of coach Saban, and I respect him,\" Kiffin said at his introductory press conference in December. \"And so, there's a reason I'm here.\"\n            ",

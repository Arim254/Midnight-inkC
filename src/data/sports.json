    "body": "\n        When the New England Patriots take the field on Thursday night, the team will be wearing a new alternate uniform it has never worn before: The Nor'easter. The uniform was unveiled back in August as part of the NFL's \"Rivalries\" program. The Patriots were one of eight teams to get a \"Rivalries\" uniform for 2025, and they'll be the fourth team to debut the new look.The plan behind the \"Rivalries\" program was to design a uniform based on a theme that's local to each team. With the Patriots being located in the northeast, the team decided to create a \"Nor'easter\" jersey and helmet combination that \"blends the region's natural elements, rich maritime history, and football tradition into a bold, future-forward design,\" according to the team. \nThe official color of the uniform is Storm Blue, which was picked because it's \"Rugged, weathered, and worn in, like the coastline after a gale.\" The uniform has six stars on the neckline, which represents the six New England states. \n\n        \n            \n                Where to watch Jets vs. Patriots: TV channel, live stream and preview for 'TNF'\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Patriots are wearing the uniforms for the first time in their Thursday night game against the New York Jets, which kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime. You can see a few more photos of the uniform below. \n\nAnd now, let's take a closer look at the helmet. \nThe Patriots teamed up with Nike to create the new uniform with a design that's suppose to harness \"the power and unpredictability of a New England storm.\"The Storm Blue look is definitely a hit in the Patriots' locker room. \"Probably the nicest uniform I've worn in my whole football career,\" Jaylin Hawkins said this week, via ESPN. \"They're dope; the color scheme. Has a lot of 'aura' to it.\"\nThe Patriots are one of eight teams that will be participating in the \"Rivalries\" program this year. This program was announced DURING the 2025 NFL Draft back in April, so a lot of people missed the initial announcement. Over the next four seasons, one NFC division and one AFC division per year will get to debut a new \"Rivalries\" uniform, so not every team got a new uniform this year. Here's when each division will be getting their \"Rivalries\" uniform: 2025: AFC East and NFC West (See all the 2025 uniforms here)2026: AFC South and NFC North2027: AFC West and NFC East2028: AFC North and NFC SouthAfter the Patriots wear their new uniform on Thursday night, we'll be getting another \"Rivalries\" uniform game on Sunday when the Los Angeles Rams show off their new look against the Seahawks. \nHere's the the full \"Rivalries\" schedule for 2025 (The team listed first is the \"Rivalries\" uniform team):Week 4: Cardinals vs. Seahawks (See the uniform here)Week 4: Dolphins vs. Jets (See the uniform here)Week 5: Bills vs. Patriots (See the uniform here)Week 11: Patriots vs. Jets (Thursday, Nov. 13))Week 11: Rams vs. Seahawks (Sunday, Nov. 16)Week 14: Jets vs. Dolphins (Sunday, Dec. 7)Week 16: Seahawks vs. Rams (Thursday, Dec. 18)Week 18: 49ers vs. Seahawks (Jan. 3 or Jan. 4)The NFL approved a new rule in April that will allow each team to wear an alternate uniform in four different games, which is up from three. That means that any team with multiple alternate or throwback uniforms will now have an extra opportunity to wear those during the regular season. The \"Rivalries\" uniforms will only be worn once this season by each team. \n            ",

Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $7,000 for $100 players on its top-rated NFL picks. It also entered Week 4 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 26-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season, and it has returned over $2,200 in profit on its top-rated college basketball picks over the past three seasons.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nOver 43 in Patriots vs. JetsNew England's offense has been humming under the direction of quarterback Drake Maye, ranked eighth in the NFL in points per game (26.5). The Patriots have gone Over in three straight games as home favorites, and the Jets have gone Over in five straight games as road underdogs. New York has hit the Over in 12 of its last 16 games overall. The Patriots have scored at least 23 points in every game during their seven-game winning streak, and the model has them scoring 33 points on Thursday to help the Over cash in 71% of simulations. Bet Patriots vs. Jets at bet365 here:Alabama -4 vs. PurdueAlabama is seeking revenge after losing to Purdue on the road last season, and it enters this matchup with momentum following a 103-96 win over then-No. 5 St. John's on Saturday. The Crimson Tide were 4.5-point road underdogs in that game, but guard Labaron Philon scored a career-high 25 points while guard Aden Holloway added 21 points and four assists. Purdue's Trey Kaufman-Renn, who had 26 points against Alabama last season, missed the first two games of the season due to a hip pointer and back tightness, so this will be a difficult time to make his first appearance. The model has Alabama winning by three possessions and covering the spread 61% of the time.\nSuns -4.5 vs. PacersThese teams are trending in opposite directions early in the season, as Phoenix has won six of its last seven games and Indiana has lost 10 of its first 11. The Suns drilled 14 3-pointers in a 123-114 win at Dallas on Wednesday, and they are among the NBA's leaders with 16.3 triples per game. Indiana is on a five-game losing streak after getting blown out by Golden State on Sunday and Utah on Tuesday. The Pacers remain without Tyrese Haliburton (Achilles) and Bennedict Mathurin (toe), which is one reason why the model has Phoenix winning by double digits and covering 68% of the time. Bet Suns vs. Pacers at bet365 here:\nLooking for more Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Thursday.

It's just a horrible matchup for the Jets, coming off a luck box win at home in Week 10, going to play a white-hot division opponent on a short week,\" CBS Sports NFL expert Will Brinson said. \"The Patriots don't let anyone run and the Jets can't pass the ball. New England should get a lead early and feed their running backs, forcing Justin Fields to drop back a ton which won't lead to anything good for the Jets.\" Back New England at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Suns -4.5 vs. Pacers (-110)It's been an abysmal season for the Pacers, who are off to a 1-10 start after taking the Thunder to seven games in the NBA Finals last season. Indiana has lost its last three games by a combined 72 points and five of its 10 losses have come by 17 points or more. Meanwhile, the Suns have been a pleasant surprise after Kevin Durant was dealt this offseason. Phoenix is 7-5 and has covered the spread in seven of its last eight games. The model is predicting a double-digit win for the Suns here and that Phoenix covers in 68% of simulations. Back Phoenix at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Sharks money line vs. Flames (+135)\"Why are the red-hot Sharks such an underdog tonight? Four wins on the spin, with outstanding work in goal while Macklin Celebrini emerges as one of the true stars of the league, have fueled a San Jose move after being left at the gate last month when winless in the first six,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Since then, it's been an 8-2-1 run, the latest win on Tuesday at Minnesota, and allowing just one goals in each win of the four-game streak. Meanwhile, Yarolsav Askarov has won his last four Sharks starts in goal, while posting a 1.23 GAA in thus far in November as well as .971 saves. That alone give San Jose an advantage over the fumbling Flames, with just four wins their first fourteen.\"\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Thursday.

That's cause for concern if you're hoping for a good game. But there's still plenty of angles to attack this game from a spread perspective, as well as prop betting and anytime touchdown scorer picks, especially if we think we know the game script and how this might play out.Click here to bet on Jets vs. Patriots at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet wins, along with three months of NBA League Pass:\nIf you're new to NFL betting or need a refresher, make sure to check out our NFL betting guide with the season underway. Also make sure to check out the SportsLine Projection Model's forecast for the entire Jets versus Patriots game.Top straight bet (spread, money line or total)Patriots -12.5We handed out the Patriots -11.5 in this week's Bet It Now column and we're certainly not going to shy away now, although if you're thinking of backing the Patriots, you probably want to do it sooner than later, as this is almost guaranteed to get to -13 and maybe even close as high as a full two touchdowns if the Pats keep getting peppered throughout the day.New England is simply a better team, so the big spread is justified, but the bottom line is it's a bad matchup for the Jets on the field. New York wants to pound the football if at all possible and isn't, ahem, great at throwing the ball forward. It's just the reality of this Justin Fields-led offense. Unfortunately for the Jets, the one thing they really want to do is what the Patriots are really good at stopping.Mike Vrabel's defense is first in the NFL in rushing yards per game allowed and top five in yards per carry allowed, although if you're looking for a sliver of hope for the Jets rush offense, the Pats are allowing 4.8 yards per rush over their last three. If the Jets can run the ball, it's a different ball game, because if they can't and Fields is forced to throw, it could get seriously ugly for New York. Defensively, it's hard to see New York stopping New England. The terrible Browns defense was fine enough against the Jets last week. New York just got aided by multiple special teams touchdowns en route to the team's second straight win. The Jets will need more luck to pull out a massive upset Thursday and I just don't see the Pats making a bunch of mistakes. Drake Maye and TreVeyon Henderson should carve up this defense and the Pats can park the bus in the second half and run the ball, hoping Henderson pops off a couple more long runs like he did to close things out against Tampa Bay. Give me the Pats by 20+. You can bet on the Patriots to cover the spread at BetMGM, where new users get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if their first bet doesn't win:Jets vs. Patriots player propsTreVeyon Henderson longest rush Over 14.5 yardsHenderson became the \"full-time starter\" three games ago (we're qualifying it a bit since the Patriots clearly like to limit his touches -- he's not a full-blown workhorse). He's had 38 carries for 277 yards in those games, good for a 7.3 yards per carry average.Last week against the Bucs, one of the best rushing defenses in the NFL over the past decade, Henderson averaged 10.5 yards per carry. He's not going to always be that efficient, but he's a big-play threat who takes a minimal number of carries for huge numbers, a la early career De'Von Achane. The Jets rank 21st in yards per rush allowed (4.5) and are even worse over their last three games (5.1 yards per carry allowed). This number is a full 2 yards lower than the rest of the market, so we're jumping all over it. With Rhamondre Stevenson out, Henderson is a lock to get around 20 total touches and I'd expect he gets 14+ carries for the third straight week unless this thing is completely out of hand by halftime. And if it is, Henderson probably broke off a long run already.  Mack Hollins Over 37.5 receiving yardsThis number is starting to tick up and might move closer to 40 by the time the game kicks off. Hollins isn't some special receiver, but you know what he's good at? Blocking as a receiver. And you know what that gets him in a game where the Pats would love to run the ball a bunch? Tons of snaps.Hollins played 79% of the snaps in Week 10, the most of any Patriots wide receiver. He and Drake Maye didn't play together at Carolina, but maybe there's a little UNC locker room love: the former Tar Heel connected with his fellow alumni for six catches (on 10 targets) and 106 yards last week.A whopping 54 of those came on one play, but Hollins is a deep threat who will get some looks dialed up his way. If he's seeing 75% or more of the snaps, I want in on anything below 40 total receiving yards.Justin Fields longest completion Under 26.5 yardsThere are almost zero passing props available for Jets quarterbacks right now because, technically, Aaron Glenn hasn't said who is going to start for New York.We all assume it's going to be Justin Fields, but there's a very real possibility he surprises everyone with Tyrod Taylor under center tonight to begin the game.At the very least, we know Fields is on a short leash this evening. And, in an ideal world for this prop, Fields starts and then gets benched or doesn't start but gets used in some rushing packages.Fields has four games this season with fewer than 54 passing yards, making this prop way too long against a good defense. We have multiple outs here and I'm quite frankly a little surprised to see this still sitting out there as of Thursday morning. TNF anytime touchdown scorer propsHunter Henry +135We have a game total of 43.5 that looks like it wants to come down and the possibility of a blowout (leading to minimal Patriots passes) so we have to be a little careful with these anytime touchdown scorer bets, especially when it comes to the New England pass catchers. Without Stevenson and with Terrell Jennings banged up, I could see New England deciding to throw a little more down by the goal line instead of just pounding Henderson here. Hunter is in the top 10 in the NFL in targets inside the 10-yard line and presents a major matchup problem for a Jets defense that has allowed the second-most touchdowns to tight ends this season. D'Ernest Johnson +425This is a major longshot here, not just because Johnson is north of 4-1 to score, but because he's not currently on the Patriots active roster! After playing six snaps for New England last week against Tampa, Johnson was sent back to the practice squad. But there's a decent chance he's elevated to the active roster at some point today with Jennings questionable. With the Patriots expecting to run the ball a bunch against a bad Jets defense with a lead, we'd love to have a longer number on a running back who could see garbage time carries for New England. If Jennings is ruled out (and that won't be until much later on Thursday) and Johnson is elevated, this number would drop below 3-1 in my opinion. So we're jumping on it now, knowing if Johnson doesn't play or isn't elevated, the bet would void anyway.\n            ",

Meanwhile, the Patriots are rolling with Drake May establishing himself as an NFL MVP frontrunner.

The Over hits in 71% of the model's simulations. Back the Over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Alabama -3.5 vs. Purdue (-110)Purdue has arguably the best player in college basketball (Braden Smith) and is off to a 2-0 start, but failed to cover the spread in both of its first two games against inferior opponents. Alabama, on the other hand, is coming off an impressive 103-96 win over St. John's at Madison Square Garden as 4.5-point underdogs and Coleman Coliseum should be rocking for this top-10 matchup. The Crimson Tide cover in 61% of the model's simulations. Back Alabama at FanDuel Sportsbook:Red Wings money line vs. Ducks (-130)\"Anaheim is light years better than expected but also perhaps a bit of a flat spot after coming up small Tuesday in a big game at Colorado. The Ducks lost 4-1 to see a seven-game winning streak snapped. When a team's long winning streak ends, it often goes into a mini-slump. In that run was a 5-2 home win over the Wings, who surely will remember that tonight,\" SportsLine NHL handicapper Matt Severance said. \"Detroit has lost three straight but not played since Sunday and had two 'good' practices this week, so they say. The Wings are healthy, too. Sounds like we may get Anaheim backup goalie Petr Mrazek, a one-time Red Wing who is 3-0 despite a 4.56 GAA.\" Back Detroit at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college basketball, NHL and NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Thursday.

    "body": "\n        The AFC East rivalry of Patriots vs. Jets kicks off NFL Week 11 on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET, with the rosters differing in appeal with NFL DFS picks. The Pats, who are favored by 12.5 points, offer the likes of MVP contender Drake Maye, standout rookie TreVeyon Henderson and four-time Pro Bowler Stefon Diggs as options for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, the Jets have the 28th ranked total offense and will be without receiver Garrett Wilson (knee). However, Wilson's absence should allow other wideouts to emerge for an offense centered around Breece Hall, which could provide NFL DFS sleepers that you can get at a discount of a price.Justin Fields will have to throw it to someone downfield as with New England having the league's No. 1 run defense, through the air may be New York's preferred option to move the ball. Which under-the-radar players could be a part of your NFL DFS strategy, and what other daily Fantasy football advice should you heed for 'Thursday Night Football'?

After being held out of the end zone over the first seven games, Hall has three touchdowns, in addition to 272 scrimmage yards, over his last two games. He also has an impressive history versus New England, averaging 120.7 total yards, with two total touchdowns, over his last three matchups with the Patriots. While New England is strong versus the run, it is susceptible to pass-catching RBs, which Hall certainly is, as no team has allowed more catches to running backs in 2025 than the Pats. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson after the rookie went for 150 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns versus what was a top-10 run defense last week with Tampa. He won't see a top-10 run defense on TNF as New York ranks 25th versus the ground game and has allowed 158-plus rushing yards in back-to-back games. Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) has missed the last two games and has already been ruled out for Thursday, paving the way for Henderson to see the bulk of touches. All but one starting running back this year has had at least 85 yards or a touchdown versus the Jets, who have allowed three running back TDs over the last two weeks. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        For the first time since Tom Brady took his perfectly manicured hair and tight spirals to Tampa Bay, the New England Patriots are relevant.After going 4-13 in each of the last two seasons, they are 8-2 this year. They share the best record in the NFL with the Broncos and Colts and own a 1½-game lead in the AFC East over the Bills, who have won the division five years in a row. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye has emerged as a legitimate MVP candidate, joining the Rams' Matthew Stafford atop the odds board of top sportsbooks. And so, New England is playing meaningful games deep into November. That includes the Thursday Night Football game at Gillette Stadium against the New York Jets in Week 11.Bet Jets vs. Patriots at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:According to SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and Projection Model, the Patriots cannot afford a loss on Thursday if they hope to earn the coveted No. 1 seed in the AFC playoff bracket. Though New England, Denver and Indianapolis are tied at 8-2, the model gives a slight edge to the Patriots to earn the top seed (as well as the home-field advantage and bye week that goes with it). The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, projects them to finish with 12.1 wins, slightly more than the Broncos (12.0) and Colts (11.9).If New England loses to the Jets, Maye & Co. go from the model's favorite to earn the No. 1 seed in the AFC to a dogfight with the Bills just to win the AFC East.Entering Week 11With Week 11 winWith Week 11 lossPatriots' chance to win division78.2%80.8%59.4%One of the reasons the model is high on the Patriots is the schedule. They have only one game remaining against a team with a winning record, Buffalo (6-3), a rival New England already beat in Week 5. According to the model, the Patriots have the second easiest remaining strength of schedule (42.3%) in the league; only the Saints (38.9%) have an easier one down the stretch.But New England players and coaches say they're not taking any opponents lightly, beginning with the Jets (2-7), who have won two in a row after losing their first seven games.\"I saw energy [from New York]. I saw excitement that jumped off the screen. This will be a challenge,\" head coach Mike Vrabel said.\"They're a good team. They're going to come in here with the right mindset. They got a lot to prove. They can continue to try to prove it,\" receiver Stefon Diggs said.Said Maye, \"They're going to be a tough challenge.\"New England is a 12.5-point favorite against New York.\nYou can bet Jets vs. Patriots at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The Jets—who famously shipped out their two best defensive players, Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams, at the trade deadline—have a lot on the line also on Thursday, but in a different way. According to the model New York enters Week 11 with a 19.4% chance to earn the No. 1 overall pick in next year's NFL Draft and a 52.4% chance for a top-three pick. Only the 1-8 Titans (53.3% and 83.6%, respectively) have a higher chance.An upset win on Thursday night would obviously affect those odds, but coach Aaron Glenn is not looking at the game that way.\"We just want to win,\" he said. \"And the more you win, the more confident you get as a player, the more confident you get as a team. And that's the only thing that we care about.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Two years ago, Maryland hosted Indiana on a beautiful late September day where everything seemed to be working for the Terrapins.Mike Locksley's Terps crushed Indiana, 44-17, to go 5-0 on the season and all but end the Tom Allen era in Bloomington. Quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa was terrific, throwing for 352 yards and five touchdowns to lead a Maryland offense that looked unstoppable. As Indiana made its first return trip to College Park last month since that loss, a lot has changed in college football. With schools now allowed to spend up to $20.5 million in direct payments to athletes under the House settlement, there appears to be more parity than ever. Sure, the usual blue bloods like Ohio State, Alabama and Georgia are still atop the rankings, but it has opened up a path for non-traditional programs -- like Indiana. The Hoosiers this time blasted Maryland, 55-10, in front of a sell-out crowd inside SECU Stadium. Two years earlier, Maryland fans were dreaming big about what a 5-0 season could portend; now they were chanting for Maryland coach Mike Locksley's firing.\nIndiana is the best example yet of what's possible in this new world. The Hoosiers are currently ranked No. 2 in the College Football Playoff Rankings and are on pace to get a first-round bye. Indiana coach Curt Cignetti is a remarkable 21-2 in only two seasons. What Cignetti has done at Indiana is both a blessing and a curse for programs everywhere, especially like-minded ones such as Maryland, which carry basketball-school monikers but recognize football is the financial engine that pays for everything. If Indiana and Cignetti can do it so quickly, why can't we? Maryland's new athletics brain trust wants a little more runway than Cignetti's remarkable two-year turnaround but has similar lofty goals of what's capable at a school frequently referred to as a sleeping giant. \n\"If we're good with a three-year plan, which is what I'm working with, then I think we're in the top tier of the Big Ten within three years in football,\" Maryland AD Jim Smith told CBS Sports two weeks ago.The big question: How?The new man with the new, inspired planMaryland's new AD had previously been SVP of business strategy for the Atlanta Braves. \n                                                                    Maryland Athletics\n                                                            Jim Smith is everywhere on Maryland's campus, documenting it all along the way on his Instagram account. In just the last two weeks, there are photos with Terps legends like former basketball coach Gary Williams, ESPN personality Scott Van Pelt and former football player Domonique Foxworth. Smith is the energetic and charismatic leader of a new-look Maryland athletics department, hoping to elevate the Terrapins to the next level. The first-time athletic director, who arrived on campus in July, is part of a new infusion of those from the professional ranks seeking to modernize a college sports industry where money has never been more paramount. For a school that has long lagged behind its peers in that department, Smith was hired to be a rainmaker. \nBefore Maryland, he worked as senior vice president of business strategy for the Atlanta Braves. But over the years Smith has been everything from the president of the MLS team Columbus Crew to the president of the Ohio State alumni association to a former WWF executive under Vince McMahon. He took the job after Damon Evans, who was AD from 2017 to 2025, left in March for SMU. Surrounding Smith are new hires of senior deputy athletic director Diana Sabau and deputy athletic director and chief revenue officer Joe LaBue. Sabau, who most recently was Utah State's athletic director, has known Smith for decades. Sabau is an experienced college sports executive, having also served as Gene Smith's deputy at Ohio State and as the Big Ten's deputy commissioner. LaBue's background is similar to Smith's, having most recently served as president of Charlotte FC. He's worked primarily in professional sports, including stints with the Carolina Panthers and then-Washington Redskins. He knows the unique terrain of the job as a Maryland alumnus. The triumvirate is only a few months on the job but is earnestly trying to wake up a Maryland football fanbase and get more people out to the games. They created Terpsville Fan Fest, a family friendly fan activation featuring face painting, inflatables and other activities that lets fans into the state-of-the-art Jones-Hill Field House before games. They've worked to improve parking, concession opportunities like Octoberfest offerings for a home game against Washington and unique souvenirs like a limited-edition Yeti tumbler sold against Indiana for homecoming. \nThe measures are working, but they haven't been easy. A 4-0 start to the season imploding into a 4-5 season dampens fan enthusiasm -- a long-standing problem for Maryland, even on the best days. An oft-repeated issue is that Maryland is between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. While it may be great for alums looking for jobs in major cities, it puts Maryland up against the Baltimore Ravens, Baltimore Orioles, Washington Commanders, Washington Capitals, Washington Nationals and Washington Wizards for fan attention and money. It has been a real challenge for the school to navigate in the past -- and an easy excuse for previous administrators -- on why Maryland couldn't get more fans out to a Saturday game. Call it knowledge or optimism, but Maryland's new leaders are all in lockstep that those professional teams don't have to be as significant an impediment as they've been made out to be in the past. From Smith on down, the mentality has shifted to say-yes-then-find-a-way. It's what has already made Smith and his new team popular with Maryland fans. \"I've heard too many times in two months here we're a college sports program in a pro sports town,\" LaBue said. \"To me, the value prop we have is just as strong, if not stronger, than any of the pro sports teams in the area, and the area is big enough and diverse enough to support all of us.\"\nFor Smith, who has spent most of the last two decades in a pro sports town in Atlanta, there are actually advantages to knowing the Commanders and Ravens have rabid fanbases. You don't have to convince people to enjoy football; you know they are all out there. \"What I've learned is 14 million people live within 100 miles of College Park,\" the Maryland AD said. \"When you start talking specifically about football and how far people will travel, that is a huge number of potential fans to develop. There really isn't a lot of competition for Division I football in that radius, so it gives us, what I believe, is a strategic advantage.\"The upside is high. There's plenty of state pride in Maryland -- ask any Marylander about the state flag -- but the key is getting more to embrace the flagship state university. That includes an undergraduate enrollment of more than roughly 30,000 students and more than 420,000 living alumni. Right now, that is about getting them to show up to games. More fans not only equals more short-term revenue but can also help Maryland better position itself with potential corporate partners and advertisers in a competitive market. The revenue potential on ticket sales alone could be huge. \nEven if Maryland had outsized demand, its stadium capacity of 51,802 is going to hold it back compared to the 100,000-plus stadiums at Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State. But the gulf between the top tier of the Big Ten and Maryland is massive -- far more than double. Maryland made $14.83 million off ticket sales in 2024, according to Knight-Newhouse data, while Michigan and Ohio State both crossed the $58 million mark. It is a reminder of Maryland's life in the Big Ten that even if it boasts healthy enrollment numbers and a wide swath of living alumni, it is disadvantaged against the rest of the conference when it comes to the most basic of all scholastic numbers. In the Big Ten, only Iowa, USC, Oregon and Northwestern had fewer undergraduate students on their main campuses, according to fall 2024 numbers. At the top is Ohio State with more than 45,000 undergraduates enrolled. Maryland boasts healthy enrollment numbers in a vacuum, but it lags behind other Big Ten universities.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The new Maryland mindset, though, is not bemoaning what you don't have but capitalizing on what you do. That is why people like LaBue and chief development officer Kirby Mills, another alumnus, are devoting so much time and energy to engaging fans and trying to get them in the building. As the former vice president of ticket sales for the Panthers, LaBue is using every skill he has to make it happen. \n\"There's no room for failure,\" he said. \"Being status quo is not OK. We've never operated that way. I think Jim's seen me a couple times the last last two months, and he's like, 'Dude, you look like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.' I said, 'Jim, I'm sorry, it's the only way I know how to operate.\" What everyone knows, too, is that the better the product, the easier an ask that is. The challenge, as the Terps' new brain trust has quickly realized, is that Maryland football fans are accustomed to being disappointed just when they get their hopes up. It's a real-life embodiment of Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown. It's evident in the differences between \"September Maryland\" and \"October Maryland.\" The Terrapins went undefeated (4-0) in September and are 18-3 in September games since 2021. In that same time period, Maryland is 5-12 in October games. After the loss to Indiana, Maryland now has the fourth-longest losing streak to ranked conference opponents in college football history, dating back all the way to 2011. \nSabau says it hurts her heart that when people talk about October Maryland, they aren't talking about great weather and beautiful fall foliage but the football program's on-field struggles. She, like her peers within the department, knows they have to find a way to get Maryland fans to believe in the vision. \"I think it's like shedding that scar tissue, which is a lot easier said than done, and really believing,\" Sabau said. \"You have to believe every time we start a game ... that we have the ability and we have the resources to win. Whether that's trusting our head coaches or trusting the talent they've recruited and brought in, we have to believe. If we don't believe it, then we're really going to have a lot heavier lift.\"The looming question, growing bigger with every on-field loss, is whether there is still belief in the current football leadership to do it. \nHow much does Maryland need to spend on football?At the very top of the evaluation of what Maryland football should and can be is the resources question. Is Maryland spending enough, both institutionally and as a fanbase, to make football successful?When looking at Indiana, there are different ways to assess its success. You can highlight that the Hoosiers hired a man who appears to be a transcendentally talented football coach, Cignetti, who has elevated the program beyond even its fans' wildest dreams. Or you can focus on Indiana deciding it wanted to improve in football, significantly increasing its financial investment and giving Cignetti the resources he needed to succeed. \"Indiana started a plan about four years ago,\" Smith said. \"They started investing in football a while ago and then they got Curt and then it skyrocketed. It wasn't hire a coach and everything's going to be OK. Put all the things in place to be successful and that's what they've done.\"What is striking about Indiana is how far it has come in just a few years. In 2021, Indiana had the fourth-lowest total in Big Ten football spending at $23,938,827. That number jumped to nearly $32 million in 2022, $34 million in 2023, and then a massive leap to $61.58 million in 2024, the first year of Cignetti. Maryland had its significant jump from 2021 ($20.49 million) to 2022 ($30.8 million), but is still well below the top of the conference. Erstwhile basketball school Indiana is spending 157% more than what it did in 2021; Maryland is spending 30% more.  \n                                                                    CoPilot\n                                                            Of the Big Ten's 16 public universities (excluding USC, Northwestern), only Purdue ($31.38 million) spent less than Maryland ($37 million) on football in 2024, according to the Knight-Newhouse database. The average total football spend of the 16 schools was $58,207,106.30. If you bundled the old \"Big Ten East\" teams together, Maryland spent less on football in 2024 then all of them. Rutgers, which joined the Big Ten concurrently with Maryland, spent $64.4 million on football -- nearly double. Indiana's increased spending not only attracted Cignetti but it allowed him to bring his James Madison staff with him. And after a wildly successful first season in which rival programs tried to poach defensive coordinator Bryant Haines and strength and conditioning coach Derek Ownings, Cignetti had the money to keep them. That 2024 season even got billionaire Mark Cuban, an Indiana alumnus but long a reluctant sports donor, to invest significant money to keep the Hoosiers' good football fortune going. For Maryland, that support has long come from Under Armour founder Kevin Plank. The athletic apparel company executive chairman has donated significantly to his alma mater over the years, including a $25 million gift for the Jones-Hill Field House. He's at a very different stage of his career and life than Nike co-founder Phil Knight, but what Knight has meant for Oregon football, especially in the NIL era, shows the outsized impact one individual can have. At minimum, Plank's Baltimore-based Under Armour company recognizes the value of Maryland athletics to the state. Maryland's new leaders are actively working to come up with ways to maximize the potential for both parties. \"I know that Kevin Plank has been the best partner to this institution, to athletics, and he really deeply believes in the success of Michael Locksley and the football program,\" Sabau said. The Mike Locksley conundrumLocksley is popular with players, but a losing spell has fans frustrated.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Ahead of what was an eventual loss to Indiana, Locksley was still optimistic about Maryland football's future under his stewardship. In his spacious office inside Jones-Hill Field House, surrounded by reminders of a successful football life, Locksley laid out what Maryland had been and what it could still become. He wasn't any happier about the losing streak than any frustrated Maryland fan was, but he still saw a young team making progress. He likened it to a turtle slowly pressing forward to win the race. The three consecutive last-minute losses to Washington, Nebraska and UCLA were heartbreaking in many ways, but Locksley, a disciple of Nick Saban's process-oriented approach, still saw a team doing a lot of the things good teams do to be successful. Before the loss to Indiana, Maryland even led the country in turnover margin. Locksley believed, though, that more financial resources were necessary if Maryland wanted to be part of the neighborhood in which Indiana now resided. Maryland has long been stuck in the middle, a Power Four program with plenty more resources than Group of Five schools but less than many of its power peers. That has only been amplified in the NIL era where Maryland has lagged far behind the top of the sport. Lockley would point to a spending gap to partially explain an 8-13 record beginning in 2024.  \n                                                                    CoPilot\n                                                            In his first meeting with Smith, the Maryland football coach told his new boss he needed \"recovery modalities\" for a team he knew was going to be short on depth. \"We have been and had been resourced to go to bowl games every year,\" Locksley told CBS Sports. \"Right now, we have enough resources that we should go to bowl games every year. That's not my goal anymore. My goal is to try to get into the playoff and try to compete for Big Ten championships. Being resourced to go to bowls and being resourced to win championships and take that next step are different resources.\"Locksley inherited a difficult job when he took over in 2019, taking over a football program still grappling with the tragedy of football player Jordan McNair's death. The first two seasons, which included the COVID-19-impacted 2020 year, were incredibly challenging, but he found his stride in 2021. For three consecutive seasons, Locksley won at least seven games, won a bowl game and had Maryland football on an upward trajectory. He developed and produced multiple NFL players including first-round pick Deonte Banks. Locksley raised the bar and made Maryland football respectable again. Then came a step back in 2024 with a 4-8 record that prompted Locksley to do a staff and roster overhaul, bringing in six new full-time coaches including offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton and defensive coordinator Ted Monachino and 64 new players. The Terps got off to a hot start but are now 4-5 with a trip to Illinois on deck. Optimistic fans would say Maryland could easily be 7-2 after losing three games by a combined 10 points. In that scenario the conversation would be around extensions and raises for Locksley rather than whether he'll be the coach next season. That's how close the margins can be in this era when James Franklin can coach Penn State in a College Football Playoff national semifinal and still be fired 10 months later. Locksley knows the reality of the life he's signed up for in college football. In a conversation with CBS Sports two weeks ago, he expressed his belief he was doing everything he could to make Maryland football successful. \"If it isn't good enough, I've done my best,\" Locksley said. \"That's the part of me for as a coach finally I'm OK with I've done my best, I'm doing my best, I will continue to do as much as I can to figure it out.\"The new boss, Smith, has preached patience. He knows that isn't necessarily what fans want to hear, but the pragmatic AD was hired to be different and that includes not being in a rush to follow his peers in doling out an eight-figure buyout. He told The Baltimore Sun earlier this week that Locksley would, at minimum, finish out the season and evaluations would come afterward. In a message to CBS Sports on Wednesday, Smith said, \"This is a process and I am confident in Locks, our coaches and the young team we have as we enter the last quarter of the season.\" The glass half-full look at Maryland focuses on a young talent base of freshman quarterback Malik Washington and defensive players Sidney Stewart and Zahir Mathis. The nation's No. 3 overall recruit Zion Elee is committed for next season. If Elee, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound defensive end from St. Frances Academy, signs with the Terrapins next month, he'd be the highest ranked football signee ever. \nLocksley has long been the pied piper of D.C.-area recruiting,  and the fear is that not only would those players hit the transfer portal if Locks was fired but that any replacement could have difficulty replicating his recruiting success. The flip side is that the countless hours spent trying to get Maryland fans invested again in football would be for naught if fans don't believe in the product. It's hard to convince fans Maryland will be in the top tier of the Big Ten in the next three years if the Terps are coming off back-to-back eight-loss seasons. It's what makes the next three-game stretch so critical not only for Locksley, but for the entire department. Maryland is desperately trying to get a fanbase to buy back in, but needs to reward its fans. A road loss to Rutgers last Saturday, in which Maryland gave up 35 points and 485 offensive yards, was a significant blow to the Terps' bowl hopes. Now, Maryland must find two wins against Illinois, Michigan and Michigan State to not only go bowling but to potentially save Locksley's job. Fan frustration is high after the Rutgers loss, but there are those around the program that believe with increased financial investment, Maryland could not only retain its talented young nucleus but surround players like Washington with more talent. It would also allow for Maryland to avoid wading into what has quickly turned into a wild coaching cycle. If Maryland were to fire Locksley, which would come with a more than $13 million buyout, it'd compete in a market that already includes Auburn, Florida, LSU, Penn State, Arkansas, UCLA and Virginia Tech. Clearing out the coaching staff comes with more millions, and that's before you even factor in a new hire who could command more than Locksley's $6.1 million annual salary. At football-rabid SEC schools, there are big boosters eager and willing to stroke huge checks to dump a struggling failing coach. In some ways, the job of the AD of those kinds of schools is to calm down the booster base to hold on to their money. Maryland is different. The school has some big boosters, but they are largely hands-off and generally unwilling to kick in millions to pay for a big buyout. A $13 million buyout might feel paltry compared to the $54 million LSU is currently on the hook for with Brian Kelly, but it isn't easily raised at Maryland. It puts Smith and his new brain trust in a tricky spot just months into their tenure. The rank-and-file Maryland fans may want Locksley gone, but the big money hasn't followed yet, sources told CBS Sports. There is talent on the roster to be excited about, but Smith must decide whether the current coaching staff is maximizing it. It all adds up to Maryland being at another inflection point. Maryland desperately wants to follow in the footsteps of Indiana and others to become more than it has historically been. Does that mean pouring more money into the football program? Hiring a new coach and hoping for better results? Both?The path Smith and his team choose over the coming months could forever change the trajectory of Maryland football. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout the offseason the CBS Sports MLB   experts will bring you a                              weekly Batting Around roundtable, breaking        down      pretty       much           anything.    The latest  news, a      historical      question,         thoughts    about        the future  of         baseball,   all   sorts of   stuff. Last week we debated the Dodgers and the dynasty talk. This week we're going to tackle the offseason's No. 1 free agent.Which team most needs to sign Kyle Tucker?Matt Snyder: They won't sign him, but I'm going with the Cubs here. They won 92 games  last season, but lost the division by five games to the Brewers after  going 35-31 in the second half. The offense struggled mightily in the  second half and a lot of that was due to Tucker's struggles and  injuries. When he was right, though, they were an offensive juggernaut.  More than anything, the Cubs need to show that they are willing  to flex their financial might. They did not rank in the top 10 in  payroll last season and projections have them around 14th heading into  next year right now. This is unacceptable, especially watching the way  the Dodgers have balanced player development with mega-market spending.  Bringing Tucker back on a monster contract sends signals that Cubs  ownership is done operating as a middle-market team. Again, though, this won't happen. R.J. Anderson: I'll say the Phillies. They received terrible corner-outfield play last  season and they could lose a key member or two of their lineup this  offseason, depending on what happens with Kyle Schwarber and J.T.  Realmuto's free agency. Add in how Bryce Harper and Trea Turner are now  nearing their mid-30s and the Phillies could really benefit from adding  a younger, dynamic outfield talent to the roster.  \nDayn Perry: I have to agree with the Phillies. As noted, corner  outfield production is a serious need and it's not hard to squint and  see the Phillies' championship window closing in the next season or two  without a splash long-term addition like this one. As well, that Philly  lineup has some soft spots in it that Tucker would address directly. I  don't expect this will happen, but it would be a wise move for Dave  Dombrowski and the Phils as they try to run down the belt and the title  in 2026. Mike Axisa: I was going to say the Phillies as well, so for the sake of variety, I'll go with the Yankees. They have a lot of offense potentially walking out the door in Cody Bellinger and Trent Grisham, and even if they re-sign those two, I don't think you can expect them to do that again. The 2025 season was close to best case scenario for both guys. The Yankees need a big bat and Tucker fits very well given his contact skills and Yankee Stadium-friendly lefty pull power. \nAlso, Aaron Judge will turn 34 in April. How much longer will he be the best hitter in the world? Tucker, who will turn only 29 in January, would give New York a lineup anchor once Judge enters his decline phase. The Yankees are at a place on the win curve where every win they add to roster increases their 2026 AL East/Wild Card Series bye odds significantly. Tucker is a difference-maker in the short-term and a needed lineup centerpiece long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're 10 weeks into the NFL season. More than half the league is likely still considering potential playoff scenarios or even planning for the Super Bowl. There are 20 teams with four or more wins, and all of them are within a game or two of the playoff picture, so they should still be thinking about that.Then there are the 12 other teams. They have three or fewer wins and they're probably thinking more about the future than they are about the present. So that's what we're going to do, too. We're going to take those 12 teams with three or fewer wins and rank their future prospects, considering both the short term (next season) and the long (the next 3-5 years). We're separating these 12 teams into three tiers: A long way away (the worst teams); Need something fresh (the middle of the pack); and Closer than you think (self-explanatory). Without further ado...A long way away12. Las Vegas Raiders11. New Orleans Saints10. Cleveland Browns9. New York Jets8. Tennessee Titans\nThese are teams that are almost entirely bereft of talent, either by design or by circumstance. We have the Raiders last because they basically have two players (Brock Bowers and Maxx Crosby) who are worth building around and not much else. They seem to be considering abandoning their new coaching staff after just one year. And their quarterback situation with Geno Smith is looking like a nightmare. The Saints also lack talent, but they at least have more clarity about their quarterback situation: they need to go out and find a new one. The same is true of the Jets and Browns. And they're all in the mix for top-five draft picks. We have the Saints, Browns and Jets ahead of the Raiders due to the financial and coaching situations, which seem preferable to where Vegas is at right now. New York and Cleveland are ahead of New Orleans here because of the draft-pick situations, where they each have multiple first-round picks coming their way via trade, in addition to their own selections.  \nThe Titans look like possibly the worst of these teams right now, but it's better to know who your potential quarterback of the future is rather than having to go find one. Cam Ward has struggled for a lot of this season in a horrendous situation, but he's also put some throws on tape that exemplify why he went No. 1 in the first place. Maybe it doesn't work out and Tennessee drops back further, but all of these other teams still need to go looking for something. Need something fresh7. Miami Dolphins6. Arizona Cardinals5. Atlanta Falcons4. New York Giants3. Washington CommandersThe Dolphins already fired their general manager and are clearly in need of a reboot of some sort, whether it be a top-to-bottom overhaul, including a new coaching staff, or just a revamp of the defense. They also might need to think about a new quarterback if Tua Tagovailoa doesn't play much better down the stretch of the season. But they still have guys like DeVon Achane, Jaylen Waddle and more, so there's not nothing to build around here. \nThe Cardinals already have a pretty solid defense. They have some offensive skill guys who can make plays. It seems like they need to (and are going to) make a change under center, and if they land on the right guy, they could make a move into a higher tier and find their way into the back end of the playoff picture by next season. Atlanta's defense has been quite good at times this season, and it seems like the Falcons have finally found a couple of good pass rushers in the draft. They also have Bijan Robinson and Drake London around whom to build things on offense. But there are questions about what they have in Michael Penix Jr. and they're out a first-round pick next year, so we're keeping them behind New York and Washington here.Jaxson Dart and Jayden Daniels have both flashed some high-end ability, with Daniels reaching the higher heights as a rookie. New York has more to build around elsewhere on the roster (Dexter Lawrence, Andrew Thomas, Malik Nabers, Cam Skattebo, Brian Burns, Abdul Carter). However, we will still lean toward the more talented quarterback, who produced at an even higher level, when it comes to adjudicating which team has a brighter future -- especially when both appear to be equally significant potential injury risks. Plus, the Giants still need to bring in a new coaching staff and we don't know how that will go.\nCloser than you think2. Dallas Cowboys1. Cincinnati BengalsThese two teams are essentially a legitimate defense away from being real playoff teams. They have two of the most explosive offenses in the NFL, and still can't manage to win games because they simply can't stop anybody. If either one of them can figure out a way to level up defensively, they could quickly make a move up their standings in their respective conferences. Maybe not all the way to the top, but certainly into the playoff picture. All it would take is competency -- not even necessarily getting to above average. Dallas is probably closer to achieving that than is Cincinnati, but the certainty of the Joe Burrow-Ja'Marr Chase-Tee Higgins trio sticking together nudges the Bengals ahead of the Cowboys because a) Dak Prescott is older and presumably closer to age-related decline than is Burrow; and b) we don't know whether or how long George Pickens will be sticking around. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Julian Sayin may currently be one of college football's best players, Ohio State defensive coordinator Matt Patricia is also comparing the redshirt freshman quarterback to one of the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. Patricia, a longtime NFL coach who won three Super Bowls with the Patriots, said that Sayin reminds him of a fellow Big Ten quarterback who went onto enjoy a Hall of Fame NFL career. \"Very efficient, really good leader, smart with the football,\" Patricia said of Sayin on the Downs 2 Business podcast. \"He's doing a good job of getting the ball out to those guys, too. So maybe that's a young Drew Brees. Maybe that's where we're headed with it.\" From a numbers standpoint, Patricia's comparison holds up. During his three seasons as a starter at Purdue, Brees led the Big Ten in completions three times and in completion percentage on two occasions. In his first year as Ohio State's starting quarterback, Sayin is currently pacing the Big Ten in completions and completion percentage. \nSayin, who has completed a staggering 80.9% of his passes this season, is on pace to set a new NCAA single-season record for completion percentage. Both quarterbacks parlayed their individual success into team success. During his senior season (2000), Brees led the Boilermakers to a share of the Big Ten title and the school's first trip to the Rose Bowl in 34 years. In fact, it was a 64-yard, game-winning touchdown pass from Brees against the Buckeyes that season that spearheaded Purdue's conference championship. It also contributed to the end of John Cooper's long and largely successful run as the Buckeyes' coach. \nThis season, Sayin has helped the defending national champions get off to a 9-0 start entering Saturday night's home game against UCLA. Last week, against Brees' alma mater, Sayin completed a whopping 81.8% of his throws for 303 yards with a touchdown and an interception while helping lead the Buckeyes to a 34-10 win. \nIn addition to pursuing a national title, Sayin also has a chance to win the Heisman Trophy, an award that alluded Brees during his time at Purdue. If he is able to do so, Sayin would join Troy Smith (2006) as the only pure Ohio State quarterbacks to win college football's ultimate individual honor. \n            ",

Alabama is No. 9. So the Boilermakers are the higher-ranked team -- both here and in the AP poll. But they're still listed as 3.5-point underdogs against the Crimson Tide, largely because the game will be played in front of a capacity crowd inside Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa.\"It's gonna be a tough game,\" said Purdue's Matt Painter, the five-time Big Ten Coach of the Year. \"We're looking forward to it.\"Among the other things Purdue is looking forward to is the return of Trey Kaufman-Renn. The preseason All-American missed the Boilermakers' first two games with what's been described as a hip pointer and back soreness. But Kaufman-Renn is expected to be in uniform and available when Purdue attempts to upset Alabama on the road the same way Alabama just upset St. John's on the road. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 20.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 30.8 minutes per contest last season, getting 26 points and eight boards in November's 87-78 victory over Alabama.\n\"He is a big part of the core of our team,\" Painter said.

    "body": "\n        It's November. The sun is going down earlier, the clouds are more prominent, and this week, there was suddenly a few inches of snow dumped on the ground where I live, north of Chicago. As if seasonal affective disorder isn't enough to get me feeling down, there was also what happened in The Six Pack last week.It was another 3-3 week, but it was one in which it felt like I had my heart ripped out. Oregon and Iowa both had red zone turnovers in a game that finished with 34 points when we needed 41 to hit our over. Oregon State outgained Sam Houston State 474 yards to 157, yet somehow found a way to not only cover the spread but also lose the game outright. Then there was Auburn, our Upset of the Week. The Tigers led Vanderbilt 20-10 at halftime, and held a 30-24 lead after the third quarter. They lost in overtime.It's enough to make me wonder if The Six Pack is cursed this year. No matter what we do, we're going 3-3. There's no escaping it. Don't worry, I'm not letting it impact my picks for this week (though maybe I should because positivity sure hasn't worked), even if it feels that way when you see my picks. We're not picking a bunch of unders because we're sad and want the world to be sad with us. We're picking them for the same reason we make every pick here: we like the chances of it winning.\nGames of the Week\nNo. 11 Oklahoma at No. 4 Alabama: This feels like a must-win situation for Oklahoma to keep its playoff hopes alive, and going on the road to face Alabama is not the kind of must-win situation anybody should be excited about. Even if you did go on the road to beat Tennessee the last time out. There was a lot of hype about John Mateer's transfer to Oklahoma in the offseason, and early in the year, he lived up to it. Then SEC play began, and, well, you don't hear much about John Mateer's Heisman chances anymore, do you?John MateerPassing efficiencyCompletion RateYards per attemptTotal TDINTNonconference153.167.6%9.093Conference115.261.3%6.354If Oklahoma is to pull off the upset here, they'll need Mateer to be at his Mateer-est. He'll need to hit big throws and do the kind of scramble-y things that many QBs have done against Alabama in the past to pull off those upsets. However, I don't know that he can. My gut instinct here is that the Oklahoma offense will struggle to move the ball consistently and put points on the board unless Alabama makes mistakes.That does not mean I expect Alabama to run away with this one, though. Quite the contrary. The Alabama offense is one-handed. The Tide can't run the ball at all and has been overly reliant on Ty Simpson and the passing attack to be successful on offense. The unit has been successful enough, as Alabama is 8-1 on the season. But have you noticed how the Tide offense has scored 30 points or more in only two of its six conference games? Both came at home against Tennessee and Vanderbilt, and Oklahoma's defense is a bit better than both. So it's hard for me to predict the Tide run away with this one, even if it is possible. All of which makes me think if Alabama wins by multiple scores, it's more likely to be a 24-10 result than a 34-23 kind of game. This matchup screams under to me. The Pick: Under 46.5 (-115) at FanduelNo. 10 Texas at No. 5 Georgia: The Texas Longhorns have scored 79 points in their last two games, but I will not be counted among the group that believes this team has figured things out on offense. I think they just played Mississippi State and Vanderbilt, two defenses that have given up plenty of points lately. Auburn, one of the worst offenses in the country, put up 38 on Vandy last week.Now, the sticking point here is that this Georgia defense isn't nearly as good as we're used to seeing. If you don't believe me, here's an incredible stat. In two games against Texas last season, the Georgia defense had 13 sacks and 25 tackles for loss. In nine games this season, the Georgia defense has 11 sacks and 35 tackles for loss. Yes, that's right, the Dawgs had more sacks against Texas last year than they have all of this season so far.The problem for Texas is, matchup-wise, I don't think they'll give Georgia the same kind of problems we've seen Ole Miss and Tennessee give them. Those teams can stretch you vertically, while Texas hasn't shown much ability to do that. As for the Georgia offense, the Dawgs have been better than Texas, but they aren't explosive, and this Longhorns defense remains one of the best in the country. All of this makes me like the under, but what I love is the first-half under. Both of these teams are notoriously slow starters. We also have two coaching staffs that are excellent with halftime adjustments, so instead of sweating the whole 60, let's try to win this one in 30. The Pick: 1st Half Under 23.5 (-108) at DraftkingsLock of the Week\nColorado State at New Mexico: One of the nice things about November college football is the ease of finding dead teams. There are plenty to be found. Colorado State is one of those dead teams. The Rams fired coach Jay Norvell following a 31-19 loss to Hawaii that dropped them to 2-5 on the season. Sometimes you will see this rally a team, whether it's because they loved or hated their coach. Then there are times when the team completely checks out. Colorado State seems to be in the latter group.The Rams have lost their two games since, and were outscored by Wyoming and UNLV 70-10 in the process.This is not a team harboring hopes of doing much the rest of the season. They look like they just want it to end. Meanwhile, New Mexico is coming off an impressive road win against UNLV and still has some control of its fate in the Mountain West should it win out. The Pick: New Mexico -14.5 (-108) at DraftkingsRock Fight of the Week\nNorth Carolina at Wake Forest: The North Carolina Tar Heels have turned a bit of a corner under Bill Belichick, and it's not hard to see the formula for their success. They're trying to win games with defense and by moving slower than molasses on offense. The only team moving at a slower pace offensively than the Tar Heels this season is Minnesota (more on the Gophers shortly), and Carolina has slowed things down even more in recent games.Wake ranks 117th in my pace ratings itself, so the Demon Deacons are all too happy to oblige Carolina's pace with their own. However, early in the season, Wake was far more efficient on offense. It may have moved slowly, but it scored 2.06 points per possession in its first six games. In the last three, the Deacons' offense is scoring 0.71 points per possession. UNC is allowing only 0.97 points per possession on defense in its last three games. There's a reason this total is as low as it is, and my suspicion is it's not low enough. The Pick: Under 38.5 (-108) at DraftkingsTeam Total of the Week\nMinnesota at No. 8 Oregon (Friday): I mentioned the pace at which the Gophers offense has moved this year when discussing the Tar Heels. This is the slowest-moving team in the country, which doesn't come as much of a surprise if you've followed P.J. Fleck's squad over the years. Now this glacier has to fly across the country to face Oregon on a Friday night, and is facing an Oregon offense that could once again be without key players on offense in receiver Dakorien Moore, Gary Bryant Jr. and tight end Kenyon Sadiq. So we might see Oregon lean into its rushing attack the same way it did against Iowa last week.That could slow the game down even further, but Oregon has also shown an ability to be explosive at home, so I don't want to mess with the Ducks' offense. Instead, I'll rely on the Ducks' defense (1st nationally in explosive play rate) to stymie a Minnesota offense that moves slowly and has been horrific on the road all year. The Gophers' offense has a success rate of only 33.9% on the road and is averaging an abysmal 0.61 points per possession in those games. The Pick: Minnesota TT Under 8.5 (-115) at DraftkingsUpset of the Week\nCoastal Carolina at Georgia Southern: Coastal is a team the market has been slow to adjust to lately. The Chanticleers got off to a 2-3 start to the season that had me wondering if coach Tim Beck might find himself on the unemployment line soon. They've won four straight since, including three straight games where they've scored at least 40 points. That has this team right back in the thick of the Sun Belt race, as they're a game behind James Madison in the standings, and will have a chance to play the Dukes for a division title in the final week of the season should they win this game.So there's no questioning that Coastal will bring its A-game to Statesboro, and I think that A-game is enough to beat the Eagles. Southern is 3-1 at home this year, but the wins have come against Maine, Jacksonville State and Georgia State. They lost at home to Southern Miss, which is a Sun Belt team on a similar tier to Coastal. I think the wrong team is favored, and I'm happy to get the Chants at plus-money. The Pick: Coastal Carolina (+125) at Draftkings\nBetsLast WeekSeasonUnitsGames of the Week1-110-12-4.22Lock of the Week1-05-6-1.61Upset of the Week0-11-10-8.07Overall3-331-35-7.95Who will win and cover in each Week 12 college football game?

    "body": "\n        After serving a 10-game suspension, Justin Tucker is officially eligible to return to the NFL this week. The former Baltimore Ravens kicker was hit with a suspension back in June for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. Tucker was accused of inappropriate behavior, including sexual misconduct, by several massage therapists in the Baltimore area.   The NFL investigated the situation and ended up suspending the 35-year-old kicker for 10 games. The league permitted Tucker to serve the suspension as a free agent, and as of Nov. 11, his suspension he has been reinstated by the league, which means he's now allowed to sign with any team that might want to bring him in.   Tucker spent the first 11 seasons of his career in Baltimore before being released in May. During a good chunk of that span, he was viewed as arguably the greatest kicker in NFL history: He was voted to the Pro Bowl seven times while also earning five All-Pro nods. In 2021, he set the NFL record for longest field goal with a 66-yard kick and he held the record for four years before Cam Little topped it in Week 9 with a 68-yard field goal against the Raiders.   Although Tucker currently stands as the fourth-most accurate kicker in NFL history with an accuracy rate of 89.1%, he struggled during his final season with the Ravens, hitting just 73.3% of his kicks. Most of those misses came from long range, with Tucker going just 6 of 11 from 50 yards or longer. A change of scenery could certainly help, but Tucker is somewhat of a mystery heading into his 12th season.   \nAccording to NFL Media, there are several unnamed teams that might be interested in signing Tucker, so let's take a look at a few possible landing spots.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      1. Rams  There is no team that needs Justin Tucker more than the Los Angeles Rams. Joshua Karty started the season as the Rams' kicker, but he lost his job after hitting just 66.7% of his field goal attempts (10 of 15) during the eight games that he played in. That number is the second-lowest percentage in the NFL through 10 weeks. Surprisingly, Karty struggled mostly on his shorter kicks, hitting just 63.6% of his field goal attempts from inside 45 yards.   The second-year kicker missed a 39-yard kick in a 34-10 win over the Saints back in Week 9 and that ended up being the last straw for Rams coach Sean McVay. After that missed field goal, the Rams were so desperate for a new kicker that they went out and signed Harrison Mevis, AKA the \"Thiccer Kicker.\" Mevis entered the NFL in 2024 and had never played in a regular-season game until Sunday when he was the Rams' kicker during their 42-26 win over the San Francisco 49ers. During the win, Mevis didn't get to attempt a field goal, but he did go 6 of 6 on extra points.   \nAlthough Mevis was solid, he has yet to attempt a field goal, so he's still unproven.   If you're looking for a team that might sign Tucker, the Rams definitely make the most sense. They're a Super Bowl-contending team in need of a kicker and it would give Tucker a chance to spend his home games kicking indoors for the first time in his career.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      2. Falcons  If you're wondering how desperate the Falcons are to find a kicker, just consider this: They were on their third kicker of the season by Week 10. The team went into the year with Younghoe Koo at kicker, but the Falcons lost all confidence in him after he missed a 44-yard field goal in Week 1 with just six seconds left to play in a 23-20 loss to the Buccaneers.   \nAfter Koo's miss, the Falcons brought in John Parker Romo and he ended up beating out Koo for the starting spot. Parker Romo took over the kicking job in Week 2 and he got off to a hot start by hitting 5 of 5 field goals in a 22-6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. However, Parker Romo has hit just 66.7% of his field goals (6 of 9) since that perfect game and the Falcons decided to cut ties with him after he missed a crucial extra point during Atlanta's 24-23 loss to the Patriots in Week 9.   The Falcons have now turned things over to Zane Gonzalez, but he's likely not going to be the long-term answer. He's been in the NFL since 2017, but he didn't kick in a single regular-season game in either 2022 or 2023. In 2024, he spent six games with the Commanders during a stint where he converted just 71.4% of his field goals, so there's no guarantee he'll have a successful stay in Atlanta.   Gonazalez has played in one game for the Falcons and he went 1 of 1 on field goals while hitting both of his extra points in a 31-25 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.   \nWith the Falcons cycling through kickers, it won't be surprising at all if they reach out to Tucker at some point about their kicking job.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      3. Packers  The Packers currently have a kicker in Brandon McManus, but it's not clear how much they trust him right now. McManus has hit just 64.7% of his field goal attempts this season, which is one of the worst percentage in the NFL for anyone with more than 10 attempts (He's 11 of 17). During Green Bay's shocking 16-13 loss to the Panthers in Week 9, McManus missed a 43-yard field goal. He followed that up in Week 10 by badly missed a 64-yard field goal on the final play in a 10-7 loss to the Eagles.   \nMcManus missed two games with a quad injury and since returning from that injury in Week 8, he's gone just 4 of 8 (50%). In the four games before the injury, he was 7 of 9 (77.8%) with a missed extra point.   \nMcManus' struggles are somewhat surprising considering how well he kicked last year. With an accuracy rate of 95.2%, McManus was one of the best kickers in the NFL in 2024, which is why the Packers decided to reward him with a three-year, $15.3 million contract in March, but he hasn't been the same kicker this season.   During the two games that McManus missed this year, the Packers turned to Lucas Havrisik, who went 4 for 4, including a franchise record 61-yard field goal in Week 7 against the Cardinals.   \nHavrisik could undoubtedly be the answer, but during his last stint as a full-time starting kicker, he hit just 75% of field goals while playing for the Rams in 2023 (He was out of the NFL in 2024).   \nIf the Packers are uncomfortable with their kicking options, it might be worth giving Tucker a call and inviting him in for a tryout. This is a Super Bowl-contending team and the Packers need a kicker they can trust. Yes, they just gave McManus a big extension, but if they can't trust him, then they should certainly think about kicking the tires on Tucker.    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     4. Colts The Colts started the year with Spencer Shrader as their kicker and he went a perfect 14 of 14 on field goals before suffering a season-ending ACL injury in Week 5. The Colts then brought in Michael Badgley to take his place and although he's been serviceable, he has missed several kicks. In a Week 10 game against the Falcons, Badgley missed two kicks: A 53-yard field goal and an extra point. Those two kicks almost cost Indianapolis the game, but the Colts ended up prevailing in overtime, 31-25. Badgley has hit just 88.2% of his extra point attempts this year, which is the second-worst percentage in the NFL for anyone with more than 15 attempts. Tucker has hit 98.5% of the extra point attempts in his career and has never finished with an accuracy rate below 96.6%.  The Colts have a Week 10 bye and coach Shane Steichen said his team won't be looking to add a kicker during their week off, but if Badgley stumbles with any missed kicks in a Week 11 showdown against the Chiefs, it won't be surprising if Indy decides to add someone.  \nThat being said, the Colts do have a female-led ownership group, so even if the team goes on the hunt for a new kicker, they might prefer to stay away from Tucker, but he has served his time in the NFL's eyes, so it will be interesting to see if any team out there gives the 35-year-old a second chance.  \n            ",

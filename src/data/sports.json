    "body": "\n        Marc Montoya, owner and head coach of Factory X mixed martial arts gym, is defending himself and his business after his former pupil, Isaac Dulgarian, was reportedly released by the UFC amid concerns about fight-fixing.The UFC reportedly cut Dulgarian this week after his loss to Yadier del Valle at Saturday's UFC Fight Night. UFC's betting integrity partner, IC360, is investigating the fight after  a suspicious number of bets poured in late on underdog Del Valle. The  story has some people concerned about potential fight-fixing on a wider scale. Montoya, Dulgarian's recent coach, addressed the controversy on Tuesday, claiming his business is being unfairly attacked.\"My gym is being attacked, my integrity is being attacked, and I just want to first and foremost say that we have nothing to do with any of the allegations being brought upon us,\" Montoya told \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" on Tuesday.\nMontoya refused to speculate on what happened with the Dulgarian fight. He said his job was to \"lead and not react\" on behalf of his team. Montoya claimed to know nothing about sports betting. \"I've actually never even placed a sports bet in my entire life -- I couldn't tell you how to do it,\" Montoya said. \"This is my life's work, and you can bet your ass that I would never, for any amount of money, sell my integrity or my word -- because in life, that's all you have.\" Montoya confirmed that he's parted ways with Dulgarian amid investigations into his fight. Dulgarian is no longer permitted to train at Factory X.\n\"The conversation was that he was cut from the UFC, and unfortunately,  there's an investigation that is being had, and, ultimately, that he's  not part of this Factory X team because of everything going on,\" Montoya  said. \"... Whether he's guilty or he's innocent, in my prediction,  Isaac Dulgarian is not gonna fight again. \"So, does it matter where he  claims he's training? Ultimately, where we sit today is in just a  crazy mess, with all these allegations, and so, the least of his  concerns right now would be where he's at and where he's training.\"  Concerns around fight fixing have grown in recent years. In 2022, the UFC released Darrick Minner after suspicious line movement before his loss to Shayilan Nuerdanbieke. Minner and his coach, James  Krause, also received suspensions from the Nevada State Athletic Commission. \nGambling scandals are under the microscope right now after NBA players and coaches were arrested in  a wide-ranging FBI probe into bettors using non-public information to place bets, plus illegal and rigged poker games.\"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an  independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on  our events,\" UFC wrote in a statement. \"Our betting integrity partner, IC360,  monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review  of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday,  November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the  health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the  integrity of our sport.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been less than a week since Luciano Spalletti was appointed as the new Juventus head coach, replacing Igor Tudor and becoming the club's third managerial change since the summer of 2024. Since the former Napoli and Italy manager was appointed, Juventus won 2-1 against Cremonese over the weekend away and then drew 1-1 at the Allianz Stadium in Turin against Sporting CP on Tuesday in the Champions League in the first home game of the new coach. In the opening two matches under Spalletti, Juventus scored three goals but also conceded two, marking some defensive issues of the Italian giants that are still looking to improve under the new manager, who didn't have much time to fix the ongoing problems. However, there was a big and immediate change: a new tactical position of Teun Koopmeiners, who played both matches under Spalletti as a left center back. The Dutch midfielder joined Juventus from Atalanta in the summer of 2024 for around $50 million, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the history of the iconic Italian club. The pressure was really high on him in his first season and he didn't deliver as much as he hoped, scoring only five goals in 44 matches played, while the season before, he scored 15 goals in all competitions under Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, in what was his best season of his career so far. Under Thiago Motta and later Tudor, Koopmeiners was deployed in several midfield roles: as a central midfielder, an attacking midfielder, and occasionally as a second striker behind the main forward. However, none of these positions truly suited his qualities or allowed him to perform at his best.\nWhen Spalletti joined Juventus, he immediately decided to deconstruct his role and started him in both games against Cremonese and Sporting CP as a left center back, a player who can not only defend but also start the attack. It's no coincidence that Koopmeiners was second with the most touches on Tuesday (74) and led the team in passes attempted (63). He had just one touch fewer than Manuel Locatelli (75), showing how equally involved he was in Juventus' build-up play and overall possession. Speaking to Sky Italy after the game, he said he feels confident playing in the new role.\"I feel very comfortable in this position. I'm not the kind of forward who plays with his back to goal, as I've had to do in some other matches and I've told the club that as well. I feel much better in this role. It's the one I also played back in the Netherlands. I like to drive forward with the ball,\" he said. \nKoopmeiners (8) saw plenty of the ball and successfully helped create attacking moments with his ball movement.   \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            As the Dutch midfielder said to Sky Italy, this is not something new for him. In the 154 matches played for AZ Alkmaar in his career before moving to Atalanta in 2021, he played 38 matches as a center back in a similar position of the one he's currently playing at Juventus. It will be interesting to see whether Spalletti decides to keep him in that role, as the coach values defenders who can play out from the back, contribute creatively, and offer an additional source of build-up quality. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Arizona Cardinals will turn to Jacoby Brissett at quarterback this Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, as Kyler Murray continues to recover from a foot injury suffered in Week 5, coach Jonathan Gannon said Tuesday. Brissett has started the last three games, leading the team to a 27-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys Monday night, completing 67.7% of his passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for another score.The Cardinals now have Brissett leading the offense on a short week as they travel to Seattle to face a 6-2 Seahawks team coming off a blowout road win over the Washington Commanders. Murray could be out longer than originally anticipated. Multiple doctors have advised that Murray's foot injury could require 4-8 weeks to fully heal, according to ESPN. \"He's doing well,\" Gannon said of Murray. \"He wants to be out there. He's a competitor. I talked to him today. He's a good teammate and he's working to get healthy.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray hasn't played since Oct. 5. He was limited in practice last week before the team announced on Saturday that Brissett would start. Gannon said last week that Murray could have a role in the Dallas game, but he was later ruled inactive.\nBrissett has performed well in Murray's absence, throwing for 320 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in a narrow Week 6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, followed by a 279-yard, two-touchdown effort in Week 7 against the Green Bay Packers.Brissett became the second player in Cardinals franchise history to pass for 250 yards, two touchdowns and rush for a touchdown on \"Monday Night Football,\" joining Jim Hart in 1974, according to CBS Sports Research. He has played well enough to spark a quarterback controversy.Following the win in Dallas, reporters asked Gannon if Murray was still his starting quarterback when he returns. \n\"Yeah, nothing's changed on that,\" Gannon said. \"That's how I feel.\" Reporters followed up by questioning if Brissett did well enough to earn deeper opportunity.\"I got nothing to add on that, guys,\" Gannon said.For now, the team will move forward with Brissett, the journeyman backup whose stats compare favorably to Murray, the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft.Comparing Jacoby Brissett, Kyler MurrayKyler MurrayJacoby BrissettYards per attempt6.07.7Total TDs77Turnovers42Passer rating88.6102.5The Cardinals' weaponry has benefitted from the change under center.

    "body": "\n        Three days removed from Clemson's 46-45 loss to Duke, coach Dabo Swinney remains up in arms over the officiating and a controversial pass interference call that played a key role in the Blue Devils' game-winning drive. Swinney, who ripped the officials over \"one of the worst calls\" he has ever seen, made big-picture arguments on Tuesday and called for reform. Specifically, the two-time national champion pleaded for more accountability from officials and a requirement that they be full-time employees.Swinney this week received a public reprimand from the ACC over his postgame comments about the officials. The conference also hit Clemson with a $10,000 fine for what it deemed was a violation of league policy.\"Coaches get crucified, fined,\" Swinney said Tuesday. \"Players get crucified, held to this unrealistic accountability standard. But refs have zero accountability. They do, but it's behind a curtain. They get to go home and drink a beer and get on with their life and just leave the carnage left behind that affects a lot of people -- people losing jobs. That system needs to change.\"\n        \n            \n                Dabo Swinney stands by bad officiating remarks following ACC reprimand, Clemson fined after Duke loss\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDabo Swinney: Refs should have 'public accountability'The call that made Swinney irate came with less than a minute left in the Week 10 loss to Duke. The Blue Devils trailed by a touchdown, and on fourth down, quarterback Darian Mensah fired a deep ball that fell incomplete for what appeared to be a turnover on downs until officials flagged Clemson defensive back Avieon Terrell for a pass interference penalty that kept the drive alive and set up Duke's go-ahead touchdown.Terrell took the brunt of the contact with Duke receiver Que'Sean Brown on the play and fell to the ground as a result of the collision. He wound up as the guilty party in a call that left Clemson players and coaches dumbfounded.\n\"They need to be full-time refs, and it needs to be a job,\" Swinney said. \"There needs to be one leader and one voice. That's what it should be, number one. And then there should be public accountability. Period. You can't criticize them? They're the only ones in the arena that have no consequences publicly. God forbid you get to pay a fine because you criticize performance, but yet everybody else can be criticized. It's a bad system, the way it's set up.\"\n        \n            \n                After latest loss, Dabo Swinney says 'I may get fired ... can't say I'd blame him' with Clemson AD looking on\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe questionable call and resulting loss presents another batch of adversity for a Clemson program that has fallen dramatically short of expectations this season. The latest defeat is the fifth on the year and sent the Tigers tumbling further to 3-5 on the year.\"We've got gambling issues going on, people being suspended, all that kind of stuff, right?\" Swinney said. \"Refs are people, too. It ain't just coaches and players. If they're a part of the game, then by God, they ought to be a part of the game. They ought to be a part of the accountability. They ought to be a part of the consequences, not just behind some shadowy curtain.\"\nTuesday's media availability was the third public appearance -- following his postgame press conference and Sunday's teleconference -- in which Swinney blasted the officials for the pass interference call.\n            ",

Lassina Traore transfers in from Long Beach State, where he was a two-time All-Big West Selection and twice led the conference in rebounds. Also, the Longhorns landed Matas Vokietaitis from FAU, where the Lithuanian was the American Conference Rookie of the Year last season, averaging 10.2 points, 5.4 rebounds and knocking down 67.7% of his field goal attempts.Perhaps the biggest addition for Texas is bringing aboard coach Sean Miller, who previously served at Xavier and Arizona. He is a four-time winner of his conference's Coach of the Year award and is known for getting the most out of his players, especially on the offensive end of the court.

That class is highlighted by Cameron Boozer, who is the No. 3 overall recruit and is one of four athletes, ever, to twice win the Gatorade National Player of the Year award in high school. His twin, Cayden Boozer, is the No. 4 point guard in his class, while Duke also landed two other 5-star prospects in Nikolas Khamenia and Dame Sarr.It's not only newcomers on the Duke roster as it returns four rotation players from last year's squad which made it to the Final Four. Jon Scheyer's team covered 67.7% of its games a year ago, and the Blue Devils have also covered in two-thirds of their games versus non-conference opponents since 2023. Additionally, Duke can take solace in that Texas struggled when stepping up in competition as it went 0-5 outright versus top-10 ranked teams last season. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make Duke vs. Texas picksSportsLine's model has simulated Texas vs. Duke  10,000 times and is leaning Over the total, projecting 153 combined points.

    "description": "\n        If the San Diego Padres are going to reach the playoffs next season, thereby giving them three consecutive berths for the first time in franc",
    "body": "\n        If the San Diego Padres are going to reach the playoffs next season, thereby giving them three consecutive berths for the first time in franchise history, they're going to have to do it with a new-look rotation in tow. Veteran right-hander Yu Darvish underwent internal brace surgery last week to repair his torn UCL and flexor tendon. As a result, he'll miss the entire 2026 season. He made the announcement on Tuesday.Add in the impending free agencies of three other Padres starters -- Dylan Cease, Michael King, and Nestor Cortes -- and San Diego is looking at having to replace the pitchers who combined to make 68 of their 162 regular-season starts (42%). Here's a look at what the Padres current rotation looks like:RHP Nick Pivetta: Coming off a career year (13-5, 2.87 ERA, 190 K in 181⅔ IP)RHP Joe Musgrove: Missed the entire season following Tommy John surgeryLHP JP Sears: Appeared just five times after coming over in a deadline tradeRHP Randy Vásquez: Posted a 111 ERA+, but with a 1.50 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 28 outingsRHP Matt Waldron: Appeared just once and has minimal MLB success to his creditThe Padres also thinned their immediate depth at the deadline, trading Ryan Bergert and Stephen Kolek to the Kansas City Royals for catcher Freddy Fermin. Bergert and Kolek had combined for 21 starts prior to that move. Add it to the quartet above, and that's 55% of the team's regular-season total.So, yes, AJ Preller and the Padres are probably going to need to address their rotation -- and they'll have to do it without a ton of great internal options. Lefty Omar Cruz is the only other starter on the 40-player roster, and he walked nearly six batters per nine innings in Triple-A. Double-A right-hander Miguel Mendez finished his season by issuing 17 free passes in 22 innings of work. And so on.\nPerhaps the most interesting option the Padres have on hand, then, is right-hander Mason Miller.\nMiller, 27, has not started a game since 2023 and was quickly moved to full-time relief to accommodate his power arsenal and lengthy injury history. Preller did not, as part of his end-of-the-year wrap, rule out the possibility of asking Miller to come into next spring as a starter. The Padres haven't officially made a call either way, yet it's something to monitor over the course of the winter.\nOf course, the Padres could always look outside the organization for help, too. San Diego's farm system is diminished after years of win-now trades, however, and it's unclear how much payroll flexibility Preller will enjoy. According to Cot's Contracts, San Diego is projected to be around $20 million beneath this past season's mark. If that's the Padres' limit, they'll have to again bargain shop. That worked out fine for them last winter with Pivetta, but the amount of help needed is more broad this go around.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff Selection Committee's first top 25 rankings of the 2025 season arrive Tuesday night as we sit in the final month of the campaign, giving us a glimpse at how this group views the country's top teams based on a variety of factors. We'll also get a detailed explanation of \"record strength,\" a new metric designed to further credit teams for how they perform against their schedule. It's supposed to provide an extra boost for beating quality teams while lessening the penalty for losses against tougher opponents.According to CFP guidelines, the selection committee \"ranks the teams based on the members' evaluation of the teams' performance on the field, using conference championships won, strength of schedule, head-to-head results and comparison of results against common opponents to decide among teams that are comparable.\"Each of the selection committee's 13 members creates a list of 30 teams they perceive as the best in college football. Those groups of teams, in no particular order, are further broken down and ranked when three or more members agree on selections.\nTuesday night's rankings are the first of five reveals leading up to Selection Sunday in December once conference championships are decided across the Power Four and Group of Six ranks.\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Texas returns to College Football Playoff contention, Miami's hopes fading down stretch\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n    1. Ohio State (8-0)No team has been more dominant and passed the proverbial eye test like the Buckeyes. Wins over Texas, Washington and Illinois is a nice trifecta through Week 10, and no opponent outside of the Longhorns in the opener has come within two touchdowns of Ohio State throughout the campaign. This team might be more complete than last season's squad that won the national championship.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 3\n    \n                                        \n    2. Alabama (7-1)The Crimson Tide hold the most ranked wins in college football (4), but we're not expecting Tennessee to be ranked in Tuesday's first playoff poll after its home loss to Oklahoma. Why is Alabama ahead of the SEC's only remaining unbeaten (Texas A&M) here? We're guessing the selection committee points to the Crimson Tide's strength of schedule, which is higher than the Aggies.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 3\n    \n                                        \n    3. Indiana (9-0)Here's a team that rarely plays with their food -- and the selection committee has to like that. The Hoosiers' Big Ten wins at Iowa and that 53-point pasting of Illinois are also notable. Ranked No. 2 in game control, that's going to linger as a strength the rest of the way since Indiana's remaining three Big Ten opponents are a combined 0-16 in conference play this season. Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    4. Texas A&M (8-0)Coming from behind to beat Notre Dame on the road along with the recent clobbering of LSU in Death Valley are high marks for the Aggies. We're not expecting LSU to be ranked in the selection committee's first poll, but it'll still count as a quality win away from home. The most likely SEC Championship Game scenario right now is Texas A&M vs. Alabama with both teams getting first-round byes if they win out in the regular season.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    5. Georgia (7-1)Unless Tennessee is ranked Tuesday night, Georgia's lone win over a top-25 team will be Ole Miss. The resume remains impressive since the victory over the Vols came inside Neyland Stadium, there was a road win at Auburn tossed in there and the Bulldogs' only loss came to one of the SEC's frontrunners. Georgia gets a chance to move into the top four if its takes care of business the next four weeks with victories over nationally ranked Texas and Georgia Tech.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    6. Ole Miss (8-1)As it stands, the road triumph at Oklahoma last month is the Rebels' best win, but Ole Miss did take out LSU when the Tigers were unbeaten and ranked No. 4. With three games left against unranked competition, the best-case scenario is an 11-1 finish and first-round home game. The win over Tulane strengthens the Rebels' resume if the Green Wave beat Memphis this weekend.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    7. BYU (8-0)One of only four remaining unbeatens in the Power Four ranks, the Cougars' most important game in several years takes place Saturday at Texas Tech. That's a resume-boosting opportunity for both teams and should determine one-half of the entries in the conference title game next month. BYU's win over Utah on Oct. 18 is its best up to this point.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    8. Oregon (7-1)The Ducks have one win this season over a team with a winning record (at Northwestern) thanks to what was expected to be a signature victory at Penn State. For the most part, however, Oregon has squashed every opponent it has faced with the exception of the home loss to Indiana and the double-overtime victory in Happy Valley.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 0\n    \n                                        \n    9. Texas Tech (8-1)Few teams have beaten Utah on the road during Kyle Whittingham's tenure, so that victory should impress the selection committee. Ranked No. 3 in game control this season, the Red Raiders have blistered much of the competition and their loss at Arizona State was impacted by starting quarterback Behren Morton being unavailable. Strength of schedule metrics won't help Texas Tech's case in the long run, but a win over BYU this weekend puts Joey McGuire's squad back in the Big 12's poll position.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    10. Texas (7-2)Steve Sarkisian and Arch Manning are getting hot at the right time. The most important win Texas currently owns is the head-to-head decision over Oklahoma in Red River. Should both of these teams finish with identical records, the committee would have to give the Longhorns the nod given the on-field result. Opportunities against top-5 Georgia and Texas A&M remain for a squad in great standing.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25:: 2\n    \n                                        \n    11. Miami (6-2)The last team in according to this projection if Tuesday night's rankings mirror our thoughts, Miami is the toughest team to grade in terms of where it will be placed this week. The Hurricanes are relying on early-season success to stake their claim as a contender considering what's transpired in recent weeks. Losses to Louisville and SMU should be critically-damaging, but we'll need to see how the committee views Miami's recent swoon before determining that.\nWins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    12. Notre Dame (6-2)Notre Dame has three wins over teams with winning records -- Boise State, NC State and USC -- with more coming down the stretch vs. Navy and Pitt if all goes well for Marcus Freeman. We think that could be enough to leap a 10-win Miami team a few weeks from now considering that head-to-head loss to the Hurricanes came way back on Aug. 31. For now, though, it's hard to see the selection committee slotting the Fighting Irish over Miami given that result.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 1\n    \n                                        \n    13. Oklahoma (7-2)After beating Tennessee for their second win this season over a team we're projecting to be in the first CFP rankings, the Sooners would virtually guarantee a spot in the bracket by winning out against Alabama, Missouri and LSU.Wins over teams in projected CFP Top 25: 2\n    \n                                        \n    14.

The Raiders' superstar tight end returned in Week 9 and delivered 43.3 PPR Fantasy points for patient Fantasy managers. That one, monstrous game was enough to vault him to the top of the PPR per-game rankings for tight ends this season, and everything is right again. Bowers now paces the position with an average of 17.4, while Trey McBride is on his tail at 16.2. After that, well, it is starting to look like the tight end position again.The number three tight end in points per game is Tucker Kraft, who is out for the year with an ACL injury. Number four is Dallas Goedert, who is the biggest touchdown regression candidate in the league and has A.J. Brown coming back. Number five is Jake Ferguson, who has scored eight Fantasy points in his last two games combined. While there are plenty of young guys to get excited about, the expectation should be that Bowers and McBride are going to be two or three points better than everyone else at tight end rest of season. Which is the same expectation we had coming into the season. What may have changed is the guy we all had at number three, George Kittle.Kittle missed a significant chunk of time due to a hamstring injury, and the 32-year-old has not performed like himself since he got back. He does not have more than four catches in any game this season and has only scored more the seven Fantasy points once in three games since returning. We're still starting him in Week 10 against the Rams, but only because of his name, not because of what his game has been like in 2025. If Kittle struggles once again, it may be time to hit the panic button.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 10:\n\n        Week 10 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            34.2% -- Brock Bowers had a 34.2% target share in his return. With Jakobi Meyers dealt to Jacksonville, he may be at 30% the rest of the season.17.8% -- Juwan Johnson has been targeted on 17.8% of Tyler Shough's throws. With Rashid Shaheed dealt to Seattle, Johnson is back in the low-end TE1 conversation.16 -- Trey McBride leads the position with 16 red zone targets, and he's actually scored five times. Hopefully, this is not just because of Jacoby Brissett.5.1 -- The Falcons have allowed a league-low 5.1 PPR FPPG to tight ends. It's a tough spot for Tyler Warren, but we are starting him anyway.5 -- Oronde Gadsden has at least five catches in four straight games. He looks like a must-start tight end.29.8 -- It was a great matchup, but Colston Loveland's 29.8 point breakout should put him in starting consideration again this week.Week 10 Streamers (TE Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYJ\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CLE -2.5\n                                    O/U 37.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                7th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                61%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    51\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    352\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Harold Fannin has 23 targets over his last three games and has scored double-digit PPR points in three of his last four.

what Brock Bowers just did to this defense? No, Schultz isn't Bowers and he won't match his production, but the Rams tight ends combined for 24.1 points against Jacksonville the week before. Schultz had a small slump in the middle of the year which we think was due to injury but he looked great last week turning eight targets into 13.7 PPR points without a touchdown.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 10 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

Exhibit A: the 2025 cutoff, which brought this year's running total of in-season deals to a record high, and saw the New York Jets add a whopping three first-round draft picks via surprise deals.The Jets' first splash, which came hours before Tuesday's deadline, was the biggest, with star cornerback Sauce Gardner relocating to the Indianapolis Colts in return for a pair of first-rounders, plus wide receiver Adonai Mitchell. The next surprise involved Quinnen Williams, Gardner's former Pro Bowl teammate, going to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a pair of early picks, including a 2027 first-rounder, plus former first-round defensive lineman Mazi Smith.Gardner and Williams have the star power to make immediate impacts in Indy and Dallas, respectively. But is it possible we'll look back on their moves as monumental for the other sides? The Jets, after all, now have five combined first-round picks over the next two seasons as a result of their Tuesday deals; that kind of haul has the potential to completely reshape the identity of the franchise, starting with the likely pursuit of a new quarterback.With all that in mind, we can look to both the recent and distant past to see there's a precedent for last-minute trades having true ripple effects, not only on the season at hand but for seasons to come.\nHere are some of the most impactful midseason NFL deals of all time:11. Jim Everett to the Rams (1986)Technically, Everett never even signed with the Houston Oilers, who spent the No. 3 overall pick in the 1986 draft on the Purdue quarterback, as contract talks between team brass and Everett's agent never progressed. But the franchise waited until the first month of the rookie's would-be debut season to ship his rights to Los Angeles. The Rams proceeded to get close to a decade out of Everett, including a 1990 Pro Bowl campaign and 1989 NFC Championship appearance.10. Minkah Fitzpatrick to the Steelers (2019)Pittsburgh already boasted a top-shelf defense when it acquired Fitzpatrick, a former first-rounder, from the Dolphins for a package that included a Day 1 pick. The Alabama product was one of the NFL's top ballhawks after his relocation, however, totaling 45 pass breakups and 18 interceptions, plus three pick sixes and four fumble recoveries, over more than a half-decade in Steel City.9. Jay Ajayi to the Eagles (2017)In the annals of Eagles superstars, Ajayi doesn't really hold up, playing just 14 games for the team over two and a half seasons. His arrival from the Miami Dolphins for a fourth-round pick, however, jump-started Philadelphia's ground game behind then-MVP candidate Carson Wentz, and his big-play juice paired perfectly with the rougher LeGarrette Blount en route to the Eagles' first Super Bowl victory that year.\n8. Jimmy Garoppolo to the 49ers (2017)Drafted as a potential successor to Tom Brady, Garoppolo was shipped to San Francisco for a second-rounder after three and a half years on the New England Patriots' bench. He quickly went 5-0 as Kyle Shanahan's starter, and then bounced back from an injury-shortened 2018 season to help guide the team to Super Bowl LIV in 2019. Imperfect but resilient, he reached another NFC title game in 2021.7. Christian McCaffrey to the 49ers (2022)Long regarded as a super-skilled but injury-bitten centerpiece of the Carolina Panthers, McCaffrey finally joined a playoff-caliber lineup when San Francisco acquired him in exchange for four picks, giving Kyle Shanahan a versatile workhorse for an already-efficient offense. His multipurpose work helped ease young Brock Purdy into the starting quarterback gig, and powered the 49ers to back-to-back NFC title games.6. Eric Dickerson to the Colts (1987)A three-time rushing champion with the Los Angeles Rams, the electric running back went to Indianapolis as part of a three-way trade and instantly vaulted the Colts' ground game into elite territory, eclipsing 1,000 yards in just nine games while helping lead Indy to its first winning playoff season in a decade. He then led the NFL with almost 1,700 yards rushing the following year, remaining an icon at the position.\n5. Von Miller to the Rams (2021)Two years after swinging big for Jalen Ramsey (more on him below), Los Angeles doubled down on its win-now approach with Matthew Stafford now under center, sending two picks to the Denver Broncos for one of the most accomplished pass rushers of all time. The eight-time Pro Bowler only stayed through the end of the season, but went on an absolute tear -- nine sacks in 12 games, including playoffs -- to help L.A. win it all.4. Jalen Ramsey to the Rams (2019)A dynamic but disgruntled Jacksonville Jaguars star, the former No. 5 overall pick was shipped to Los Angeles for three picks, including two first-rounders. It was a steep price for the Rams to pay, but Ramsey instilled much-needed swagger into the team's remade secondary, validating an eventual big-money contract with a Super Bowl ring in 2021. He logged three Pro Bowl nods before leaving in 2023.3. Marshawn Lynch to the Seahawks (2010)Banged up and disgruntled with the Buffalo Bills, Lynch went to Seattle for two mid-round picks and quickly restored -- then exceeded -- his first-round reputation, most notably with an unforgettable tackle-shedding touchdown run in the postseason. He became the centerpiece of the Seahawks' physical attack, eclipsing 1,200 yards rushing in each of the four subsequent seasons, and helping the team win Super Bowl XLVIII.\n2. Mike Haynes to the Raiders (1983)A six-time Pro Bowl cornerback and former Defensive Rookie of the Year with the New England Patriots from 1976-1982, Haynes was dealt to Los Angeles for a pair of early-round draft picks. He proceeded to pair with fellow future Hall of Famer Lester Hayes, giving the Raiders one of the NFL's most feared cover duos and helping the team win Super Bowl XVII. He spent seven total seasons in silver and black.1. Herschel Walker to the Vikings (1989)Minnesota got itself an apparent superstar by acquiring the emergent running back from the Dallas Cowboys, but Walker's move in exchange for five players and six future draft picks is now regarded as arguably the most lopsided trade in NFL history. Two of those picks would become Emmitt Smith and Darren Woodson, perennial Pro Bowlers for three different Super Bowl-winning Cowboys teams.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        That Dominik Szoboszlai has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, perhaps their best, is not really up for debate. What made Tuesday by far the campaign's outstanding performance was how the Hungarian's presence at the heart of the side enabled so many others to be their best selves.Szoboszlai was all things to Arne Slot. Out of possession, his industry set the tone for the sort of diligence that is required if you are going to hold Real Madrid goalless. This was a Liverpool display of real commitment and organization, a collective willingness to sacrifice that has too rarely been seen since the half-billion-dollar splurge on new signings. That is probably not down to any lack of willingness on the part of the summer arrivals, more a lack of reference points who can define their approach.Their No. 8 was like a lighthouse for the rest of this team. A cutback to the edge of the Liverpool area? There was Szoboszlai to boot the ball clear. A counter down the wing? You could rest assured that the support run would be coming from the Hungarian with the alice band. Every time there was a question to be asked of Thibaut Courtois, you could be sure that Szoboszlai would be involved in its posing. He drew the best save of the first half, his unerring set-piece delivery teed up plenty of his teammates to test the Real Madrid No. 1.Eventually, it became too much for Courtois, beaten on the hour when a header flew off Alexis Mac Allister at close range. All the Argentine had to do is meet the fizzing cross from, well, you guessed who. No one carried the ball more frequently than Szoboszlai, no one took more shots and only Florian Wirtz created more chances. That last statistic is telling too. His teammates were better for having Szoboszlai back where he is at his best.\nWide on the left, it no longer fell on Wirtz to drop into midfield and aid the build-up. Over recent years, there have been few more devastating talents in the final third than the German, but he has spent too much of his early weeks in England dropping deep to aid Liverpool's clunky, Trent Alexander-Arnold-less ball progression. This time, he held court in that inside left spot outside the box where he is at his best.Further back, Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch got into a familiar groove, the latter exceptional in his eye for an interception and ability to carry upfield. And when the defense begins at the front of the pitch, it becomes all the easier for the back four to impose themselves in their individual duels, as Conor Bradley did quite outstandingly up against Vinicius Junior.It helped Liverpool no end that Madrid were so tepid, not the first time that it has felt like Xabi Alonso has veered towards caution against a high-grade opponent. La Liga's leaders were too eager to drag the tempo of the game down but ultimately achieved nothing more than wasting long spells of possession before Liverpool turned the pace up. Arda Guler was nothing like his usual self, instead far more subdued in his positioning. The dynamism of Federico Valverde might have helped; instead the hosts dubbed him the weak link in defense with a host of passes going from right to left to get Wirtz isolated against a midfielder masquerading as a right back.\nIt wasn't only without the ball that Madrid missed Alexander-Arnold, whose return to the Anfield stage in the 82nd minute was greeted with a chorus of boos. The visitors had a devastating front three of Jude Bellingham, Vinicius and Kylian Mbappe, all of whom flashed threat on occasion but lacked the service to exert pressure. Slot could doubtless have told his counterpart that Alexander-Arnold's more presence in an XI is usually a guarantee of ball progression from which forwards can feast.Without any means of unlocking their attackers, Madrid turned out a performance not that dissimilar to their Merseyside trip last season. On that day, they had the big names too but had no answer for a true team like Liverpool's.Frankly, this was a vision of how the English champions should have come back to defend their crowns, much more than the muddled mess that came when they couldn't bring themselves to choose between Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak. This was the side that Slot forged into comfortably England's finest in 2024-25 but with the necessary upgrades and tweaks required. A midfield of Szoboszlai's verve, Mac Allister's precision and Gravenberch's control was never a problem. It proved Tuesday to be a weapon capable of blowing Madrid out of the water.\n            ",

A week ago, we were calling Rico Dowdle a huge loser because Head Coach Dave Canales was insisting on playing Chubba Hubbard every other drive despite the clear evidence that Dowdle was the better back. Well, Canales considered the evidence. In Week 9, Dowdle had 25 carries and scored 28.1 Fantasy points against the Green Bay Packers of all teams. Chuba Hubbard played a season-low 22% of the snaps and had just five touches. And we are all in.Dowdle comes in at RB6 in my full PPR Projections for Week 10, and I may be too low. In the three games he has played, Dowdle has rushed for at least 60% of the snaps, accumulating 519 yards and scoring four total touchdowns. It was easier to process that when he was doing it against the Dolphins and the Cowboys but the Packers hadn't given up a 100-yard rusher all season. Now, in Week 9, he gets the Saints.The guy right behind Dowdle in the projections is Kyle Monangai, who may be pulling a Dowdle himself. Monangai had 198 yards against the Bengals in Week 9 and now faces the Giants. We are unsure about D'Andre Swift's status as of Tuesday, and we will unsure how much that status impacts Monangai. I expect that if Swift plays we get a 50/50 situation like what we saw when Hubbard came back. If Monangai is clearly better I would expect Ben Johnson to make the same decision Canales did. That being said, Swift was on a bit of a heater himself before he got hurt, so when he gets healthy I wouldn't expect him to go away quite as easily as Hubbard did. And the Bears schedule gets much more difficult down the stretch. So if you can convince someone that Monangai is the second coming of Dowdle, I would be selling high.Now let's get to the rest of the Week 9 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 10 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            6 -- Alvin Kamara has six rush attempts in each of the Saints last two games. Do whatever you can to bench him.41 -- Jacory Croskey-Merritt has not topped 41 scrimmage yards since Week 6.12 -- Jahmyr Gibbs had a season-low 12 touches in Week 9. Hopefully that was just a one week blip.77.1% -- James Cook's 77% rush share in Week 9 led the NFL. Hopefully the Bills keep that up.6.0 -- Derrick Henry is averaging six yards per carry with Lamar Jackson on the field this season. He could still be a league winner.41.2% -- Trey Benson has a 41.2% avoid rate. For reference, Emari Demercado has a 4.5% rate and Zonovan Knight has a 10.5% rate.

Singletary's role still wasn't great, he only played 56% of the snaps and only had 10 touches, but he looks like the Giants running back to roster, if you have to. If nothing else, I would expect him to be the short yardage back, which makes him the most likely to score a touchdown.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #31\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        SEA\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SEA -6.5\n                                    O/U 45.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                13th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                11%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    169\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                If Trey Benson returns then I am not sure Demercado matters. But if Benson is out, Demercado is likely the best Cardinals running back in Week 10. They are going with the hot hand approach and he had the much hotter hand in Week 9, averaging 5.6 yards per carry. His career rushing average is even higher than that and if not for the foolish goal line fumble, he may have taken this backfield over sooner. Even if Benson is out I don't like him as more than a flex against Seattle.\n            \n            \n\nStashes (RB Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #37\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -2.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                32%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    127\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    -1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    1.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Saquon Barkley was nursing a groin injury the last time we saw him.

He projects as a top 10 back for me in all formats against a Giants defense that has allowed the second most Fantasy points to opposing running backs. If Swift is back, then Dowdle is the top play.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

That should keep his roster rate low. But this Bills run defense is one of the worst in the league and Achane is also one of the top targets in the passing game for Miami each week. He had 19 touches for 91 yards against the Bills earlier this year and is always a threat to break a home run for a long touchdown. I like him better on sites that reward a full point for a catch, but he is in play as a contrarian play on FanDuel as well.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 10 Fantasy football projections for every position are now available on SportsLine. Find out which of my favorite plays are projected to score higher than consensus rankings and which don't live up to their draft hype, at least in Week 10.

    "body": "\n        The most powerful team in the NFL has a 1-7 record and hasn't been to the playoffs in 14 years, which is not only the league's longest drought but also tied for the longest active postseason drought in any of the four major professional American sports.That's right -- after a trade-deadline-day teardown of epic and historic proportions, the New York Jets have the chance to control what the future holds for the next two offseasons in the NFL.First-year general manager Darren Mougey made seismic moves Tuesday, trading cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys. The Jets received two first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell from Indianapolis, and first- and second-round picks -- as well as defensive lineman Mazi Smith -- from Dallas.Gardner, 25, is one of three players to be on the All-Pro First Team each of his first two NFL seasons. The Jets rightfully viewed him as a cornerstone of the franchise just four months ago when they made him the NFL's highest-paid cornerback with a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension.\nWilliams, 27, who has made each of the last three Pro Bowls, also seemed to be part of that formula. His contract runs through 2027.The Jets had to get appropriate return for these players, and they did. It's the first time this millennium that a team has made multiple in-season trades for first-round picks. New York now has two 2026 first-rounders, two 2026 second-rounders and three 2027 first-rounders.There's plenty of chatter already about what New York could do with that haul. Quarterback is atop the list after Justin Fields has become the latest in a series of experiments that didn't work.\nRestocking the defense -- which was near the bottom of the league even before these trades and also struggled last year -- will be a major priority, too. The same will be said for filling skill position players beyond Garrett Wilson, whom the Jets were reportedly resolute in not trading.Perhaps that's the greatest advantage, though. The Jets are a blank slate. They don't have to address one position or another. If they're not satisfied with what's available to them at quarterback in the 2026 draft -- where they could pick first -- they don't have to go with one. They can build in the trenches or in the secondary or at wide receiver or ... anywhere. They could bring in a bridge quarterback and refocus on 2027.And my goodness, what a loaded 2027 class it is. The names there are enough to pique the interested of even the most curmudgeonly -- and they have plenty of reasons to be curmudgeonly -- Jets fan. Wide receivers Jeremiah Smith (Ohio State) and Ryan Williams (Alabama). Edge rushers Dylan Stewart (South Carolina) and Colin Simmons (Texas). Maybe suddenly resurgent Texas quarterback Arch Manning, gets there, too.\nAgain, the excitement shouldn't be focusing on whom, exactly, the Jets will draft, but the simple fact that they'll have ample opportunities to choose a direction here. The world is their oyster. Adding to their power is an important note: The 2027 first-round pick acquired from Dallas is the better of the Cowboys' own 2027 selection, and the one it acquired from the Packers in the Micah Parsons deal.There's a real chance that it's a top-half-of-the-first-round pick. This is a seemingly minor detail that could be a major difference. It's an NBA-esque trade where the \"first-round pick\" notation requires much more detail.New York Jets General Manager Darren Mougey and Jets Head Coach Aaron Glenn, shake hands as they pose for the press, at the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center, Monday, January 27, 2025, in Florham Park. Mougey and Glenn were introduced to the press in their new positions for the first time. \n                                                                    © Kevin R. Wexler-NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n                                                            Returning to the curmudgeonly Jets fan, they may point out that this has happened before. In fact, the Jets are the most recent team to make five picks in a two-year span, doing so in 2021-22.\nThat stretch is looked at as a failure because they missed on Zach Wilson, but they also hit on Gardner, Wilson and potentially still Jermaine Johnson II.\"The Jets are doomed to repeat mistakes forever and ever until the end of time,\" our hypothetical Jets fan says.That's wrong. The Jets of today and tomorrow aren't doomed to make the mistakes of the Jets of yesterday simply because of the name on the front of the jersey. If that were true, no bad team would ever get better.\nMougey deserves some leash, benefit of the doubt and perhaps even credit -- I know that's hard to grasp, Jets fans -- for his savvy moves. If the Jets stand pat with their five first-round picks -- again, a big \"if\" considering how many paths they could take -- it will be the 13th time since the merger that a team makes five first-round picks in a two-year span. The Dolphins, Raiders and Browns also did it in the past decade, and all three made the postseason shortly thereafter. Cleveland even ended a playoff drought longer than the Jets' current one.The blueprint would be the 1991-92 Cowboys, who added foundational pieces to their 1990s dynasty in first-round picks Russell Maryland, Alvin Harper, Kevin Smith and Robert Jones and second-rounder Darren Woodson.In all likelihood, the Jets will fall somewhere in between. There will be hits, and there will be misses. Where they can't miss is quarterback. The \"With great power comes great responsibility\" quote applies here. Mougey, coach Aaron Glenn and the rest of the Jets have great power. They also have great responsibility to get it right.\nAt least they're giving themselves a legitimate chance. The Jets asking for more patience when they already own the NFL's longest active playoff drought is difficult but necessary. The days of trying to make Fields work or acceding to Aaron Rodgers' every wish -- impatient, one-foot-in, one-foot-out moves that put the Jets in this spot in the first place -- or hoping for Sam Darnold or Wilson to be the franchise savior amid hopeless conditions are over.The board has been wiped clean. There are no excuses, and there can be no looking back. Trades like these don't happen without an owner's permission, either; Woody Johnson seemingly being on board and in line with the patient approach is massively important, too.New York can transform its organization. It can select a highly drafted quarterback and provide a viable ecosystem around him. It can replenish a defense badly in need of talent all over. It can bring in veterans to help: New York is projected to have the third-most salary cap this offseason. All of these things weren't possible before Tuesday's deadline deals.\nThe teardown is near complete. The rebuild can begin in earnest. The Jets' playoff drought will continue this year. Maybe it's not over next year or the year after.But the Jets are finally doing things the right way, finally trying to build a team from the ground up rather than plugging in holes here or there. For an impatient franchise and fan base, patience isn't easy. But it might just be worth it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU's search for a football coach continues to draw national attention, and intrigue in the job spiked again when one of the school's most prominent alumni indicated former coach Nick Saban could be a candidate. Shaquille O'Neal, the four-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer who played for the Tigers from 1989 to 1992, said he heard LSU may be in talks Saban about a return to Baton Rouge.\"I heard through the grapevine that they were having conversations with Nick Saban,\" O'Neal told Us Weekly. \"That'd be awesome if we can bring Nick back.\"Verge Ausberry, the school's interim athletic director, quickly put that notion to rest.\"Nick Saban and I have a standing conversation probably every two or three weeks,\" Ausberry said on 104.5 ESPN. \"We're good friends, first of all. He's a person I admire a lot. Coach Saban was joking. No way he's coming back to football, okay? Miss Terry's not going to let him. That's not going to happen. Let's get that out of the way soon, because if he was and he was interested, I would drive down there and pick him up right now.\"Saban, 74, led LSU from 2000-04, capturing a national championship before departing for the NFL. He returned to college football in 2007 at Alabama, building one of the most dominant dynasties with six more national titles before retiring in 2023. This past weekend on ESPN's College GameDay, Saban addressed speculation of a potential return to coaching and emphasized that tradition alone does not guarantee success in modern college football.\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"You've got all these external factors that are constantly changing,\" Saban said. \"Whether it's the transfer portal, how much you can pay guys, revenue sharing, what kind of collective do you have? So, traditionally, how have you been able to adapt to that? ... Some of the traditional jobs, like LSU, that people always looked at as one of the best jobs, have they adapted to all these things like they need to to continue to be one of the best jobs in the country?\"\nSaban later clarified that he has no plans to return to coaching.For O'Neal, the focus remains on patience and optimism for LSU's next hire. \"We're just gonna sit and see who they choose,\" he said. \"I know it will definitely be a winner and I know it'll be somebody that's in line with our culture. I know it's somebody who's going to bring us back to winning. We realize if you lose more than two games, we don't get a significant bowl game.\"\nLSU fired Brian Kelly Oct. 26 after a 5-3 start in his fourth season. Kelly finished 34-14, with a single SEC Championship Game appearance, but was unable to get the Tigers to the College Football Playoff to contend for a national title. The decision led to the resignation of athletic director Scott Woodward, who had fallen out of favor with LSU stakeholders, including Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\n            ",

Status quo in this series prior, however, was to ride the RedHawks, who won and covered both reg season meetings in 2023-24,\" SportsLine's legendary college football handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Once again, Chuck Martin has Miami straightened out for the stretch run, now 19-3 SU and 16-6 vs. the spread in MAC action into the weekend. Also, ex-Baylor/Toledo dual-threat transfer QB Dequan Finn now making his presence felt for Martin after positing his best numbers of the season (312 yards of total offense) in the 26-17 win over WMU . Wins and covers in five straight suggest Martin has Miami primed again for the stretch.\" Bet on college football at FanDuel Sportsbook:76ers money line vs. Bulls (-104)Both of these teams are off to unexpected 5-1 starts despite the fact that Paul George hasn't played yet for Philadelphia and Coby White is yet to suit up for Chicago. White (calf) remains out for the Bulls and Ayo Dosunmu (quad) is listed as questionable, so backcourt depth might be a concern. George (knee) has also been ruled out, but Joel Embiid should be fresh after being rested on Sunday against the Nets. The backcourt of Tyrese Maxey and V.J. Edgecombe could pose serious problems for a Chicago defense that gave up 31 points to Jalen Brunson in a loss to the Knicks on Sunday. The model predicts that Philadelphia wins in 62% of simulations. Bet on the NBA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Duke -9.5 vs. Texas (-106)After landing the No. 1 recruiting class in the country for the third time in four seasons, Duke has a clear talent advantage over Texas. Sean Miller took Xavier to the NCAA Tournament in two of his last three seasons and also spent 12 year at Arizona, but he'll likely need a full recruiting cycle to get Texas back into contention. The Longhorns failed to cover in 10 of their last 13 games last season while the Blue Devils covered in 11 of their last 15. The model predicts that Duke covers in 59% of simulations. Bet on college basketball at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

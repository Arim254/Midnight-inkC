    "body": "\n        The Contemporary Baseball Era Committee has elected Jeff Kent into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, museum president Josh Rawitch announced Sunday at the Winter Meetings in Orlando.Kent was named on 14 of 16 ballots. Twelve votes are needed for induction. Others on the ballot this year were Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Carlos Delgado, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield and Fernando Valenzuela. As a reminder, there are two separate Hall of Fame votes each offseason and the one that generally comes to the forefront is the BBWAA vote. This Contemporary Era Hall of Fame vote is tantamount to a second chance for players who have lapsed off the BBWAA ballot. A 16-person panel met in person to discuss the merits of eight candidates before casting their ballots. The panel: \nHall of Famers Fergie Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony Perez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell, Robin YountExecutives Mark Attanasio, Doug Melvin, Arte Moreno, Kim Ng, Tony Reagins, Terry Ryan Media/historians Steve Hirdt, Tyler Kepner, Jayson StarkKent, 57, hit .290/.356/.500 (123 OPS+) in parts of 17 seasons along with 2,461 hits, 560 doubles, 377 home runs, 1,518 RBI, 1,320 runs and 55.4 WAR. He's the all-time leader in home runs by a second baseman. Kent played for the Giants for six seasons and amassed most of his career value there (31.6 WAR with San Francisco, while he didn't get more than 8.4 WAR with any other team). Kent hinted Sunday that he'd like to go in with a Giants logo on his plaque cap, citing his \"great moments in the Bay Area with those fans.\" It's also possible that the Hall will go with a blank logo, as he spent five years with the Mets, four with the Dodgers, two with the Astros, one with the Blue Jays and one with Cleveland.A five-time All-Star and four-time Silver Slugger, Kent won the National League MVP in 2000. \nIn 10 years on the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot, Kent never got higher than 46.5% of the vote. He was the victim of a crowded ballot and probably punished far too heavily for being a so-called one-dimensional player. He was one of the best hitting second baseman of all time, but defensive and baserunning metrics weren't kind to him and dragged down all-encompassing metrics like WAR. Speaking of, Kent ranks 19th in WAR among second basemen in baseball history and he's now the 21st Hall of Famer at the position. As noted, he's first in home runs at the position and ranks third among second basemen in RBI. He's also 12th in runs and 13th in hits.Kent will be inducted into the Hall  in July in Cooperstown, alongside the winners of the BBWAA vote that  will be announced in January. Among the candidates on the BBWAA's ballot are newcomers Ryan Braun and Cole Hamels, as well as holdovers like Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones, Alex Rodriguez, and more.\nBonds, Kent's former teammate, and Clemens both received fewer than five votes and, according to a new rule, they are now ineligible to appear on the next Contemporary Baseball Era Committee ballot in December 2028. The earliest they can appear on the ballot again is in December 2031. If they receive fewer than five votes again, they will no longer be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Sheffield and Valenzuela also got fewer than five votes. Murphy and Mattingly got six votes each while Delgado got nine.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 14, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 15 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Shedeur Sanders, QB, BrownsSanders has found his way onto the NFL radar and more importantly the Fantasy radar with an explosive Week 14 performance against the Titans. Only Josh Allen scored more Fantasy points than Sanders in Week 14. The rookie Browns quarterback nearly racked up 40 Fantasy points (38) with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns. He added a fourth touchdown on the ground where he also added 29 yards. If Sanders continues to find success in the screen game, on vertical passes and as a scrambler in the red zone, he could make his way onto the Fantasy radar this playoffs. Tony Pollard, RB, TitansThe Titans may have found something on the offensive side of the ball by leaning on Pollard in the run game. Against a stingy Browns run defense that has stopped almost every back it's faced, Pollard ripped off 161 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Perhaps more importantly, he obliterated any timeshare with Tyjae Spears on route to 25 carries. Pollard is worth scooping back up off the waiver wire for the stretch run.\nRyan Flournoy, WR, CowboysFlournoy put up big Fantasy numbers earlier this year when CeeDee Lamb was hurt and that was the case again in Week 14 after Lamb left with a concussion. Flournoy racked up 113 receiving yards on nine receptions and a touchdown. He also saw a whopping 13 targets despite not starting the game. Flournoy could continue to be a surprising factor if Lamb is forced to miss time with a concussion. He may be worth firing up as your Flex in Week 15 if Lamb is out. Harold Fannin Jr., TE, BrownsIf Fannin is still on your waiver wire, and he remains there in many leagues, it's time to scoop him up. Fannin is a favorite for Sanders and the Browns pass game is starting to heat up a bit. He racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets via eight receptions in Week 14. He's worth starting as an every-week TE. \nTim Patrick, WR, JaguarsTrevor Lawrence continues to make major strides in Liam Coen's passing game over the last three games and that's good news for Jaguars receivers. With Brian Thomas Jr. failing to take hold of the role he earned in his rookie season -- albeit mostly with Mac Jones at quarterback and in an entirely different scheme -- Patrick was able to stand out in Week 14. Patrick finished with 78 yards on five catches and a touchdown. Given the injury situation with the Jaguars receivers this year and the steady improvement in the pass game, he's worth a speculative stash and add in deep leagues. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin wasn't asked about all of the outside noise following the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens that propelled Pittsburgh into first place in the AFC North. But Aaron Rodgers was, and the veteran quarterback didn't mince works while addressing the recent speculation regarding his coach. \"Means maybe you guys will shut the hell up for a week,\" Rodgers said. Rodgers played a big role in Pittsburgh's win that should quiet some of the noise surrounding his coach, at least for now. He threw for 284 yards that included the game-winning, 38-yard score to running back Jaylen Warren. Rodgers, who turned 42 last week, also ran for his first touchdown since joining the Steelers. \nOn Sunday, the Steelers showed a resolve that has become synonymous with Tomlin's teams over the years. Despite its recent losses, the growing outside noise and facing a team that ran roughshod over them their their previous two meetings, the Steelers made enough plays on both sides of the ball to get a much-needed win that put them back into first place in the AFC North with four weeks to go. \n\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said afterward. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. ... Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"Tomlin has received criticism for not having more success in the playoffs during his first 18 years as the Steelers' coach. A hallmark of Tomlin's tenure has been his ability to field competitive teams year in and year out -- regardless of the circumstances -- while never having a losing season. Pittsburgh's resolve undoubtedly played a role in Sunday's win, which has now put the 7-6 Steelers back in the driver's seat in terms of winning the North and the subsequent playoff spot that comes with it. Of the Steelers' final four opponents, only the Lions (whom they will face in Week 16) have a winning record. \nWhile Tomlin surely still has his detractors, the noise regarding him and his future with the Steelers should be dialed back this week as Pittsburgh readies itself for a prime time matchup against the suddenly-surging Dolphins. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Juventus lost 2-1 on Sunday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona against Napoli and showed that the work of the coach, Luciano Spalletti, needs more time. The Azzurri won thanks to the brace of former Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who joined Napoli in the summer of 2025, and proved that Antonio Conte's side are back on track and now leading the Serie A standings with a one-point margin on Inter. On the other hand, Juventus showed that they are still struggling to create chances and suffered, despite scoring one goal in the second half with Kenan Yildiz, well assisted by USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie. The team coached by Spalletti probably played their worst match of the season, and some numbers showed all the concerns of the fanbase and the manager.\"We didn't produce as much as we could, but we need to sit down and talk because we still showed the same issues. In my opinion, we can do better than today, we gave them an incredible number of chances. If you don't lead it yourself, you end up being a passenger to others who make decisions and you have to adapt. Every time they get a set piece, they make a block, we couldn't find countermeasures. Maybe we allowed them to get too comfortable, but these are all decisions that have to be taken on the spot and the result depends on the decision you make\", he said during the post-match press conference. The injury of Dusan Vlahovic, who will be out for several weeks after undergoing surgery, underlined the poor impact of Jonathan David this season, who struggled and failed to create chances to score in the second half. With his contract expiring in the summer of 2026, Vlahovic must soon clarify his future, as Juventus need to know whether they can count on him moving forward and given his performances and impact this season, it's clear they desperately do.\nThe Napoli match was more than disappointing for Spalletti, who lost his first game since he was hired to replace Igor Tudor on Oct. 30. Since then, Juventus won four matches and drew three in all competitions before losing to Napoli on Sunday, a match that showed they still need much more work. It was clear how much they struggled in the attacking phase: their 0.24 xG against Napoli was their lowest of the season, matched by season-worst totals in touches inside the box (eight) and shots (five). Juventus posted their poorest attacking numbers of the campaign against Conte's side, showing they are still firmly a work in progess. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the end, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee took the path of least resistance, bringing head-to-head into the conversation for the first time this season in their final placement of Miami over Notre Dame for the last at-large spot in Sunday's 12-team bracket.Ninth-ranked Alabama did not move despite a 21-point loss to Georiga in the SEC Championship Game, centering the discussion on the Hurricanes and Fighting Irish for the last spot. Miami entered the final rankings at No. 12, while Notre Dame was No. 10.Both teams were idle during conference championship weekend.\"We felt like the way BYU performed in their championship game, a second loss to Texas Tech in a similar fashion, was worthy of Miami moving ahead of them in the rankings,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said Sunday. \"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison. … The one metric we had to fall back on was the head to head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"Yurachek said Duke's win over Virginia and the idea of the ACC being excluded from the bracket entirely \"had absolutely no impact\" on the decision to include Miami at No. 10.\n\"Our charge is to rank the top 25 teams, then you fill out the 5 highest-ranked conference champions and seven at-large spots for the bracket,\" Yurachek said.Miami ended the season on a four-game winning streak with a margin of victory at 27.5 points per game. The Cougars, after losing to Texas Tech on Nov. 1, had won three straight at a 21 points per game clip prior to Saturday's 34-7 beatdown at the hands of the Red Raiders. The metrics were extremely tight when it comes to Miami's case against Notre Dame (10-2) and BYU (11-2) on paper. Game control was this committee's preferred metric as we've seen the last four weeks of rankings and ranked wins are supposed to mean something -- and they did during final deliberations.\nIn terms of common opponents as it relates to Notre Dame specifically, Miami beat NC State 41-7, Syracuse 38-10, Stanford 42-7 and Pittsburgh 38-7. And the Hurricanes beat three of the four common opponents shared with Notre Dame by an even wider margin.Following Tuesday night's penultimate rankings, Yurachek left the door open for the Hurricanes. A loss for BYU placed Miami right behind Notre Dame for the first time during this playoff discussion and was the final data point needed for the boost.\"The management committee during the offseason provided some clarification to some comments that were made last year, and indeed idle teams can move following the results of the championship games,\" Yurachek said earlier this week. \"And how they impact the teams that are around those that play in the championship game and data such as strength of schedule, teams that may be idle. So yes, teams that are idle can move up or down.\"\nMiami will travel to seventh-seeded Texas A&M in the opening round.\n            ",

Now that the dust has settled on the regular season and conference championship weekend, we know the 12 teams that will compete for the national title.It comes as no surprise that Indiana secured the top overall seed after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. It's the highest ranking in program history as the Hoosiers enter the postseason as legitimate national contenders, fresh off their first outright conference title in 80 years.Ohio State didn't fall far. The Buckeyes, looking to defend their 2024 national championship, landed at No. 2, followed by SEC champion Georgia at No. 3 and Big 12 champion Texas Tech at No. 4. Those four teams earn opening-round byes.Oregon (No. 5), Ole Miss (No. 6), Texas A&M (No. 7) and Oklahoma (No. 8) will each host first-round games.The top eight was mostly locked entering Sunday's selection show. Beyond that is where the intrigue surfaced. Alabama wasn't punished for its lopsided loss in the SEC title game, holding firm at No. 9. That sets up a first-round rematch with Oklahoma, which beat the Crimson Tide earlier this season.The real controversy came at No. 10, where Miami edged Notre Dame for the final at-large bid despite trailing the Irish in every previous set of rankings.For the first time ever, two Group of Five teams reached the playoff. No. 11 Tulane earned its bid by winning the American Conference, while No. 12 James Madison benefited from ACC chaos to slide in as Sun Belt champion.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma: 8 p.m. | ABC/ESPNGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner -- : 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner -- : 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Chiefs have lost three of their last four since rising to a season-high two games above .500 and are in serious danger of missing the playoffs for the first time during the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid era. They desperately need to come away with a win here to keep their season alive.Houston captured a much-needed victory over the division rival Indianapolis Colts last week to improve to 7-5. The Texans have now won four games in a row since falling to 3-5 on the season, and now they have their quarterback, C.J. Stroud, back in the lineup. They're still on the outside of the playoff picture and looking in, though, so they also need to keep stacking victories to remain in the hunt for the postseason.\n        \n            \n                Week 14 NFL playoff picture: Which teams can be eliminated -- and which matchups will reshape the race\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will come away with the win?

Kansas City is 6-6 and in 10th place in the AFC. The Chiefs probably need to win all five of their games down the stretch of the season to even make the playoffs. They can maybe go 4-1 and still have a chance to get into the dance. They begin with this game against Houston, then finish out December and early January with games against the Chargers, Titans, Broncos and Raiders. There should be two gimme wins on that schedule against Tennessee and Vegas, but the other three contests are difficult matchups against playoff hopefuls. It's not going to be easy to make the needed run for a postseason spot.Texans playoff hopes. Houston is 7-5 and in eighth place in the AFC. The Texans have more paths to the postseason than do the Chiefs because not only can they compete for a wild card berth, but they can also potentially win the AFC South. The Jaguars and Colts are only a game ahead of the Texans at 8-4 apiece. Houston has this game against Kansas City, followed by games against the Cardinals, Raiders, Chargers and Colts to close out the season. They should be able to beat Arizona and Vegas, but again, the other three games are difficult ones against playoff hopefuls. It won't be easy for them to make the needed run for the postseason, either.Kansas City's O-line injuries. The Chiefs will be without both of their starting tackles for this game. Josh Simmons went on injured reserve with a wrist injuries and Jawaan Taylor has already been ruled out with triceps and knee issues. They could also potentially be without guard Trey Smith, who has yet to practice this week due to an ankle injury. That'd leave them down three important starts in front of Patrick Mahomes. Houston's dominant defense. The Texans are shutting down everyone in their path right now. Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, in particular, are totally taking over games, while the rest of the defensive front is also making things incredibly difficult for opposing offenses and the secondary's coverage has been remarkably sticky throughout the year. This is a unit playing at an extraordinarily high level at a key moment of the season, and given the matchup and Kansas City's injury issues up front, could pose a significant challenge for the Chiefs. Chiefs vs. Texans prediction, pick\nI'm going down with the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid ship. \nPick: Chiefs 23, Texans 16 | (Kansas City -3.5, Under 41.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Following a regular season filled with drama and intense conference championship battles, the top programs now shift their attention to the CFP, aiming for a shot at college football's ultimate prize.After Indiana's incredible Big Ten title victory over Ohio State, the Hoosiers enter this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall very far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opens with four first-round games on Friday, Dec. 19, and Saturday, Dec. 20, before advancing to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma: 8 p.m. | ABC/ESPNGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee was never going to please everyone with its 2025 bracket. The decision to hold Notre Dame out of the 12-team field was a move that left the Fighting Irish and much of the college football world stunned. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua said Notre Dame feels as though a playoff berth was \"stolen\" from its players after its controversial slide behind Miami in the final top 25 rankings.Hours after learning it would not be included in the 12-team CFP bracket, Notre Dame announced it will not participate in bowl season.\"As a team, we've decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,\" Notre Dame wrote in a statement. \"We appreciate all the support from our families and fans, and we're hoping to bring the 12th national title to South Bend in 2026.\" The Fighting Irish entered conference championship week on the right side of the projected cut line and two spots ahead of the Hurricanes in the rankings. Neither team played a game this week, yet the committee felt it had enough evidence from the season-long results to swap them and put Miami in the field as the No. 10 seed.\n\"There is no explanation that could possibly be given to explain the outcome,\" Bevacqua said to Yahoo Sports. \"As I said to Marcus (Freeman), one thing is for sure: Any rankings or show prior to this last one is an absolute joke and a waste of time. Why put these young student-athletes through these false emotions just to pull the rug out from underneath them having not played a game in two weeks and then a group of people in a room shatter their dreams without explanation? We feel like the playoff was stolen from our student-athletes.\"This marks the second time in as many weeks that Notre Dame dropped in the rankings in favor of another CFP contender. Alabama leaped over the Fighting Irish at the end of the regular season despite winning by a smaller margin over Auburn than Notre Dame did over Stanford. Marcus Freeman's team won 10 games in a row but fell out of favor with the committee down the stretch, leading to one of the most questionable snubs of the playoff era.\"My feelings and the feelings here are just shock and, really, an absolute sense of sadness for our student-athletes,\" Bevacqua said. \"Overwhelming shock and sadness. Like a collective feeling that we were all just punched in the stomach.\"\nMiami's head-to-head win over Notre Dame in Week 1 proved decisive in determining which of the two bubble teams earned the final at-large playoff berth. The question facing the committee is why it took until Dec. 7 for that result to matter. The Fighting Irish ranked ahead of the Hurricanes in every set of CFP rankings before Sunday.The committee's explanation was that the head-to-head comparison only came into effect once the two teams were separated by one spot.\"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said. \"The one metric we had to fall back on was the head-to-head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"\n            ",

It was Daniels' first game back from dislocating that same left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. After throwing an interception to Minnesota edge defender Andrew Van Ginkel, Daniels was trying to chase down Van Ginkel when Isaiah Rodgers (legally) came in and shoved Daniels to the ground.\nDaniels was in clear pain leaving the field, and Marcus Mariota came in on the ensuing drive; Mariota's first drive also ended in an interception. Daniels entered the medical tent and emerged with a towel over his head and without the arm sleeve he had been wearing over his elbow. Washington ruled him questionable to return.Daniels suffered a plethora of injuries this season. He sprained his knee in a Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed the next two games. He came back and helped lead the Commanders to a Week 5 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but Washington lost in Week 6 to the Chicago Bears, and in Week 7, Daniels suffered a hamstring strain in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game before returning in Week 9, when he suffered the dislocated elbow.Despite entering Week 14 with a 3-9 record, Washington wanted Daniels to return when medically cleared to help him gain reps and build toward next season. Daniels had nearly a week and a half of limited practices before being a full participant Thursday and Friday ahead of the Vikings game.\n\"I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,\" Quinn said on Nov. 24. \"It's a skill, just like throwing and processing. And so, all those things are important.\"\n            \n    ",

Eight teams have three wins or fewer on the year. Looking forward to Week 15, Commanders at Giants is the game expected to have the greatest impact on the 2026 NFL Draft order.As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:\n1. New York Giants (2-11)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York is on a Bye this week, so there were not any NFL Draft stakes on the line. 2. Las Vegas Raiders (2-11)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas kept it close in the first half, but slowly bled out over the course of the evening. 3. Tennessee Titans (2-11)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEIn a battle of top-5 overall projected teams, Tennessee emerged victorious over Cleveland with the snow falling. \n4. Cleveland Browns (3-10)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland made a valiant effort at a comeback down two scores to the Titans, but poorly executed a two-point conversion. 5. New Orleans Saints (3-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRTyler Shough was far from perfect as a passer, but showed a lot of toughness and determination on his two rushing touchdowns. The rookie has given New Orleans some reason for optimism. 6. Washington Commanders (3-10)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington went down without as much as a whimper Sunday versus the struggling Vikings. Jayden Daniels returned to the lineup, but did not solve the team's offensive issues. \n7. New York Jets (3-10)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets lost seven straight games to open the season, but have shown some life over the past five games. The team was on life support Sunday, however, as the game against Miami was never really competitive. 8. Arizona Cardinals (3-10)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBThe Cardinals are limping to the finish line with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. Arizona has a decision to make at quarterback this offseason. 9. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (4-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta's first-round pick continues to climb, which only benefits the Rams. Los Angeles is looking at a situation where they could theoretically make a play for the heir apparent to Matthew Stafford while simultaneously contending for the NFC. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Burrow returned from injury in hopes of keeping the team's playoff chances alive, but the dream may be dead with this week's loss to Buffalo. 11. Minnesota Vikings (5-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy managed the game just as he had done at Michigan. He was not the driving force on offense, but he avoided the critical errors that he had been accumulating in recent weeks. Minnesota put an end to a four-game losing streak. 12. Miami Dolphins (6-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami's rebound has been one of the most improbable stories of the season. The Dolphins have won five of their past six games to force their way back into the AFC Playoff picture. \n13. Baltimore Ravens (6-7)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBThe AFC North is typically a competitive division with multiple playoff representatives. In 2025, it is trending toward only the division winner emerging.14. Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas' three-game win streak came to an abrupt end Thursday night against a desperate Lions team. The Cowboys are exactly .500 with four games to play.15. Kansas City Chiefs (6-6)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City hosted the surging Texans on Sunday Night Football. 16. Carolina Panthers (7-6)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina is tied atop the NFC South after the Buccaneers' loss to the Saints. The two teams play each other twice over the final four weeks.\n17. Houston Texans (7-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe red-hot Texans traveled to Kansas City on \"Sunday Night Football.\"18. Detroit Lions (8-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit knocked off Dallas on Thursday night to keep its NFC North chances alive. 19. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh has taken over sole possession of first place in the AFC North after hanging on to beat the Ravens on Sunday.20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers continue on their downward spiral, as the team has now lost four of their past five games. The division is very much attainable with three games remaining against the Falcons and Panthers. \n21. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-5)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLJacksonville took a commanding lead in the division as the Colts continue reeling from Daniel Jones' injury. The real winner is the Jets, who acquired Indianapolis' first-round pick as part of the Sauce Gardner deal. 22. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers host Philadelphia on \"Sunday Night Football.\"23. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia won four games to open the season, then lost two games, then won four straight, and is now on a two-game losing streak. Will a new win streak begin against the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football\"?24. Chicago Bears (9-4)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago battled back from a two-score deficit against Green Bay, but it was too little, too late in the end. \n25. Buffalo Bills (9-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRIt was a classic Joe-Burrow vs. Josh Allen showdown Sunday in Buffalo. The Bills keep pace in the AFC East. 26. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco rides a three-game win streak into its bye before returning in Week 15 against the Titans.27. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland is not going to get a top-half-of-the-round pick from Jacksonville. The Jaguars have a firm grip on the divisional lead; the Browns will have to wait to learn where they will be picking.\n28. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBGreen Bay was able to fend off Chicago not only in Sunday's game, but also the NFC North divisional race. The two teams will meet again before the end of the season. 29. Seattle Seahawks (10-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRAtlanta served as a thorn in the side of Seattle in the first half, but the Seahawks pulled away for a decisive win.30. New England Patriots (11-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye has yet to throw for 300 yards in a game, but the Patriots will carry the league's best record for at least one more week.31. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLSeattle and Los Angeles are deadlocked in the NFL's most competitive division. Three of four NFC West teams have at least nine wins.32. Denver Broncos (11-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTSunday was just the third time this season in which a Broncos outcome was decided by one score or less. Yet they have the league's best record.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs will host the Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football in a pivotal matchup for both teams.

New users receive 20 100% profit boost token with your first $1 bet:Rashee Rice, Chiefs (+125)The Chiefs are making up for lost time without Rice, as Kansas City was without its most dynamic wide receiver for the first six weeks due to a suspension. The 25-year-old has five touchdowns in six games this year, including scoring twice in Kansas City's 31-28 loss to the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. Rice has at least seven targets in all six games, including back-to-back games with 12 targets, and he's averaging 9.8 targets per game as Mahomes' top option in the passing attack. The model expects this usage to continue with the Chiefs facing a situation where if they lose Sunday, they'll be in a challenging position to reach the postseason. The model views Rice as the top candidate to find the end zone on Sunday Night Football.Click here to bet on Rice as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+155)Hunt scored a touchdown in four straight games before having his streak snapped last week against Dallas, but Hunt remains one of the most reliable scorers in the NFL. The 5-11, 216-pound back has the size to be utilized at and near the goal line, which has resulted in five touchdowns over his last five games. Even with Isiah Pacheco back from a knee injury last week, Hunt played 64% of snaps compared to Pacheco's 30%, and he had 14 carries compared to Pacheco's three. Expect a heavier Hunt usage again this week with Hunt averaging a reliable 4.0 yards per carry, and the model projects value in Hunt at +155 odds to score on what's likely to be a chilly Sunday evening in Kansas City. Click here to bet on Hunt as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in free bets if your first $5 bet wins: Jayden Higgins, Texans (+400)Higgins was an early second-round pick, No. 34 overall, in the 2025 NFL Draft, and he's showcased why, especially in recent weeks. The 6-4, 215-pound receiver has a touchdown in two of his last four games. After seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in four straight contests, averaging seven targets per game during that stretch. Those targets have led to production, with more than 40 yards in three of four games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. Kansas City's game plan will likely revolve around containing Nico Collins, which creates opportunities for Higgins. At +400 odds at BetMGM and given his increased involvement lately, the model sees strong value in playing Higgins in Sunday Night Football anytime TD bets. Click here to bet on Higgins as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Want more Week 14 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Chiefs vs. Texans in Week 14 Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        The Big Ten and Big 12 meet in the 2025 Alamo Bowl when the No. 16 USC Trojans take on the TCU Horned Frogs in the final game on the Tuesday college football bowl schedule. USC went 9-3 and was in the CFP mix until a loss to Oregon on Nov. 22 ended any realistic chances. TCU went 8-4 and ended the regular season on a two-game winning streak. USC quarterback Jayden Maiava is playing, but he won't have his top three targets as receivers Ja'Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon and tight end Lake McRee have all opted out. TCU's most notable absence is quarterback Josh Hoover, who is heading to the transfer portal.Kickoff from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas is at 9 p.m. ET. The Trojans are 4.5-point favorites in the latest USC vs. TCU odds, while the over/under is 56.5.

The total has dropped since opening at 58.5, with absences such as Hoover and Lemon factoring into that. USC, however, should still be able to move that ball with Maiava leading the charge. Freshman receiver Tanook Hines should be able to step up and be a top target, while USC's run game remains in good shape with King Miller leading that way. The Horned Frogs have a capable backup quarterback in Ken Seals who can step in. Seals didn't play much this year, but has over 700 career passing attempts dating back to his time at Vanderbilt from 2020-23. TCU receiver Eric McAlister, an NFL prospect, has decided to play, giving TCU another spark on offense. SportsLine's model is projecting 65 combined points as the Over hits well over 60% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins TCU vs. USC, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

The CBS Sports second-team All-American will be among the most talented defensive players in the portal when it comes the final two years of his eligibility. Michigan is a logical destination for Daley considering that the Wolverines just hired former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham.Daley suffered a non-contact injury in the penultimate game of the regular season that knocked him out for the remainder of the campaign. The lower-leg issue brought a premature end to a dominant season in which Daley was, at the time, the national leader in tackles for loss.In his transfer announcement, Daley said that he will be fully healthy by spring, which sets him up to contribute at his new school in Week 1 of the 2026 season.\"I'd like to thank my teammates, coaches, and Ute Nation for the incredible support these past two seasons,\" Daley said. \"The experiences I've had here will last a lifetime. Who I consider to be my family has grown significantly and I will always cherish those relationships. This rehab has given me time to pray and reflect on my future. I will be entering the transfer portal fully healthy by the spring of 2026 with two years of eligibility remaining. I'll always love Utah. Go Utes!\"\nDaley's 17.5 tackles for loss were the most in college football through 11 games, and he ranked second nationally in sacks with 11.5 before missing the season finale. Both marks were career highs for the breakout star, who had zero career starts heading into 2025. Daley was also the first Utah player since 2017 to record strip-sacks in consecutive games, and he ranked fifth in program history with 91 sack yards on the year.That upward trajectory makes Daley a rising NFL Draft prospect. He could flourish next year if he remains healthy and fits well in his destination program's defensive system.That is what makes a potential transfer to Michigan so compelling. Daley developed over the last two years under Whittingham's tutelage, and while the Wolverines' new coach has yet to construct his assistant staff, the continuity that would come with a move to Ann Arbor figures to benefit Daley. He could settle in as the leader of Michigan's defensive front and would face stiffer competition in the Big Ten than in the Big 12, allowing him to refine his skills before departing for the NFL.\nWhile the Wolverines project to be in play during Daley's recruitment, any program with a need up front and a wealth of NIL resources could make a push for one of the top defensive players in the 2026 transfer cycle.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- In the afterglow of this exceptional triumph, it is perhaps worth reflecting on how implausible such a result might have seemed a quarter hour through. Given that so many of Arsenal's recent wins by one-goal margins have been batterings in disguise, perhaps it is appropriate that obliterating a paper tiger of a title contender should see the Gunners dodge a rather nasty paper cut.It is not so much that Aston Villa were necessarily better than Arsenal in the Gunners' 4-1 win on Tuesday. Their win wasn't inevitable. It certainly seemed, however, that Unai Emery had Mikel Arteta's number. Villa would absorb the strength of the first press, find a way of drawing Arsenal out of position and spring their transition threats.Ollie Watkins continued to torment his boyhood club, his ability to spin out of duels making for a forward who can get as much joy against William Saliba as anyone else. As they had three and a half weeks ago, Villa found ways to get Watkins quick ball in behind and he found ways to get shots away. Before the weirdness of garbage time, Arsenal had only allowed one shot worth over 0.5 xG in a Premier League game this season. That had gone to Watkins at Villa Park and he followed that up with an almost as frustrating miss early on, contriving to skew wide after brilliant work to get him into a scoring position.The muscularity with which Ezri Konsa stripped possession from Viktor Gyokeres and the precision of the pass that followed exemplified the excellence of Villa's start. Emery knew which duels his team were going to dominate and this game had a way of funnelling itself into the positions ,that would allow them to impose themselves. There are few players even in the Premier League who Mikel Merino bounces off. In the first half he could get no purchase on Amadou Onana, the press beater in chief. He was at his dynamic best and Arsenal were without the one player who might have been able to stop him, Declan Rice sidelined with a minor knee injury. Even if Rice had been blown by, he would have had the recovery pace to win the second duel. When Merino was taken out of a move, he was not coming back.\nPerhaps if Onana had been able to make it back out for the second half, this game would have been different. \"Maybe it didn't help us that Onana is injured,\" said Emery. \"He is important for us in set pieces and in the middle.\" That loss of fizz through the middle, already lessened due to the suspension of Boubacar Kamara, hit hard. Before Onana's exit there was a very real risk that the verticality of Villa's passing would rip through the Arsenal backline. \nThe hosts found themselves in an almighty bind. They are a very good pressing team and it is the right thing for very good pressing teams to push for those high regains. That much would be apparent in the second half, but in the first, the margins were razor-thin.  Gabriel chased Morgan Rogers right into the heart of the Villa area. He was inches away from a steal that would surely have led to Martin Odegaard's opener. Instead, he couldn't quite nick the ball, and in a flash, Onana was driving up the field. Had he not sold himself short with a blatant dive, he might have been able to create an even better chance for Villa than the ones they spurned.Arteta knew the danger his team were in. \"The moment you allow them to attack your back is a big problem because they have runners from inside, they have people that can pick up passes from deep positions, they have players in the last line that are excellent at making the runs, pulling shoulders and attacking your backs. And you have to control that because every time you give the ball away, they have the capacity to do that,\" he said. With 45 minutes played, it rather felt like Arsenal were playing with fire. In the second, they strode purposefully onto the coals. There were adjustments to the press, what Arteta termed some \"behaviors\" changing. There was no consideration given, however, to what might have seemed the most natural response of any coach in that position. No dialling down. No stepping back. Arsenal would chase the ball with even more intensity, commit even more in pursuit of the regains. \n\"I really like that,\" said Arteta, \"because you're going to go through different patches and periods against top opposition like Villa and then you still have the ability to come out on the game and deserve to win it.\"The opener might not have come from Arsenal's chasing -- set piece again, set piece again as they say 'round these parts -- but the killer second was a vindication of their aggression. Youri Tielemans might have thought he had broken through the lines but slamming into Jadon Sancho like a toddler in a bumper car came Odegaard, who recovered possession more frequently than anyone on the pitch tonight. Dancing feet took him away from John McGinn and suddenly those gaps up the gut that Villa had been exploiting were opening up for them. Martin Zubimendi cruised through.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            All that was needed from then on was to restore some xG balance to the world. For most of December, Arsenal couldn't hit a barn door from six yards out. Of course, the month ended with Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus bending them in from the edge of the area. Scoring returns from range that even Steph Curry couldn't keep up propelled Villa on a title tilt, they ended this game scoring one of the three <0.8 xG shots they took.\nEven with those unmissable chances Villa found a way to spurn, they still somehow ended up outperformed on the xG front. Rarely does a statistic so compellingly speak to the difference between two teams. Even when Arsenal indulged their madness, they couldn't make themselves the inferior team. Even when their plan seemed so ill-suited to their opponents, they were simply able to do it better and prove themselves to be greatly superior.\n            ",

While the Browns were complicating things for the Steelers in their quest to wrap up the AFC North in Week 17 -- and, in the process, realistically falling out of range for the top two and possibly three quarterbacks -- the Raiders were outclassed by the Giants, the other two-win team entering the penultimate week of the 2025 regular season.That result puts Las Vegas in pole position to select Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. There will be debate about whether Mendoza is worth the top pick (he is) or whether other quarterbacks could challenge him for QB1 (they can in theory, but Mendoza is the surest thing as of late December). Either way, a year after passing on Shedeur Sanders and Jaxson Dart at No. 6 in favor of running back Ashton Jeanty, the Raiders have no choice but to draft a quarterback this spring.After that, it's worth watching how the rest of the class shakes out. A long list of quarterbacks has already opted to return to school in 2026 -- either staying put or entering the transfer portal -- which could push QB-needy teams like the Jets, Cardinals, Browns, Saints (though Tyler Shough increasingly looks like the future there), Dolphins and even the Steelers to explore trade-up scenarios for prospects such as Dante Moore or Ty Simpson.In this mock, there are no trades, but three quarterbacks come off the board in the top five, leaving the Browns -- who own two first-round picks in 2026 -- on the outside looking in. Instead, Cleveland addresses wide receiver and offensive line, signaling a commitment to the two rookie quarterbacks it drafted last spring, at least for now.It also means the Cardinals, picking fifth, land Simpson as QB3 in the class -- the third time since 2018 that Arizona has used a high first-round pick on a franchise quarterback.\nElsewhere, the first round features five wide receivers, edge rushers and cornerbacks, along with four offensive tackles and two interior offensive linemen.OK, let's get to it.Note: This is the current NFL Draft order after Week 17 (via Tankathon).\nNFL Mock DraftRound 1The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors celebrated Christmas in style with a 126-116 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 25. But while picking up a victory in front of a large television audience was a prime opportunity for the Warriors to prove that they are still one of the NBA's top teams, Draymond Green said it was also a double-edged sword.Green lamented the human element of playing on Christmas Day, saying that it \"f----ing sucks\" to be away from family for most of the holiday. Few active players are as qualified to speak on the reality of Dec. 25 games than Green, who played his 11th Christmas game this year.\"Yes, it is an honor to be considered one of the great draws that is in the NBA,\" Green said on his podcast, \"The Draymond Green Show.\" \"To play on a day where everybody's watching is incredible. All of those things are great. But two things can be true at once. Playing on Christmas Day also f---ing sucks. The reason it sucks is, number one, it can affect your mood. Number two, we are human beings and, just like everyone else, enjoy Christmas Day with their families. That kind of gets messed up for us.\"Green is not the only NBA star to speak up about the reality of Christmas games this year. Before he appeared in his record 20th Dec. 25 game, LeBron James said he would \"much rather be at home with my family.\" That honesty raised eyebrows and generated pushback from some fans who noted that playing on the holiday is essentially a badge of honor.\n\"I hate when people are like, 'It's an honor to play on Christmas Day. People should shut up,'\" Green said. \"No, you should shut up.\"Green posted seven points in the win over the Mavericks and was outscored by even of his Warriors teammates. It was his fourth consecutive game with single-digit points.\"For all of those who are like, 'You should be honored' -- honored to miss your family time?\" Green said. \"Honored to miss your kids opening gifts? Honored to leave your kid and go to work? Because no one works on Christmas Day. We're going to work. Everybody says it's this great honor. I just want to give you a little perspective. It's a great honor to go to work on Christmas Day?\"\nThere were five games on the NBA's 2025 Christmas Day schedule, and they delivered the high entertainment value that typically comes with the league's holiday slate. The most significant result of the day was the San Antonio Spurs' 117-102 statement win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, which asserted Victor Wembanyama and his squad as championship contenders. And in the nightcap, Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards combined for 100 points in a 142-138 overtime thriller between the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n            ",

Now, though, that commitment will, according to the Athletic, \"be deferred in the range of three-to-five years,\" with an unknown payout structure. The arrangement with Rendon will theoretically allow the Angels to be more active on the free-agent market or in assuming salary commitments via trade. The Angels initially signed Rendon prior to the 2020 season to a seven-year, $245 million free-agent contract coming off a strong tenure with the Nationals. While Rendon was highly productive during the abbreviated 2020 campaign, injuries and broad-based decline took firm hold thereafter. Through the first six years of Rendon's Angels tenure he put up a total WAR of just 3.9 at a cost of more than $200 million. Prior to joining the Angels, Rendon amassed a WAR of 34.2 in parts of seven seasons with Washington. As well, Rendon didn't play at all in 2025 after undergoing a second hip surgery in the spring, and he also appeared unlikely to play in 2026. Since 2021, Rendon has averaged just 41 games played per season. \nFrom the team standpoint, Rendon's Angels contract stands as one of the worst in MLB history. He's expected to retire once the buyout is complete, ESPN previously reported.As for the Angels, they presently have Christian Moore penciled in as their third baseman, but they may now pursue an upgrade at Rendon's former position. Available free agents include Eugenio Suárez and Alex Bregman, although the latter appears more likely to go to team better positioned to contend in 2026.

    "body": "\n        Without some of their best players as Declan Rice missed out with a knee injury, Arsenal were able to go five points clear atop the Premier League after defeating Aston Villa 4-1 at the Emirates Stadium with a four-minute double from Gabriel and Martin Zubimendi. Entering the match, Villa were the hottest team in the Premier League with eight consecutive league wins, including taking down Arsenal at Villa Park, but in the reverse fixture, Arsenal made a statement that they're the contenders to beat. Ollie Watkins would get a goal late on for Villa, but Arsenal's four goals in the second half blew the match wide open and quickly.Villa had their chances in the first half of the match, but as Arsenal grew into the clash, it became clear which team was controlling the match. After the goal in the 48th minute, Arsenal kept their feet on the gas, including an all-important goal for Gabriel Jesus. The Arsenal forward scored as soon as he entered the match, which is a statement to Arsenal's growing depth as they get healthy during the season. He's been working his way back to full fitness after suffering an ACL tear in January, and entering 2026 with Jesus in the squad will only increase the options that Arteta has at his disposal.Kai Havertz also made his return to the squad, although the German attacker didn't make it into this match, he's another player who will be key down the stretch for Arsenal as they look to capture their first Premier League title since 2003-04. Now having won four consecutive matches in the league, the Gunners are looking stay hot with contenders lurking. Manchester City can draw within two points of the Gunners when they face Sunderland on Thursday, but anticipation will grow for their clash with Arsenal on April 18, which could decide the league title if they continue at their current pace. City are linked to adding Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth who could provide Pep Guardiola with more options in the attack but Arteta has shown that after the Gunners added Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Eberechi Eze, and Piero Hincapie during he summer, their squad is deep enough to keep up with anyone in the league.\nFor Villa, despite this setback, they're in a great place entering the new year under Unai Emery, with a nine-point lead over Chelsea for a top-four place. Getting back into the Champions League is the goal for Villa, and even with losing, they aren't fully out of the title race in the Premier League due to trailing by six points, but this does throw a wrench in any title ambitions that they would've had.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana coach Curt Cignetti never minces words and delivered some of college football's most notable comments over his dominant, two-year stretch. From \"Google Me\" to not being surprised after a road win at Oregon, Cignetti's nature commands respect.Cignetti's boring-by-design, top-ranked and unbeaten Hoosiers are on the verge of battling blueblood Alabama for the first time in program history Thursday at The Rose Bowl. His players do not concern themselves with the Crimson Tide \"mystique\" coming in, he said.\"You probably know more about the mystique than they do,\" Cignetti said. \"Our guys just know what they see on tape.\"Blunt and succinct. The follow-up centered around the Hoosiers' path to College Football Playoff glory.\n\"The only goal right now is to have as good a day as we can today,\" Cignetti said. \"We've got progress to make in our preparation. When we get done today, this morning, with media, it's important we have a great day and that we have a realistic perspective what it takes to meet the challenge, gives us the best possibility. \"What you're talking about are things in the past, which I've probably fielded that question a hundred times, right? But it's a good question. It's great. There's a lot of excitement. But we're here to play in the playoff game and our 100 percent focus is on the here and now.\"The Alabama 'mystique'Alabama lost two of its final four regular-season games prior to the 34-24 win over Oklahoma in the CFP first round. Alabama trailed 17-0 in the first half of that one before Zabien Brown's interception return for a score late in the second quarter sparked a comeback.\nThere's nothing unnerving about an Alabama's rushing offense at 109.3 yards per game, which ranks 120th with inconsistent quarterback play. Only Texas Tech's Behren Morton brings a lower QBR than Ty Simpson, who did throw two touchdown passes in the CFP opener, among teams still left in the playoff.The Alabama \"mystique\" developed during Nick Saban's illustrious tenure, which included six national championship game appearances over a seven-year stretch at one point in the playoff era with three titles. The glamour deteriorated sometime thereafter after Alabama suffered two regular-season losses in 2022 and lost to Michigan at the goal line in overtime during a playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl in Saban's final game.Ironically, Alabama is back in that same setting this week, hoping to post its best win of the Kalen DeBoer era. The Crimson Tide have had a different look and overall makeup the last two years under their new coaching staff, a more finesse approach offensively and less aggression on the other side of the football.\nDeBoer did not appreciate Alabama receiving labels as soft after its season-opening loss at Florida State. Alabama responded by winning 10 of its next 11 games to reach the SEC Championship before a 21-point loss to Georgia brought the Crimson Tide to reality as the playoff's No. 9 seed.Cignetti's Hoosiers brought a far more predictable run to No. 1 with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza asserting himself as the frontrunner early after a win at Oregon and solidifying the honor with a final-second drive at Penn State and win over Ohio State in the Big Ten finale.\n            ",

As it turns out, their last franchise quarterback played a key role in developing their next one. Shough said that his conversations with Drew Brees earlier this season helped him hit the ground running as a starter.Shough, the No. 40 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, took just three snaps in the first seven weeks of the season but spent those first two months of his career gearing up for an opportunity to lead the offense. When he spoke with Brees, the future Hall of Famer assured him that he was on the right track.\"Being able to talk to Drew Brees midway through the season and get a really in-depth look at what his week looked like and his preparation,\" Shough said. \"And then also just trusting the plan that your coaches have out for you. When I got to talk to Drew and kind of compare and contrast to what I had been doing, it was really encouraging because I had been doing most all those things and I could implement some of the things that he was doing from a preparation standpoint.\"The Saints won at least 11 games in each of Brees' final four years in New Orleans. They have a sub-.500 record over the five years since his retirement, but the late-season surge with Shough under center suggests they could eventually return to the level of success they enjoyed during Brees' legendary career.\nThat newfound optimism is quite the shift for a franchise that appeared rudderless just a couple of months ago. The Saints stood at 1-7 before they inserted Shough into the lineup.\"I just really wanted to make sure whenever I was a backup that I wanted to overprepare and make sure that when I got my opportunity that it wasn't all of the sudden 'I'm starting now. I feel like I have to do so much more,'\" Shough said.\nWhile his five interceptions are the sign of a modest learning curve, Shough has largely acclimated to the NFL in short order. The former Louisville quarterback, who also made stops at Texas Tech and Oregon throughout a lengthy college career, ranks seventh among NFL quarterbacks in completion rate at 67.8%. He also passed for more than 300 yards in each of his last two games and has made an impact on the ground with 152 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 12-team College Football Playoff field will shrink from eight to four over two days of action, starting with a New Year's Eve showdown between (10) Miami and (2) Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. The marquee matchup marks the first time the two blue blood brands have faced off since the 2003 BCS National Championship. New Year's Day begins with (5) Oregon facing (4) Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. Later in the day, (1) Indiana will face (9) Alabama with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Crimson Tide became the first team in the expanded playoff format to win a game on the road when they knocked off (8) Oklahoma.The final quarterfinal matchup will feature (6) Ole Miss take on (3) Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs defeated the Rebels 43-35 earlier this season in Athens, which marked Ole Miss' first loss of the 2025 campaignAs the College Football Playoff continues, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate all the quarterfinal games through New Year's Day.All times Eastern\nCollege Football Playoff quarterfinal TV scheduleCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami vs. (2) Ohio State -- Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Miami won its first CFP game in program history in a low-scoring battle against Texas A&M on the road. The Hurricanes' reward? A date with reigning national champion Ohio State on New Year's Eve. The Buckeyes are fresh off their first loss of the season to Indiana in the Big Ten title game. Ohio State star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who happens to be from South Florida, will face a team and place he is familiar with. Smith has already talked about the 2003 Fiesta Bowl between Miami and Ohio State in the days leading up to the game.Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (4) Texas Tech -- Thursday at noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Oregon has a chance at CFP quarterfinal redemption after getting blown out against Ohio State last season in the Rose Bowl as the No. 1 overall seed. The Ducks are coming off a win over James Madison in the first round and will face a stout Texas Tech defense with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Red Raiders are making their first appearance in the CFP after winning the Big 12 title.Rose Bowl -- (9) Alabama vs. (1) Indiana -- Wednesday at 4 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Out of all the quarterfinal games on deck, this game has the chance to be the best one. Alabama is coming off a dramatic comeback win over Oklahoma in the first round, while Indiana is riding high on its best season in program history after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. Indiana is led by Heisman Trophy winner and potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, Fernando Mendoza. One of the questions to ponder: Will Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams be involved? He finished with just one catch for five yards against OU.\nSugar Bowl -- (6) OIe Miss vs. (3) Georgia -- Thursday at 8 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The last time Ole Miss played Georgia, Lane Kiffin was still on the sidelines. That obviously is no longer the case, as Kiffin accepted the job at LSU before the Rebels played in the CFP. Ole Miss defeated Tulane in the first round -- which also happened to be another rematch from the regular season -- for its first CFP win in program history. As for Georgia, quarterback Gunner Stockton made his first career start in last season's Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the new year just around the bend, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Hazen expects end to Marte trade rumors 'shortly'Mike Hazen, the Diamondbacks' top baseball operations executive, is ready to move on from trade talks involving second baseman Ketel Marte. Hazen said Tuesday that he anticipates putting \"an end\" to negotiations \"shortly.\" How shortly? \"I haven't figured that out yet,\" Hazen told MLB.com. \"But this isn't going to continue to linger. We need to focus on our offseason. Again, my gut this whole time was that [a Marte trade] wasn't going to happen, and I think it seems likely that that's the case and we want to focus on other things we need to do.\"Marte, 32, is a three-time All-Star who is under contract through at least the 2030 season. He's been subject to trade rumors this winter after raising the ire of his teammates last season. The Diamondbacks have been tied to free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, with some reports suggesting Arizona would be open to keeping Marte even if they land Bregman.\nReds still hoping to add outfielderThe Reds have already this offseason added outfielder JJ Bleday via free agency and outfielder Dane Myers via trade. Even so, Cincy is still in the market for outfield help, the Athletic reports. The Reds are likely to do that via trade, and more specifically they'll look to deal from the rotation in order to get another outfielder to put in their mix for 2026 and beyond. The Reds are coming off a 2025 campaign in which they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in a full season since 2013. However, they claimed the third and final wild-card spot in the National League despite an offense that ranked 26th in the majors in OPS+. Marlins, Dodgers pull off minor tradeThe Marlins have acquired outfielder Esteury Ruiz from the Dodgers in exchange for right-handed prospect Adriano Marrero, Miami announced on Monday evening. To make room for Ruiz on the 40-player roster, the Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment. \nRuiz, 26, has a .639 OPS and a -1.2 WAR across parts of four MLB seasons. In 2023 as a member of the A's, he led the American League with 67 stolen bases. Marrero, 18, worked 33 innings in the Dominican Summer League last season, his first in professional baseball. Okamoto in U.S. as posting window nears endJapanese first baseman Kazuma Okamoto, in keeping with the rules of the MLB-NPB posting system, must sign by 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4., when his 45-day posting window closes. With the clock running out, Okamoto is now in the U.S. to visit interested teams in person, Yahoo Japan reports. The Pirates, Padres, and Angels have previously been reported to have some level of interest in Okamoto.We ranked Okamoto, 29, as the 22nd-best free agent available this offseason. He's spent his entire career with the Yomiuri Giants and hit .322/.411/.581 with 15 home runs in 77 games around an injury to his non-throwing elbow in 2025. Okamoto has played third base most of his career, though he's seen more action at first in recent years, and is expected to stay there long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two months of the 2025-26 NBA season set up what could have been the greatest MVP race of all time. Nikola Jokić is currently on pace to set new single-season records for PER, BPM and Win Shares per 48 minutes. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ranks eighth, third and second all-time in those respective metrics, but is ahead of Jokić in EPM for the second consecutive season, which is relevant as EPM is the metric with by far the strongest predictive history when it comes to MVP. Looking for more straightforward measures of excellence? Jokić currently leads the NBA in both rebounds and assists while Gilgeous-Alexander's Oklahoma City Thunder are still on pace to go 70-12. Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging slightly less than one point per minute, which only Wilt Chamberlain and Joel Embiid (in just 39 games) have ever accomplished. Jokić is a couple of free throws shy of a 60-40-90 shooting season, which the NBA has never seen before. These are two of the greatest individual seasons of all time through two months.And yet, as things sit now, the MVP race between them is probably over. On Monday, Jokić suffered a knee injury that, in the moment at least, appeared potentially catastrophic. He was thankfully spared the worst outcomes. A hyperextended knee will keep him sidelined for at least a month, but it won't cost him the season. It will, however, almost certainly cost him a chance at a fourth MVP award.Jokić hasn't missed a game yet this season, playing in all 32 of Denver's contests to date, but let's say he's out until the end of January. The Nuggets have four back-to-backs in their January schedule, loading their slate with 18 total games between now and the beginning of February. That's the exact number of absences it takes to remove a player from award eligibility. If Jokić returns on Feb. 1, ironically against the Thunder, or any later, he's out of the MVP race. If he comes back sooner but misses games later on due to caution or other injuries, he'll fall out of the race. At this point, the odds of him playing 65 games are nearly zero.\nThat doesn't explicitly guarantee Gilgeous-Alexander wins MVP. He could get hurt too. But the gap between Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander and the eligible field is vast. Take EPM, the MVP predictor stat. Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league at +10.1. Jokić is second at +9.7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, who himself is almost certainly going to be ineligible having missed 13 games thus far, is third at +9. Nobody else is even a +6.Gilgeous-Alexander has the eighth-highest BPM of all time. The next best mark from this season belongs to Victor Wembanyama, who's ranked 115th. Luka Dončić is in third place for PER... at 95th all-time to Gilgeous-Alexander's third. I could give you 100 guesses and you'd probably never land on which current player comes the closest to Gilgeous-Alexander's second-place all-time Win Shares per 48 minutes ranking. It's Mark Williams... all the way down at 117th. In other words, there's a vast statistical canyon here. Gilgeous-Alexander is the NBA's second-leading scorer on the league's best team with all of the metrics in his favor. If he plays 65 games, he's going to win MVP.And that puts him in pretty rarified air. There are only 15 multi-time MVPs in league history, and of those 15, just 10 have reached two MVPs through their age-27 season: Bob Pettit, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokić. Not bad company to keep.\nHe would have two immediate obstacles to claiming a third. The first is history. No one since Larry Bird has won three straight MVPs. Not Jordan. Not James. Not Jokić. As we learned during Jokić's attempt at a third trophy, narratives swing hard against prospective three-peaters. And if Gilgeous-Alexander doesn't get his third next season, it gets far harder from there. Every MVP since James in 2012 has been between the ages of 24 and 28. The 2027-28 campaign will be Gilgeous-Alexander's age-29 season. The Thunder have already claimed back-to-back No. 1 seeds and are well on their way to a third, so it's possible that, by then, they're simply over the regular-season grind as an organization.But this is still a historically dominant scorer playing on a team that figures to be atop the league practically indefinitely. He's going to factor into most of the MVP races until the end of his prime and, as Jokić's injury this season shows, it doesn't take much to clear the field in the era of the 65-game minimum. Odds are, there's another MVP for Gilgeous-Alexander in here somewhere. The more he claims, the more unimpeachable his legacy becomes. There are nine three-time MVPs in history, five four-time winners, three five-time winners and a lone six-timer.For now, he's set up to win just his second trophy, but at this age and with this team, there's not really an upper-limit at play here. If he can make it through the next three months and change intact, Gilgeous-Alexander will already have more MVP trophies than Kobe Bryant. He'll match Stephen Curry, the player he's seemingly succeeded as the NBA's best point guard. And while championships are not assured, the Thunder are as well-positioned to compete for them moving forward as any team ever has been. \nIt's too early to really get into all-time rankings where Gilgeous-Alexander is concerned, but there are very, very few players who have ever accomplished what Gilgeous-Alexander is poised to do by the end of this season. We're watching an all-timer here, and if there's a silver lining to Jokić's injury, it's that it may well put Gilgeous-Alexander's greatness into perspective. He may be neck-and-neck with Denver's three-time MVP, but this year at least, he's head and shoulders above everyone else. For the next month or so, he will somewhat definitively be the NBA's best player and this spring, there's a trophy waiting to reward him for that.\n            ",

Allen has the Bills firmly in the playoff chase yet again after an MVP season last year, though it may be tough to catch the 11-2 Patriots at this point. Meanwhile, Burrow has missed most of the season due to a toe injury, but he returned on Thanksgiving last week and promptly led Cincy past Baltimore. Kickoff from Highmark Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET.

    "body": "\n        With the four weekday games from last week's holiday slate, your Week 14 NFL predictions should account for the rest advantages that teams have. Games like Bengals vs. Bills (-6), Ravens vs. Steelers (+6), Chiefs vs. Texans (+3.5) and Eagles vs. Chargers (+2.5) all feature teams with multiple days of rest over their opponent. While sportsbooks factored this in when setting the Week 14 NFL odds, having the edge in rest hasn't always been beneficial in regard to NFL spread success. Cincinnati, for example, who played on Thanksgiving Day, is 0-6 ATS over its last six games when it has the rest advantage.Elsewhere, Seahawks vs. Falcons (+6.5) pits one team, in Seattle, that has the league's best spread record (9-3) versus an Atlanta squad that's comfortable in the role of an underdog. The Falcons have been dogs six times this year, only losing ATS once, though it remains without Drake London (knee). When there's reason to back both teams with Week 14 NFL bets, digging deep into the trends, stats and analysis can it more apparent which side to choose.

Being at home is important to note for the Jets as that means the Dolphins have to leave sunny South Beach for a December game in the Northeast. Tua Tagovailoa is 0-7 all-time in his career when the temperature is 40 degrees or below, and forecasts are calling for a temperature of 34 degrees come Sunday. Additionally, the Jets are 4-1 ATS over their last five games, while Miami has scored just one touchdown in each of its last two games and has zero passing TDs in three of its last four. The model has New York prevailing versus the spread almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 14 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7.5, 40.5) cover versus the Raiders in nearly 60% of simulations. Denver's nine-game win streak is its longest in 13 years, while the Raiders' six-game losing streak is the third-longest active one in the NFL. Speaking of streaks, the Broncos have won each of the last three meetings, while Vegas has also lost versus the spread in each of its last three games this season. The Raiders fired OC Chip Kelly prior to Sunday's loss to the Chargers, and the Vegas went out and produced just 156 total yards, which is the team's second fewest in any game in eight years. With Las Vegas now facing Denver's elite defense, the Broncos win by double-digits, per the model, which also says the Under hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 14 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 14 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams projected to win by at least a touchdown, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Larry Hartstein, who is 25-15 (+835) over his last 40 Vikings ATS picks, is backing Washington (-1.5) to cover at home versus Minnesota on Sunday.\"The Commanders gave a spirited performance coming off their bye, losing by one in overtime to Denver. It was Washington's second solid effort in a row. Terry McLaurin's return made a huge difference, as did the presence of Daron Payne and Will Harris on defense. Now Washington visits a reeling Vikings team dealing with internal turmoil.\" Hartstein's Week 14 NFL picks can be found here.Chiefs vs. Texans 'Sunday Night Football' picksTeams battling for a spot in the AFC playoffs meet in primetime on Sunday with the Chiefs listed as 3.5-point favorites and the over/under at 41.5.

SportsLine's Sia Nejad, who has nailed 15 of his last 25 NFL props, is going Patrick Mahomes Over 34.5 passing attempts (-120). \"It's going to be tough for the Chiefs to move the ball on the Texans defense, but I think the preferred method will be via the pass (as it usually is for KC),\" he said. \"While I do expect volume I don't expect efficiency from Mahomes especially with a banged up offensive line.

Philly is a 2.5-point road favorite, with the over/under at 41.5. From an injury standpoint, Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert (hand) was a limited participant at practice this week and his status is uncertain. The Chargers, however, should get running back Omarion Hampton (ankle) back after he was a full participant at practice on Friday. Emory Hunt is on a 29-15 roll (+1215) on Philadelphia picks, and he's backing the Eagles to cover the small spread.\"I expect this game to come down to who can protect their respective QB best, and which QB can supersede the pressure and situation, to make plays,\" Hunt said. \"In both instances, it keeps coming up Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles. I expect to be the game to really get them going for the duration of the regular season.\" Get more 'Monday Night Football' picks right here.\n            ",

One Sunday rivalry matchup is the Green Bay Packers hosting the Chicago Bears, and the SportsLine Projection Model is backing the Packers as 7-point favorites in its Sunday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook in a 4:25 p.m. ET contest. The model is also backing the Chiefs to cover as 3.5-point favorites against the Texans on Sunday Night Football, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on the Colts vs. Jaguars in a pivotal AFC South matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line and over/under picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

White said. \"Indy has failed to gain 300 yards in back-to-back games after entering the Week 11 bye as the top offense in football. The Jaguars just closed out a brutal stretch of four road games in five weeks by going 4-1, and the defense is playing well enough that I have Jacksonville rated above average for the first time all year. With Indy's injury concerns, that means this game should be pick 'em at worst, and I wouldn't be surprised if Jacksonville closes favored.\" Back the Jaguars at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Packers -7 vs. Bears (+100)Somehow, even the word \"dominated\" doesn't seem to nearly justify the Packers' success against the Bears over the last 15 years. The Packers have won 11 of 12 head-to-head meetings in the last six years, and when the Bears finally won in Week 18 last season, Green Bay didn't play its starters long in the contest. The Packers are 26-4 against the Bears over their last 30 meetings. Even with a new era of Bears football with Ben Johnson as head coach, that history lingers as plenty of Chicago coaches fell to Green Bay during that span. The Packers enter Sunday on a three-game winning streak. Both teams have top-10 scoring offenses, but Green Bay has the No. 6 scoring defense (18.8 ppg allowed), while the Bears rank 25th in scoring defense at 25.6 ppg allowed. The model projects history to repeat itself, with the Packers winning and covering in 54% of simulations. Back the Packers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Chiefs -3.5 vs. Texans (-110)There's no place like home for Kansas City, as, despite being 6-6 on the season, the Chiefs are 5-1 at Arrowhead Stadium, including winning each of their last five home games. Kansas City hasn't allowed more than 20 points in any of its six home games this season. Both teams will rely on their defense on Sunday Night Football, as Houston has the No. 1 scoring defense at 16.5 ppg allowed this year. However, the Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes, and even with Kansas City 1-3 over its last four games and currently more likely to miss the playoffs than make it in NFL futures odds at DraftKings, it's difficult to imagine a postseason without Mahomes. Given Kansas City's home dominance, the model projects the Chiefs to cover in 53% of simulations. Back the Chiefs at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        With the calendar firmly in December, the 2025 NFL regular season is starting to near its conclusion, and Week 14 figures to be a major one when it comes to the playoff picture. Things kicked off with a big Lions win over a surging Cowboys team, and things will kick into full gear on Sunday, with major matchups like an NFC North clash between the 9-3 Chicago Bears and the 8-3-1 Green Bay Packers, with first place in the NFC North on the line. Week 14 is also the final bye week of the season, so four teams are off (Panthers, Patriots, Giants, 49ers), but there is still some NFL line movement that is worth noting.The Kansas City Chiefs (6-6) are also in a very important spot on Sunday Night Football when they host the Houston Texans (7-5) in what may very well be a must-win game for a team that went 15-2 last regular season and has made all but one Super Bowl since the 2019 season.With 13 weeks worth of data, lines are getting sharper as well. There's still been some notable NFL line movement in Week 14, however, and here, we break down the games that have seen the biggest shifts since lines first opened, with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:Bengals vs. Bills (1 p.m. ET)Open: Bills -6.5, O/U 53.5Now: Bills -6, O/U 54\nThe Bengals got Joe Burrow back last week, and he threw for 261 yards and two scores in a win over Baltimore. But now he faces a Bills defense that ranks first in the NFL in passing yards allowed (163.2 per game). Cincinnati has the worst defense in the NFL, but Burrow's presence at least gives them a chance to keep it pretty close.Colts vs. Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)Open: Colts -2.5, O/U 49.5Now: Colts -1.5, O/U 45.5\nIt's expected to be a tight battle between a pair of 8-4 teams, but the Colts are looking to turn things around after starting 7-1. The Jaguars have won four of their past five, averaging 29 points per game over that span. The Colts have scored 36 total points in losses over the past two weeks but still have the best scoring offense in the NFL (29.8 per game). Steelers vs. Ravens (1 p.m. ET)Open: Ravens -6.5, O/U 47.5 Now: Ravens -6, O/U 43\nThe rivals are both 6-6, but the Ravens had won five in a row before Joe Burrow and the Bengals snuck up on them on Thanksgiving. Pittsburgh has lost five of its past seven, and last week's home loss against Buffalo wasn't pretty. Quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers of the Steelers (wrist) and Baltimore's Lamar Jackson (ankle) are both a little banged up, so the total has dropped considerably. Broncos vs. Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)Open: Broncos -8.5, O/U 40.5 Now: Broncos -7.5, O/U 40.5 \nDenver has won nine in a row but hasn't been scoring as much as expected. The Raiders held the Broncos to just 10 points in Week 10 but only managed a touchdown. That's why they have lost six in a row. This one shouldn't be THAT low-scoring, but the Denver defense is ruthless. It all comes down to how Bo Nix and Co. execute.Texans vs. Chiefs (8:20 p.m. ET) Open: Chiefs -4.5, O/U 43.5 Now: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 41.5 \nMost are expecting Patrick Mahomes to bring Kansas City back to life, but the Texans are coming off consecutive big victories against the Bills and Colts. They won't roll over, and the Houston defense is the league's best, allowing 265.7 yards and 16.5 points per game. The Texans are 6-3 against the spread in their past nine games, but K.C. is 4-2 ATS at home. \n            ",

The Steelers started 4-1 but have lost five of their last seven games to fall back to .500. The Ravens, on the other hand, started 1-5 but have gone 5-1 since.Bet Steelers vs. Ravens at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:Neither team is playing close to its best at the moment. The Ravens fell to the Bengals, 32-14, with Lamar Jackson committing three turnovers against a struggling Cincinnati defense. Three days later, the Steelers lost to the Bills, 26-7, with Aaron Rodgers, fractured left wrist and all, completing just 10 of 21 passes for 117 yards, getting bloodied one a strip sack and then calling out his wide receivers after the game. Jeers rained down not just for the team, but for coach Mike Tomlin.\nAll that leaves both teams limping, bloodied and bruised -- literally and figuratively -- entering one of the NFL's best and most physical rivalries. SportsLine's projections add extra drama, too: The Ravens would have a 65% chance to make the playoffs with a win (23% with a loss), and the Steelers would have a 78% chance to make the playoffs with a win (31% with a loss).Below, we outline how to watch, keys to the game, betting information and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Steelers liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MarylandTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -6, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Ravens vs. Steelers: Need to knowLamar Jackson is struggling. Jackson is far from the dynamic force we've seen him be throughout his career. He has run for just 48 yards over his last three starts -- his fewest in any three-start span in his career -- and he has failed to produce any touchdowns, passing or rushing, in three straight games for the first time in his career. His accuracy has been inconsistent ever since he returned from a hamstring injury, too; his four straight starts with a sub-60 completion percentage is also a career-long. Jackson is just 3-4 in his career (including playoffs) against the Steelers, but he has won two straight against Pittsburgh and is 20-4 in December as a starter. Jackson has one of the league's highest sack rates this season, so evading T.J. Watt and the rest of the Pittsburgh pass rush will be key.Aaron Rodgers is also struggling. Week 13 marked Rodgers' third consecutive start with fewer than 200 passing yards, tying the longest streak of his career. Rodgers' 47.6% completion percentage in Week 13 was also his worst in a game he finished since 2020. Rodgers has been unable to get much of a downfield passing game going -- his average completion is just 3.5 yards downfield, by far the lowest in the NFL -- and the Ravens could make it tough sledding with their three-safety looks and strong cornerback play of late.Expect some wild moments. When these two teams meet, the unexpected tends to happen. Before their Week 16 and wild card games last year, nine straight meetings had been decided by one possession, and eight of the last 11 games overall have featured at least three combined turnovers.Ravens vs. Steelers pick, prediction\nAfter winning five straight games, the Ravens were seemingly back on track, at least defensively, with the expectation that the offense would eventually find its way there, too. Then they produced a turkey on Thanksgiving. Now, they face a crucial game, especially considering they have to go to Pittsburgh in Week 18. Baltimore would certainly like to have the tiebreaker advantage going into that one, and the only way to do that is to win this weekend. Expect a bounce-back performance from Jackson, who has had extra time to get healthier in between games, and an important win for the hosts.

The Jaguars are coming off a 25-3 beatdown of the 1-11 Tennessee Titans, while the Colts fell to the Houston Texans on their home field, 20-16.The importance of this matchup cannot be overstated. The Colts and Jaguars are both atop the AFC South at 8-4, although Jacksonville owns the tiebreaker in the division due to its higher win percentage in common games. Indy appears to be trending downward. Once 7-1 and looking like the favorites in the AFC, Shane Steichen's squad has now lost three out of their last four games.Bet Jaguars vs. Colts at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:We could look back at this matchup as the moment we learned who was going to win the AFC South. Let's break down this divisional showdown, but first, here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Colts vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: EverBank Stadium -- Jacksonville, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Colts -1.5, O/U 47.5 (via FanDuel)Colts vs. Jaguars: Need to knowHow's Daniel Jones' mobility? As you know by now, the Colts quarterback is playing through a fracture in his fibula. Last week against the Texans, Jones made some nice throws, but noticeably was not as mobile as usual. He registered zero scrambles, according to PFF, making it the first game since Week 5 Jones did not scramble. Pressure Jones and contain Jonathan Taylor. That's how the Jaguars can win this game. Sauce Gardner's will not dress. The Colts' trade-deadline addition is week-to-week with a calf strain suffered last Sunday, and will not suit up this week. It's concerning long-term, because calf strains can linger. Which Colts squad will show? You're going to have to score points if you want to beat the Colts. Indianapolis is the NFL leader in points per game entering Week 14 with 29.8. However, the Colts are averaging 21.8 points per contest over the last four games. Jaguars have the momentum. While the Colts are trending downwards, you could make the argument the Jaguars are trending upwards. They have won three games in a row following the largest blown lead in team history (19 points), which came against the Texans in Houston. Jacksonville dominated Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 11, found a way to win against the Arizona Cardinals in overtime then destroyed the Titans last Sunday. Jacksonville needs to mind their dirty laundry. Don't put the game in the ref's hands! Did you know the Jaguars lead the NFL in penalties with 104? That's something to watch on Sunday. Colts vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nI find it fascinating that the Colts have not won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- going 0-9 during this stretch. The Colts have not looked fantastic as of late, and you have to wonder how much Jones' fibula injury is affecting him. The Jaguars defense is not the Texans defense, but this same unit destroyed Herbert and the Chargers in Jacksonville, 35-6, a couple weeks ago. You never know what you're going to get with Lawrence, but I'll take Jacksonville in an upset. Pick: Jaguars +1.5, Over 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

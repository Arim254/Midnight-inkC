    "body": "\n        Familiar matchups may incentivize Week 11 NFL bets, and there's no shortage of those on the NFL schedule. There are nine divisional contests you could make Week 11 NFL picks on, the most of any week thus far. The entire AFC North and NFC West will do battle with Steelers vs. Bengals (+5.5), Ravens vs. Browns (+7.5), Rams vs. Seahawks (+3.5) and 49ers vs. Cardinals (+3). In terms of non-divisional games, there's a potential Super Bowl preview at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday as Buffalo is a 5.5-point home favorite over Tampa, per the latest Week 11 NFL odds, in a matchup of 6-3 teams coming off defeats. The NFC East is featured in the Week 11 NFL schedule with its teams taking part in three standalone games. Washington faces Miami in the first NFL game in Madrid, as the Dolphins are favored by 2.5 points, per the NFL lines. Nearly 12 hours later, Eagles vs. Lions (+2.5) takes place on SNF, and finally on Monday, the Cowboys visit the Raiders, which has Dak Prescott and Dallas as 3.5-point road favorites, according to the latest Week 11 NFL spreads. All of the updated Week 11 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 11 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Being at home doesn't appear to be much of an advantage for the Vikings, who committed eight false starts during a Sunday home loss to Baltimore. That's the second-most false starts by a home team in a game since 2000, as J.J. McCarthy has struggled in his debut season. He has six interceptions and four fumbles (one lost) across his four starts while being sacked 15 times. Meanwhile, Chicago has won six of its last seven games, going 5-2 ATS over that stretch. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 11 NFL predictions: the Steelers (-5.5, 49.5) cover at home versus the Bengals in well over 50% of simulations. Cincy owns the worst defense, by far, in the NFL, ranking dead last in points allowed and yards allowed, with bottom-three rankings in pass defense, takeaways and redzone defense. Additionally, its three spread victories this year are tied for the fewest in the league, and coming off a bye won't give the Bengals much of an edge as the team is 1-5 ATS over its last six games with a rest advantage. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS at home since the start of last year, and its No. 16 offense could look like a top-five unit versus Cincy. The model projects Pittsburgh to score a touchdown more than its season average as the Steelers cover. SportsLine's advanced model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 11 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 11 NFL schedule and just revealed two underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 11 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which two teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        CHESTER, Pa. – For something that is technically seasonal, there is an omnipresence about the World Cup. It is almost never too early to frame things around the quadrennial tournament for a number of obvious reasons, chief among them the indisputable fact that most players work day in and day out with the World Cup in mind. Four years is a lot of time to accomplish those goals but often it can feel like no time at all, depending on how you look at it.\"It always feels close,\" U.S. men's national team defender Tim Ream said on Friday. \"Even when it felt far away, it felt close.\"There is, though, something undeniable about the looming deadline of their opening game at next summer's tournament, now just under seven months away.\"We have 10 training sessions to go,\" Ream said about the next two international windows, \"so when you talk about length of time, number of days, probably not, but when you talk about number of games, number of training sessions, number of camps, it's knocking on our door.\"\nA new layer of seriousness has naturally seeped into the USMNT's training sessions, the number now sliding into the single digits. Saturday's friendly against Paraguay is the fourth-to-last before head coach Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup roster, intending to have his group together as soon as they commence their pre-tournament training camp in late May. There is a sense of finality this month, though -- this will be the last time the USMNT convene before March, something Pochettino has emphasized since naming his roster last week. He is intent on getting as many looks at his vast player pool, having called in 71 players in his year-plus in the job, half of his 24 player roster for November's games made up of players who did not take part in October's camp.How to watch the United States vs. Paraguay oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 5 p.m. ETLocation: Subaru Park -- Chester, PennsylvaniaTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: USMNT +130; Draw +230; Paraguay +210\"It's to give a big boost and motivation and it's a big opportunity in November because the squad is the squad that we selected,\" Pochettino said about the fresh faces, including forward Ricardo Pepi, who returns to the group after an injury-plagued year. \"It's great to [see him] after one year because last game from him in the national team was in November in St. Louis [a 4-2 win over Jamaica] and today, if we [did] not give him the chance today to come, we need to wait four months more, I think March, to see [him] again.\"The turnover from October's friendlies, a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia, is the direct result of several key players being unavailable – midfielder Tyler Adams picked up an injury over the weekend, for example, while Christian Pulisic is only in the early stages of his recovery from a hamstring injury. Cohesion may be an issue as a result on Saturday against Paraguay, though the head coach has chosen a glass half full approach as he continues to embrace a spirit of experimentation.\n\"I think it's a good test for us even if for us, it's maybe the first time that we play with this starting 11,\" he said. \"I think it's good because I think we need to translate our capacity to adapt quick, the capacity to be quick in the culture, the philosophy and the idea that we want to play. Even if we don't know too much, I think we did everything to try to create the chemistry in between the players, even if they didn't play too much together.\"The specifics of the philosophy are still being worked out, though the foundation seems to be in place. \"Intesnity\" and \"aggressiveness\" are words that frequently come up when describing Pochettino's ethos, a wide-ranging fundamental that carries tangible and intangible demands for players.\"I think there's definitely a style [of play] andI think it comes down to the work ethic,\" midfielder Diego Luna said. \"I think that's the biggest thing for us because the talent is there with whoever we bring in and whatever players we have. At the end of the day, it's about the determination and the grime, both with the ball and without the ball,that this team has to have good performances.\"\nSome of Pochettino's tactical preferences are finally clear to see, too, particularly in a recent switch to a back three. The formation is quickly becoming a constant but the head coach has always insisted this look is one of several the team could break out and as Ream described it, a back three can mean a variety of different things.\"It's not a full on, stick with it three at the back but it's important for all the guys to get the reps to understand that sometimes we start with a four, build with a three [or] start with a three and build with a three, sometimes we play five and build with a three,\" Ream said. \"It'll be important for all the guys that are here who haven't gotten as many reps to watch the film, make sure we're really focused in the meetings because that's where a lot of the work can really be done and a lot of the understanding can happen and then translate that and then take it out onto the field so we've worked a bit on that, a good bit on that in the last couple of training sessions and I think everybody has a pretty good understanding of it.\"Focus has so far been the theme of the week for the USMNT, no matter each player's relative newness to Pochettino's approach.\n\"There's a little bit more bite in training, there's intensity, there's more aggressiveness,\" Ream said. \"Guys are doing everything they possibly can to be a part of the team and as we've gotten closer and closer, I think we've seen that more and more and that's a good thing. Guys are desperate to be a part of the group and be a part of the team and be part of a World Cup on home soil.\"Even if the USMNT seem to be in a constant push-and-pull between experimentation and cohesion, they are attempting to make up the difference in their moments off the pitch.\"There's not that many trainings we get to have, not that many times you get to connect with guys leading into games,\" Luna said. \"It's about more, I think, connecting off the field, building that chemistry and that bond to build to kind of have that trust on the field and stuff like that. I think that's the biggest thing.\"\nThe ever-changing USMNT roster, though, has one particular perk for Pochettino – it reinforces the idea that \"no one is safe\" and that they will need to put in the work to earn a spot at the World Cup.\"It's challenging, but at the same time, it's super cool,\" Luna said about the comings and goings from camp to camp. \"You got a bunch of guys coming in that are representing the badge and I think to get their opportunity and stuff shows that we have a bunch of talented players and keeps the competitive nature at the top.\"Gio Reyna's 'more focused on the field'The long list of fresh faces includes midfielder Gio Reyna, who is back with the USMNT for the first time since March's defeats in the Concacaf Nations League Finals. Pochettino has used club form as the foundation for his roster decisions, which almost automatically ruled Reyna out of the running since last winter. Since moving from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach, though, Reyna is slowly building some match fitness -- but it is not the only noticeable change to the player's situation.\n\"He's not really let the challenges overseas seep into camp, which is great to see,\" Ream said. \"I've had a few conversations with him, nothing crazy, but he's speaking up a lot more in the trainings in terms of, 'I'm seeing this, what are you seeing?' He's really getting involved in the understanding of the movements and what we're kind of doing in the buildup and in the defensive shape so I feel like he's more in tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing and I think weather it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now and that's a good thing. I think that's something that, as young players -- he's not the only one – you see it a lot. I was guilty of it as well. You kind of lose focus a little bit as trainings go on. Like I said, his focus seems so much more intense and greater this time around after missing out for so many camps.\"Reyna is also joined in camp by midfielder Sebasitan Berhalter, the son of ex-USMNT head coach Gregg, the pair on opposite sides of a family feud that included their parents. Days after the U.S.' elimination at the 2022 World Cup, Gregg spoke at a summit and disclosed that a player was nearly kicked off the roster for his conduct, reports later emerging that Reyna was the player in question. Reyna's parents, former national team players Claudio and Danielle, had complained to U.S. Soccer about his playing time and Danielle eventually shared a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Gregg and his now-wife Rosalind, which led U.S. Soccer to launch an investigation that eventually cleared Gregg of wrongdoing. The issue seems to well and truly be in the past, though.\"I heard something but for me, it's not important,\" Pochettino said. The most important thing, he added, \"is the national team. And if we believe that Sebastian and Gio are important for us — and, because I think these two guys are really intelligent and very clever — if something happens, for sure, they are mature enough to deal with that.\"\nIt was not top of mind for anyone else in camp, either.\"I completely forgot about it until the third or fourth day and I was like, 'oh wait a minute,'\" Ream said. \"But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. Their relationship has looked pretty normal to me and to everybody else and I think what happened happened and we've all kind of moved on from it and they have as well and that's a good thing. Like I said, everybody's trying to make this team. Everybody's trying to be a part of the home World Cup and those two guys are no different than myself, than Chris [Richards], than Tanner [Tessman], than everybody in the group. It's good to see that their focus is here and now and hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple of months.\"\n            ",

Miller Moss, who spent his last four seasons at USC and threw for 2,555 yards for the Trojans last year, has made the Cardinals one of the most consistent offenses in the nation by breaking 20 points in all nine games. He's thrown for 2,132 yards with 11 touchdowns this season. Star Louisville running back Isaac Brown will miss his second straight game, which means the Cardinals will likely rely on Miller even more on Friday. Meanwhile, Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has thrown for 2,136 yards with 14 touchdowns compared to five interceptions this season, and he's two weeks removed from throwing for 385 yards in a 45-point effort for the Tigers against Duke. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Spurs to defeat the Warriors (-142)\"Am I a huge Steph Curry fan? Not really,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"In many ways, he has ruined the NBA with his crazy pull-up/step-back 3-pointers because he is so gosh-darn amazing that everyone thinks they can do it. Do I think schematically Curry was good for basketball? Absolutely not. But I would argue he has changed the NBA, maybe more than Jordan has. My point is that Steph can win a game by himself. He did Wednesday on the Riverwalk with 46 points. It's just so hard to sweep one of these baseball-type series, though -- especially away. Remember, we were in this spot last Sunday with Orlando. With trepidation, I played the Magic to sweep Boston in a similar home/home type thing. They didn't.\" Back San Antonio at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Iowa (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-112)\"On the wrong end of an 86-67 scoreline vs Santa Clara on Monday actually flatters the Musketeers, who only picked up the pace in garbage time when Richard Pitino let transfer guard Roddie Anderson (ex-UCSD and Boise State) shoot to his heart's content in the second half, when he scored 25 of his 29 points,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"A more accurate barometer of the X came in the first two games when laboring past LeMoyne and Marist, and the first half vs. SCU when held to 20 points. Good things are expected at Iowa under new head coach Ben McCollum, who made Drake the rage of the Missouri Valley last season and has the Hawkeyes shooting out the lights (57% from the floor!) in the first two games. Play Iowa.\"\nWant more Friday NBA, college basketball and college football picks?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

Thomas, who has already been discharged from the hospital, posted a video while standing up, indicating he was recovering well from the procedure. Thomas did not set a timetable for his return to the golf course but noted he will miss the start of the 2026 PGA Tour season at a minimum.\"My next few weeks will be a lot of resting before the rehab process begins,\" Thomas wrote. \"I have a great team behind me who I fully trust to get me back to a better place than I was before! Before you ask, I'm not putting any tournament on the calendar or specific time for returning. While I will miss some events in the beginning of 2026, I want to be very smart and patient in letting my disc fully heal so it isn't an issue again. I'm very lucky that the game of golf allows us to play at a high level for a long time, and that's what I plan on doing - this procedure will allow me to do that injury free in the future. Can't wait to see y'all back out there.\"\nThe 2026 PGA Tour season will start later than usual after The Sentry was cancelled due to drought conditions in Hawaii. Thomas won't set a target date, noting he will be patient and allow the disc to fully heal in hopes of avoiding any lingering issues. \nAlong with missing PGA Tour events, Thomas will no longer participate in the upcoming Skins Game competition on Black Friday. He was scheduled to compete with Keegan Bradley, Tommy Fleetwood and Xander Schauffele at his Panther National golf course in Florida. A replacement for Thomas was not immediately announced Friday. Thomas will also sit out the start of the TGL season. The second year of the simulator golf league begins Dec. 28, and if Thomas is going to miss tournaments in the 2026 season, he will assuredly be out for at least a portion of the TGL season for the Atlanta Drive. \nThe 2025 campaign was a return to form for Thomas, who picked up his first win since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and added three runner-up finishes among his eight top 10s. That showing earned Thomas a spot on the United States Ryder Cup team and pushed him back into the conversation among golf's best. Thomas' performance tapered off later in the year with just one top 10 in his last six events, and it has now become clear some of that was due to hip pain caused by a disc issue. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With just two teams on a bye, Week 11 Fantasy football lineups may look a little more robust after four squads had off last week. The likes of Ja'Marr Chase, Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are back in action, but Kansas City receivers may not be too appealing as Week 11 Fantasy football picks. That's because the Chiefs are facing a Denver team which has allowed the fewest Fantasy points to wideouts, shutting down the likes of Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and A.J. Brown. Kansas City also won't have running back Isiah Pacheco (knee), giving Denver the ability to zero in on the passing game even more. Observing which defenses are more conducive to allowing lots of points and yards should be a part of every manager's Fantasy football strategy. If the likes of Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy stay on your bench, then you'll want to see what the Week 11 Fantasy football projections forecast for others on your roster. Before making your Week 11 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 11 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 11 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 11 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 11: The model is fading Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a 10-time Pro Bowler who ranks as the TE5 this year. Even though Kelce, who is being started in 63% of leagues, had the second-most positional Fantasy points from Weeks 5-9 before a bye last week, he has a matchup to avoid as the Chiefs face Denver, which ranks No. 3 in scoring defense and No. 6 in passing defense. Just six teams have allowed fewer receptions or receiving touchdowns to tight ends than the Broncos, who've held their last three opposing starting TEs -- including Brock Bowers -- to an average of 44.3 yards and zero scores. Kelce sits outside the top 10 Fantasy tight ends in the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings, so he's one to fade.Another curveball: The model is high on Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, despite being the QB17 entering Week 11 and coming off the worst Fantasy performance of his Pittsburgh career. Rodgers, who has an over/under of 231.5 passing yards this week, has an extremely favorable matchup versus Cincinnati on Sunday as he had a four-touchdown game versus the Bengals in Week 7. Cincinnati has allowed the second-most Fantasy points to quarterback in 2025, as it's given up the most passing touchdowns and third-most passing yards. The model has Rodgers ranked above the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Caleb Williams and Matthew Stafford, despite all three of them being among the top 10 Fantasy QBs this season.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

Dobbins for this Sunday's divisional matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs and possibly some time after due to a significant foot injury, according to the NFL Network. The report states that Dobbins is \"believed to be out for the foreseeable future\" and is exploring all options, including injured reserve. Dobbins suffered the injury in Week 10's win over the Raiders.If he is placed on IR, Dobbins would miss at least four games, meaning he'd be sidelined for matchups against the Washington Commanders, Las Vegas Raiders and Green Bay Packers if he is designated before the Week 11 game.So far this season, Dobbins has played in 10 games where he has totaled 772 rushing yards and four touchdowns.Injuries have plagued Dobbins' career, with the former second round pick missing 43 games over four years with the Baltimore Ravens and four games with the Los Angeles Chargers last season.

    "body": "\n        CHESTER, Pa. --  We're still more than six months out from the World Cup, but the gravity of the tournament is beginning to close in as the United States men's national team's final camp of 2025 is in full swing. Mauricio Pochettino's squad has done plenty to inspire optimism during their three-match unbeaten streak to enter this camp, but now they're preparing to take the pitch without Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie, in what are critical matches as preparation time runs short. The USMNT will start off facing Paraguay before a clash with Uruguay, again facing two teams who have qualified for the World Cup as they continue to test themselves under Pochettino. But without regular starters, this could be one of the final chances during this World Cup cycle for players like Gio Reyna to impress and show why they need to be in the squad when the dust settles. Pochettino has consistently maintained that he doesn't shut the door on anyone who may not be in camp, but he has also been clear to the players about his expectations for them while here. Perform to those expectations, and there are spots to earn in that final roster, but otherwise, plenty of players are waiting in the wings for a shot as Pochettino has dug deep in the pool during his time in charge.\"The way Poch wants us to play, he wants everyone to know their role, he wants everyone to be onboard and he wants nobody to think their postion is gaurenteed so I wouldn't say [regular players missing] affects preperation too much but of course at the same time wer're missing some key players and when we get to the important games and where it matters we're gonna want everyone fit and availible,\" Folorian Balogun said, speaking ahead of the match. \"But the most important thing is to manage what we have, and of course, the players who aren't here get healthy and look after themselves.\"For those who are here, one who has a massive opportunity to make an impact is midfielder Gio Reyna. He hasn't appeared for the USMNT since March of 2025 in the third-place game of Concacaf Nations League play and has since moved to a new club in Borussia Monchengladbach. Now getting some minutes for them, albeit as a consistent substitute not a starter, this will be a chance to end 2025 on a high note while looking to make a second consecutive World Cup and earn playing time while there.\n\n        \n            \n                USMNT's Philadelphia Union alums return home for friendly with a major chance to make the World Cup squad\n                \n                    Chuck Booth                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHow to watch the United States vs. Paraguay oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 5 p.m. ETLocation: Subaru Park -- Chester, PennsylvaniaTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: USMNT +130; Draw +230; Paraguay +210Reyna's returnMinutes have been hard to come by for Reyna since his move to Gladbach in the Bundesliga, as he's struggled with injuries and adjusting to the club after leaving Borussia Dortmund. With only 147 minutes during the season, it's unknown how fit Reyna will be for gametime, but there are few players in the squad who can bring his vision and ability on the ball to the table, which is why he's here at this critical time. With the move from Dortmund, a lot has changed in Reyna's life since being in the 2022 World Cup squad, and it shows to the players around him.\"He's a lot more mature, you know, he's married now and he's a lot more mature and to himself,\" Balogun said. \"He seems focused and like he wants to put the injuries and the noise behind him to play and do what he does best, so I'm happy and looking forward to seeing him.\"\nWhat happened in the past between the families of Reyna and Sebastian Berhalter is just that, in the past. During the road to the World Cup, they're here and coexisting with a common goal of making the squad and leading it to glory on home soil. We'll need to see what happens when Reyna takes the pitch, but as he's spoken about in the past, he knows what he needs to do. Now is the time to show that he can do it on the pitch.Lean on BalogunOne of the most capped members of the attack, with 21 appearances for the USMNT, the pressure will be on Balogun to carry the attack without the USMNT regulars beside him. The World Cup is drawing closer, and with goals in his last two starts, Balogun is showing why there was so much promise behind his commitment to the USMNT as a dual national. He's been able to create space for others with his movement and holdup play while putting shots on frame to keep defenses honest. In form for club and country, if the USMNT are going to get results from games in this window, they'll need Balogun at his best but his role will change a bit depending on the lineup. If Reyna does start, his ability on the ball will help create space but otherwise, Balogun will need to operate in smaller windows of space than he has become accustomed to. It's a good test for him as it'll be one that prepares him for his first World Cup.\nGrowth from the back threeAs camps continue, it feels like the back three is here to stay. Not only are players comfortable in it from their time at club level and under Pochettino, but the USMNT have also secured results in the formation. But it's also not a strict back three as well. Tim Weah referred to his role as a fake wing back when he played during the September international break, and Tim Ream also echoed that flexibility.\"It's not a full on, stick with it three at the back, but it's important for all the guys to get the reps, to understand that sometimes we start with a four, build with a three [or] start with a three and build with a three, sometimes we play five and build with a three, so it's important for everybody to understand what we're doing and what's being asked, the different ways that we can play,\" Ream said.With plenty of players who can play multiple positions like Joe Scally in this camp, Pochettino will have even more options in how build up looks even without one of his defensive stalwarts in Richards. Being able to push forward and grow with different players in this formation will only add to Pochettino's options while also increasing the confidence that the team has in what they can do.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick is not worrying about anything but North Carolina's next opponent. The UNC coach knows there's an opening in the NFL that many will link him to, but his attention is on Wake Forest.Belichick's name has been tied to the New York Giants coaching vacancy since Brian Daboll was relieved of his duties following New York's Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears.Belichick affirmed that commitment to Chapel Hill on Friday night when he said that he will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.\"I have great respect and genuinely care for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families. The New York Giants played an important role in my life and in my coaching journey. It was a privilege for me to work for the Mara family and be a member of Coach Parcells' staff for over a decade. However, despite circulating rumors, I have not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies. \n\"Since arriving in Chapel Hill, my commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. We have tremendous support from the university, our alumni, and the entire Carolina community. My focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team, develop our players, and build a program that makes Tar Heel fans proud. We're on to Wake Forest.\"These comments came after Belichick struck a similar tone on Tuesday during his weekly press conference.\"I've been asked about it from time to time, but I've been down this road before,\" Belichick said. \"I'm focused on Wake Forest. That's it, and that's my commitment to this team, and next week, it'll be to our next opponent, and so forth. But, you know, I'm here to do the best I can for this team.\" \nIt's easy to see why so many have speculated about Belichick's possible interest in the Giants, and vice versa. Prior to winning six Super Bowls with the Patriots, Belichick won a pair of Super Bowls as the Giants' defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells. He was carried off the field by Giants players after New York shut out Washington in the 1986 NFC title game en route to defeating the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.Four years later, Belichick's defense held the mighty 49ers' offense to just 13 points in what was one of the biggest upsets in conference title game history. A week later, his defense made even more history by holding the prolific Bills offense to just 19 points in the closest Super Bowl ever played. Belichick's controversial game plan worked; New York's defense (which often lined up with just two defensive linemen) allowed Thurman Thomas to rush for 135 yards, but it succeeded in neutralizing Jim Kelly and the Bills' prolific passing attack. That game plan currently resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nIn 2009, during a return trip to Giants Stadium, Belichick broke down in tears while reflecting back on his years with the Giants. Ironically, it was the Giants who handed Belichick's Patriots two of his three Super Bowl losses that includes New York's shocking upset over the previously-undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Belichick served as the Browns' head coach from 1991-95 and was the Patriots' coach from 2000-23. His six Super Bowl wins as a head coach is two more than the next closest coach, former Steelers coach Chuck Noll. Belichick's 303 regular season wins is the third highest total in NFL history. His 333 total wins is second to only Don Shula's 347 wins that came with the Dolphins and Colts. Belichick's NFL career will likely be immortalized in the Pro Football Hall in 2026. He is one of nine coaching semifinalists for induction next summer in Canton, Ohio. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 8 Oregon is expected to be without wide receivers Dakorien Moore and Gary Bryant Jr. for Friday night's game against Minnesota, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Moore and Bryant are two of Oregon's top three receiving options with a combined 742 yards and seven touchdowns through the air this season. This will be the second consecutive game that Moore has missed, as he was sidelined for Oregon's Week 11 win against Iowa after suffering a knee injury in practice. Bryant was carried off the field in the first quarter against the Hawkeyes. It didn't take long for Moore, who signed with Oregon in 2025 as the nation's top-ranked wide receiver prospect, to emerge as one of quarterback Dante Moore's top targets. Moore had 69 yards and a touchdown on just two catches in Oregon's Week 2 win against Oklahoma State, which marked his debut against Power Four competition. He's dipped below 40 yards receiving just once in seven games since and his 15.8 yards per catch ranks sixth in the Big Ten among receivers with at least 20 receptions on the season and first among the conference's true freshmen. \n        \n            \n                College football Week 12 storylines: The pending battle over 3-loss SEC teams in CFP; All eyes on Lane Kiffin\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor Bryant, this is his third season at Oregon and sixth year of college football. He started his career at USC and transferred to Eugene after three seasons with the Trojans. \nMoore, a product of Duncanville, Texas, initially chose the Ducks over offers from almost every major program in the nation, including the in-state powerhouse Texas Longhorns. He filled an immediate need for Oregon, which lost three of its top four receiving targets from the 2024 season.To compound matters, Evan Stewart, Oregon's top returning wide receiver, suffered a preseason knee injury that has sidelined him for the entirety of the 2025 campaign thus far. There is a chance that he returns late in the year. With Moore and Bryant unable to go, Oregon will rely on Malik Benson and Jeremiah McClellan, who each have at least 200 yards receiving this season, against the Gophers. McClellan, a redshirt freshman and former top-100 prospect in the 2024 class, could start alongside Benson at one of Oregon's outside receiver spots. \nOregon improved to 8-1 overall, 5-1 in Big Ten play and moved up to No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings following the win in Iowa City. The Ducks have matchups with two former Pac-12 foes -- No. 17 USC and Washington -- to close out the regular season. The Nov. 22 game vs. the Trojans will be played at home in Eugene before a trip to Seattle on Nov. 29.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Raheem Morris came under fire this week when comments from Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. were misinterpreted to make people think the young quarterback wasn't getting any support from the coaching staff. On Friday, Morris fired back at those online who pulled Penix's answer out of context.On Wednesday, Penix was asked about his mental and physical support systems. Penix cited his fiancé as the person he leans on mentally and emotionally, and he pointed to coaches back home for assisting him physically with tips on things like throwing mechanics.Some on social media clipped captioned video of the answer to make it seem as though Penix was implying he gets no help in Atlanta. In a charged response, Morris called the whole situation a \"joke\" and accused people of pulling things out of thin air.\"Stop looking for stuff on a young man,\" Morris said, per ESPN. \"You don't need this stuff on him. It is what it is. But all of those things people do, it doesn't matter to affect this building.\n\"I just feel bad for the kid. I don't want the kid having to deal with stuff that doesn't matter or stuff that's not real. ... Let his problems be his problems, like third downs. Let's fix those. Don't make up [a thing] that doesn't exist.\"In his full answer on Wednesday, Penix doesn't say anything that reflects poorly on the Falcons coaching staff. He was simply pointing to people outside the facility who lend support.\"Mentally, my fiancé is always there for me,\" Penix said. \"I know, whenever I get home, she's gonna be there for me. No matter how I played, she's always gonna be there for me. She's gonna have a smile on her face. She's gonna give me a hug and make me feel good no matter what.\n\"As far as physically, like on the field stuff, there's nobody I talk to as far as another quarterback or anything like that. I do have quarterback coaches from back home that reach out to me like, 'Hey, you need to clean this up or clean that up, and everything will be good.' Those guys help me as far as that too. Shoutout to them.\"The Falcons are currently riding a four-game losing streak, and that has put both Penix and Morris under a microscope. Penix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has completed 58.8% of his passes for 1,807 yards, nine touchdowns and three interceptions.Now 3-6 on the season, Atlanta occupies third place in the NFC South, and it desperately needs a divisional win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n            ",

They lost to Iowa by one, competed for a half against No. 1 Ohio State, and almost upset No. 2 Indiana last Saturday. You have to wonder how much do these players have left in the tank mentally after two emotional losses to Ohio State and Indiana. The loss to the Hoosiers was particularly gut-wrenching because Penn State came from behind to take a late lead before losing in the final seconds on one of the best catches you will ever see by Omar Cooper Jr.\"This is a tough spot for Penn State on the road laying over a touchdown. I can see a scenario where the Nittany Lions start off slowly and this settles into a close, low-scoring game.

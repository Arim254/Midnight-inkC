Two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua is reportedly finalizing a deal to box Paul to end this year.Paul vs. Joshua is in the works for December, according to reports from Yahoo Sports and Ring Magazine. Netflix will reportedly stream the fight, which would take place in Miami. Paul and Davis' Nov. 14 fight was canceled amid new domestic violence allegations against Davis.There should be much more hype for Paul's fight with Joshua than the canceled \"Tank\" exhibition fight.The biggest criticism of Paul-Davis was the size difference between them. Paul regularly competes at cruiserweight, roughly 65 pounds heavier than WBA lightweight champion Davis' normal weight class. The weight gap was so big that Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission, prevented the fight from being sanctioned in Atlanta.\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) unexpectedly became one of boxing's biggest stars with meticulous matchmaking. He often leverages his size and youth against smaller, older opponents with mainstream name value. The 28-year-old's biggest wins are against \"Iron\" Mike Tyson, former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, Nate Diaz and former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley, all of whom are currently in their 40s and 50s, with Tyson pushing 60. Against Joshua, Paul will have no such advantages. Two-time unified heavyweight boxing champion Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has every advantage over Paul on paper. Joshua is bigger, more experienced, technically superior, and hits harder. He's twice mixed it up with the greatest boxer of his generation, reigning undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. While Joshua's best days are behind him -- Hearn suggested Joshua could retire next year -- the 36-year-old is young enough to handle Paul.\nPaul is on a six-fight winning streak, most recently winning a unanimous decision over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Joshua had a four-fight winning streak, which included a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, snapped by Daniel Dubois in September 2024. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA placed Michigan State's football program on three years of probation following violations committed by former staff members during Mel Tucker's tenure, officials announced. The program also must vacate 14 wins from the past three seasons, including all five victories from the 2024 season, Jonathan Smith's first year as coach, according to ESPN.The NCAA found that Tucker and his former staff failed to properly oversee the program, resulting in violations involving three ineligible players. Investigators determined that staff arranged impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, covered unofficial visit expenses and engaged in improper contact with recruits.In addition to vacating wins, Michigan State must pay $30,000 plus 1.5% of the football program's budget, which was $58.6 million for the 2024 season, per ESPN. The sanctions also include restrictions on official and unofficial visits, recruiting communications, recruiting-person days and off-campus recruiting contacts and evaluations over the three-year probation period.Tucker, former general manager Saeed Khalif and former assistant coach Brandon Jordan received show-cause orders, which bar them from coaching in college until the penalties expire. Tucker was given a three-year order for failing to adequately monitor the program, while Khalif and Jordan received six- and five-year orders, respectively, for knowingly providing impermissible recruiting inducements.\nIn a joint statement, Michigan State president Kevin Guskiewicz and athletic director J. Batt said the university pursued a negotiated resolution to minimize penalties on current athletes and staff, who were not involved in the violations.\"Today's announcement brings closure to an NCAA investigation resulting from violations committed by a previous staff,\" the statement read. \"With this matter behind us, we are able to move forward, focusing on the present and future of Spartan football.\"\nMichigan State fired Tucker for cause in 2023 amid unrelated sexual harassment allegations. Meanwhile, Smith is in his second season as Michigan State's coach, with an 8-13 record prior to the vacated wins -- five of which came during the 2024 season. Three of those victories were Big Ten games. The Spartans (3-6), lost all six of their conference games this season, leaving Smith technically winless against Big Ten opponents at Michigan State.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Clippers guard Bradley Beal will miss the remainder of the season after suffering a fractured hip, Beal's agent told ESPN. Beal, who will have surgery on the hip, sustained the injury in L.A.'s 114-103 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 8, and missed the following game against the Atlanta Hawks.Beal, 32, was originally listed as out for that game against the Hawks with what the Clippers were calling hip soreness, but after undergoing further imaging the injury was determined to be far worse than that. Clippers coach Ty Lue admitted there was concern about Beal's injury, and that concern proved to be warranted.Mark Bartelstein, Beal's agent, told ESPN that the decision for season-ending surgery was reached after consulting an array of medical opinions.\"We met with numerous doctors and specialists around the country in collaboration with the entire Clippers medical staff over the last few days, and came to the decision unanimously that the surgery will allow Brad to have a full and complete recovery,\" Bartelstein said. \nBradley Beal's career derailed by injuriesBeal, a three-time All-Star, had a rough start to the season in his first year with the Clippers. He's averaged a career-low 8.2 points on just 37.5% from the floor. He appeared in six of L.A.'s 10 games, and hasn't been as productive as the Clippers had hoped when they signed him in the summer. The Clippers signed Beal to a two-year, $10.98 million deal with a player option on the second year after the Suns used the waive and stretch provision to allow him to become a free agent in the offseason. He was coming off a two-year stint in Phoenix where he averaged 17.6 points, but never played more than 53 games each season as injuries limited him -- and the Suns -- from building chemistry with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.Injuries have now followed Beal to the Clippers, though we've never see him play as poorly as he was to start this season. Some of that is due to him still working back from a knee scope he had in May, which limited him in the preseason. Beal has been on a minutes restriction in each of the six games he's played, but hasn't been as efficient as he has been over the majority of his career.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA Power Rankings: Spurs, Pistons making the leap; Eastern Conference earning its keep\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Clippers were hoping Beal would replace the production of Norman Powell, who the team sent to the Miami Heat in a three-team deal that landed them John Collins from the Utah Jazz. That wasn't the case, and now they'll lose Beal for the remainder of the season.Beal, a 13-year veteran, has only played in 70 or more games four times over his career, and hasn't been able to find his footing at either of his two stops since being traded from the Wizards in 2023. He's still only 32 years old, and his player option next summer should ensure he'll remain with the Clippers through next season, but his durability has been a massive concern in the last few years.A major blow for the ClippersThe Beal injury is a massive blow given the Clippers have started the season 2-8 and are also without Kawhi Leonard, who is dealing with an ankle sprain he sustained in a loss to the Miami Heat on Nov. 3. However, ESPN's Shams Charania said on NBA Today Wednesday afternoon that Leonard's absence isn't considered to be \"significant.\" That should be a sigh of relief for the Clippers, and while Leonard can mask a lot of the team's issues, he alone won't solve the fact that L.A. has a bottom-tier offense -- ranked 20th in the league, to be exact -- and an even worse defense (26th).\nBeal already wasn't providing a ton offensively for the Clippers, so they'll have to find that missing offensive production elsewhere. Bogdan Bogdanovic would ideally supply some of that missing production the Clippers hoped Beal would bring, but he's seemingly slid out of the rotation after being held out of back-to-back games. Beal's injury should mean an elevation in role for Bogdanovic, but he'll need to do better than the 6.3 points and 28% from the field he's averaged in four games this season.The Clippers were expected to be a dark horse contender in the Western Conference this season, but injuries have yet again plagued them. It's still early, and perhaps Beal's injury will push the Clippers to look for a trade that could net them some more scoring. But for now, they'll have to look elsewhere on their roster to get them out of this skid with Beal's injury serving as the latest tough pill to swallow for a team that has been continually derailed by injuries.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Quarterbacks Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield will face off this Sunday when the Buffalo Bills host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. As they get ready for the competition on the field, the two are having some friendly banter off of it.When asked about his friendship with Allen, Mayfield poked fun at his Week 11 opponent and peer from the NFL's 2018 draft class. Mayfield, who is known for his quips and one-liners, said, matter-of-factly, \"I have to walkie-talkie to him because he's so damn tall, so I can't really have a face-to-face conversation with him. But you know in Buffalo, it's cold, it's rainy. Even though he's 6-10, his hands are small, so he better wear his gloves.\"\nIn case it wasn't obvious, Allen isn't actually 6'10\", but he does stand at 6'5\" compared to Mayfield's height of 6'1\". The exaggeration for comedic effect certainly worked. Allen's hand size was listed at just over 10 inches while Mayfield measured 9¼ inches at the combine. \nMayfield may have been slightly off on his measurements, but he did have one set of facts correct -- it will be cold in Buffalo this weekend. The projected temperature range is between 32-42 with a 30% chance of rain, via weather.com. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.A reporter at Allen's press conference later in the day informed the reigning NFL MVP of Mayfield's comments. Allen was quick to offer a retort, offering a quip about Mayfield's golfing accessory.\"Baker wears two gloves golfing,\" Allen said. \"So, he's that type of guy. I love the guy, he's awesome.\"\nThe Bills are the favorite to win on Sunday at -5.5, with the over/under set at 48.5, according to DraftKings.Both the Bills and Bucs are sitting at 6-3 with Buffalo in second place in the AFC East while Tampa Bay is in first place in the NFC South. And both teams are also coming off losses. The Bills lost a stunner to the beleaguered Miami Dolphins while the Buccaneers were defeated by the ascending New England Patriots.Allen and Mayfield have had solid seasons thus far. Allen has a 70.3 completion percentage, 2,139 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, five interceptions, 311 rushing yards on 59 attempts, and seven touchdowns on the ground. Mayfield has a 64.1 completion percentage and has thrown for 2,192 yards with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions, along with 158 yards on the ground on 22 attempts.\nThese two quarterbacks got their start together, as both were drafted in the Class of 2018. Mayfield was the first overall pick by the Cleveland Browns, while Allen was selected by the Bills at No. 7 overall.\n            ",

He received 26 of 30 first-place votes.\nSkubal, who turns 29 on Nov. 20, also won the award in 2024 and did so in unanimous fashion. This crowning makes Skubal the first repeat winner since Jacob deGrom of the Mets in 2018 and 2019. He's the first AL pitcher to win back-to-back Cy Youngs since Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez with the Red Sox in 1999 and 2000. As well, Skubal is now the 22nd pitcher in MLB history to win multiple Cy Young awards. He's just the second Tiger to win two Cy Youngs, joining Denny McLain, who won the award with Detroit in 1968 and 1969. Skubal prevailed in the balloting, which is conducted by the Baseball Writers Association of America, over his fellow AL finalists, Garrett Crochet of the Red Sox and Hunter Brown of the Astros. Here's a look at the full voting:Pitcher1st2nd3rd4th5thPointsTarik Skubal, Tigers264---198Garrett Crochet, Red Sox426---132Hunter Brown, Astros--243280Max Fried, Yankees--620361Bryan Woo, Mariners---51626Carlos Rodón, Yankees---215Aroldis Chapman, Red Sox----44Jacob deGrom, Rangers--—-22Trevor Rogers, Orioles----11Drew Rasmussen, Rays----11He joins Pirates ace Paul Skenes, who was named the National League Cy Young winner.\nThis past season, Skubal led the American League in ERA and also paced the AL in ERA+ with a mark of 187. He backed it up with an AL-best FIP of 2.45, and his K/BB ratio of 7.30 led all qualifiers in MLB. Skubal also struck out 32.2% of opposing batters, which also led all qualifying pitchers, and his WAR of 6.5 was tops among AL pitchers. He set a career high with 241 strikeouts in 2025 and registered a quality start in 68% of his trips to the mound versus an MLB average of 51%. Any current discussion of Skubal right now must address the trade rumors that have persisted. He's going into his walk year in 2026, and it's possible -- although probably not likely -- that the Tigers will look to deal him this offseason before losing him to free agency. This of course is not the club's only option with regard to their remaining control over Skubal, especially since parting with him likely closes their current contending window. \nFor now, though, the story with Skubal is that he's once again been recognized as the American League's best pitcher.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Kosar, a former Pro Bowler for the Browns who led Cleveland three AFC Championship games over a four-year span, said via social media that he was slated to receive a liver transplant this past weekend, but it has been delayed as the donor organ was infected.Kosar then underwent two procedures and was preparing for a third one. \"I could really use your love, support and actual prayers today,\" Kosar said. \nIn another video, Kosar showed that he still has his sense of humor. In \"the spirit of the hospital and maturity,\" Kosar displayed his \"Steelers black and gold regulation university hospital attire.\" \nKosar, 61, shared during an 2021 interview with Cleveland Magazine that doctors diagnosed him with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson's disease. He has been on the list for a liver transplant through University Hospitals. \nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 1985 NFL Draft, Kosar went to Cleveland less than two years after helping lead the Miami Hurricanes to its first national championship. He then helped lead the Browns to four playoff appearances over a five-year span from 1985-89. Kosar's three playoff wins is the second-most by any starting quarterback in Browns history, trailing only Hall of Famer Otto Graham. In the divisional round of the 1986 playoffs, Kosar made NFL history by passing for 489 yards during the Browns' win over the New York Jets. Only two other quarterbacks (Ben Roethlisberger in 2020 and Tom Brady in 2017) have since thrown for more yards in a playoff game. After nearly a decade in Cleveland, Kosar won a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys as Troy Aikman's backup. He threw a touchdown pass in Dallas' 1993 NFC title game win over the San Francisco 49ers after Aikman left the game after sustaining a concussion. \nA 12-year NFL veteran, Kosar finished his career by spending three seasons as Dan Marino's backup with the Miami Dolphins. \n            \n    ",

He prevailed over his fellow NL award finalists, Cristopher Sánchez of the Phillies and Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Dodgers. Skenes joins Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who won in the American League. Here's  look at full voting:Pitcher1st2nd3rd4th5thPointsPaul Skenes, Pirates30----210Cristopher Sánchez, Phillies\t-30---120Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers--1611272Logan Webb, Giants\t--106547Freddy Peralta, Brewers\t--4111044Nick Pivetta, Padres----77Jesús Luzardo, Phillies\t---135Andrew Abbott, Reds\t---124Zack Wheeler, Phillies\t----11In his second MLB season, Skenes made 32 starts, and over that span he put up an MLB-leading ERA+ of 217 and an MLB-leading 2.36 FIP with 216 strikeouts and a 5.14 K/BB ratio. Skenes also logged a quality start in 63% of his trips to the mound, and he managed that 10-10 record despite toiling for a last-place Pirates team that lost 91 games. Skenes' WAR of 7.7 for this season ranked second only to Sánchez's 8.0 in all of baseball. Skenes' work in 2025 comes after his stellar work as a rookie in 2024, when he won Rookie of the Year and finished third in the NL Cy Young vote despite not being called up until May 11 and working just 133 innings. Through the first 55 starts of his MLB career, Skenes has an ERA of 1.96. \nSkenes is the third Pirates pitcher to win the Cy Young award. He joins Doug Drabek in 1990 and Vern Law in 1960. Even though Skenes isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2029 season, he's been the subject of constant trade rumors since not long after he arrived in the majors. While Pirates owner Bob Nutting is never to be doubted when it comes to his willful neglect of the on-field product in Pittsburgh, a trade of Skenes anytime soon seems highly unlikely. Indeed, general manager Ben Cherington recently told reporters that Skenes would indeed be a Pirate in 2026. \nAs for his new hardware, Skenes thanks to his youth, excellence to date, and underlying dominance has a real shot at joining the guild of those pitchers to win multiple Cy Young awards. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        While Drake Maye, Matthew Stafford and Jonathan Taylor have dominated league MVP discussions, former Saints Super Bowl-winner and soon-to-be Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees mentioned another player who certainly deserves consideration, too. \"There's a lot of guys that are playing some outstanding football,\" Brees said during a one-on-one interview with CBS Sports. \"Drake Maye, he's made huge leaps from last year. ... Stafford is playing outstanding.\"I look at what the Seattle Seahawks are doing right now. You know, if [Jaxon Smith-Njigba] isn't an MVP candidate, he's certainly Offensive Player of the Year, right? I think those are some good names.\" Now in his third season in Seattle, Smith-Njigba is enjoying a breakout season for the Seahawks, who are off to a surprising 7-2 start under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Smith-Njigba is currently leading the NFL with 1,041 receiving yards and is on pace to break Calvin Johnson's single-season record of 1,964. \nWhile he is certainly deserving of consideration, Smith-Njigba doesn't have history on his side as far as winning league MVP. No receiver in league history has won the award, including Jerry Rice, who didn't win following the strike-shortened 1987 season despite catching 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. The award instead went to then-Broncos quarterback John Elway. Perhaps coincidentally, the year that Johnson set the single-receiving receiving record was also the last time a non-quarterback won league MVP. In the 12 years since then-Vikings running back Adrian Peterson won MVP, a quarterback has won the award each year. Speaking of quarterbacks, Brees doesn't envision Stafford -- who at 37 is enjoying arguably his finest season to date -- or the 7-2 Rams slowing down anytime soon. Brees feels that Stafford has a golden opportunity to solidify his status as a future Hall of Famer. \n\"I think he still has some great years ahead of him,\" Brees said of Stafford, who earlier this season became the ninth quarterback to reach 400 touchdown passes and the 10th one to eclipse 60,000 passing yards. \"It's really just a matter of how long he wants to play. He's in a place now with some really incredible talent around him, a great head coach in Sean McVay and a great system that just fits his strengths. \"He still has all the ability in the world,\" Brees said. \"I find that window between age 35 and 40-42-years-old is really an opportunity for a quarterback. That's almost like entering your prime. Think about just how much you understand and know mentally, and if you're still able to do it physically, then those could be some of your absolute best years.\"\nBrees is keeping himself busy this fall. In addition to keeping a close eye on the NFL in his role as an analyst, Brees has teamed up with Abbott for their \"We Give Blood Drive\" a competition through their partnership with the Big Ten to see which Big Ten school can donate the most blood throughout the college football season. The winning school, which will be announced during the 2025 Discover Big Ten Football Championship Game on Dec. 6, will receive $1 million from Abbott for student or community health. There is also the opportunity to earn a Big Ten school shirt of your choice by giving blood. \n\"I think a lot of us maybe just don't recognize the impact that giving blood can do for our community and just saving lives,\" Brees said. \"One blood donation can save up to three lives. ... We're actually in a blood shortage right now as a country. It's kind of unprecedented, maybe the worst one of our of our lifetime, and so we're encouraging everybody to get out and give blood.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A defender is not going to win the Ballon d'Or this time. Broadly speaking, that is probably the right thing. There is nothing more valuable and challenging in the sport than putting the ball in the net on a consistent basis. So long as Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Harry Kane continue to do that, they will be the frontrunners for a 2025-26 season that has an awful lot of football left to play.It is no reflection on our modern footballing culture, the brain melt of the Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo era, that defenders aren't winning the biggest prizes in football. That has always been true. There were a smattering of names in contention in the years immediately after France Football first awarded the prize in 1956: the English center backs Billy Wright and Duncan Edwards the following year, Giacinto Facchetti when Inter retained the European Cup in 1965. Perhaps the greatest defender ever, Paolo Maldini, received slightly fewer points over his entire career than Zinedine Zidane got when he won the prize in 1998.There are only five broadly defensive players to have been dubbed the game's finest: goalkeeper Lev Yashin in 1963, Franz Beckenbauer in 1972 and 1976, Matthias Sammer in 1996 and Fabio Cannavaro a decade later. Given that the Germans on that list often operated as sweepers, we can quibble about Rodri but it wouldn't change the broader point.It takes something fairly extraordinary for a defender to win the greatest individual honor in football. Suppose that were beginning to happen this season, though. What would it look like? \nWell, for starters, the defense itself would have to be sensational. It is harder to capture defensive excellence in quite the same way it is at the other end. We have a good idea when Haaland is playing well, the ball keeps going into the net. A low tally in the goals conceded column is not necessarily as indicative of exceptional individual performances but perhaps if the team performance was truly remarkable, one would have to consider the individuals within that backline. Of course there are some pure defending numbers that might tell a story, such as when a center back has 13 shots blocked and his goalkeeper has 16 saves. That speaks to a defender who is doing the very final, very important bit of defending very well.There are other statistics in which defenders might shine. Are they helping their teammates to progress the ball, whether through their carrying or passing? Are they getting a volume of touches that suggests they are trusted to build play? Are they showing strength in the duels? It probably wouldn't hurt to bear in mind that Rodri had his best scoring season when he won the Ballon d'Or and that Sammer came up with some clutch goals at Euro 96. It wouldn't be a bad idea to get as near as realistically possible to whatever number Mbappe et al set as the high water mark of scoring.If we want to get really creative, perhaps we might argue that they encapsulate a new mode of football as Beckenbauer did with his ability to drive possession forward from the back. At what might be the birth of the set-piece age, would it not be the time to celebrate the sport's most dominant force at dead balls?\nYou've probably worked out where I'm driving to here. I'd guess it was probably in the headline in the first place.How Gabriel compares to other center backs in the 2025-26 Premier League \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Gabriel Magalhaes fulfils all those criteria above. He has been the best pure defender in an Arsenal backline that, even after its wobble against Sunderland, is trending towards being one of only three in Premier League history to concede fewer than 20 goals over the course of a season. A few years ago, Gabriel's defining qualities were mostly his defending but his ability to move the ball up the field from the left-hand side he marshals has developed rapidly.Then there is the set-piece revolution at whose vanguard stands the big Brazilian. Since he arrived in England in the summer of 2020, Gabriel has scored 18 Premier League goals from dead balls. His nearest rival is James Ward-Prowse on 14. In the last four and a bit seasons of European top-flight football, only Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski better the set piece output of the Arsenal center back. Already this season he has two goals and two assists to say nothing for the defenses who seem to fall apart when he attacks a corner. In a particularly limited set of circumstances he must be defended in much the same way as Haaland. If you don't limit the supply, you find yourself in the lap of the gods.\nContinue on this current trajectory and at the very least Gabriel will get a good number of votes. To muscle his way in among the winners, though, that requires excellence both from him and his teammates. The realistic path to him beating multiple players with a lot of goals probably has to include Arsenal not just winning the Premier League but the Champions League too. In at least one of those it would have to be incredibly apparent that this win came on a bedrock of clean sheets and it probably wouldn't hurt to weigh in with a few more of those goals in the biggest games. Think Rodri's goal against West Ham in May 2024 to wrestle the Premier League in Manchester City's direction.Given that it's a World Cup year, something similar will probably need to happen with Brazil, too, a grit and grind run to the final a la Cannavaro's Italy. This column has and will continue to insist that Ballon d'Or votes have generally cleaved too far towards picking the guy with the most medals rather than the outstanding footballer of the year but in these circumstances, you'd have to bear in mind that the second of the prize's three criteria is \"team performances and achievements\". And of course, in those circumstances, Gabriel's winning of the game's biggest prizes would have kept them out of the mitts of Mbappe, Haaland and Kane. What value all those goals if, at best, they deliver a domestic title?So perhaps that intro wasn't entirely accurate. It isn't beyond the realms of possibility that a defender might win the Ballon d'Or this year. All they need to do is be the best player on teams that win their domestic league, the Champions League and then the World Cup. Chuck a disproportionate number of big goals in there too and whadyya know, there's something shiny and spherical waiting for you in September.\nBallon d'Or power rankingsA quick reminder before we dive into this list: minutes matter. How can you be the best performing footballer in the world if you aren't on the pitch for much of the season? And so when big names like Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele take a tumble, it is often because of that. These may be less pivotal games than those that come in the spring and summer but they'll still count.Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid and France (--)Erling Haaland, Man City and Norway (--)Harry Kane, Bayern Munich and England (--)Lamine Yamal, Barcelona and Spain (+3)Michael Olise, France and Bayern Munich (--)Pedri, Barcelona and Spain (-2)Gabriel Magalhaes, Arsenal and Brazil (NR)Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid and Brazil (--)Vitinha, PSG and Portugal (new entry)Bukayo Saka, Arsenal and England (--)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The hype for Travis Hunter was off the charts leading into the 2025 NFL Draft. So much so that questions of where he'd ultimately end up completely placed talk about a quarterback, Cam Ward, being the clear-cut No. 1 overall pick, on the back burner. In today's NFL, where everything revolves around the comings and goings of the quarterback, Hunter's aura engulfing the pre-draft process was impressive in itself. And when the Jaguars then stunned the league by vaulting up to the No. 2 overall pick in a blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Browns to bring in Hunter, it was pure pandemonium.The reason for all the intrigue surrounding the Colorado product was because of his stellar collegiate career as both a wide receiver and cornerback, and it was his intention to continue playing both ways at the NFL level. The Jaguars were not only on board with it, but a driving force in sending the treasure trove to Cleveland with the expectation that he'd continue to do so at an elite level. While there were flashes of that brilliance beginning to peak out, things have largely cratered for Hunter and the Jaguars, with the first-rounder now out for the season after undergoing surgery to repair the LCL in his right knee. \nDurability, specifically whether or not Hunter (or any player for that matter) playing both ways was sustainable from a health standpoint, was one of the few critiques/questions that surrounded the prospect in this attempt to be a top-flight receiver and corner in the NFL. Those concerns have since been realized, and now Jacksonville is faced with some existential questions as to the future of its No. 2 overall pick.Travis Hunter's rookie season at a glance\nOffensive snaps played: 323Defensive snaps played: 162Defensive stats: 15 total tackles, three passes defended, 56.3% completion rate against as the primary defender, 61.5 passer rating against as the primary defenderHunter became just the second player in the last 20 years to log at least 150 offensive and defensive snaps in a season. He was also the first player since 2000 to have at least 200 yards receiving and 10 or more defensive tackles in a single season. Entering Week 11, Hunter is third among rookie wide receivers in receptions and fourth in receiving yards. What Jaguars are saying about Hunter's two-way future?Naturally, coach Liam Coen was asked about Hunter's future as a two-way player in the aftermath of the news coming out that he'd be done for the year. Coen noted that it's \"very premature\" to come to any sort of conclusion on that front. \n\"I understand there's a lot of questions about if he'll remain a two-way player and all those kind of things,\" Coen told reporters Wednesday. \"All of that is very premature, and at the end of the day, like every player on this roster, he'll be evaluated at the end of the season and we'll be able to give him his three better, three best and the things that we need to continue to improve upon and the things we need to build on.\"\nShould Travis Hunter continue being a two-way player?The Jaguars need to pick a lane with Hunter or at least weigh one side of the ball drastically over the other. The first-rounder is certainly capable of playing both ways, but they run the risk of making him a master of none, at least in this early stage of his development. At the beginning of the season, Jacksonville tried to make him a true two-way player, and it produced lukewarm results. Specifically, in Week 2 and Week 3, Hunter logged over 50% of the offensive snaps and over 60% of the defensive snaps. Over that stretch, he caught four of his eight targets as a receiver for 43 yards and posted eight tackles while breaking up one pass. Hunter also gave up five catches on seven targets for 64 yards as the primary defender in coverage. \nAfter that Week 3 matchup against Houston, where Hunter logged a season-high 68.3% of the defensive snaps, the Jaguars seemed to soften their push toward making him a 50-50 two-way player and favored him more on offense as his snaps on that side of the ball increased each week from there on out.WeekOffensive snap percentageDefensive snap percentageWeek 352.9%68.3%Week 455.9%13.6%Week 567.2%39.1%Week 677.6%40%Week 787%20%Since Week 4, Hunter caught 18 of his 29 targets for 222 yards and a touchdown as a receiver. That put him on a 17-game pace of roughly 76.5 receptions, 943.5 yards, and 4.3 touchdowns. It's no surprise to see that when Hunter saw that big increase in snaps in Week 7 that he enjoyed his breakout performance of the season as a receiver. He was targeted 14 times and hauled in eight catches for 101 yards and a touchdown, albeit in a loss to the Rams. Meanwhile, he was in coverage for 12 pass defense snaps (via TruMedia) and broke up his lone target against. That feels like a potential sweet spot for Hunter as he and the Jaguars look toward 2026. Instead of playing more than half of the snaps both ways, Jacksonville should look to make him primarily a receiver with a starter's snap load, and then situationally send him out in coverage as a corner. \n        \n            \n                Travis Hunter was on verge of breaking out at WR -- now knee surgery has ended the Jaguars rookie's season\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRevisiting the Jaguars-Browns blockbusterJaguars receivedBrowns receivedNo. 2 overall pick (Travis Hunter)No. 5 overall pick (DT Mason Graham)2025 fourth-round pick (RB Bhayshul Tuten)2025 second-round pick (RB Quinshon Judkins)2025 sixth-round pick (S Rayuan Lane III)2025 fourth-round pick (RB Dylan Sampson)2026 first-round pickThe early returns on moving down from the No. 2 overall pick favor the Browns. While Hunter has the highest ceiling of any player involved thus far (Cleveland's 2026 first-rounder still to be determined), the Browns came away with three key contributors: defensive tackle Mason Graham, along with running backs Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson.Graham looks like he's going to be far more than a consolation prize with the fifth overall pick. Entering Week 11, the rookie is graded as the 37th-ranked interior defensive lineman overall, per PFF. While the sack totals (0.5) are not there, he's been able to get after the quarterback from the interior and has 16 total pressures thus far while batting down three passes. He's also been stout against the run. \nMeanwhile, the Browns were able to completely reshape their backfield through this trade with the additions of Judkins and Sampson. After joining the team in Week 2, Judkins has been sensational, rushing for 561 yards and five touchdowns through eight games. That puts him on a rushing pace of roughly 1,192 yards and 10 touchdowns for a full season. While Judkins is the feature back and a potential star at the position, Sampson has been solid as a passing-down back when given the opportunity, catching 21 of his 24 targets for 136 yards receiving. If that 2026 first-rounder from the Jaguars helps land the Browns another starter, it's a lopsided deal in their favor, especially if it's an avenue toward their starting quarterback. Can the Jaguars still 'win' the trade?When the Jaguars made the trade up to No. 2 to land Hunter, it became the first deal inside the top two for a non-quarterback since Orlando Pace in 1997. It was a massive price tag, but it was for a player who they believe can be a top player at two key positions. If he one day lives up to being Jacksonville's No. 1 receiver and No. 1 corner and does so at a high level, it could maybe end up being worth the haul. Right now, it feels like an overpay for a player who had his plate filled to the brim and got hurt. They need to focus on making him a No. 1 option in one area before moving on to the next, and before we can consider them a potential winner in this deal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas heads into this weekend's visit with Georgia playing to keep its College Football Playoff hopes alive. After a shaky start to the season that saw Arch Manning struggle and led several reactionary college voices to dub him the biggest bust in college football history, Manning looks to be figuring it out. In the last two games, the former five-star passer threw for 674 yards and six touchdowns as Texas moved to 7-2 on the season.Considering they started the season ranked No. 1 in both the coaches and AP poll, that record seems like a disappointment, but given the way the early part of the season started and the noise around Manning, the Longhorns being in striking distance of their season goals is a positive development. A monstrous three-game stretch begins Saturday Between the Hedges. But for a few changes of fortune, Texas could be lining up against Manning.Georgia was front and center in the recruitment and ended up being one of the biggest opponents for Texas in their pursuit of the most high-profile recruit of all time. The Longhorns won out by a comfortable margin with Manning, but Georgia was right there in the thick of the fight. \n\"I got to know him, our staff got to know him,\" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said this week of Manning's recruitment. \"He came over here a lot. He was very honest and had his thoughts about both programs. He liked both programs. He had to pick one.\"\nHere's a look back at how two college football giants went head-to-head for Manning in the most famous race in recruiting history.Manning's post-sophomore barnstorming tourThe Manning family knew that Arch's recruitment could turn into a circus if it wasn't managed correctly. Following his highly profiled freshman season at New Orleans' Isidore Newman, the family kept offers quiet and recruiting largely off of his radar. After he completed his sophomore season, Manning's parents and grandparents decided to start honing in on the schools he was interested in.\nDuring the summer following his sophomore season (so, 2021), Manning made trips to SMU, Clemson, LSU, Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Ole Miss. It was a preliminary tour designed to lay some groundwork for his list of offers and figure out where he wanted to return for game visits that fall. Steve Sarkisian and quarterbacks coach AJ Milwee at Texas were already building a strong bond with Manning, but the family loved what then-OC Todd Monken brought to the table as a play-caller at Georgia. Manning also told 247Sports prior to his junior season that Athens was \"the coolest college town there is.\" Georgia may have been the early favorite, though there's no telling. Manning's recruitment heats up during junior seasonAs he moved into his junior year (fall of 2021) Texas, Alabama and Georgia started to separate as Manning made several campus visits. Ole Miss also remained in the picture given the family ties to the Rebels, but there was talk behind the scenes the family wanted Arch to choose his own path. Manning visited Athens for a September matchup against South Carolina, where he was photographed in the stands in Georgia gear. The Bulldogs had involvement from Monken along with Buster Faulkner, who served as an assistant quarterbacks coach. The family also had a great relationship with offensive line coach Matt Luke, who was formerly the head coach at Ole Miss.\nGeorgia fans made it clear they wanted Arch.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Manning then attended a game at Alabama in early October before going to Texas a few weeks later. Texas suffered a disappointing loss to Oklahoma State in Year 1 of Sarkisian's tenure, but sources told us that Manning loved the visit and was building a bond with several recruits and players near the program. Manning's former head coach Nelson Stewart told 247Sports that Texas was doing a phenomenal job recruiting Manning.\"I think they have done an outstanding job establishing a relationship with him from the start,\" Stewart said. \"Coach Sark's direct involvement in his recruitment comes across as very authentic and special. It's obvious Arch and him have a great connection. It's all happened very naturally and nothing has been forced. AJ Milwee has also been instrumental in establishing the same type of connection with Arch. Credit to Texas for the way they have handled his recruitment and done things how I feel is the right way. That's why they are where they are with him.\"Trio of powerhouses emerge after junior seasonManning finished his junior season and took some time away from recruiting to consider his options. Though he never officially named favorites, sources indicated that Texas, Georgia and Alabama were the top three schools in contention for Manning. It was setting up to be a heavyweight battle with Manning scheduling spring visits (2022) following his basketball season before he ultimately set his summer official visit schedule.Manning's first two spring visits were scheduled to Georgia on March 19 and Texas on March 24. While there was lip service paid to schools like LSU, Florida and Virginia, nobody with any knowledge of the situation thought he'd end up outside of the trio of bluebloods. Coming out of those trips, Manning set a return visit to Alabama, but the buzz was that Texas and Georgia had pulled ahead. Texas continued to set the tone on the relationship front while the overall operation at Georgia impressed Manning and his family.\"Both he and his dad loved the organization of practice,\" Isidore Newman head coach Nelson Stewart said. \"It was really, just everybody was always moving. They loved the meetings and installs with Coach (Todd) Monken. It sounded like the structure was just great. Everything flowed and the attention to detail. Obviously Kirby's enthusiasm, not just with the starters but with the backups, that was something both said was great. The energy Kirby has, you see on the sideline, coaching all his players, not just one specific group.\"Obviously they love Athens. Love the facilities and I think they came away reaffirmed with things they thought. Just incredibly well organized, energetic and I'm glad he's able to go into meetings and go into practice and see how things are really run. That's the neat thing about Arch, his family, this recruitment. It's not about the bells and whistles, it's about getting in the weeds and seeing how things work and forming those relationships and I think both came back really excited about everything he saw.\"Though it didn't eliminate Alabama from contention, the Crimson Tide took fellow Louisiana passer Eli Holstein in the class, flipping him from Texas A&M (Holstein is at Pitt now). Manning set three official visits for Georgia (June 3), Alabama (June 10) and Texas (June 17).\nManning chooses Texas in pivotal summer decisionComing out of his March visit, the talk was around Texas and Georgia, but several sources close to Manning conceded that the Longhorns held the edge. Over the previous two years, Manning had been making friends with targets of several of the programs he was looking into, but it was clear he was making inroads with more players from Texas than anywhere else.He'd also grown close to several current and former players at prestigious Austin Westlake High School, including safety Michael Taaffe, who was a walk-on for the Longhorns at the time. Taaffe earned near-legendary status for being Manning's primary host on his visits and building a bond that would ultimately help get Manning to Austin. Manning's relationship with the Westlake players was so good, there was briefly a rumor around the state that Manning would transfer to the Austin area to play his senior season, though there was ultimately nothing to that.After Manning finished his visits, there was talk that he could stretch the recruitment into the fall and consider more programs. Though nobody near Manning was talking much, he'd made his decision. He'd make that commitment public nearly a week later on June 23, 2022. His head coach told 247Sports that the relationships made the difference.\"From the beginning of their recruitment. from the first Zoom he had with Sark, it was a real connection between the two,\" Stewart said. \"I think the authenticity, getting to know him and the extension of A.J. Milwee and the importance of the quarterback coach being able to echo the sentiments of the head coach, they're a great team. It's all been very natural. They worked tremendously hard in recruiting. I remember two times I came into the weight room in the morning and AJ is already sitting there with the lights on with his Starbucks.\"Texas used Manning's commitment to build momentum and finish with the No. 3 recruiting class in the 2023 cycle. After sitting for two years behind Quinn Ewers, Manning made his debut as a regular starter. Saturday's matchup against Georgia will have big implications for the SEC race and playoff picture, and if Manning plays a role in a Texas win, it's a reminder of how a recruiting win can change fortunes.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Horns247 has one of the most experienced journalists in the Texas market in Chip Brown.

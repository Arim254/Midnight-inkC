However, back-to-back losses to the Bengals and Steelers put them back into second in the division and now they're in a chase position again. The Ravens avenged their loss to Cincinnati with a 24-0 shutout victory last week and the defense has generally played much better since the Week 5 bye. With New England having blown a 21-point lead against the Bills with a chance to clinch the AFC East last week, the model sees some cracks in the Patriots' armor. It predicts that Baltimore covers the spread in 55% of simulations.Over 47.5 pointsThe Patriots have one of the best run defenses (fifth in rushing yards allowed) in the NFL, but they were gutted for 168 yards on the ground last week by the Bills. Now they'll take on a Ravens rushing attack that ranks third in the NFL and just put up 189 yards in their win over the Bengals. Meanwhile, the New England offense still managed to score 31 points last week and rushed for a season-high 246 yards. The Patriots have had exceptional balance all season, throwing 411 times and rushing 401 times.

    "body": "\nBoth teams need a victory in NFL Week 16 when the Detroit Lions host the Pittsburgh Steelers with both teams entering Sunday at 8-6 and in danger of missing the playoffs. The Steelers are in a good position, sitting a game ahead of the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North, but they likely need to hold that spot to make the postseason. The Lions are unlikely to win their division as they are two games behind the Chicago Bears (10-4) in the NFC North and 1.5 behind the 9-4-1 Green Bay Packers, who are second in the division and hold the final playoff spot.   Kickoff from Ford Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Lions are 7-point favorites in the latest Steelers vs. Lions odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points scored is 52. Detroit's over/under for total points scored is 30.5, while Pittsburgh's is 21.5. Before you make any Lions vs. Steelers picks of your own, make sure to look at the top NFL picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times. \nWhere to watch Steelers vs. Lions on SundayWhen: Sunday, Dec. 21Time: 4:25 p.m. ETTV: CBSStream: Paramount+  Follow along: CBS Sports AppSteelers vs. Lions betting previewOdds: Lions -7, Over/Under 52Both teams are 7-7 against the spread, but Pittsburgh has covered in consecutive games and is 6-3 ATS in its past nine in December. Detroit is 10-2 in its past 12 against AFC teams. The Lions have the league's highest-scoring offense (30.6 points per game), which is why they are 9-5 to the Over, including 6-1 in their past seven. Pittsburgh is 7-7 but has scored at least 27 points in four of its past five games. The Detroit defense gives up 24.6 points per game (23rd in NFL) and Pittsburgh gives up an average of 25.4 on the road. Steelers vs. Lions SGPLions -7Jahmyr Gibbs Over 74.5 rushing yardsJared Goff Over 263.5 passing yards Bet it at DraftKings:\nModel's Steelers vs. Lions score prediction, picksThe model sees some value in taking the Steelers as plus-money underdogs on the money line, as they are winning in 35% of simulations. Detroit is covering the spread 52% of the time, and the simulations peg the score right on the number. The props model is expecting a big day for the Lions' offensive players, with Goff predicted to throw for 304 yards and Gibbs to rush for almost 91. Goff is averaging 262 yards per game but has topped this total in three of the past four and had a season-high 338 last week. Gibbs entered NFL Week 16 sixth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and is averaging 5.5 yards per carry. He has five runs of at least 42 yards this season, so one big run could get him halfway there.Steelers vs. Lions score prediction: Lions 30, Steelers 22\nWant more Week 16 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Detroit Lions.

    "body": "\n        For the second time in a matter of weeks, the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals have agreed to a trade involving a three-time All-Star honoree. First it was right-hander Sonny Gray, and now, on Sunday night, the Red Sox are adding first baseman Willson Contreras in a four-player swap.As is tradition at CBS Sports whenever a notable trade happens, I appear to offer instant analysis. Below, you'll find reports on every involved player and their potential fit. I also boil those parts down to a letter grade for both sides, though those are the least important parts of the piece.Before moving on, here is the trade in its entirety:Red Sox receive: 1B Willson Contreras, $8 millionCardinals receive: RHP Hunter Dobbins, RHP Yhoiker Fajardo, RHP Blake Aita\n        \n            \n                Willson Contreras traded to Red Sox: Boston acquires veteran slugger from Cardinals, per report\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNow, let's conduct some business.Red Sox grade: AContreras, 33, hit .257/.344/.447 (123 OPS+) with 20 home runs in his maiden voyage as a first baseman. He continues to possess explosive bat speed and, for the first time in his career, he lifted and pulled more than 19% of his balls in play. Expect his raw stats to look significantly better if that sticks in 2026: whereas Busch Stadium plays as neutral or worse for right-handed hitters, Fenway Park happens to be one of the top destinations for a righty looking to pad his numbers.Generally, bat speed is one of the main concerns for right-handed first baseman aging into their mid-30s. That variable not only impacts their slugging capacity, but also their ability to keep their strikeout rate in check. While Contreras swings and misses and punches out his fair share, it should be encouraging that he improved both his in-zone and overall contact rates in 2025 -- and did so with only a slight reduction in his swing rate. Anything and everything can happen in this sport. Still, Contreras looks like he ought to be good for another above-average showing or two.\nContreras' contract calls for him to be paid $18 million next season, $18.5 million in 2027, and an adjusted $7.5 million buyout on a club option for 2028, per The Athletic. He'll also net $1 million here for agreeing to waive his no-trade clause. Minus what the Cardinals are sending over, the Red Sox will be responsible for $36 million over the next two-plus seasons. That'll push the Red Sox closer to the first tax line, but there's no excuse for them to stay under -- not when they have a playoff-caliber roster in place that should be in contention for the American League pennant.Plus, put another way, they're paying Contreras almost the exact same terms the Chicago White Sox will pay Munetaka Murakami -- the latter being younger, but  arguably much riskier. (It's also much less than the Baltimore Orioles are paying Pete Alonso, who shares some of the same general concerns as Contreras.)It's to be seen how the Red Sox fill out the rest of their infield. You figure Trevor Story will be back at shortstop, but otherwise? Boston has Marcelo Mayer, Ceddanne Rafaela, Kristian Campbell, and David Hamilton on hand. They also have reported interest in retaining free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. And that's without taking incumbent first baseman Tristan Casas into account. In other words, the Red Sox still have a lot of sorting out to do between now and Opening Day 2026.\nIf nothing else, the Red Sox were able to net an above-average stick on a short, cheap agreement for more of their pitching surplus without touching anyone they're likely to miss in 2026 (Payton Tolle or Connelly Early) or compromising other pursuits. This, then, seems like another fine swap both ways.Cardinals grade: AIf nothing else, you have to credit the Cardinals for paying down Contreras' salary to get a better return. They did the same in the Gray deal (a move that also received an \"A\" grade). In total, the Cardinals will have spent $28 million to ensure that the Red Sox could take both players on. Expect St. Louis to throw around more coin to facilitate a potential Nolan Arenado trade later this winter.Dobbins, 26, appeared 13 times and compiled a 4.13 ERA (100 ERA+) and a 2.65 strikeout-to-walk ratio before tearing his ACL in July. He's a supinator who threw five pitches at least 9% of the time last season, including three different breaking balls: a shorter slider, longer sweeper, and a curveball that generated his highest whiff rate. Dobbins' mid-90s fastball featured far more cutting action than expected, though the pitch-quality algorithms consider it to be a below-average offering anyway. (It's hard to argue based on results, seeing as how opponents hit .316 and slugged .453 versus it.)\nWhen Dobbins returns to the fold, he could figure into the back of the Cardinals' rotation. Remember, St. Louis has already added two other prospective starters this winter: free-agent signing Dustin May and right-hander Richard Fitts, who came over as part of the aforementioned Gray trade.\nFajardo, 19, was acquired last winter from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for lefty Cam Booser. He's a tall right-hander who spent most of last season in the Carolina League, tallying a 2.98 ERA and a 2.95 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Fajardo is, predictably, given his youth, a work in progress. His arsenal includes a pair of fastballs that can get into the mid-to-upper 90s, as well as a quality breaking ball. He's thrown strikes and coerced a high rate of ground balls thus far, and there's a clear pathway for him to become a big-league starter in due time. Stay tuned.Aita, 22, was a sixth-round pick in the 2024 Draft. He made 23 appearances across Low- and High-A, scoring a 3.98 ERA and a 3.30 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Aita features a flatter plane to the plate and a tremendous feel for spin that manifests in (among other pitches) a quality slider. He's a candidate to take a step forward with the right player development support, making him another possible big-league contributor -- maybe even in a starting role if everything goes well.\nIt's not the flashiest set of names, but top executive Chaim Bloom has successfully added three interesting arms who could log starts and/or innings over the years to come. That's a nice piece of business considering how most front offices these tend to regard the value of non-elite right-right first basemen in their mid 30s.\n            ",

That's when the All-Pro wide receiver frantically whipped the football backward with the hopes a teammate would recover the football and run in for the game-winning touchdown. Funny enough, Goff did just that despite the Steelers defense appearing to stop playing because it seemed like St. Brown was held up long enough for the play to be blown dead because of forward progress. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: 49ers, Bears punch their tickets; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, Goff's scoop and score off St. Brown's lateral was wiped away because St. Brown pushed off of Steelers All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey to make the initial catch at the start of the play. \nHead referee Carl Cheffers explained that because the penalty was on the offense that Goff's touchdown was nullified. By NFL rules, an offensive penalty when time has expired does not trigger a replay of the previous play, so the Steelers walked away with a crucial, late-season victory.\nThe Lions' playoff hopes are now slim to none as a result of their last-second loss. Detroit needs the Green Bay Packers, the current owner of the NFC's seventh and final playoff spot, to lose their last two games against the Baltimore Ravens (7-7) and the Minnesota Vikings (7-8), and the Lions also need to win their last two games at the Vikings and at the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (11-4). \n            \n    ",

Over its first 31 plays, it had produced just 113 yards -- a paltry 3.6 yards per play.It's a good thing for the Steelers they got a 32nd play -- and that Kenneth Gainwell made arguably the best play of the season. With just 11 seconds left in the half and trailing the Detroit Lions 10-3, Aaron Rodgers lofted a deep ball to Kenneth Gainwell, who somehow fought through a pass interference by Alex Anzalone, got a hand under the ball while lying on his back, then secured the ball, got up untouched and scored. See for yourself:\nThe 45-yard score was the longest receiving touchdown by a Steelers running back since Dwight Stone went 78 yards in 1988, according to CBS Sports research.Gainwell, in his first season in Pittsburgh, is having a career year across the board, and this, his seventh touchdown of the season, also set a career high.\nBoth the Steelers and the Lions entered this game 8-6. Pittsburgh currently leads the AFC North by one game over the Baltimore Ravens; the Lions are just on the outside looking in on the NFC playoff picture. If Pittsburgh hangs on to make the playoff or Detroit ends up missing out, this play could be a huge reason why.\n            \n    ",

He went back to the locker room with Baltimore training staffers, and after the team initially ruled him questionable to return, he was ruled out for the game late in the third quarter.Jackson, 28, took a knee to the back while going down on a run and left the field. Tyler Huntley took over for one play, and the Ravens kicked a field goal on the next snap after that to tie the game, 10-10. Huntley played the Ravens' final drive of the half as well.\nJackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries all season. He suffered a hamstring strain in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and missed three games, returning in Week 9 against the Miami Dolphins. However, he has only had one full week of practice since then due to knee, ankle and toe ailments. He also dealt with an illness this week.Jackson's rushing production has fallen off steadily this season, especially in the wake of the hamstring injury and the injuries that followed. Entering Week 16, he is averaging 30.3 rushing yards per game this season, by far a career low. His 5.5 rushes per game are also on pace to be a career low.\nAs of Jackson's back injury, Ravens (7-7) are 1.5 games back of the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) in the AFC North. Baltimore has a 20% chance to make the playoffs, per SportsLine.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool's Alexander Isak is suspected to have broken his leg during the team's win at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, likely forcing him to spend several months on the sidelines, according to The Athletic.The extent of the injury is still unclear since the team is still waiting on results from an MRI, though the Reds feared it is a serious one, according to the report. Should Isak be diagnosed with a lower leg fracture, it would likely require several months for him to heal and return to the pitch.Isak sustained the injury in the 56th minute, shortly after coming on as a halftime substitute for Conor Bradley. He received a pass from Florian Wirtz as he made his way into the box, quickly taking a shot from close range. As the ball flew into the back of the net, though, Spurs' Micky van de Ven approached Isak for a challenge and the Liverpool forward landed awkwardly. Isak did not join his teammates in the celebration, instead he received medical treatment and then walked off the pitch with the assistance of medical staff four minutes later.\nThe Sweden international's diagnosis was not clear immediately after the game, with manager Arne Slot admitting he did not know the extent of the injury.\n\"If a player doesn't even try to come back, that is usually not a good thing but I cannot say anything more than that,\" Slot said post-match. \"That is just gut feeling and nothing medical … Let's not be too negative yet. We don't know yet, let's hope he is back with us soon.\"Isak notched his second goal of the Premier League season before he came off injured and will likely miss an important stretch of the season, aiming to settle into his new surroundings after a slow start to life at Liverpool. The injury is expected to put a big dent in his first season at the club, though, as well as provide a new set of challenges in a difficult campaign for the reigning champions.Liverpool's festive fixturesDec. 27: Wolverhampton Wanderers (h)Jan. 1: Leeds United (a)Jan. 4: Fulham (a)Jan. 8: Arsenal (a)How will Liverpool cope without Alexander Isak?Questions about how Liverpool will fare without Isak are peculiar ones since the 26-year-old has been off to a slow start since his $174 million move from Newcastle United over the summer. He arrived injured, though, and Slot argued that Isak's early weeks with the Reds were like a preseason since the forward missed out on Newcastle's preparation during a tense period between him and his old club, hampering his ability to perform upon arrival. As a result, he has not exactly been a staple for the Reds – he has nine starts between all competitions and just two league goals for the Reds so far.\nIsak would have had more opportunities to impress during the festive fixtures, especially considering Liverpool's absences. Mohamed Salah is currently with Egypt as they begin to compete in the Africa Cup of Nations, while Cody Gakpo, who has four goals and three assists in the Premier League this season, is dealing with a muscle issue that will keep him out until the new year. Liverpool may have to rely solely on Hugo Ekitike, who has eight goals in his first Premier League season, during a busy period that ends with a trip to Arsenal on January 8.Other options include Federico Chiesa and academy product Rio Ngumoha, though neither have started a league match this season.It is unclear if Liverpool will dip into the transfer market specifically with Isak's injury in mind, though the Reds have reportedly agreed to terms with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo over an $87 million move in January, per The Guardian. Semenyo has eight Premier League goals for Bournemouth this season but plays much more frequently on the wing, while Isak is more of a No. 9.\nSweden's World Cup qualification fateIf Isak is diagnosed with a broken leg, he is likely to miss Sweden's crucial World Cup qualifiers in March. Sweden are set to face Ukraine on March 26, the winner then meeting either Poland or Albania on March 31 for a berth at next summer's tournament in North America. The eventual winner of that playoff will be placed into Group F at the World Cup, where they will face the Netherlands, Japan and Tunisia.Isak played three matches for Sweden in the first round of UEFA World Cup qualifying last fall, though he did not get on the scoresheet during a horrid run that saw the team score just four goals and concede 12 in six games. Sweden, though, were able to reach the playoff round – which will take place in March – because of their performance in the UEFA Nations League, a saving grace for a team that would otherwise be watching the World Cup from home.Sweden will have to rely on the likes of Newcastle's Anthony Elanga and Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres instead, neither of whom have been in particularly strong form this season. Gyokeres has five league goals for Arsenal this season but just one assist for Sweden in World Cup qualifiers, while Elanga has one goal for the national team during qualification but has yet to score in the Premier League this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf has put himself at risk of being suspended by the NFL. At the very least, his pockets certainly will be a bit lighter.During the first half of the Steelers' Week 16 matchup against the Detroit Lions, Metcalf was seen interacting with a fan in the stands. He then threw a closed fist at the fan's face before walking away.Check out what happened, here:\nCBS rules analyst Gene Steratore explained that because this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by the officials, it could not be penalized. \"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in to from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said.\nThe Detroit Free Press tracked down the fan in the stands, and asked them what they said to Metcalf and what their name was.\"What, my full name isn't is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf,\" the fan said. \"He doesn't like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"The fan was reportedly ejected from Ford Field after the incident. Metcalf is in his first season with the Steelers after being acquired via trade from the Seattle Seahawks in March. He is Pittsburgh's leading receiver with 55 catches for 808 yards and six touchdowns, and it would be a massive loss for Aaron Rodgers & Co. if Metcalf were to be suspended for his actions. The Steelers visit the 3-12 Browns next Sunday. \nThe 8-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North battle with the 7-7 Baltimore Ravens, who host the New England Patriots this week on \"Sunday Night Football.\" The Steelers and Ravens face off in the regular-season finale in Week 18, which could be for the AFC North crown and a spot in the playoffs. \n            ",

A touchdown would give the Lions the lead with seconds remaining.Then it all fell apart: An offensive pass interference overturned an Amon-Ra St. Brown touchdown and sent the Lions back to the 11. A false start moved them back to the 16.\n        \n            \n                What happened on final play in Steelers' chaotic 29-24 road win over Lions? Making sense of dramatic ending\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShortly thereafter, the knockout punch -- a strange and controversial one -- landed: St. Brown caught a pass at the 1-yard line and lateraled to Jared Goff, who scored as time expired. However, St. Brown had been flagged for offensive pass interference, and the heroic effort was for naught. Here's the full explanation.\nThat sequence may well be emblematic of Detroit's season as a whole.After the Chicago Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night, the Lions were just one game back of the Packers, who added quarterback Jordan Love (concussion) to their lengthy list of significant injuries. Instead, the Lions fell to 8-7, a result that had two significant NFC playoff implications:The Bears (11-4) clinched a playoff berth, because the Lions can no longer reach 11 wins.The San Francisco 49ers (10-4) clinched a playoff berth, because the 49ers' 8-2 conference record is better than what the Lions can possibly reach.It also narrowed Detroit's postseason path to just about the narrowest one possible. The Packers (9-5-1) remained 1.5 games up on the Lions with two games to go for both teams, meaning the Lions' only path to the playoffs is to win both of their next two games AND have the Packers lose both of their next two games.\nLions schedule: Week 17 at Vikings, Week 18 at BearsPackers schedule: Week 17 vs. Ravens, Week 18 at VikingsSportsLine projections give Detroit a 5% chance to make the postseason.\n            \n    ",

The Chiefs specifically struggled to stay healthy this season, and that trend continued during their Week 16 showdown with the Tennessee Titans. During the first half, Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him being out for the remainder of the game. The Chiefs fear that Minshew tore his ACL in the loss, ESPN reports. Veteran backup Chris Oladokun replaced him and went 6 of 8 for 45 yards in the first half after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. Tennessee is now 3-11 on the year, while the Chiefs fell to 6-9. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nOladokun finished the game with 111 yards on 11 of 16 passing. He was sacked four times while directing one scoring drive during the game's final 30 minutes. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned his first Pro Bowl berth in 2023 after throwing a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Red Sox have acquired veteran slugger Willson Contreras in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, reports ESPN. The Cardinals will receive righty Hunter Dobbins and minor-league pitchers Yhoiker Fajardo and Blake Aita in return, according to The Athletic. This is the second significant Cardinals/Red Sox trade this offseason; Boston sent two young pitchers to St. Louis for Sonny Gray last month.Similar to Gray, Contreras will receive an additional $1 million in guaranteed money in exchange for waiving his no-trade clause, according to the Boston Globe. He is signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028, and now has $42.5 million coming his way. The Cardinals will pay $8 million of the $42.5 million, reports MassLive. While Contreras initially showed no interest in leaving St. Louis, even in the face of the ongoing rebuild, he eventually reconsidered and waived it to approve the deal to a Red Sox club that, unlike the Cardinals, figures to contend in 2026.\n        \n            \n                Willson Contreras trade grades: Red Sox finally get their big bat, Cardinals continue clearing out veterans\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe trade pushes Boston's payroll into the same range as last year, meaning the the Red Sox will either have to raise payroll or shed a contract(s) to bring back third baseman Alex Bregman.Contreras, who's going into his age-34 season, is a former catcher who will likely man first base and DH for the Red Sox, as he did for the Cardinals in 2025. He gives Boston a needed middle-of-the-order righty bat and fits Fenway Park well given his above-average pulled fly ball rate. Contreras is coming off another productive season: \nThose 2025 outputs were good for a 123 OPS+ and a 2.5 WAR in 135 games. Contreras continues to back up his strong offensive production with similarly imposing batted-ball indicators. All of that suggests he's likely to continue producing at a high level for the time being. For his career, the three-time All-Star has an OPS+ of 118 and a WAR of 29.2 across parts of 10 MLB seasons. Over that same span, he's averaged 26 home runs and 31 doubles per 162 games played. Defensively, Contreras put up strong numbers last season, his first as a primary first baseman.Dobbins, 26, had a 4.13 ERA with 45 strikeouts in 61 innings in 2025, his first season in the majors. A knee injury ended his season in July, though he is expected to be ready in time for spring training. MLB Pipeline ranked Fajardo as the No. 23 prospect in Boston's system, calling him a \"potential mid-rotation starter.\" Aita was unranked. He and Fajardo both pitched in Single-A in 2025.\nBoston went 87-73 in 2025 and reached the postseason for the first time since 2021. They were eliminated by the rival New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The two teams who met in last season's Western Conference Finals will get reacquainted on Thursday's NBA schedule as the Oklahoma City Thunder visit the Minnesota Timberwolves. OKC (38-10) won that West Finals series in five games and is coming off a 104-95 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday. Minnesota (29-19) has won back-to-back outings, most recently defeating Dallas, 118-105, on Wednesday. Guard Jalen Williams (hamstring) is out for Oklahoma City. Mike Conley (back) is out for Minnesota, while Rudy Gobert (ankle) is questionable. Tipoff is at 9:30 p.m. ET from the Target Center in Minneapolis. These teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight regular-season matchups, with the Wolves prevailing in the last meeting. The latest Timberwolves vs. Thunder odds have OKC as 6.5-point favorites per DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 228.5.

The Thunder lead the league in scoring and rank among the top three in field goal percentage, 2-point percentage and free throw percentage. As for the Wolves, they own the No. 5 scoring offense and also boast top-5 rankings in field goal percentage and 3-point percentage.OKC will be without defensive ace Alex Caruso (adductor) and All-Defensive member in Jalen Williams, while Cason Wallace (hip), who ranks second in the NBA with 2.1 steals per game, is questionable. That's lots of firepower on the defensive end for the Thunder, which is why the model projects them to allow nearly 5 more points than their regular season average. With that, the Over hits 51.8% of the time.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits well over 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. \nSo who wins Thunder vs. Wolves, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Timberwolves vs. Thunder spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two superstars will change their fortunes at the WWE Royal Rumble. On Saturday, one man and one woman will secure world title matches at WrestleMania 42. Every year, the Royal Rumble jump-starts the Road to WrestleMania. Superstars throw each other over the top rope with hopes of winning the Rumble. This year, Cody Rhodes seeks to become only the second superstar to win three Rumbles, a feat achieved only by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. That's a tall task with a stacked field featuring Roman Reigns, Jacob Fatu and Bron Breakker.Nine former world champions are set for the women's Rumble, including Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan. Rounding out the card is Drew McIntyre's first undisputed WWE title defense against Sami Zayn, plus the potential finale of \"The Phenomenal\" AJ Styles. It's a high-stakes retirement match pitting Styles' career against Gunther's Rumble spot.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what   the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action   goes down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n2026 WWE Royal Rumble predictionsMen's Royal Rumble match: While WWE pulled a brilliant move last year by having Jey Uso win the Rumble to the surprise of everyone, it feels as though there is a good chance that this year's edition gets the \"expected winner\" treatment. Breakker is very clearly positioned to challenge CM Punk for the world heavyweight championship at WrestleMania. While Oba Femi might be the man who has the standout Rumble performance, Breakker has the backing of The Vision, who has agreed to help Breakker get the win. It's not the most shocking outcome, but it makes plenty of sense to set up a big match for WrestleMania. Pick: Breakker wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)Women's Royal Rumble match: Where is Belair? She contributed to the best match of WrestleMania 41 weekend, a women's world title match with Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. During the match, she suffered a finger injury that sidelined her for over eight months. In July, Belair told CBS Sports that she was at \"the tail end of this healing process,\" but we still haven't seen her wrestle. She re-entered the women's world title scene on the road to WrestleMania last year. I cross my fingers that she does the same this year as a surprise entrant. Pick: Belair wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse) Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: Sometimes, you have to just look at a match and think, \"Hey, why not?\" It's fairly clear that Zayn will eventually have a run with a world title, and this is an easy opportunity to put the title on him for a month or two before taking it off of him ahead of WrestleMania. It probably makes sense to keep the title on McIntyre, but if we aren't going to get surprising Rumble winners, why not a surprising title change? Pick: Zayn wins -- Brookhouse\nMcIntyre and Zayn both deserve solid world title reigns, but the defending champ deserves it slightly more. This version of McIntyre has repeatedly fallen short, or had his reign ended the same night it started. McIntyre must win his first title defense, especially amid his feuds with Rhodes and Fatu. I'm not sure McIntyre enters WrestleMania, let alone leaves it, with the undisputed WWE title, but he should hold it past the Rumble. Pick: McIntyre wins -- Mahjouri  AJ Styles vs. Gunther: Do I want Gunther to win? No. I want Styles, my all-time favorite professional wrestler, to deny a loss that would see him retire. I want him to steal Gunther's Rumble spot and win the 30-man match, 10 years after he debuted at the same event, before he retires in 2026. I want him to headline WrestleMania and further his phenomenal legacy. The story is right there. Sometimes the obvious decision is the right one, but I'm not confident WWE will see it through. Reports about creative shake-ups inspire some hope, but not enough to pick against the modern-day legend killer. Pick: Gunther wins -- Mahjouri  Styles isn't going to lose a retirement match. Sure, they could do a rerun of the referee missing Gunther tapping out only for Gunther to win and then reverse the decision on Raw, but that feels unnecessarily complicated. Rather than jumping through unnecessary hoops, Styles should just get the win and continue along his final year as an active wrestler. Pick: Styles wins -- Brookhouse  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It is not often that five-time major champion Brooks Koepka is nervous, but nerves are what he expressed Tuesday when speaking with the media La Jolla, California, ahead of his return to the PGA Tour. Getting the hard part out of the way, Koepka was able to focus on golf alone Thursday as he signed for an opening 1-over 73 at the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open.\"[I was nervous] just because I care,\" Koepka said. \"I think I've fallen back in love with the game. And honestly, watching my son play a little bit and wanting to be able to see him watch me, or I guess want him to watch me play well and realize how much this game's given me, how fun it is and how cool it is to just be out here.\"Koepka's score positions him 11 strokes behind first-round leader Justin Rose, who blitzed the North Course at Torrey Pines with a stellar 10-under 62. As for those who played on the more difficult South Course, like Koepka, Seamus Power was the low man with a 7-under 65. Power and Koepka will face a less stern test on Friday as the North Course was more than three strokes easier than the South Course in Round 1.Not only did Koepka's return mark his first start on the PGA Tour (not including major championships) since the 2022 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, but Thursday saw him take his first competitive reps since the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in early October 2025. As such, some form of rust was inevitable as he played alongside Max Homa and Ludvig Åberg.\n\"I felt like it was pretty good,\" Koepka said. \"I struck it really well. I didn't hit enough fairways. If I was able to get to the back of the ball, I felt like I hit a good quality shot. Didn't really make any putts besides 18 right there. Yeah, it felt good. It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing. I just need to kind of play my way into it.\"For Koepka, it came off the tee and on the greens as he struggled to consistently position himself in the short grass, carding a single birdie despite giving himself a handful of quality looks. The 35-year-old started with a sweet-looking swing into the par-4 1st, where his approach left him 10 feet for an initial birdie that was not meant to be.Koepka hit his first four greens in regulation as he battled the right off the tee and put a bogey on the scorecard along the coast on the par-4 4th, where he required three putts from just about 50 feet. A missed opportunity came on the accessible par-5 6th as Koepka caught a ride on the par train as he rounded the turn in 1 over.\nHe did well to get through a difficult stretch of the golf course unscathed and arrived at the par-5 13th with a real chance to get back to even. After lashing a fairway wood out of the rough and short of the green, Koepka was on the receiving end of an unfortunate break as his third settled long of the green, leaving him a difficult up-and-down. Unable to save par, Koepka drifted to 2 over.The bogey may have brought another square to Koepka's scorecard, but it was also followed by fluid, compact swings. Koepka split his last two fairways and four greens in regulation. His second into the par-5 finisher sizzled through the green, leaving him another difficult scramble opportunity that he cashed in on to return to 1 over.\nAll in all, Koepka did not appear that far off. He was required to be defensive on most of his birdie putts as he left himself looks from above the hole. The breaks did not necessarily bounce his way, either. As the round progressed, he settled into his own. He remained patient and composed, and the good news is it will only get easier from here on out -- both because his play will take place on the North Course on Friday and because the noise surrounding his return should only get quieter.\n\"[I'm appreciating] everything,\" Koepka said. \"Just the opportunity to be out here. I think that's the main thing. Just being out here and seeing how quickly this has all kind of come together. It's kind of blown my mind, and I'm just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys.\"Rose rises to the occasion on the North CourseThe ageless wonder! Rose ripped off 10 birdies late on Thursday to shoot up the leaderboard and command the solo first-round lead. The 45-year-old is no stranger to taking it deep early in the Farmers Insurance Open, as he opened his 2019 tournament with a 63. He ended up winning that event and looks keen to do the same just seven starts removed from his last victory at the St. Jude Championship in last summer's FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        We're  one week out from the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Who will get moved, and where, is very much top of mind around the league right now. ",
    "body": "\n        We're  one week out from the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Who will get moved, and where, is very much top of mind around the league right now. For all the understandable lusting over Giannis Antetokounmpo now that the Bucks are reportedly listening to offers for their superstar, there are several other potential trade candidates who can be considered less valuable and far riskier. Sometimes not acquiring a certain player ends up being the wiser move.What follows is a group we'll call The Avoidables -- five players it would be smarter to steer clear of for various reasons. Buyer beware. 1. Anthony Davis, MavericksInitial reports had Davis undergoing hand surgery that would have shut him down for the remainder of the season. That was eventually walked back after Davis pushed back and voiced his displeasure on social media. Instead, after the Mavericks star consulted with a second specialist, it was announced that the big man would be reevaluated after six weeks. It was another brutal setback to add to AD's long list of health concerns over the years. The man has suffered an outrageous number of injuries in his career, so many that his nicknames include \"Street Clothes\" and \"Anthony Day-to-Day Davis.\" \nTough but fair. He's played just 20 games this season. Last year he played 51 games combined between his time with the Lakers and Mavs. The NBA's new(ish) criteria requires players to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for awards. Davis has cleared that bar just three times in the last decade. No one doubts his talent. Just two seasons ago he made second-team All-NBA and first-team All-Defense. But that kind of output and availability has become the exception rather than the rule. Davis will also turn 33 in March and has two more years left on his current deal. He'll make $58.4 million next season, and he has a player option on the back end for a whopping $62.7 million when he'll be 35 years old before the contract finally expires. If he doesn't play again this season, Davis will have cleared $2.7 million per game. That's good work if you can get it -- but who would want to cut those checks moving forward?\n2. Ja Morant, GrizzliesThe Grizzlies finally arrived at the correct conclusion and are shopping Morant. What I suspect they have learned since putting him on the market is the cruel reality of supply-side economics when there's little demand. The Hawks traded Trae Young to the Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum's expiring contract and Corey Kispert. That kind of low-yield return should have greatly worried the Grizzlies front office. The NBA is loaded with high-usage ball-dominant guards. There just aren't a lot of teams that have a big hole in that area that needs filling. Even if a team wanted to upgrade at that position, it's difficult to make the case for Morant being the guy. The Raptors were reportedly interested in Morant early on but have since cooled on the idea. Hard to blame them. Like Davis, Morant has only been intermittently available. Morant suffered a UCL sprain and is expected to miss at least three weeks. He's played just 20 games this season. The last two seasons he played a combined 59 games. In seven NBA seasons, he's never played more than 67 games. \nJust as concerning, he hasn't progressed on the floor. If anything, he's regressed. For much of his career Morant has relied on his outsized athleticism. He's produced some breathtaking highlights. But those only get you so far. He's a good passer, but in a league that greatly values shooting, Morant has never added an outside element to his skillset. He's a career 31.1% 3-point shooter, and his 44.4 eFG% this season is by far the worst mark in his seven years in the league. Morant has two more years left on his contract for more than $87 million. He'll be 28 in the final year of the deal. That's a lot of money to commit to someone who doesn't shoot well and won't be able to rely on athleticism alone forever. 3. Zion Williamson, PelicansTo be clear, the Pelicans have signaled that they aren't looking to move Williamson. That's been the consistent line of thinking for multiple front offices in New Orleans, though it's fair to wonder why. Considering who precedes him on this list, it's kind of remarkable that Williamson might be the least reliable guy of the bunch. Yes he's played 33 games this season, which is three more than he played all of last year, but we'll see how many more he can add on. In seven years in the NBA, Zion has had three seasons where he played 30 or fewer games. And in the 2021-22 season, he didn't play at all due to injury. \nWilliamson has slimmed down, but he's still a big body that relies on strength and athleticism to make an impact. For someone who's so physical, he's a sneaky good passer (though his assist numbers this season are the lowest they've been since his second year in the league). But much like Morant, his game hasn't evolved during his time in the NBA. He's a 31.7 percent shooter from beyond the arc, on a total of 101 attempts for his entire career. That's not an element that he's worked on or even seems interested in adding. Almost as concerning, he gets to the line a ton. He's averaging just under eight attempts per game this season, but he's shooting 70 percent. That's not great and borders on a liability. Zion has two more years left on his contract and is owed more than $87 million. Eventually, the Pelicans should try to find someone to take Zion off their hands. In the meantime, nice of the New Orleans front office to save the rest of the league from making a mistake. 4. LaMelo Ball, HornetsAt some point the suddenly surging Hornets are going to look around and realize that they have two quality young players to build around and Ball isn't one of them. The future belongs to Kon Knueppel and Brandon Miller. Which doesn't mean that anyone should be rushing out to pry LaMelo away from Charlotte. \nLike everyone else listed so far, Ball has availability issues. He's played 38 games this season. But in four of his other five professional seasons he played 51 or fewer. He's averaging19 points on close to 16.5 shots, his worst production since his rookie year. He's also playing just over 27 minutes per game, the least he's played in his career. And check out what Hornets head coach Charles Lee said about him after a recent loss to the Cavs: \"For the most part, he continued to try to play through it and not let his shot-making, or shot-missing, dictate the energy he was gonna give to the game.\" Talk about damning with faint praise. 5. Zach LaVine, KingsYou could make a case to avoid so many of the potential Kings trade candidates, but LaVine is probably first among them. He's having his worst season in a while. LaVine has always been a volume scorer, but he's averaging fewer than 20 points and shooting under 50% -- a marked drop off from last season. \nSure it's a wonky fit in Sacramento due to poor roster construction, but his usage rate is roughly the same this season as it was when the Kings traded for him last year. When he's not launching and scoring in bunches, he's hardly contributing. His rebounds and assists per game are the lowest they've been since his second season in the NBA when he was 20 years old, and on the defensive end he's far from useful. LaVine will be 31 in March. Like the rest of The Avoidables, he has a dodgy injury history. He played 74 games last season, but just 25 the season before. In six of his first 11 seasons, he played fewer than 65 games. And that contract that made it so tough for the Bulls to find a taker for him until the Kings came along and bailed them out last season still has one more year left. LaVine has a player option for next season at nearly $49 million. Hard to imagine many teams knocking down the Kings door for the chance to pay him that much. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in nearly two decades, the Baltimore Ravens have a new head coach. Jesse Minter was introduced as the man in charge in Baltimore Thursday, one week after the team officially hired him to replace John Harbaugh. Minter, 42, comes from the Los Angeles Chargers, where he was the defensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh. Of course, it was John -- the other Harbaugh brother -- who had been coaching the Ravens for the last 18 years. Minter in Baltimore on John Harbaugh's staff from 2017-20, rising from defensive assistant to defensive backs coach.Minter interviewed for several head-coaching jobs, but his time in Baltimore helped push him to return, he said.\"When this job opened, this became the one for me, and this was the one that I wanted,\" Minter said. \"I did go through the initial process with a lot of different teams, but as I was able to reconnect with people in this organization, and knowing the history, knowing the tradition, knowing the spine of the organization, kind of what it's built on, there was no better place for me.\"\nHere are three takeaways from Minter's introductory press conference.Minter: Lamar Jackson the 'best' player in the NFLMinter faced Lamar Jackson once as the Chargers' defensive coordinator -- in Week 12 in 2024 -- and got a taste of what makes him so special. Jackson, Baltimore's starting quarterback for the past eight seasons, threw for two touchdowns and ran for another as the Ravens rallied for a 30-23 victory.Now that he's coaching Jackson rather than coaching against him, Minter said he's already had \"multiple conversations\" with the two-time MVP and is looking forward to more.\"With Lamar, I just look forward to connecting with him, helping him become the best version of himself, creating a team identity that allows him to thrive -- which he's already proven to be an elite, elite, one of the best .. the best player in the National Football League -- and put a team around him that allows him to reach that ultimate goal of bringing a Super Bowl back to Baltimore,\" Minter said.\n\n        \n            \n                Grading every offensive and defensive coordinator hire: Chargers hit home run, Lions and Commanders take risks\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson, who turned 29 three days after a season-ending Week 18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, played in just 13 games in 2025. He missed three games with a hamstring injury and another with a back contusion as he dealt with several nagging issues throughout the season. His rushing numbers were down to career lows as a starter, too, and he had one of the NFL's highest sack rates. However, he still showed moments of brilliance and led the NFL with 13.3 yards per completion.Talked to John Harbaugh about the openingGiven his connection to both Harbaugh brothers and the fact that he was moving from coaching under one to succeeding the other, Minter talked with John Harbaugh and got some positive feedback.\"Yes, I've talked to Coach a couple times,\" Minter said. \"Tons of respect for John. The 18 years here, the wonderful success, a Super Bowl, probably in the Ring of Honor one day. ... We've had just a couple of small conversations. He knows how I feel about this place. He did text me, 'I think they should hire you.' That was just one of the texts he sent, so I appreciated that. But I love John.\"\nHe also got some advice.\"Really just take the foundation in place and build on it, make it better, put my own spin on it and not try to be John Harbaugh, not try to be Jim Harbaugh, be myself, connect with everybody, make it about all of us, and I really look forward to doing that,\" Minter said.Minter plans to call defensive plays, maximize Kyle HamiltonMinter said he will call the defense, calling it \"a strength of mine.\" Though not as numerous as offensive play-calling head coaches, defensive play callers in head-coaching roles do exist; Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald calls the defensive plays and has his team in the Super Bowl, for instance.\"I have a really good process, I feel, to do what I need to do to be ready to call the game, but I also have the ability to be the head coach and to impact the entire roster -- the entire team -- and make sure that it's our offense, our defense, our special teams, and that there's no divide there,\" Minter said.\nOne of the advantages Minter will have when calling plays is Kyle Hamilton. With three All-Pro selections in four years, Hamilton is one of the NFL's premier safeties, but Minter views him more as \"a weapon.\"\"He is a positionless defensive player that I would classify as a weapon on defense,\" Minter said. \"As much as you can do to get a guy like Kyle near the point of attack, I think, is what you try to do as a designer, play caller. I could not be more thrilled to be able to work with Kyle.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL season's 25 biggest stories: Shedeur Sanders, Sam Darnold, stunning firings headline wild ride\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMinter helped Chargers safety Derwin James have two of the best seasons of his NFL career. James had career highs in sacks (5.5) and tackles for loss (10) in 2024 and was a second-team All-Pro selection both years under Minter.\nMinter's work in Los Angeles surely appealed to a Baltimore team in need of more defensive discipline and playmaking, too. This season, the Chargers defense was in the top 10 in takeaways (23), sacks (45) and plays of 20-plus yards allowed (44). The Ravens finished tied for 15th, tied for 28th and 31st in those respective categories.\"I think about defense a certain way,\" Minter said. \"[The players will] learn how I think about it and how I feel about it. I think there's a fundamental level needed, required to play great defense that we will harp on tremendously, and so I look forward to getting with the guys [for] them to kind of learn my thoughts on how you play great defense.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Marcus Semien scanned the bar area inside the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego late one evening during the MLB Winter Meetings. The year was 2019, and Semien, still a member of the Oakland Athletics, had just completed a breakout season, one that helped propel him into the league's elite. Yet at this moment he wasn't too enamored with his newfound accolades, nor the adulation. In his mind, there was another star on the horizon. He glanced to his left, then peered out over a sea of baseball executives who claim that bar space each December until he found his person. \"This,\" he said to one reporter situated in the same vicinity. \"This is who you have to meet.\" \nIt was Paul Toboni -- long before he claimed the role as the Nationals president of baseball operations at 35.At the time, Toboni had just been promoted to director of amateur scouting for the Red Sox. He was only 29. Around the game, he was viewed as a rising star. The kind who would run his own team one day.He had a feel for people. Easy to talk to. Charismatic. Toboni played the game, too. He and Semien were teammates at Cal. He had a scouting background and an understanding for analytics. \nSemien understood he wasn't the only future star in the room. \"I watched him as a teammate, a baseball teammate in college, how he worked, whether it was in the weight room or at practice or just his effort on the field,\" Semien, now with the Mets, told CBS Sports via a phone call earlier this month. \"When you play with somebody and you see them doing the hardest thing we're ever going to do, playing the sport, and then he goes into the business world, I knew he was going to do just fine.\" Semien wasn't taking a guess. He recognized a peer for his baseball acumen and ability to scout talent. Toboni snatched up Roman Anthony for the Red Sox in the second round of the 2022 MLB Draft. Anthony was the top prospect in baseball before debuting in 2025 and looks bound for stardom.\nA year later, he grabbed Kristian Campbell in the fourth round. He was a compensation pick after Xander Bogaerts chose the Padres in free agency. Campbell has had his struggles, but the Sox still view him as a linchpin to their future.Toboni survived three heads of baseball operations -- Dave Dombrowski, Chaim Bloom and Craig Breslow -- during his time in Boston. It never broke his stride. Toboni kept climbing, eventually reaching the level of assistant general manager with the Sox.Now, Toboni is running his own club. The Nationals handed him the keys as they try to claw back relevance in the National League East.\n\"I'm bringing over what I learned in Boston and trying to move us forward,\" Toboni said. \"Early on, you're drinking from a fire hose.\"As endearing and engaging as Toboni can be, there's a harder edge underneath.\"I think he has the right balance of remaining rigidly anchored to his beliefs while showing the empathy and humility to bring others along and to admit when he's wrong,\" Breslow said.He wasted little time reshaping the front office in D.C., making sweeping changes shortly after arriving. He hired Blake Butera as manager in October. The 33-year-old is MLB's youngest skipper in more than 50 years. Last week, he made his first big player move: trading MacKenzie Gore, the Nats' best starter in 2025, to the Rangers. Shortstop CJ Abrams could be next. \nThose around the Red Sox describe Toboni as unwavering. Once he commits to a direction, he doesn't flinch. That approach didn't always sit well with older ways of thinking in Boston. Toboni pushed process. Numbers. Alignment. Data. He played a role in the Red Sox' push toward Driveline Baseball, helping reshape how certain departments operated and where decision-making lived. His scouting background evolved. Less gut. More metrics. Sometimes more spreadsheets than stadium seats.His playing background mattered. It just didn't dictate the process.\"We have to stay open minded and adapt as the game changes. Having said that, you know, it's still, still something that I really value,\" Toboni said of his playing days. \"I think I just deploy it differently than I did as an area scout.\" Toboni starts with the metrics. The model. The valuation. Then he goes hunting for what the model might not show. \n\"When you see a valuation on a player, you're like, OK, what might the model be missing?\" Toboni said. \"Your ability to poke holes in a model valuation lends back to how I was trained as an evaluator.\"The love for the game, however, has been enduring.Semien remembers going to Giants games with Toboni while the two were in college, how he already knew the ins and outs of every player on the field. He was immersed.That carried over on the field, too. Toboni was a preferred walk-on at Cal, appearing in just 24 games combined in 2011 and 2012. The at-bats were limited. The approach never was.\nThat team wasn't supposed to last. The program was supposed to be cut by the university during the time Toboni and Semien were there. Instead, Cal Baseball was saved, thanks to donors and a surprise run to the 2011 College World Series.\"He was impactful, regardless of how much he played,\" said his former college coach David Esquer, now the head coach at Stanford.Paul Toboni, No. 30, wasn't the star of Cal's College World Series team in 2011, but 'he was impactful.' \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Toboni is now looking for something else to save in Washington. A team seemingly so far removed from the glory days of 2019 when they lifted their first World Series banner with the likes of Max Scherzer and a 20-year-old Juan Soto. \nToboni, his wife, Danielle, and their four children have settled into one of Washington's older, quieter neighborhoods. Life is still in motion. Boxes unpacked slowly. The work in the front office, though? Moving fast.Toboni standing on his own now, at the top. He's no longer just an amateur scouting director in a bar at the Manchester Grand Hyatt.He's someone you need to know.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES – Crystal Dunn, a member of the U.S. women's national team's 2019 Women's World Cup-winning squad, announced her retirement on Thursday, bringing an end to her decorated 12-year professional career.Dunn was a fixture on the national team from 2016 through 2024, taking part in two World Cups and three Olympic Games. She played six matches en route to the World Cup-winning run in France in 2019 and was also a regular starter during the team's gold medal-winning run at the Olympics in Paris in 2024. The 33-year-old was also an accomplished player in the NWSL and was a three-time champion in the league, notching two titles with the North Carolina Courage and a third with the Portland Thorns.She also played for Gotham FC and Chelsea, where she won a WSL title in 2017 under current USWNT head coach Emma Hayes. She was last under contract with Paris Saint-Germain.\"This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished. I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give,\" Dunn wrote in part in a post on Instagram. \" I'm ready to embrace the life that awaits me on the other side. I look forward to spending more time with my family and being a more present mom. This was not a decision made lightly, but was one made with immense gratitude for everything I've experienced as a professional soccer player. \"\nA native of New York state, Dunn was a talented youth player, winning an NCAA title with the University of North Carolina in 2012 and the U-20 Women's World Cup the same year, a member of the last U.S. team to win that title. She made her senior team debut the following year, and in 2014, she was drafted by the Washington Spirit.She truly burst onto the scene as an attack-minded phenom in her second season with the Spirit, scoring 15 goals in 20 games and winning the league's golden boot award and MVP honors. Her uptick in form, though, came after she was left off of Jill Ellis' roster for the 2015 Women's World Cup, thrusting her back into the national team conversation following the snub. The USWNT's historic depth in attack, though, meant she was converted to left back and spent much of her national team career there.\"I just remember that 2019 World Cup and the [2024] Olympics, literally, that last game, she saved us,\" Mallory Swanson, the lone goalscorer in the gold medal game in Paris in 2024, recalled from the NWSL's annual media day, hours after Dunn announced her retirement. Dunn's skill was on full display on that day, especially as Brazil put in a strong offensive showing against the USWNT.\nDunn matched her accomplishments with an unmatched ability as a versatile player who was amongst the elites, regardless of what position she played. She brought her attacking attributes to her play as a left back and had a brief comeback as a forward with the USWNT in between the 2023 Women's World Cup and 2024 Olympics, but also deputized as a No. 10 at times during her three years with the Thorns.\"She's one of the GOATs for soccer, for sure, and as an outside back, she doesn't get enough credit,\" her ex-USWNT colleague Trinity Rodman said.In the late stages of her career, Dunn was one of a handful of USWNT players who balanced motherhood with life as a professional athlete after welcoming her son Marcel in 2022. She was one of the beneficiaries of the USWNT's 2022 equal pay settlement with U.S. Soccer which, among other things, guaranteed child care for all national team players regardless of gender, and was previously one of the many players who were plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the federation.\n\"I saw Crystal go through a lot of things,\" Sophia Wilson, who recently welcomed her first child, said. \"I saw her have a baby, go through that. I feel like I've known Marcel for his whole life so she's one of the main reasons I knew I could do the same thing. I could have a baby and come back and play because I saw Crystal do it and she's just such an inspiration. I mean, I can't say enough things about what she's done for the game, what she's done for this league and we're going to miss her, for sure. I don't think there'll be another Crystal.\"Dunn was a mentor to a younger generation of players in more ways than one, lending a helping hand as one era of the USWNT passed the torch to the next one. Wilson described her as resembling an older sister, while Rodman called her \"a cool aunt\" for the less experienced players.\"Crystal and I get along really well and vibe off of each other really well because our personalities are both very loud but she led the team in a different way than, like, a Becky Sauerbrunn,\" Rodman said. \"I think they were best friends but also polar opposites. She led by example but also [was] very, very vocal. She was really good at connecting with the younger players but also having that relationship with the older players so setting the standard while also empathizing with the newer players, which I thought was really good.\"\nHer playfulness also stands out as something her teammates will miss fondly.\"I think off the field, just gonna miss her dancing in the locker room, her DJ vibes, all the just like impact that she's had,\" Swanson, who is also a new mother, said. \"Just seeing her with Marcel and being a mom, and just being around Marcel, he's like, literally the cutest little boy. She left the game a better game than she found it, which is what we all strive to do. And I'm just gonna miss her and her goofiness and funniness and all of it.\"Dunn made the last of her 160 appearances for the USWNT in May of last year, playing 90 minutes in a 3-0 win against China. She played her final game in September, playing a half for PSG in a 3-0 win at Lens in the league.\n            ",

The game is set for Feb. 20, 2027.The Stars were named the host for the game back in November, but it wasn't until Thursday that they found out their matchup -- one that has plenty of history. The Stars beat the Golden Knights in five games in the 2020 Western Conference Final, only for the Golden Knights to avenge that loss by winning the 2023 Western Conference Final over Dallas in six games. The two teams also met in the first round of the 2024 playoffs, when Dallas overcame an 0-2 series deficit to win in seven games.This will be the second time the Stars have hosted an outdoor game; in 2020, they beat the Nashville Predators 4-2 at Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas. The Golden Knights have less fond memories of playing outdoors. In 2021, Vegas lost to the Colorado Avalanche, 3-2, in the NHL Outdoors at Lake Tahoe in 2021. It also lost 3-0 to the Seattle Kraken in the 2024 NHL Winter Classic at T-Mobile Park, home of the Seattle Mariners.\nThe 2026 NHL Stadium Series game -- the Boston Bruins vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Raymond James Stadium -- is on Saturday.\n            \n    ",

The Aggies have won seven of their last 10 contests, with one of the victories being an 89-80 home triumph over the Matadors on Jan. 1.The Rockets are 3.5-point favorites against the Hawks in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Heat are 1.5-point favorites versus the Bulls. The Red Wings are -122 on the money line against the Capitals and Cal State Northridge is a 2.5-point favorite versus UC Davis.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Jan. 29. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchRockets at HawksTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Atlanta | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 223.5 (-109) | Expert: Amen Thompson Over 17.5 points (-112, PropBetGuy)Two of the Hawks' games during their current winning streak went Over the projected total for Thursday's contest, while their triumph over Boston yesterday saw 223 points scored. The Rockets are averaging 116.3 points this season but failed to reach that number in six of their last eight outings. Houston produced only 99 points in its loss to San Antonio on Wednesday, and the SportsLine Projection Model believes the team will break out in Atlanta and the Hawks will continue their scoring pace as the Over hits in well over 62% of its simulations. Amen Thompson scored 25 points on Wednesday, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (+1285 on his last 110 NBA player prop picks) feels the Rockets guard will come up with another strong effort and reach or exceed his season average of 18.3 points. \nHeat at BullsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Chicago | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 237.5 (-112) | Expert: Ayo Dosunmu Over 13.5 points (-114, Mike Barner)Both teams are in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring and the bottom 10 in points allowed. However, three of Chicago's last four games have finished Under the projected total for Thursday's matchup, and Miami is one day removed from a shootout against the Orlando Magic that saw 257 points scored, so the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Heat are prime for a lower-scoring contest as its simulations have the Under hitting more than 61% of the time. Ayo Dosunmu is averaging 14.6 points this season but scored 20 and 19 in his last two outings, and SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (18-7, +963 on his last 25 NBA player prop picks) believes the Bulls guard will continue to produce as he had 23 points against the Heat in their first meeting this season.NHL best bets, where to watchCapitals at Red WingsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6.5 (-107) | Expert: Red Wings -120 (Matt Severance)The Red Wings haven't been involved in many high-scoring games of late, as six or fewer goals were scored in seven of their last 10 contests. They've allowed more than three tallies just once in their past 11 outings, while the Capitals have recorded more than three goals in only one of their last nine games. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks goals will be at a premium in this matchup as the Under hits in 54% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (23-11, +1096 on his last 34 NHL money line picks) likes Detroit to prevail since Washington has lost six of its last seven contests and is wrapping up a six-game road trip.CBB best bets, where to watchUC Davis at Cal State NorthridgeTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Northridge, Cal. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Cal State Northridge -2.5 (-105) | Expert: UC Davis +1.5 (-105, Zach Cimini)The Aggies are hot, having won seven of their last 10 games. The Matadors are not, as they've lost three of four. UC Davis posted a nine-point victory over Cal State Northridge at home at the beginning of the month, but the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Matadors earning a split of the season series as its simulations have them covering the spread 66% of the time. SportsLine expert Zach Cimini (+133 on his last 59 college basketball picks) disagrees, feeling that Cal State Northridge still could be feeling the effects from its trip to Hawaii last weekend. He likes UC Davis to cover.\n            ",

If he does, the league's power structure will certainly update. But even if he stays with the Bucks until the summer, there will be other deals that change the calculus. \nUntil then, here is where things stand with our final pre-trade-deadline Power Rankings. After the deadline, we will revisit the rosters and look ahead with that information in hand. Note: As a general Power Rankings rule, we're going to try to strike a balance between what we've seen in the last week, the season as a whole so far, and what can reasonably be expected to play out over the next few weeks. We will not go so far as to rank these teams based on championship expectations, because in that case it would take a lot more to alter, at least in tiers, the generally accepted hierarchy. Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week. But if you're beating bad teams, just as an example, and probably playing a little above your head, it's not necessarily going to be reflected in a completely commensurate climb up the rankings.

Detroit doesn't have much else to turn to besides Cade's creation, and the 3-point shooting (20th in percentage, 27th in makes per game) is a problem. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            34-11\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Nuggets\n                                \n                            Jamal Murray got fouled on 3-point shots twice inside the four seconds on Monday, but each time was unable to convert all three free throws with a chance to tie the game as Denver fell for just the third time in its last nine.

They erased a 16-point deficit to beat the Nuggets last Tuesday and a 15-point deficit to beat the Mavericks on Saturday. They tried to mount a similar rally against the Clippers but a 26-point hole was a bit too deep.

And we know Michael Porter Jr. is sought after depending on Brooklyn's price. In other news, the Nets have lost six straight and 14 of their last 16. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            12-33\n                        \n                                30\n                            \n                                    Wizards\n                                \n                            The Wizards ended a nine-game losing streak with a win over the Blazers on Monday.

    "body": "\n        And then there were 24 teams remaining. A wild finish to the Champions League league phase has set the bracket for the knockouts, and Jose Mourinho's Benfica have snuck in to cause chaos. Arsenal became the first team to finish the league phase a perfect eight for eight, as the Gunners have risen to become the favorites to win the entire tournament. But after Arenal, who has the next best shot at taking home a European crown?That means it's time to take on the unenviable task of combing through a lot of similar teams to build out tiers of contention, so let's get rolling:The one true contenderArsenalAs the first team to finish with a perfect eight wins from eight in the league phase, Arsenal belong in a tier of their own when ranking the contenders for the Champions League crown. While a rotated side did concede two goals to Kairat Almaty on the final day of league phase play, the Gunners still finished with the best defensive record, allowing only four goals in eight games. Arsenal have been able to adapt their style to compete in various match scenarios, which is a credit to both Mikel Arteta's management and the depth of a strong squad.In a tier of their ownBayern MunichWhile Bayern didn't get a chance to face Arsenal in Champions League play, this squad is not to be overlooked. They may have lost their undefeated record in the Bundesliga, but they also got Jamal Musiala back from injury to add to their loaded attack. Harry Kane has been one of the best forwards in the world, but alongside Serge Gnabry and Michael Olise, Vincent Kompany is spoiled for riches in setting up his side. He even has depth in midfield, while the defense has done just enough to keep things ticking over. Bayern are more of a 1A and 1B contender scenario with Arsenal \nWith some help, it could happenLiverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter, PSG, Manchester CityNow we get to the groups, and this tier is one where each team has questions to answer if they're to win the Champions League. Liverpool have been excellent in this competition, but it feels like their Premier League woes will start to catch up to them sooner than later. Chelsea have improved under Liam Rosenior, and with a healthy Cole Palmer, no one will want to face the Blues in the knockouts. Barcelona haven't been able to get things going until they fall behind in games. Alvaro Arbeloa's Real Madrid are very much a work in progress. Inter have lost some of their magic. Injuries and playing so much soccer last season seems to be catching up to PSG, and Manchester City's hopes rest in Marc Guehi steadying their defense. Any of these things can be fixed by February, giving these teams a chance at winning it all, but there's a reason why eight teams ended with between 14 - 16 points in the league phase. After the top two, things are very much fluid.Not a top team but on the right trackNewcastle UnitedI didn't know what to make of the Magpies. They had one of the toughest schedules of any team in the league phase and will be tested after losing to Barcelona and drawing PSG, but it also feels like they're missing a top gear. If they didn't drop points to Marseille and Bayer Leverkusen, this is a top-eight team instead of a team taking part in the playoffs. Defensively, they only conceded seven goals, and if a match ends up in a penalty shootout, being able to lean on Nick Pope in net is a massive advantage.Who even are they?TottenhamIf it weren't for Tottenham already being in the round of 16 and having won the Europa League last season, they'd probably be further down these rankings. We don't even know if Thomas Frank will be managing the squad when they take the pitch again in the Champions League due to their Premier League struggles, but they were able to control most of their Champions League fixtures. Tottenham may not have had the most difficult path to get here, but you can only play the teams who are in front of you, and they did just that to rise up the table as the Premier League teams put on quite a showing during the league phase.\nIf they're perfect, sureAtletico Madrid, Sporting CP, Juventus, Atalanta, Borussia DortmundUnlike our first group of flawed sides, this group feels out of their depth in the knockouts. Atletico Madrid have lost their ability to control matches as they lean into being an attacking side. Sporting have a chance, but they can't have Luis Suarez get marked out of a game in their most important fixtures. Juventus and Atalanta can almost be combined here; they have the players to go on a run, but a spot in the last eight feels like their ceiling. And for Dortmund, this squad has fallen quite far since they made the Champions League final in 2024. While they fell to Real Madrid there, this current squad lacks the creativity that they need to really make something happen.Can cause an upset but probably are up against itBodo/Glimt, Benfica Alright, now this is a fun group. Tasked with facing either Real Madrid or Inter in the round of 16, the deck is already stacked against Bodo/Glimt and Benfica, but if you said that either would be in the knockouts a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have believed you. Bodo has gone through Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to get here, while Benfica needed a stoppage-time goal by a goalkeeper. Through Jose Mourinho, all things are possible, especially while he's coaching a true underdog. The knockouts are usually where underdogs go to fall, but in the case of these two sides, they've been counted out during the entire tournament, so not believing that they can net at least another win now could be a fool's errand.Happy to be hereMonaco, Bayer Leverkusen, Galatasaray, Qarabag, Club Brugge, OlympiacosGalatasaray may be the standout team here because any team traveling to Rams Park in Turkiye will be in for a fight, but overall, these are sides that will be happy to have made the knockout stage. Each may win a game, but going further than the round of 16 seems a step too far unless they draw Tottenham there in the case of Brugge or Galatasaray.\n            ",

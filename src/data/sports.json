    "body": "\n        As late as Tuesday morning, this year's Breeders' Cup Classic was being touted as the best Classic ever.And, with all due respect to the 1998 and 2004 Classic fields, the argument for 2025 was strong. After all, the race had the top three finishers from last year's Classic. It had 10 horses who combined to win 20 Grade 1 or Group 1 races, including the Kentucky Derby, $20 million Saudi Cup and the last two Travers Stakes. It had horses who had a combined $42.4 million in earnings, led by Japan's Forever Young, who has won more than $15.7 million.But then Sovereignty scratched from the Classic.The reigning Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes winner, who was on his way to one of the best 3-year-old seasons in recent history, spiked a temperature on Monday night and was officially scratched from the race on Wednesday. And, now, the best Classic field ever is something less than that. While there will not be a matchup between Sovereignty and the top older hoses on Saturday, storylines abound in this year's Breeders' Cup Classic at Del Mar just north of San Diego.\nThe talented but mercurial Fierceness will look to capture the Classic one year after he ran his eyeballs out in the same race, only to finish second. Defending champion Sierra Leone looks to become just the second horse to win the Classic twice, joining the great Tiznow. Sierra Leone will get assistance from his stablemate Contrary Thinking, who has been entered as a rabbit for the Classic, to the ire of Fierceness owner Mike Repole. With Sovereignty out, Fierceness has inherited the role of the favorite, listed at 5-2 on the morning line. Sierra Leone (7-2), Forever Young (7-2), Preakness Stakes winner Journalism (5-1) and Mindframe (6-1) round out the top five choices in the nine-horse Classic field. Below, we'll take you through everything to know about this year's Classic from profiles of all the horses involved to info about the race and the road to Del Mar to where to find official betting strategy, including win picks and exotic plays, from a host of SportsLine experts.\nWhat to know about the 42nd Breeders' Cup ClassicWhat: 42nd Breeders' Cup ClassicWhere: Del Mar in Del Mar, Calif.Who: Nine horsesPurse: $7 millionDistance: 1¼ milesPost time: 6:25 p.m. ETNetwork: NBCWeather forecast: Sunny, high of 71Breeders' Cup Classic live odds1 Fierceness (5-2)2 Baeza (10-1)3 Nevada Beach (20-1)4 Contrary Thinking (50-1)5 Forever Young (7-2)6 Sovereignty scratch7 Sierra Leone (7-2)8 Mindframe (6-1)9 Journalism (5-1)10 Antiquarian (10-1)Odds as of Thursday afternoonSportsLine expert picksSportsLine has three great horse racing experts who have locked in their Breeders' Cup Classic picks. Here's a preview of each:Gene Menez, a former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, has been red-hot since last year's Breeders' Cup. Last year he crushed the late Pick 4 on Breeders' Cup Saturday for a $5,303 windfall. He nailed the winner, trifecta and superfecta in the Florida Derby for a $529.60 score and the winner and trifecta in the Blue Grass Stakes for a $761.96 jackpot. Hit the late Pick 4 on Kentucky Oaks day for $915.48. And in the Kentucky Derby, he hammered the exacta and trifecta for a $1,045 payout. Menez's top pick is Forever Young.Jeff Hochman, who is a SportsLine expert in multiple sports as well as a microshare horse owner, is coming off a tremendous a summer racing season at two of the country's premier tracks, Saratoga and Del Mar, winning at an outrageous 65.7% rate. His top Classic pick is a horse who is \"truly elite.\" He also is high on a double-digit longshot who \"enters on an upward trajectory\" and is a \"dangerous outsider.\" Find Hochman's full Breeders' Cup Classic wagering strategy at SportsLine.\nMichelle Yu, a horse racing expert who is on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, has been at the Breeders' Cup all week long and hit the exacta at this year's Kentucky Derby. Her top pick this week is a horse she things has been a \"good horse, and he seems to be rounding into a great one.\" Check out Yu's Breeders' Cup betting strategy at SportsLine.Road to the Breeders' Cup ClassicHere are the most significant races on the road to Del Mar:Feb. 22, Saudi Cup: After a stirring stretch duel, Forever Young surged past the highly regarded Romantic Warrior at the wire to win the $20 million race in a fast time.April 5, Santa Anita Derby: Journalism overcame some traffic trouble to run down Baeza (second) for his fourth straight win.\nMay 3, Kentucky Derby: Race favorite Journalism (second) couldn't hold off Sovereignty down the stretch; Baeza was a fast-closing third.May 17, Preakness Stakes: Blocked by two rivals with nowhere to go, Journalism powered his way through a hole that wasn't there and made up five lengths with a furlong to go to catch a seemingly home-free Gosger in one of the most remarkable finishes in Triple Crown history.June 7, Belmont Stakes: In a virtual replay of the Kentucky Derby, Journalism (second) couldn't hold off Sovereignty down the stretch; Baeza was third.\nJune 28, Stephen Foster Handicap: Mindframe stalked a slow pace to win; Sierra Leone rallied from last two finish a non-threatening second. Aug. 2, Whitney Stakes: Contrary Thinking (ninth) helped ensure a fast pace, setting up stablemate Sierra Leone for the win; Fierceness faded to fifth in the nine-horse field.Aug. 20, Pacific Classic: Fierceness almost jumped the temporary rail at the start and overcame traffic issues for a resounding 3¼-length win over Journalism (second).  \nAug. 31 Jockey Club Gold Cup: Bumping at the start led to Mindframe losing jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. Antiquarian sat midpack and produced his best career effort for his first Grade 1 win. Sierra Leone (second) was slightly bothered by a fallen Ortiz at the start and rallied for second.Breeders' Cup Classic horses (morning-line odds)1 Fierceness (5-2)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: John VelazquezLast race: First in the Pacific Classic by 3¼ lengthsCareer record: 13 starts: 7 wins, 2 seconds, 1 thirdCareer earnings: $5,155,320Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 111 (twice)Sire: City of LightDripping with talent, Fierceness returns to the site of arguably the best two starts of his career. He's back at Del Mar seeking redemption after finishing a game second in last year's Classic to Sierra Leone. With the scratch of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, Fierceness has inherited the role as the race favorite.2 Baeza (10-1)Trainer: John ShirreffsJockey: Hector BerriosLast race: First in the Pennsylvania Derby by 2¼ lengthsCareer record: 8 starts: 2 wins, 3 seconds, 2 thirdsCareer earnings: $1,503,500Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 105 (2025 Pennsylvania Derby)Sire: McKinzieThis 3-year-old had been running behind Sovereignty and Journalism all year but finally earned a breakthrough win in his last start, the Pennsylvania Derby. His speed figures have improved with every performance, and he now enters the Classic on a positive upward trajectory with room to improve. He also will be running out of his backyard for the first time since April.\n3 Nevada Beach (20-1)Trainer: Bob BaffertJockey: Mike SmithLast race: First in the Goodwood Stakes by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 4 starts: 3 wins, 1 secondCareer earnings: $296,500Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 101 (2025 Goodwood)Sire: Omaha BeachHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert usually has a loaded hand for the Classic, but this year he brings a longshot in Nevada Beach. This 3-year-old has started just four times, so he is nowhere near his ceiling, but he will need to get faster in a hurry; his best career Beyer Speed Figure (101) is not remotely competitive in this field.4 Contrary Thinking (50-1)Trainer: Chad BrownJockey: Florent GerouxLast race: Seventh in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 12¾ lengthsCareer record: 7 starts: 2 winsCareer earnings: $140,040Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 95 (2025 allowance)Sire: Into MischiefBeware: This Chad Brown trainee is not in this race to win or even finish in the money. He's in it to serve as a rabbit and ensure a fair pace for Brown's other entrant, the late-running Sierra Leone. That's a role he has served in his last two starts, the Whitney Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup. He lost those two races by more than 80 lengths combined.5 Forever Young (7-2)Trainer: Yoshito YahagiJockey: Ryusei SakaiLast race: First in the Nippon TV Hai by 2½ lengthsCareer record: 12 starts: 9 wins, 3 thirdsCareer earnings: $15,718,590Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 109 (2024 Breeders' Cup Classic)Sire: Real SteelThis Japanese invader has won nine times and earned more than $15.7 million around the world but is still looking for his first victory in the United States. Last year, he finished third in both the Kentucky Derby and the Classic. If he is able to repeat his performance from the Saudi Cup in February, he will have a big chance to finish in the winner's circle.\n6 Sovereignty Scratched.7 Sierra Leone (7-2)Trainer: Chad BrownJockey: Flavien PratLast race: Second in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 13 starts: 5 wins, 5 seconds, 3 thirdsCareer earnings: $7,006,200Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 112 (2024 Breeders' Cup Classic)Sire: Gun RunnerThe defending champ returns to the site of his best career performance. In last year's Classic, he capitalized on a hot early pace and rallied for a resounding 1½-length victory. This late-running colt always comes charging down the stretch but often is at the mercy of the pace. So trainer Chad Brown also has entered stablemate Contrary Thinking to cook things up on the front end. If Sierra Leone gets beaten, the pace shouldn't be an excuse.8 Mindframe (6-1)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: Irad Ortiz Jr.Last race: Did not finish in the Jockey Club Gold CupCareer record: 8 starts: 5 wins, 2 secondsCareer earnings: $1,844,580Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 105 (2025 Stephen Foster Handicap)Sire: ConstitutionTrainer Todd Pletcher says that Mindframe may be the most talented horse in his barn, and the record helps support that: five wins and two seconds in eight career starts. But, because of the rugby scrum at the beginning of the Jockey Club Gold Cup, Mindframe has not finished a race since June 28. That's suboptimal preparation for a race featuring the fastest dirt horses in the world.9 Journalism (5-1)Trainer: Michael McCarthyJockey: Jose OrtizLast race: Second in the Pacific Classic by 3¼ lengthsCareer record: 10 starts: 6 wins, 3 seconds, 1 thirdCareer earnings: $3,998,880Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 108 (2025 San Felipe Stakes)Sire: CurlinThis year has been a long campaign for Journalism, who emerged in the spring as the Kentucky Derby favorite and ran in all of the big races. Though Sovereignty proved better in their two meetings, Journalism showed his class with his victory from an impossible spot in the Preakness Stakes. For the first time since March, he will enter a race fresh, and he gets one of the top jockeys in the world, Jose Ortiz, to hop aboard.\n10 Antiquarian (10-1)Trainer: Todd PletcherJockey: Luis SaezLast race: First in the Jockey Club Gold Cup by 1½ lengthsCareer record: 9 starts: 4 wins, 3 secondsCareer earnings: $944,100Best career Beyer Speed Figure: 108 (2025 Jockey Club Gold Cup)Sire: PreservationistHe may be the third of the three Todd Pletcher trainees on the odds board, but he is coming into the Classic the right way: His speed figures have slowly improved with every race, culminating with a career-best effort to win the Jockey Club Gold Cup over Sierra Leone. Antiquarian has had two months off since that race and, with a bit more improvement, has a longshot's chance.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Artificial intelligence has apparently found its way into the National Women's Soccer League. Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey recently ",
    "body": "\n        Artificial intelligence has apparently found its way into the National Women's Soccer League. Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey recently revealed that she used ChatGPT out of interest and to test its women's soccer knowledge, while also using a prompt for tactical ideas on how to compete against other teams in the NWSL. Speaking on the \"Soccerish Podcast,\" the most veteran coach in the league spoke about how she engaged with the technology over the course of the offseason, using different questions that ranged from a general standpoint to more specific formative prompts.\"One day in the offseason, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, 'What is Seattle Reign's identity?' And it would spurt it out. And I was like 'I don't know if that's true or not,'\" she said. \"And then I put in, 'What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?' And it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went 'You should play a back five.' So I did. No joke, that's why I did it.\"  \nAI in soccer 101The tactical conversation came about after Harvey was asked how she's evolved on or off the pitch as a coach, and the Reign manager mentioned she'd never coached a back five until this year. \n\"I'd never really done a lot of research on it. I'd never really, like, invested into how it could be played in the women's game. I'd only ever really seen it from afar, you know, watching men's games really,\" Harvey said on the podcast. \"It was always sort of talked about as a way to see games out. You know, [you go ahead] and get into a back five and stop people from scoring, was sort of how, like, a back five had been talked about for me.\"She went on to explain that the unorthodox method came later, while using the AI technology, after delivering questionable information about the club itself. That's Harvey then got more specific in the prompts.So what were the games she referenced?While Harvey didn't give specific details about what the AI's response gave, she did key in on the fact that a back-five formation was suggested for two specific teams. \nA quick search, first round by Kim McCauley, shows that they played with five in the back in a 1-0 loss against Orlando Pride in April. Another significant five back moment against a top squad was an early match in May against Kansas City Current, where the Reign won, 1-0.\"It was early in the season. And I said to the coaching staff, 'I'm not joking, this is what I did.' And they were like, 'Huh, interesting,'\" she recounted. \"We researched it. We did a deep dive on it. We thought about how we could play it, and we went for it, and we liked it. It worked. We won the game.\"\nLater in the season, the Reign lost to Kansas City 2-0, and the Current clinched the 2025 NWSL Shield. In fairness to Harvey, they started the game with three in the back that day.While Harvey may have used the technology out of curiosity and for general brainstorming, there's still the part of actually executing the ideas. With Harvey emphasizing that ChatGPT 'didn't tell you how to play it, what to do in it, or any of that stuff,\" but just the presentation of the idea sparked enough interest in her to bring it to her coaching staff. So what has happened since?The Reign have since used the five-back model in several of their games this season while also implementing a three-back or standard four-back formation. While it hasn't made the team the most threatening in front of goal, it has made them a frustrating side to play against, and their record was enough this year to clinch them a playoff spot. \nWhat final seeding they'll be will depend on the final regular-season match day, as they're currently in fourth place. The irony of the Reign's NWSL Decision Day match is that it is against third-place Orlando Pride, and the two teams are still in contention for the honor to host a playoff match. Whoever is the winner between the two could potentially secure third place, while the loser could end as low as a seventh seed, pending results across the league.Though no matter the playoff position, Harvey is confident in her team's ability to adjust and adapt. It's been their big strength this season despite the lack of goal scoring. \"We've obviously come in and out of it. We played it tons, then we came out of it, and then we went back into it. And now we're quite, like, fluid actually. We can float in and out of it within games. And I love that,\" said Harvey.\n\"When I hear coaches saying, 'We don't know what you're going to do, you're the hardest team to prepare for. Defend. You defend in multiple ways in games.' I'm just like [fist pumping] that, I want everyone to not have a clue what we're going to do. I think that is, like, amazing.\"What does ChatGPT say about Seattle Reign?So now that the regular season is almost over, with just one game remaining with Decision Day on Sunday, what does ChatGPT have to say about Seattle Reign's identity now? For starters, it says a whole lot, including outdated information and multiple references to its old name, OL Reign, under previous ownership, OL Groupe, and that it has attracted some of the best international players, \"such as Megan Rapinoe, Jess Fishlock, and Lydia Williams.\" Former U.S women's national team star Rapinoe retired in 2023. So, has Williams, who also left the club in 2019. It also references the Reign's playing style as \"fast and possession-based,\" which, considering the AI suggested a five-back to Harvey earlier this year, is the complete opposite of how they have played this season.\n            ",

The model enters Week 9 on a sizzling 45-28 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.   The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. Since its inception, it has also generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and it enters Week 10 on a profitable 47-33 combined run on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024.

I don't think that's giving credit to the Ravens defense getting healthy coming out of their bye in Week 7,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The Dolphins offense doesn't seem like it has nearly as much to worry about as Chicago last week for Baltimore, and I see it as unlikely that Tua Tagovailoa strings together two good games in a row. I expect the Ravens' offensive gameplan to be a bit conservative with Jackson returning from injury as they stick to running the ball and keeping the clock moving. This total is about 2-3 points too high for me.\" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Bucks +3.5 vs. Warriors (-115)\"First time leaving the West Coast for the Dubs so I'm a little befuddled at this number. Giannis Antetokounmpo has been truly unstoppable,\" SportsLine handicapper Matt Severance said. \"I definitely looked at Giannis' PRA, but it's absurd: 51.5. And he probably goes Over, but I'm not capable of playing an Over on that. Naturally, make sure of lineups before any play.\" Back the Bucks at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Thunder -15.5 vs. Wizards (-110)After a 68-win season and a championship, the Thunder are off to a 5-0 start. Meanwhile, the Wizards improbably blew an 18-point lead against the 76ers to lose in overtime and drop to 1-3 on Tuesday. They're back in the tank again after getting blitzed by the NBA draft lottery last season and their roster full of youngsters is no match for the best team in the NBA. The model predicts that the Thunder cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Thunder at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks for this week?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Thursday.

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Indiana looks to keep rolling as it puts its undefeated record on the line Saturday at Maryland. This will be the 14th all-time meeting between the Big Ten foes, with the Hoosiers holding an 8-5 edge in previous matchups.Indiana won 42-28 last season on its way to the College Football Playoff. A victory Saturday would give the Hoosiers a 9-0 start for the second consecutive season under coach Curt Cignetti. Indiana had never started 9-0 in program history before Cignetti arrived ahead of the 2024 season.Cignetti's squad has cruised thus far, including marquee wins over Illinois and No. 6 Oregon, both by at least two possessions. Indiana has won seven of its eight games by double-digit margins.Maryland, meanwhile, is trying to prevent another collapse under coach Mike Locksley. The Terrapins opened the year 4-0, capped by a win against Wisconsin to start Big Ten play, but have since dropped three straight conference games.\nMaryland has never finished with a winning Big Ten record under Locksley. A fourth loss Saturday would make avoiding that outcome extremely difficult.Indiana vs. Maryland: Need to knowA look at Indiana's dominance: Indiana's dominance is approaching historically significant territory. The Hoosiers have a plus-34.5 point differential in 2025 which means that, on average, they are outscoring their opponents by almost five touchdowns and extra points. That leads the FBS. Indiana also led the nation in point differential last season. Georgia also led the nation in point differential from 2021-22, when it won back-to-back national championships. The Bulldogs are the only program in the last 30 years to achieve such a feat. Indiana has a chance to join them. Another Heisman performance for Mendoza?: Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza currently has the best odds to win the Heisman Trophy at +185, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. He ranks fifth nationally with 1,923 yards passing and leads all quarterbacks with 27 total touchdowns, 24 of which have come through the air. Though Indiana has not had to play from behind much -- if at all -- he's eclipsed 200 yards passing in all but two games thus far. He'll have a chance to put up some solid numbers against Maryland's pass defense, which ranks 11th in the Big Ten while allowing 227 yards per game.     \nCan Maryland snap the streak?: Maryland has struggled against ranked conference opponents. In fact, the Terrapins have never beat a top-25 Big Ten opponent in league play. You have to go all the way back to 2010, when they were a member of the ACC, to find their last win against a ranked conference foe. That came against Russell Wilson's NC State. Since then, Maryland has lost 42-straight games in that scenario. It's the longest active FBS streak and the fifth-longest such streak all-time.   How to watch Indiana vs. Maryland live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: SECU Stadium -- College Park, MarylandTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Indiana vs. Maryland prediction, picks  \nMaryland has kept things close in its last three games, but that doesn't change the fact that said games still resulted in a loss. Maryland's last loss came against UCLA -- the same UCLA team that Indiana just beat 56-6. Results often are not directly translatable in a sport as chaotic as college football, but they certainly can be indicative of what to expect. In this case, it's hard to see Maryland hanging with the scorching-hot Hoosiers. Pick: Indiana -21.5 (-115)\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n

    "body": "\n        Don't cheat: which two NFL teams currently have the longest active winning streaks headed into Week 9? Hint: both are led by second-year quarterbacks who both wear the number 10. Answer: the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, who are both 6-2 and atop their respective divisions. During New England's winning streak, they've held all five opponents to 20 points or less while averaging nearly 31 points per game.For the Broncos, it's been a different story having trailed at some point during all five wins. This week, the Patriots are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons, while the Broncos are 1.5-point underdogs at Houston in a game where the over/under is just 39.5, as a pair of top-five scoring defenses go head-to-head. Can both the Patriots and Broncos continue their recent hot play and remain atop the AFC East and AFC West divisions respectively?

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point. While Indy is still a playoff team, I will be fading them as a road favorite in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Steelers 26, Colts 24\". See his other Week 9 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 9 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 9 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

This game is a homecoming for the South Florida native, and he's saved some of his best performances for lining up against the Dolphins. He threw five touchdown passes in his last game versus Miami in 2023, which was his second career five-TD game against the Dolphins. Jackson has four NFL games with a perfect passer rating, and half of them have come against Miami.In his three full games this year, Jackson went over 1.5 passing touchdowns in each, including three passing scores in his last full game in Week 3. The Dolphins defense should certainly help the two-time MVP hit the Over, as Miami has been shredded through the air. The Dolphins have allowed the highest completion percentage and second-highest passer rating in 2025, in addition to picking off the fewest passes.

    "body": "\n        A pair of AFC division leaders headline the NFL Week 9 schedule when the Indianapolis Colts take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is in control of the AFC North at 4-3, but have dropped two in a row. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule.  Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off for the 10th time, with Mahomes holding a 5-4 edge. However, Buffalo has won four straight regular season meetings with Kansas City. How should you handle those NFL games and optimize what to bet on NFL in Week 9?

    "body": "\n        Teams with two wins apiece will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' with a two-time MVP back on the NFL player props market. Ravens vs. Dolphins on TNF will mark the return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after he missed the last three games. He will be a central figure with NFL prop bets but not the only player of high interest with 'Thursday Night Football' props. Big names like Derrick Henry, Tua Tagovailoa, De'Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle all have interesting lines to wager on for the opener of Week 9, as Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points, and the total is 51.5 points.No team has allowed more rushing yards to opposing running backs than the Dolphins, as they're allowing 128.3 yards to running backs alone. However, Miami just held Bijan Robinson to 25 yards on the ground, which makes backing the Over of Henry's NFL prop total of 89.5 rushing yards no sure thing. Additionally, Jackson's return could affect the future Hall of Fame running back's usage. So, before betting any Dolphins vs. Ravens props for 'Thursday Night Football,' you need to see the Ravens vs. Dolphins prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Dolphins vs. Ravens   NFL betting on 'Thursday Night Football,' the Machine Learning Model  has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided Ravens vs. Dolphins prop picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Miami vs. Baltimore here.Top NFL player prop bets for Dolphins vs. Ravens  After analyzing the Ravens vs. Dolphins props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Jackson goes Under 230.5 passing yards (-114 at FanDuel). It's fair to assume that Jackson will be a bit rusty after missing a month of action, and he's played conservatively after missing games previously. He threw for just 165 yards in his first game back after an illness kept him out of a 2021 game, and he had only 107 passing yards in his first game back after being on the COVID-19 list for a 2020 game.Miami's defense will also contribute to Jackson hitting the Under as defending through the air is one of the few strengths of the Dolphins. They allow fewer than 200 passing yards per game as they prevent the big play with just 10.3 yards allowed per completion, which is seventh-fewest in the NFL. Meanwhile, just three teams give up more yards per rush than Miami (5.0), so look for Baltimore to lean on its ground game instead of an aerial attack. Jackson's projected to have 189.8 passing yards in a 4.5-star pick. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Ravens vs. DolphinsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has three additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

    "body": "\n        After missing the past two games with a foot injury, Cardinals' Kyler Murray is preparing to start Monday night's game against the Cowboys, Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said on Thursday. Murray, 28, hasn't played since he injured his foot during Arizona's Week 5 loss to the Titans. That game was the third of three consecutive losses for the Cardinals, who started the year with consecutive wins over the Saints and Panthers. During Murray's absence, the Cardinals' offense was led by veteran Jacoby Brissett. While he put up decent numbers, Brissett lost both of his starts by four points to two of the NFL's best teams: the Indianapolis Colts and the Green Bay Packers. Murray's return should help revive the Cardinals' ground game, which hasn't recovered since losing former Pro Bowl running back James Conner to a season-ending injury in Week 3. Arizona has averaged 118.2 rushing yards with Murray this season and just 91 yards per game without him. Making Murray's return more significant is the fact that the Cowboys are one of the NFL's worst teams against the run. They are currently 29th in the league in rushing yards allowed, 25th in average yards-per-carry allowed and 23rd in touchdown runs permitted. \nThe Cardinals' quarterback change could also lead to more targets for second-year wideout Marvin Harrison Jr., who was targeted just eight games during the Cardinals' last two games after getting 32 targets during Murray's five games under center. \nWhile there are clear upsides to Murray's likely return, one significant downside are the turnovers that sometimes occur with Murray as a result of him either holding the ball too long or trying a low-percentage pass that ends up in the hands of the other team. Murray had two picks during Arizona's Week 4 loss to Seattle and a fumble during the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Titans. Murray aside, Monday is a huge game for two teams who are looking to stay alive in the NFC playoff picture. The Cardinals (2-5) haven't won since Week 2, while the Cowboys (3-4-1) are trying to get back to .500 following last week's blowout loss in Denver.\nAs for intangibles, Murray is 2-2 on Monday night, but he's never lost a game as a starter at AT&T Stadium. His lifetime mark of 9-0 stretches back to his high school days. His last game there -- on Oct. 19, 2020 -- was a 38-10 Cardinals' victory, which happens to be the lone blemish on Dak Prescott's \"Monday Night Football\" record of 5-1.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        AFC squads coming off much-needed victories will kick off NFL Week 9 when the Miami Dolphins host the Baltimore Ravens on 'Thursday Night Football.' Baltimore (2-5) ended a four-game skid with a 30-16 win over Chicago on Sunday, while Miami (2-6) had lost three in a row before beating Atlanta, 34-10, in Week 8. Both teams currently sit in third place in their respective divisions, and the Ravens are 9-3 versus the Dolphins over their last 12 meetings. Lamar Jackson (hamstring) is expected to play after being sidelined since Week 4, as is Tua Tagovailoa (thumb) despite being on the injury report.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. Baltimore prevailed, 56-19, when the teams last met in 2023. The latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds have Baltimore as 7.5-point road favorites, and the Ravens are 1-3 ATS with Jackson as starter, while Miami is 4-2 ATS over its last six games. The over/under for total points is 51.5, making it the third-highest of NFL Week 9. Baltimore is at -457 on the money line (risk $457 to win $100), with Miami at +350 (risk $100 to win $350).

The team played turnover-free ball, rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, and the defense allowed a season-low of 16 points. Baltimore kept Chicago out of the endzone through the air, marking the first time the Ravens have held an opponent without a passing touchdown in 2025, and the 96 rushing yards allowed by the Ravens were the second-fewest they've given up all year.Even with Jackson missing over half of the offensive snaps this year, Baltimore still ranks second in yards per rush (5.3). Derrick Henry moved into sole possession of fifth place on the all-time rushing touchdowns list versus Chicago, passing Bears legend Walter Payton, and he should find similar success versus Miami's defense, which allows the fourth-most yards per carry. The Dolphins passing defense is even more exploitable, as it's given up the highest completion percentage, has the fewest interceptions and has allowed the second-highest passer rating. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Dolphins can coverDespite being 2-4 straight up over their last six games, the Dolphins are 4-2 versus the spread during this span. They're coming off their best performance on both sides of the ball, scoring a season-high of 34 points and allowing a season-low of 10 points in a win over Atlanta. The team still has playmakers even without Tyreek Hill, as De'Von Achane has at least 91 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in nine straight games, while Jaylen Waddle has at least 95 receiving yards in three of his last four.Those playmakers can take advantage of a Baltimore defense which hasn't played up to the franchise's standards. The Ravens rank in the bottom five in points allowed, yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. Only one team has allowed more rushing scores than Baltimore, and opponents have scored in an NFL-high of 52.7% of possessions versus it. Tua Tagovailoa should have all day to pick apart Baltimore's secondary as the Ravens have the second-fewest sacks on the year. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Ravens vs. Dolphins picksFor the NFL Week 9 'Thursday Night Football' game of Dolphins vs. Ravens, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 61 total points.

    "body": "\n        Late on Tuesday night, after he had led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 121-111 victory over the New York Knicks, and brushed off more questions about trade rumors, Giannis Antetokounmpo said it was \"too early to give compliments\" about the team's new starting point guard, Ryan Rollins. Antetokounmpo then launched into a detailed explanation of Rollins' importance to the team, and the work he's put in to improve on both sides of the ball, which lasted nearly three minutes.\"He's been playing incredible,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Defensively, he's one of the most annoying guards, probably, in the league. He's making the right reads. He's able to play with me, come off the bench, pretty much does everything. I love playing with him. He's been playing incredible with the team.\"Rollins was a second-round pick back in 2022, and has bounced around the league since then, in part due to his own off-court mistakes. (In Jan. 2024, Rollins was arrested and accused of shoplifting from Target. He later plead guilty to one count of petit larceny.) He appears to have found a home with the Bucks, however, and may be the answer to their backcourt questions.\nAfter Damian Lillard tore his Achilles in the playoffs, the team waived him and stretched his contract, which freed up the cap space to sign Myles Turner. While Turner's arrival helped shore up the Bucks' frontcourt, swapping an All-Star guard for a center left the Bucks' backcourt as thin as it has been since the team became a contender back in 2019. In the summer, general manager Jon Horst decided to take a by-committee approach and re-signed Rollins, Kevin Porter Jr. and Gary Trent Jr., signed Cole Anthony and gave AJ Green an extension. All are solid rotation players, but one of the big questions about the Bucks this season was whether any of them could take another step. The answer will not only help determine how far the team can go in the Eastern Conference, but whether Antetokounmpo sticks around beyond this season. The early signs suggest Rollins may be the one to make a leap. Porter rolled his ankle in the Bucks' season-opening win over the Washington Wizards, and hasn't played since. Rollins replaced him in the starting lineup, and it may be difficult to send him back to the bench once Porter is healthy. \nThrough four games, Rollins is averaging 15.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and three steals per game -- tied for first in the league -- on 47.6/35/100 shooting splits. Against the Knicks, he poured in a career-high 25 points to go along with four assists and four steals to help the Bucks improve to 3-1. Thus far, the Bucks are 8.2 points per 100 possessions better with Rollins on the floor than when he sits. His on-off splits with Antetokounmpo are particularly interesting.The Bucks have been awesome with Antetokounmpo and Rollins on the floor together \n                                                                    PBPStats.com\n                                                            When Antetokounmpo called Rollins one of the \"most annoying guards\" in the league, he wasn't lying. Rollins is tied for first in the league in steals per game (three) and third in deflections (5.5). He is willing and able to pick up opposing ball-handlers fullcourt, and if they aren't ready for that pressure, it's going to be a long night. Even when he isn't getting steals or deflections, his pressure disrupts what other teams are trying to do -- either by forcing them to run extra shot clock or have a secondary ball-handler bring up the ball.\nWatch this possession against the Knicks. He picks Brunson up 90 feet from the basket, makes him turn his back and give the ball up, presses Brunson when he gets the ball back, creates a deflection with high hands, stays attached to Brunson as he takes a tough pull-up, then jumps into the passing lane for a steal as the Knicks tried to save the offensive rebound. \nPerhaps it's no surprise that Rajon Rondo, who is working as a coaching associate with the Bucks on a part-time basis, has become a mentor for Rollins. \"Once I fouled out [in the preseason game] I knew my capabilities defensively,\" Rollins said Tuesday. \"I knew that I could stay in front of these guys and make it tough for them. So I'm not surprised at what I can do, it's just learning and being better at it.\"Here's 90 seconds of Rollins being annoying on defense:\nRollins can guard, and the Bucks want him to focus his efforts on that side of the ball. \"If I had my druthers, I'd want him to keep his defensive intensity, that's more important than anything,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. But as long as Porter remains out -- and perhaps even beyond that point, depending on how the rest of the backcourt is performing -- the Bucks will need Rollins to contribute on both ends. \nRollins' pick-and-roll playmaking has been solid, but not spectacular. On his 53 pick-and-roll possessions, including shots and passes, the Bucks are scoring 1.132 points per possession, which ranks in the 76th percentile in the league, per Synergy Sports. He's shooting 35% from 3-point range, but was 3 of 16 in his first three games before going 4 of 4 against the Knicks. Rollins' 3-point shooting will be a key stat to watch. He shot 40.8% last season on 2.1 attempts per game, but did not have a meaningful amount of attempts in the NBA before that. In his two years at Toledo in college, he shot 88 of 278 from behind the arc (31.7%). Playing alongside Antetokounmpo, there will be 3-point opportunities for Rollins. Antetokounmpo was only half-joking when he said it was \"too early to give compliments\" to Rollins. Consistency is major separator in the NBA. Can Rollins keep up this level of play over the course of a full season? If he can, the Bucks will be better than everyone expected prior to the season. \n\"I know my capabilities. I've been saying that for a while now. I just needed the opportunity and the platform to be able to go out there and play through mistakes and play my game,\" Rollins said. \"I feel like I'm doing that now. [But there's] a lot more to do, so [I have to] keep growing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays are one win away from winning the 2025 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays possess a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven series, putting them a victory away from claiming their first championship since repeating in 1992-93. The Dodgers, meanwhile, have no margin for error in their own pursuit of consecutive titles. It's to be determined if the World Series will conclude on Friday or Saturday, but this much is clear: the end is near. With that in mind, CBS Sports figured to use this time to sort out who is in the running for the World Series' Most Valuable Player honors.Truthfully, this is a tough World Series to elevate one player above all others. Only one of the games has been decided by fewer than four runs, and that was the 18-inning marathon that the Dodgers won in Game 3. Otherwise, there've been limited opportunities for narrative-stealing performances.Still, scroll with us as we sort through five realistic candidates through Game 5 to claim the hardware.1. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., 1B, Blue Jays\nGuerrero has a lot working in his favor. He's recorded at least one hit in all five games, and has notched multi-hit efforts in three of those. He's homered early in Games 4 (to give the Blue Jays a lead) and 5 (to pad their lead). Guerrero is also an easy choice from a narrative perspective, having started this year by putting pen to paper on a long-term extension rather than entering free agency this offseason. That last part won't show up in the stat sheet, but never doubt a writer's affection for easy copy -- especially as a tiebreaker in a field without a clear frontrunner. \n2. Trey Yesavage, RHP, Blue Jays\nRookies have won the World Series MVP trophy on three prior occasions: Jeremy Peña ('22), Livan Hernandez ('97), and Larry Sherry ('59). Yesavage made his case for becoming the fourth in Game 5, when he broke Don Newcombe's rookie reward for strikeouts by fanning 12 Dodgers. As impressive as that performance was, voters may hold a just-OK Game 1 start against him. Remember, Yesavage exited after surrendering two runs on four hits and three walks in four innings of work. For whatever it's worth: Yesavage has the second highest Championship Win Probability Added among Blue Jays, trailing only Eric Lauer, who worked several scoreless innings in that marathon Game 3 less.\n3. Addison Barger, RF, Blue Jays\nIf voters aren't taken by Guerrero or Yesavage, Barger has a decent candidacy to consider. He's notched multiple hits in four of the first five games of the set. That includes launching a grand slam that broke open Game 1 and either scoring or driving in a run in Games 3, 4, and 5. Barger also 1) recorded an assist in Game 3 and 2) was one of CBS Sports' postseason breakout picks. 4. Shohei Ohtani, TWP, Dodgers\nBobby Richardson (1960) is the only World Series MVP winner in history who played for the losing team. Ohtani probably won't become the second, but if he does it'll be on the strength of his incredible Game 3 performance that saw him record four extra-base hits (two home runs) and reach base a record nine times. Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw a complete game in Game 2, would also enter the equation if he has another brilliant outing as part of his Game 6 start.5. Alejandro Kirk, C, Blue Jays\nKirk has the third highest CWPA among Blue Jays hitters, having plated six runs on six hits, including a pair of home runs. His narrative case would be stronger if the Blue Jays had held on to the 3-2 lead he staked out with a three-run shot during the middle of Game 3. Otherwise, his biggest offensive contributions to this series haven't arrived during pivotal situations -- at least not yet.\n2025 World Series MVP oddsOdds via FanDuel as of Oct. 30Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: -195Shohei Ohtani: +250Yoshinobu Yamamoto: +1300Alejandro Kirk: +2200Addison Barger: +2700Trey Yesavage: +6500\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- First-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer spent 25 seasons grinding as an NFL assistant coach before the Dallas Cowboys gave him a shot to be the boss in 2025.That's one of the reasons why he's about had it with his Cowboys off to a 3-4-1 start thanks to Jekyll and Hyde play on both sides of the football: Dallas' offense is averaging the league's second-most points per game (30.8 points per game) while Dallas' defense is allowing the second-most points per game (31.3 points per game). That makes his Cowboys just the fourth team in NFL history to average 30 or more points per game on offense and allow 30 or more points per game on defense through the first eight games of a season. None of the previous three teams to do that won a playoff game. In fact, no team has ever reached the playoffs, allowing 30 or more points per game.Schottenheimer is the team's offensive play caller, so his side of the ball is more than doing its part. Quarterback Dak Prescott ranks third in the league in passing yards (2,069) and is tied for third in the NFL in passing touchdowns (16). Running back Javonte Williams ranks fourth in the NFL in rushing yards (633) and third in rushing touchdowns (eight). Wide receiver George Pickens ranks third in the NFL in receiving yards (685), and both he and tight end Jake Ferguson are tied for third in the NFL in receiving touchdowns (six). It's been difficult for Schottenheimer to watch the side of the ball he isn't directly involved in floundering to this degree, which puts a tight lid on what Dallas can accomplish this year. He let that frustration out Wednesday afternoon before the team's practice following the Cowboys' largest loss of the season in Week 8, a 20-point beatdown, 44-24, at the Denver Broncos. \n\"You can take stats on offense and shove them up your ass as far as I'm concerned. It is what it is. We want to win,\" Schottenheimer said. \"People talk about, 'Hey, MVP and this and that.' Dak Prescott doesn't want to win MVP. He wants to win a Super Bowl and that's what we want to win. We're not there yet. We've not played consistently well enough to certainly be in that discussion but it doesn't mean the journey stops. ... You get more intentional, and you got to do it together.\"Offense vs. defenseThat's why Schottenheimer has increased his attendance at defensive meetings over the last few weeks, despite being the Cowboys' offensive playcaller. He's trying to do everything he can to help defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus and his defensive staff, after the Cowboys have struggled to get comfortable in his zone coverage-based scheme (80.1% zone coverage rate, the seventh-highest in the NFL this season). Dallas has surrendered 66 explosive plays -- runs of 12 or more yards or completions of 16 or more yards -- this season, which ranks as the second-most in the NFL, just one behind the New York Giants' league-leading 67 explosive plays allowed. \nThis week, Schottenheimer spent a noticeable amount of time in the linebacker position room. He said he hopes his defense can have a tighter focus to play cleaner football when getting into position with their run fits. \"It's to offer my expertise on what I see and how I would attack them and things like that,\" Schottenheimer said. \"There will be changes. Some are bigger than others, but the change is not necessarily what makes this thing go. What makes it go is going to be the execution. That's what I want everybody to understand.\"\nEberflus called Schottenheimer's increased presence in his meetings with defensive staff and players \"always beneficial.\"\"Any offensive guy that I've been with, it's really beneficial because you can see it through the offensive coordinator's eyes,\" Eberflus said Thursday. \"Gives us insight, not only in a defensive meeting or unit, but also when we just talk in the office. So I think that's really important to soak that in.\"\nThis stretch actually isn't Schottenheimer's first foray into the defensive meeting rooms with the Cowboys. After he found himself on the unemployment line in 2022 following the Jacksonville Jaguars' letting go of former head coach Urban Meyer's entire 2021 staff, then-Dallas head coach Mike McCarthy hired him to be a consultant in 2022. He spent that season with then-defensive coordinator Dan Quinn and the defense, offering his perspective from the other side of the ball on how to tweak and improve their approach. Schottenheimer was then promoted to the offensive coordinator role in 2023 when Kellen Moore left for the Los Angeles Chargers; however, his return to contributing on defense has been welcomed by his players. \n\"I think it's good he's in the meetings, just giving a higher awareness of what's going on and just being able to chime in or certain things when we're asking about what he's thinking from an offensive standpoint,\" defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa said Wednesday.\"McCarthy was mainly meeting with the offense when he was the head coach here, and Schotty was in that consulting role. He was kind of doing what he's doing now, so it's cool to have him and just more eyes. ... Time is ticking, so it's heightened urgency.\"The toughest part about Dallas' defensive struggles is that the players feel like they're having good practices against the Cowboys' offense, the No. 2 scoring offense in the NFL, but then the unit fails to execute on game day. That execution disconnect is something that's still being worked through nearly halfway through the 2025 season.\n\"That's definitely one of those things you just got to see that translate,\" Odighizuwa said. \"Just make sure everyone is on the same page in that regard and just make sure that we stick to the fundamentals because it's not like doing the right things is going to guarantee that you win. But once you start to stray from doing it the right way, failure is guaranteed.\"Cowboys defense this seasonStatsNFL RanksPoints per game allowed31.331stTotal yards allowed404.631stYards per play allowed6.231stPass yards per game allowed258.6  31stRush yards per game allowed 146.329thThird-down conversion rate allowed52.4% LastQB pressure rate38.1% 13thSacks15T-22ndPasser rating allowed112.0LastTakeaways7T-20thZone coverage rate80.1% 7thMan coverage rate15.0% 27thBlitz rate25.6%19thWhen will the major changes occur?The likely Week 11 return of explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown should provide a boost to Dallas' defense, but it's not fair to expect him to be the defense's savior.  It's also worth wondering if Dallas' defense was doomed the moment they traded Micah Parsons away a week before the season kicked off. The Cowboys' defensive expected points added (EPA) per play when Parsons was on the field was the best in the NFL from 2021 to 2024. When off the field in that same span, Dallas had the league's worst EPA per play, per CBS Sports Research. That data is coming to life in 2025, with Dallas having the NFL's worst defense across the board this season. On Thursday, Parsons was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for October with the Packers. Schottenheimer disputes the premise that Parsons' absence has sunk them, and he pointed to what happened with Cleveland Browns' All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett in Week 8: he recorded a Browns franchise-record five sacks, but Cleveland lost 32-13 to the New England Patriots. \n\"Defense is about more than just one guy. Some of our defensive struggles have not been because of one guy not doing the right thing, and not been one assignment, hasn't been one defense, whether it's man, zone, whatever,\" Schottenheimer said. \"This is the ultimate team game and defense. The more I spend time over there, you realize this as an offensive guy, but like if you're not aligned perfectly in terms of your fits and things like that, it makes it really, really difficult. So again, all respect to Micah [Parsons]. What a great player. But team defense is what we need to play better.\"Cowboys defensive EPA/Play with Micah Parsons on/off field, 2021-2024On FieldOff FieldDefensive EPA/Play0.08-0.04NFL Rank 1stLastAfter squaring off against the feisty 2-5 Arizona Cardinals in Week 9, Schottenheimer promised key changes over the team's Week 10 bye week. \"Like I said, we've already had some of those meetings and we've talked about those changes. We're in the mode right now of we've got kind of a one-game season, and I say that because we've got Arizona before the bye,\" Schottenheimer said. \"No one is pleased. No one is happy with the way we performed [against the Broncos]. It's not acceptable. It's not good enough, and that starts with me. So I would say that both the staff and the players are aware that the standard was not met.\"\n            ",

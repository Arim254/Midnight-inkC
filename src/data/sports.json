    "body": "\n        A rematch of two top Big Ten teams will determine which national championship participant comes out of Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta.  No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon have already faced each other this season, a 30-20 win in Eugene for the undefeated Hoosiers. It was a significant program accomplishment for Curt Cignetti in Year 2 of his miraculous Indiana rebuild, especially after an offseason narrative around the Hoosiers' losses to Ohio State and Notre Dame lingered. Indiana definitively proved in that game -- and every game since -- it was no one-hit wonder.  Now the big question is can Indiana do it again? You can call it an overplayed narrative but it can be difficult to beat a team twice in one season. Georgia just learned that the hard way down in New Orleans against Ole Miss.  CFP predictions: Why Indiana will win it all | Why Oregon will win a national title \nIndiana seems to be peaking at the right time, coming into this one off an emphatic 38-3 Rose Bowl win over Alabama. But Oregon is battle-tested, too. The Ducks easily handled their first-round opponent, James Madison, before knocking off Texas Tech, 23-0, in one of the most impressive defensive performances of the season. With Dan Lanning leading the way, this team isn't afraid of anything or anyone.   Indiana vs. Oregon: Need to know for Peach Bowl How does Oregon run game hold up?: Oregon was dealt a significant blow Tuesday when running back Jordan Davison was officially ruled out for Friday's Peach Bowl. Davison, who led the Ducks with 15 rushing touchdowns, suffered a broken clavicle in Oregon's quarterfinal win over Texas Tech. Making the situation even more precarious is that Oregon is now down to only three healthy running backs with Jayden Limar and Makhi Hughes hitting the transfer portal. Fortunately for Oregon it still has Noah Whittington, who led the way with rushing attempts, but it'll be interesting to see how Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein adjusts his gameplan without a significant piece like Davison. Whittington's carries high this season was 17 -- against Iowa and Washington -- but that number will almost certainly have to go up against Indiana if Oregon wants to stay balanced.  Preview of top NFL picks: There is some variance across all the NFL mock drafts you can find out on the internet, but Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore are pretty consistently atop the projections. At CBS Sports, for instance, both Mike Renner and Josh Edwards both have Mendoza and Moore projected to go in the first two picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. We are still a long way from April's draft, but if you're a fan of say the Las Vegas Raiders, New York Jets or Arizona Cardinals, you'll want to tune into the Peach Bowl to watch your potential next franchise quarterback. This is the kind of game that can play big in the minds of NFL executives and scouts when it comes time for the draft. Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy winner, has flown up the draft boards with a terrific season in Bloomington. He hasn't officially declared for the draft but with the Hoosiers taking TCU quarterback transfer Josh Hoover, the signs are there. It's a bit more up in the air with Moore who could still return to Eugene despite the possibility of being a top draft pick. One factor, too: Moore is still just 20-years old and this is his first season as the full-time starter after previously starting five games as a freshman at UCLA.  \nHuge stakes for both programs: Indiana has never been anywhere close to this stratosphere of college football before. A Peach Bowl win over Oregon to send Indiana to its first national championship appearance would be remarkable. There will be books and movies made about Cignetti if he can get two more wins. Oregon has had much more success over the last two decades than Indiana, but still has never won a national championship. Nike co-founder Phil Knight desperately wants to see one. Oregon has played in two national championship games in the 21st century, a 22-19 loss to Auburn in 2011 and a 42-20 loss to Ohio State in 2015. The Ducks have been oh-so-close in the past, and another bite at the apple would be well appreciated in Eugene.   Where to watch Indiana vs. Oregon live Date: Friday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Indiana vs. Oregon prediction, picks \nEven with the above caveat about it being hard to beat a team twice, I have to stick with Indiana in this game. It's going to be difficult, and I would expect the margin to be closer than the first time around, but Indiana just does so many things so well. I completely trust Curt Cignetti and his coaching staff, I believe in Fernando Mendoza to deliver in the big moments and, ultimately, I think Indiana's defense will give Oregon quarterback Dante Moore problems again.

    "body": "\n        There is a limited four-game NBA schedule on Thursday, which begins at 7 p.m. ET and has the last tip at 9 p.m. ET.   Even with the schedule low on quantity, there is a high quality in the NBA DFS player pool to build your daily Fantasy basketball lineups around. Stars like Keyonte George, Donovan Mitchell, Cooper Flagg, Anthony Davis, Lauri Markkanen and Pascal Siakam are in action, so you certainly have plenty of directions to go with NBA DFS picks. Finding someone who can outperform his price tags on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings is key to that and to constructing a winning NBA DFS strategy.  Donte DiVincenzo (undisclosed), Josh Giddey (hamstring) and Isaiah Jackson (concussion) are among those who are out for tonight. That means there are several players who could make a difference in their absences. Who should find their way into your daily Fantasy basketball lineups? Before making any NBA DFS picks, be sure to check out the NBA DFS advice, player rankings, stacks, and top daily Fantasy basketball picks from SportsLine's Mike McClure.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins:McClure is a DFS professional with more than $2 million in career winnings. He's also a predictive data engineer at SportsLine who uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every minute of every game 10,000 times, taking factors like matchups, statistical trends and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best NBA DFS values on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel and create optimal lineups that he shares only over at SportsLine. They're a must-see for any NBA DFS player.McClure has turned his attention to NBA action on Thursday and locked in his top daily Fantasy basketball picks. You can only see them by heading to SportsLine.Top NBA DFS picks for Thursday, January 8For Thursday, one of McClure's top NBA DFS picks is Mavericks PF/C Anthony Davis, who is listed at $9,300 on DraftKings and $10,900 on FanDuel. The 14th-year veteran is off to a solid start to the season. In 18 games, all starts, he is averaging a 20.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.7 blocks and 1.2 steals in 30.8 minutes. He is connecting on 52.2% of his field goals and 72.6% of his free throws. Davis should fare well against the Utah defense, which ranks 27th in the league by allowing 119.8 points per game.Dallas has won two games in a row thanks in part to Davis' play. He is coming off back-to-back double-doubles. In a 100-98 win at Sacramento on Tuesday, he scored 19 points, while grabbing 16 rebounds. He poured in 26 points, while adding 12 rebounds, five blocks and three assists in a 110-104 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday. New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Another part of McClure's optimal NBA DFS strategy includes stacking Davis with forward Naji Marshall ($5,000 on DraftKings and $5,400 on FanDuel). The fifth-year veteran is averaging 13.2 points in 37 games played, including 14 starts.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of big-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Phillies interested in BichetteThe Phillies may be looking to upgrade their infield situation, and on that front free agent Bo Bichette is of interest to the club, to the point that they've scheduled a meeting, the Athletic reports. \nAny signing of Bichette by Philly would likely entail moving on from catcher JT Realmuto, who's also a free agent, and trading third baseman Alec Bohm, according to that same report. The arbitration-eligible Bohm and the Phillies on Thursday settled on a $10.2 million salary for 2026. With Trea Turner and Bryston Stott entrenched at at shortstop and second base, respectively, for the Phillies, Bichette would presumably take over at third base in place of Bohm. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bichette as the No. 3 free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"Bichette's optimal position is second base, but his bat may convince a team to tolerate his substandard play at short for a few more years yet. He rebounded from a down season by clearing a .290 average (for the fourth time in five tries) and 60 extra-base hits (for the third time). Bichette's flat swing allows him to wear out elevated pitches, with his .337 average on offerings located in the upper half ranking fifth among qualifiers. As an added bonus, he's on the younger side for a free agent (he'll turn 28 in March).\"This past season, Bichette for the AL champion Blue Jays had an OPS+ of 129 and WAR of 3.5 in 139 games for the Blue Jays.With little movement on Bellinger, Yankees consider BichetteThe Yankees' priority this offseason is re-upping with outfielder Cody Bellinger, who last season put up a 5.1 WAR -- his highest such figure since his MVP season of 2019. However, the Yankees and Bellinger still have a wide gap in talks and the club is now looking \"more seriously\" at the aforementioned Bichette, the New York Post reports. On Bellinger, The Athletic reports that the Yankees have offered a multi-year deal worth more than $30 million per season, but Bellinger and his agency \"continue to push for seven years.\" The Yankees have said basically all offseason that they want Bellinger back, but perhaps the ask from his camp is a bit aggressive for the Yankees' tastes. If that's the case, it's possible they'd pivot to Bichette.Bichette, who turns 28 in March, has been a member of the AL East-rival Blue Jays for his entire professional career to date. He's a shortstop who may also be willing to man second or third, but the Yankees may at least theoretically be open to an upgrade over Anthony Volpe at short. Bichette endured uncharacteristic struggles in 2024, thanks in part to nagging injuries, but in 2025 he rebounded to put up vintage numbers and then some. As such, he's one of the most coveted free agents available this winter. \nYankees still exploring trade for rotation helpThe Yankees in an effort to add another starting pitcher to their mix for 2026 may have missed out on Edward Cabrera, who wound up being dealt to the Cubs, but now New York has moved on to other targets. Specifically, the Yankees have had at least cursory trade discussions with the Nationals regarding MacKenzie Gore and with the Brewers regarding Freddy Peralta, MLB.com reports. Gore would be more of an upside play for the Yankees, while Peralta is an established frontline presence who boasts three straight seasons of at least 200 strikeouts. Both hurlers are believed to be at least theoretically available this offseason. When healthy, the Yankees' rotation is a strong one, but Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt are all expected to open the 2026 season in the injured list as they recover from various elbow surgeries. Three possible frontrunners for Tucker\nKyle Tucker is our top-ranked free agent of the offseason and it's possible his thus far quiet market is starting to make a bit of noise. Specifically, the Dodgers, Blue Jays, and Mets have emerged as three leading options for Tucker, the Athletic reports. As Will Sammon writes: \n\"The Mets' preference is to offer a shorter contract length (probably less than four years) with a high annual average value. League sources expect the Blue Jays to go longer. Assuming they'll act aggressively and given their history of swooping in and making deals with stars, the Dodgers loom as a contender.\"Speaking of a short-term, high-AAV deal for Tucker, our Mike Asixa recently explored what that might look like. The Blue Jays have been among the most aggressive of teams this offseason coming off their pennant-winning campaign in 2025, and the Dodgers of course remain the standard in terms of ownership's commitment to building a championship roster. As for the Mets, owner Steve Cohen has vast resources and they're in need of a headline-grabbing addition after the free-agent losses of Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz. As for Tucker, he's going into his age-29 season in 2026 and he boasts a career OPS+ of 139 and a WAR of 27.3 across parts of eight MLB seasons. His combination of power, plate discipline, defense, and base-running make him a star. Rockies ink LorenzenThe Rockies and right-hander Michael Lorenzen have agreed to a one-year, $8 million free agent contract with a $9 million club option for 2027, ESPN reports.\nLorenzen, 34, is coming off a 2025 season for the Royals in which he pitched to a 4.64 ERA and a 4.59 FIP in 26 starts and one relief appearance. For his career, the one-time All-Star has an ERA+ of 103 and a WAR of 10.6 in 11 major league seasons. \n            ",

Detroit is a file-and-trial team, meaning they will not negotiate on a one-year deal before the hearing. That means the two sides are likely headed for a possibly contentious arbitration hearing that could impact extension talks. Skubal's camp filed for a $32 million salary for 2026 while the Tigers filed at $19 million, a $13 million gap that represents the largest difference in arbitration history, according to ESPN. The record for a pitcher in arbitration is $19.75 million, but that was in 2015 (David Price). Skubal's filing of $32 million would beat Juan Soto's record ($31 million) in arbitration.By way of reminder, players with 3-6 years of MLB service time are eligible for salary arbitration. As well, players in the top 22% of service time between 2-3 years are also eligible. Those latter players are called Super Twos and go through arbitration four times rather than the usual three before being in line for free agency. Other big names eligible for arbitration this time around who reached settlements include Randy Arozarena of the Mariners, Hunter Brown of the Astros, Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman of the Orioles, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Yankees, among others. Eighteen players, including the aforementioned Skubal, William Contreras of the Brewers, Joe Ryan of the Twins, and Isaac Paredes of the Astros, were unable to reach a settlement.\nAs for how the arbitration deadline works, players file the salary they believe they should be paid in 2026 and teams file the salary they believe the players should be paid for the upcoming season. If the two sides are unable to agree on a figure, they will go to an arbitration hearing where each side will state their case, and a three-person panel will pick either the salary the player filed or the salary the team filed. There's no splitting the difference between the two figures or picking one out of thin air. As such, the system is designed to promote negotiation, and that's typically what happens before a trial is held. Indeed, the vast majority of arbitration-eligible players sign one-year contracts for the coming season prior to the filing deadline. Only a handful actually file salary figures and even fewer go to a hearing. Neither side wants to go to a hearing because the process necessarily entails, on the team side, emphasizing a player's flaws and shortcomings in the name of winning. That can lead to acrimony and a frayed relationship between team and player. Generally speaking, arbitration salaries are based on comparable players at the same service time level. A player with three years of service time who outperformed a player with six years of service time could have a lower 2025 salary because of, well, service time. Service time matters in arbitration. It's not purely about performance. That means the biggest arb-eligible salaries belong to those players who are in the final year of arbitration. Here are the record arbitration salaries heading into this year's deadline: \nJuan Soto, 2024 Yankees: $31 millionShohei Ohtani, 2023 Angels: $30 millionVladimir Guerrero Jr., 2025 Blue Jays: 28.5 millionMookie Betts, 2020 Dodgers: $27 millionNolan Arenado, 2019 Rockies: $26 millionHere now are some of the notable signings from Thursday's arbitration salary filing deadline.Oneil Cruz, Pirates, $3.3 million (FanSided)Anthony Volpe, Yankees, $3.475 million (YES)Ernie Clement, Blue Jays, $4.6 million (FanSided)CJ Abrams, Nationals, $5.2 million (FanSided)Riley Greene, Tigers, $5 million (Detroit Free Press)Gavin Lux, Reds, $5.525 million (New York Post)Shea Langeliers, A's, $5.25 million (FanSided)MacKenzie Gore, Nationals, $5.6 million (FanSided)Hunter Brown, Astros, $5.71 million (MLB.com)Brendan Donovan, Cardinals, $5.8 million (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Bryson Stott, Phillies, $5.9 million (FanSided)George Kirby, Mariners, $6.55 million (FanSided)Jesús Sánchez, Astros, $6.8 million (MLB.com)Adley Rutschman, Orioles, $7.25 million (FanSided)Jhoan Duran, Phillies, $7.5 million (The Athletic)Steven Kwan, Guardians, $7.725 million (FanSided)David Peterson, Mets, $8.1 million (FanSided)Gunnar Henderson, Orioles, $8.5 million (Baltimore Banner)Jeremy Peña, Astros, $9.475 million (MLB.com)Alec Bohm, Phillies, $10.2 million (The Athletic)Jazz Chisholm Jr., Yankees, $10.2 million (YES)Daulton Varsho, Blue Jays, $10.75 million (New York Post)Jesus Luzardo, Phillies, $11 million (Philadelphia Inquirer)Taylor Ward, Orioles, $12.175 million (FanSided)Randy Arozarena, Mariners, $15.65 million (FanSided)Failed to agree to dealTarik Skubal, Tigers; player filed at $32 million, team filed at $19 million (MLB.com)Eric Lauer, Blue Jays; player filed at $5.75 million, team filed at $4.4 million (Sportsnet)William Contreras, Brewers; player filed at $9.9 million, team filed at $8.55 million (MLB.com)Joe Ryan, Twins; player filed at $6.35 million, team filed at $5.85 million (MLB.com)Isaac Paredes, Astros; player filed at $9.95 million, team filed at $8.75 million (MLB.com)Kris Bubic, Royals; player filed at $6.15 million, team filed at $5.15 million (MLB.com)Vinnie Pasqantino, Royals; player filed at $4.5 million, team filed at $4 million (MLB.com)Tyler Stephenson, Reds; player filed at $6.8 million, team filed at $6.55 million (MLB.com)Graham Ashcraft, Reds; player filed at $1.75 million, team filed at $1.25 million (MLB.com)Keegan Akin, Orioles; player filed at $3.375 million, team filed at $2.975 million (MLB.com)Kyle Bradish, Orioles; player filed at $3.55 million, team filed at $2.875 million (MLB.com)Cade Cavalli, Nationals; player filed at $900,000, team filed at $825,000 (MLB.com)Reid Detmers, Angels; player filed at $2.925 million, team filed at $2.625 million (MLB.com)Yainer Diaz, Astros; player filed at $4.5 million, team filed at $3 million (MLB.com)Bryce Miller, Mariners; player filed at $2.625 million, team filed at $2.25 million (MLB.com)Edwin Uceta, Rays; player filed at $1.525 million, team filed at $1.2 million (MLB.com)Dylan Lee, Braves; player filed at $2.2 million, team filed at $2 million (MLB.com)Calvin Faucher, Marlins; player filed at $2.05 million, team filed at $1.8 million (MLB.com)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

A make-up date has not yet been set.\nThe game, scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local time) was delayed for nearly two hours before officially being postponed. Chicago experienced unseasonably warm temperatures -- in the 50s -- and significant humidity and rain Thursday, with flood and flash flood warnings throughout the area.Furthermore, the Chicago Blackhawks had played at the United Center the previous night, defeating the St. Louis Blues 7-3. All of those factors combined to form a court that was visibly wet in several spots, despite the best efforts of several arena staffers who used towels and other supplies in an effort to dry the court.The Athletic reported humidity levels in the arena were nearly double what they usually are, and the Bulls broadcast noted the arena had pumped the air conditioning in an attempt to help solve the issue.\nIt created a strange scene inside, with players intermittently doing some light warmups, playing \"horse\" or trying trick shots and then going back to the locker room. Players were sent back to their locker rooms about 50 minutes after the original tip-off time, per Chicago Sports Network. They then emerged from and retreated to the locker rooms again about 1:45 after the game was scheduled to begin.The delay wasn't all for naught, though: Benny the Bull produced this highlight.\nThough rare, postponements of this ilk aren't completely unprecedented. In 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers' home game against the Sacramento Kings at what was then the Wells Fargo Center was postponed due to essentially the same situation: warm temperatures, humidity and a hockey game the previous night.\n            \n    ",

Golfers who finish inside the top 50 of the 2026 FedEx Cup standings (qualify for the BMW Championship) will all receive recurring equity grants in PGA Tour Enterprises, which will be awarded in April 2027.The decision comes as a response to feedback from a players meeting at last summer's Rocket Classic that was taken to a November board meeting and ultimately approved.Roughly 200 PGA Tour members are now equity holders in the program, which has topped $1 billion in value. Current equity holders remain eligible to earn equity through the expanded program, regardless of their stake.\n\"As the sports industry continues to evolve and attract significant investment, your ownership in the PGA Tour is becoming an increasingly important part of the conversation,\" PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp wrote in the memo. \"The PGA Tour's player ownership model stands out as a groundbreaking approach -- giving you the opportunity to benefit from the PGA Tour's growth and success in ways that go beyond weekly purse earnings. In short, as the PGA Tour does better, so do you.\"The Player Equity Program was announced in 2024 when the Strategic Sports Group -- a consortium of sports owners from North America -- invested $1.5 billion into the tour's newly created for-profit entity, PGA Tour Enterprises, with an additional $1.5 billion investment possible down the road.\nEquity grants were first awarded to players based on career performance, recent performance and Player Impact Program metrics. Those individuals who were key in building up the PGA Tour received equity, while additional equity was set aside for future PGA Tour players as well.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA and WNBPA will not have a new collective bargaining agreement in place by the Friday deadline, per WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart. \"We're not coming to an agreement by tomorrow. I can tell you that,\" Stewart told reporters on Thursday. However, despite the expectation that a third deadline will come and go without a new CBA, Stewart added that the WNBPA and WNBA plan to continue to negotiate in good faith.That last part means the WNBPA will not look to make a strike official just yet, but it does show that the two sides remain far apart on key elements of the upcoming CBA. Why can't the WNBA and WNBPA reach an agreement? There are all manner of things at stake in the new CBA, from codifying charter travel to prioritization and more. However, as is always the case in a labor dispute, the biggest hurdle is about money. \nThere is currently a wide gulf in the proposals from each side regarding what the salary cap will be and how much of the league's revenue will go to the players. The WNBA's proposal in early December offered to raise the cap to $5 million and the max salary to about $1.3 million a year in the first year of the deal. Sources close to the situation told CBS Sports that over the course of the proposed deal, the max salary would raise to almost $2 million and that multiple players on each team would be eligible for the max salary. The minimum salary in this deal would start at $230,000 and the average salary would start at $530,000. All of these salary figures include a base salary plus a revenue-sharing component that includes both team and league revenue, something players have been asking for. The source estimates that this deal would result in players getting about 70% of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.For comparison, in 2025 the WNBA's salary cap was about $1.5 million, the minimum salary was around $66,000 and its supermax was about $250,000. \nThe WNBPA, however, has reportedly countered with a proposal for the players to get 30% of gross revenue, moving the salary cap in 2026 to around $10.5 million with a max salary around $2.5 million. Sources tell CBS Sports that the WNBA has not yet submitted a formal counter to the WNBPA's latest offer, which was submitted a couple of weeks ago.The biggest discrepancy remains what figures should be included in the revenue-sharing pot and whether the players' share comes from the gross revenue or the net revenue.What's the point of a deadline if the two sides will just keep negotiating?A good question! One of the unique things about the WNBA calendar is that the offseason is so long that there isn't a true sense of urgency created by manufactured deadlines. In the NBA, for example, there are less than four months between when the NBA Finals end and the next regular season begins. In the WNBA, there are seven months between the end of the Finals and the start of the regular season. \nThat's the biggest reason neither side is stressing over a missed deadline in early January. The two sides already agreed to extend the initial deadline twice already -- first from from Oct. 31 to Nov. 30 and then again from Nov. 30 to Jan. 9. Whether they make an official extension or not, it doesn't sound like the union is quite prepared to take the official step of going on strike -- although players have authorized the union to do so if necessary. The key thing all sides want to avoid is missing actual games. We are still four months away from the traditional opening of training camp, so both sides aren't feeling the heat just yet. We will find out what the actual deadline both parties feel would create problems for the 2026 season once there's serious movement from the league and union, but it's clear arbitrary deadlines aren't going to force either to make major concessions. When would the season end up in danger of being delayed? Unrivaled plays into the first week of March and if an agreement hasn't been reached by the time that season ends, there would be real concerns about whether the season can start in late May as per usual. \nThat said, there is more to get done than usual this offseason because there are two expansion teams -- the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire -- that haven't even gotten to go through the expansion draft process. The expansion draft structure has to be agreed up on in the new CBA, but you can bet those franchises are getting a bit itchy to finally start putting together a roster after being stuck in a lengthy holding pattern. Even if there's no panic from either side right now, each missed deadline brings the looming specter of a work stoppage into play. Neither side wants that, but they are both keenly aware of the importance of this CBA negotiation in laying the framework the league will operate under going forward. Players feel they've never had more power or leverage, but the league wants to make it clear that they are in charge. The result is a standoff that is about to blow through its third deadline this offseason with no obvious end in sight. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred was in studio for a segment on WFAN in New York Thursday afternoon and among the topics broached was expansion and, along with it, realignment. It's been a hot button topic the last few years, as it's been a long time since MLB expanded and the league is currently thriving. While the league is currently balanced with two leagues of 15 teams and six divisions of five, each league having an odd number of teams feels a bit off. And, again, the league hasn't expanded since the Diamondbacks and Devil Rays joined the fray in 1998. The commissioner has long said he wants two expansion teams selected before his term expires in January 2029.\"Thirty-two would be good for us,\" he said, also noting there are a lot of cities that want a Major League Baseball team. \"When people want your product, you oughta try to find a way to sell it to them.\"Mathematically, 32 teams would fit more snugly into leagues than 30, given that you could have 16 teams in each league and eight divisions of four. \n\"It does a ton for us from a format perspective,\" the commissioner said. \"You would realign along geographic lines, which could alleviate a ton of the travel burden that's on players.\" It's a good point. Keep in mind that MLB players travel so much more than players in any other sport, given the 162-game schedule, even with it divided up into 2-4 game series throughout the season. Manfred also discussed what a problem the first round of playoff games can be, logistically, if featuring a team from each coast, making the scheduling either too late for people in the east or too early for people in the west -- and sometimes both. Other leagues, like the NBA, are more cleanly split geographically, allowing the Knicks to play in eastern time and the Thunder in western, for example. \nThe big takeaway there is that Manfred likes the idea of moving away from the American and National Leagues and instead toward East and West leagues. However, he did say he would want to keep the two-team cities \"separate.\" That is to say that the Cubs and White Sox, Mets and Yankees and Dodgers and Angels, respectively, would remain in different divisions.  Upon first glance, that might seem like a tough needle to thread, but not impossible.Even if the Mets and Yankees, for example, were both in an Eastern League, you could group the Yankees with the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Pirates while the Mets could go with the Phillies, Orioles and Nationals. It could work.Regardless, there's a CBA next offseason that needs to be completed and Manfred has also said in previous years that he won't deal with expansion until the stadium situations are resolved for the A's and Rays. \nStill, it's a fun offseason topic of discussion.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Hats off to Pete Golding, who opened his Ole Miss tenure with back-to-back wins and held a fourth-quarter lead over Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals. He came up just shy of a trip to the national championship game, though, with a heartbreaking 31-27 Fiesta Bowl loss to the Hurricanes.It was a devastating defeat for a program that was on a mission to prove itself following Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU. Miami quarterback Carson Beck scampered across the goal line for a late go-ahead touchdown run, and although the Rebels had one shot at the end zone as time expired, Beck's score came with too little time for Ole Miss to overcome it.The Rebels played with fire over their final two games of the season, and they got burned in the Fiesta Bowl. One week after surrendering 34 points to Georgia, the Ole Miss defense gave up 31 to the Hurricanes and could not deliver a critical stop in the final minute.Among Golding's offseason tasks will be to bolster a defensive unit that just last year stood with the nation's elites. He is a proven former defensive coordinator and may well be up to the task of rebuilding that group in short order. After all, he worked over the last three years for the \"Portal King\" and ought to have some transfer portal magic up his own sleeve.\nIf the college football world learned one thing about Ole Miss over the last few weeks, it is that this program, as currently constructed, is built to sustain adversity. More is on the way with the inevitable roster upheaval that will occur with players following Kiffin to LSU, transferring to other schools and departing for the NFL Draft. Golding was capable of weathering one storm, but can he guide the ship through another?Trinidad Chambliss eligibility waiver decision awaitsSo long as the NCAA obliges, Ole Miss will have an elite cornerstone around which to build its 2026 roster. Star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss plans to re-sign with the Rebels, but his deal is contingent on the NCAA approving his eligibility waiver for a sixth year. Chambliss filed that waiver request in November and is still awaiting a ruling.Of course, Chambliss could fight the ruling in court à la Diego Pavia if the NCAA turns down his request.\nChambliss is a Division II transfer who played four seasons at Ferris State, and his argument exists on the grounds that Division I redshirt rules differ from those of Division II. The eighth-place finisher in Heisman Trophy voting argues that he should receive a retroactive redshirt for the 2022 season because he played in just two games that year. DI permits players to redshirt once -- so long as they play in no more than four regular-season games.If the NCAA approves a sixth year for Chambliss, he will return to Ole Miss with an 11-2 record as the Rebels' starter. After taking over for Austin Simmons early in the year, he orchestrated a stellar offense with 3,937 passing yards, 22 touchdowns to just three interceptions and another 527 yards and eight scores on the ground. That is an immense amount of returning production for an offense that will also welcome back All-American running back Kewan Lacy.Pete Golding tasked with reconstructing coaching staffKiffin took six assistant coaches with him to LSU, but Golding kept most of the defensive staff intact and is expected to retain his own defensive play-calling duties in 2026. As an internal hire himself, he had the benefit of overseeing at least some continuity in his first few days as head coach. That some of the LSU-bound assistants remained on staff for the CFP run added a unique wrinkle and an element of turmoil, but with that now in the past, Golding's primary focus can turn to finding permanent offensive coaches.\nPatrick Toney is in as co-defensive coordinator. Running backs coach Frank Wilson came over from LSU. The Rebels also announced a handful of hires to the player personnel department. But the work is not done.Identifying and hiring the right candidates on the offensive side of the ball is of critical importance for Golding, who is now a first-time head coach with no experience coaching anything but defense. The returning talent on the Ole Miss offense is too elite to waste.Are the Rebels' new expectations sustainable?Ole Miss raised its own bar during the Kiffin era, wherein 10-win seasons became the norm after being few and far between for the vast majority of the program's history. The Rebels won 13 games this season for the first time ever, made their CFP debut, climbed into the top 10 of the AP Top 25 for the fifth straight season and were just two wins away from a national championship. That is an unprecedented amount of success.\nEvery time a coach not named John Vaught posted a double-digit win total at Ole Miss, a period of mediocrity ensued shortly thereafter. Golding has a longstanding trend to buck. He is off to a strong start having beaten a pair of playoff teams and severely threatening another, but he did so with Kiffin's players and a staff that he, for the most part, did not hire. Can he repeat these achievements as the face of the program?It would be one thing for Golding to prevent the floor from falling out from underneath the Rebels. To keep this program in SEC and national title contention is a completely different question and one that, frankly, only time will answer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after a standout junior season, he announced. Reese is the No. 6 overall player in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and projects as a potential top-10 pick.\"Want to say thank you to coach (Ryan) Day and coach Mick (Mickey Marotti) for believing in me and for everything they poured into me,\" Reese wrote on social media. \"Thank you to the entire strength and conditioning staff who pushed me, challenged me, and prepared me for the next level. ... I want to thank all of Buckeye Nation. It was truly an honor to suit up in the Scarlet and Grey. The love and support from this fan base is unmatched.\"I am looking forward to representing my family and my school in the 2026 NFL Draft.\"Reese finished 2025 by recording 69 total tackles (34 solo) with 6.5 sacks. Reese was a finalist for the Butkus Award, which honors the top linebacker in college football. The Ohio State standout is the second-highest-ranked defender in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings behind Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr.\nIn Reese's final game at Ohio State against Miami in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl, he finished with seven total tackles. The Buckeyes lost to the Hurricanes 24-14, which ended their pursuit of winning back-to-back national titles.Reese's NFL Draft stockReese is the No. 6 overall prospect and the top-ranked linebacker in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. However, he could go higher in the draft than his ranking. CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner mocked Reese at No. 4 to the Tennessee Titans earlier this week.\"The Titans have plenty of needs, with wide receiver and edge rusher chief among them,\" Renner wrote. \"I lean edge here, given how consistently teams can find receiving talent later in the draft, but it wouldn't be surprising if Carnell Tate were the pick instead. Arvell Reese, though, is more of a wildcard -- a traits-based projection with high-end upside as a pass rusher. He's a modern hybrid linebacker who would add pass-rushing juice from anywhere on the Titans' front seven.\"\nAnother analyst, Ryan Wilson, mocked Reese at No. 2 to the New York Giants.\"An explosive, high-motor LB with a versatile skill set that includes elite closing speed vs. both the run and the pass,\" Wilson wrote. \"He is a terror coming downhill, showcasing his strength and athleticism to shoot gaps, shed blocks and collapse the pocket. Reese is a wrap-up tackling machine who consistently plays with an aggressive edge and the versatility to line up across the front seven. One of the biggest risers over the first month of the college season.\"Impact on Ohio StateReese declaring for the draft should not come as a surprise to the Buckeyes. There is a very real possibility that Reese will be the first non-quarterback selected. In Wilson's latest mock draft, Reese was one of four Ohio State players selected in the first round.Replacing that level of talent won't be easy, but Ohio State is primed to reload for next season on the defensive side of the football. The Buckeyes will not only have to replace Reese, but also standout linebacker Sonny Styles as well, who also projects as a first-round pick.\nOhio State is already busy trying to find its replacements. The Buckeyes landed a commitment from former Wisconsin linebacker Christian Alliegro, who is the No. 146 overall player and the 10th-ranked linebacker in the 247Sports transfer rankings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 6 Ole Miss lost a heartbreaker against No. 10 Miami 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl, costing the Rebels a shot at the program's first-ever national title game appearance. But while the Hurricanes are heading to the national title game, contact on the final Hail Mary attempt will leave many fans wondering what could have been. Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss put his cape on in perhaps his final appearance with the Rebels, connecting for consecutive passes of 23 and 17 yards to reach the Miami 35-yard line. Both teams called a timeout with six seconds remaining, knowing that the next play would likely be the final one in Phoenix. Chambliss dropped back, backpedaling to buy time and then targeted receiver De'Zhaun Stribling in the corner of the end zone. Stribling got a hand on the ball, but was unable to reel it in through multiple defenders. He quickly put his hands in the air in protest. \nAs Stribling made his way down the field, Miami cornerback Ethan O'Connor seemed to hold onto his pads. Stribling's jersey moved due to O'Connor's pull, and Stribling pushed back against O'Connor's face. O'Connor also appeared to pull down as the ball reached the end zone. \nOle Miss players after the play looked to the officials with confusion, expecting a flag, but none came. \nESPN rules analyst Bill LeMonnier was asked about the play on the broadcast. Despite the fighting and pulling, he agreed with the decision to not throw a flag and let the game end. \"When we have mutual combat, we're going to leave that alone 99% of the time,\" LeMonnier said. \nOn the day, Miami was the more penalized team, committing 10 violations for 74 yards. Ole Miss was more disciplined, called for only four for 34 yards. During one key sequence, the Hurricanes committed a pass interference and a late hit in consecutive plays, pushing Ole Miss into the red zone. However, they only escaped with a field goal. It's also worth noting that the game was officiated by a neutral Big Ten crew. Miami quarterback Carson Beck led a legacy-defining drive in the waning seconds of regulation, running for a touchdown with only 18 seconds remaining. The Hurricanes are now set to play in their first national championship game since 2002. The title game is taking place at Hard Rock Stadium, the same venue where the Hurricanes play their home games. For Ole Miss, much of the coaching staff is set to leave for LSU after former coach Lane Kiffin left before the College Football Playoff. Pete Golding was promoted to head coach before the postseason, and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. remained to call plays. With this result, Weis's tenure in Oxford is over. \n            ",

The Rebels defeated Tulane and Georgia during the first round and quarterfinals, respectively, during their first CFP appearance in program history.The Rebels certainly made the most of their first trip to the CFP despite some drama. Ole Miss coach Pete Golding, who took over after Lane Kiffin departed for LSU, won his first two games at the helm of the program. Despite Kiffin's departure, he still had a strong rooting interest for his old team.Despite Kiffin no longer being with the program, he still benefited financially from the Rebels' playoff run. That's because, as part of the agreement of Kiffin leaving Ole Miss before its CFP run, LSU agreed to pay his playoff bonuses if the Rebels kept advancing.Kiffin earned $250,000 from LSU on New Year's Day thanks to the Rebels' win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. That came in addition to the $250,000 he made on their win over Tulane in the first round for a cool $500,000 payday. Kiffin was set to earn up to $1 million had Ole Miss run the table and won the national title.\n\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin's return to Ole Miss with LSU set for September 2026 as SEC releases complete football schedule\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe former Ole Miss coach signed a seven-year deal worth $91 million in Baton Rouge, which comes with opportunities to earn more via incentives, according to records obtained by The Advocate. Before incentives, Kiffin will make $13 million per year. One of the escalators in Kiffin's contract requires a raise to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship, according to the Advocate.\n            \n    ",

The Hurricanes will face the winner of No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami for college football's ultimate prize.The Hurricanes went on a 15-play, 75-yard drive that lasted 2:55 and resulted in a 3-yard touchdown run by quarterback Carson Beck. Ole Miss had one final chance to pull off an upset on the last play of the game, but the pass in the end zone was incomplete.Despite being guaranteed to be the worst seed in the title game, Miami will actually be playing at its own stadium for the right to win its first national title since 2001. That's because Hard Rock Stadium was chosen as the site for the CFP title game back in 2022. The city of Miami will host the title game for the second time this decade and the first time since hosting Alabama's win over Ohio State back in 2021.\nAlthough it's rare for a college or professional team to play for a title at their home stadium, it's not unheard of. During the 2020 season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs to win their second Super Bowl title. The Buccaneers won the Super Bowl inside Raymond James Stadium, although attendance was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The following year, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium to win their second Super Bowl title in franchise history. Before that, no team in NFL history had played for the Super Bowl title inside its home stadium.\nNext year's CFP title game will take place in Las Vegas. UNLV plays its home games at Allegiant Stadium in Sin City, which would be the next opportunity for a college football team to accomplish the same feat as Miami. Due to the circumstances -- and the fact that Miami plays its home games inside an NFL stadium -- it might be quite some time before a college football team matches this feat.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        If you asked PGA Tour players to define their biggest weaknesses, you would wind up getting myriad different answers: some based on feel, some based on numbers, some based on imagination and some based on what they have accomplished in the past and the heights to which they have previously soared.Weakness is all relative, of course. A historically good driver of the golf ball who experienced a down season in that area may still have a long-term perspective on his skill set. The same holds up and down the bag. On the other end of the spectrum, players may view certain parts of the game as a lost cause, almost with hopes of occasionally strong weeks complementing the cornerstones of their game.Let's take a look at where players may have dipped in 2025 -- both from a short-term standpoint and from a \"he really needs to fix this\" point of view. Were they just down years and not the beginnings (or continuations) of downward trends?Viktor Hovland's drivingThe best iron season of Hovland's career -- he finished second to Scottie Scheffler in terms of strokes gained approach in 2025 -- was met with the worst driving season of his career. Oh, golf, such a fickle game. The former FedEx Cup champion lamented throughout the season that the big stick was in an uncomfortable spot, and it is not a stretch to say it was one of the reasons why he did not win the U.S. Open, where he finished solo third.\n\"Yeah, a little bitter about my driver,\" Hovland said at Oakmont. \"Just can't seem to figure it out. It's like a lingering problem all this year, so it's kind of pissing me off.\"But where exactly did things go wrong with Hovland off the tee?Hovland's driving statisticsCategoryValueRankStrokes gained: Off the tee0.09983rdDriving distance303.387thDriving accuracy63.13%58thLeft rough tendency9.09%4thRight rough tendency14.39%74thDistance from edge of fairway25' 6\"56thBall speed173.95101stClub head speed115.64107thThe biggest takeaway from above? Hovland moved in the wrong direction in terms of speed. In his memorable 2023 season, the Norwegian had an additional 4 mph at his disposal in terms of average ball speed and 3 mph in club head speed. Coincidentally, the faster he swung, the more accurate his ball flew within a tighter window.Some of this regression could be due to injury -- Hovland had to withdraw from Sunday singles at the Ryder Cup due to a nagging neck injury that popped up at the Travelers Championship -- or less speed training in general. No matter the cause, the effect handcuffed him at various points in the year.Bryson DeChambeau's iron playDeChambeau has never been the best iron player in the world, but he has always been capable of piecing together high-end performances. In 2025, he never really did that outside of a LIV Golf event in Korea, which doubled as his only victory of the season.On the major stage, the two-time U.S. Open champion was held back by this area of his game. It was a significant reason why he was unable to hold onto his lead Sunday at the Masters after grabbing it two holes into the final round, and it is why he fell off the pace Saturday at the PGA Championship.It just was not good enough, and at those venues, it was exposed.DeChambeau attempted to rectify the situation -- he replaced his 3D-printed Avoda blades that made noise at the 2024 Masters with a new set from LA Golf ahead of the U.S. Open and played a different golf ball in hopes of producing less spin. The results weren't necessarily there in the second half of the summer, but the thinking is and with a full offseason of tinkering under his belt, DeChambeau will have something up his sleeve for 2026.Collin Morikawa's short gameMorikawa's obsession with hitting the fade is so deep that he asked Santa Claus for it on Christmas. Seriously. Who knows if he got it under his tree, but it won't matter if his short game does not take a step in the right direction. It's true that Morikawa's iron play is not as good as it was in 2020 and 2021 when he won two major championships, two other PGA Tour events and the DP World Tour Championship, but it is not that far off.He still ranked third on the PGA Tour in strokes gained approach this year behind only Scheffler and Hovland. That is a place where he can do damage, but if he wants to win big tournaments -- which he has not done since the 2023 Zozo Championship ... err ... Baycurrent Classic -- he needs more than just his iron play.To keep up with Scheffler, McIlroy and DeChambeau, Morikawa needs the entire arsenal. He lacks length and does not seem intent on chasing any, so his path to victory is slimmer, and it tightens even more with the state of his short game. Ceiling performances are still there when everything clicks, but the floor drops from underneath him when his fade isn't fading.In 2025, Morikawa experienced the worst total strokes gained season of his career in large part because it was his second-worst around-the-green campaign and his second-worst on them. This comes just one year after he put together his second-best total strokes gained season -- better than 2020 and 2021 -- thanks to his best season both on and around the green. So, why wasn't it his best, then? Because he had his worst approach year. But with his irons back in tow, that should no longer be a worry. Instead, the focus should be on how he can improve chipping, pitching and putting.Xander Schauffele's puttingSchauffele's driving numbers are a bit noisy from a statistical standpoint. His return from injury came at a point in the schedule that featured some of the most difficult driving courses on the PGA Tour, and oh yeah, he put a new driver in the bag as well.That's a lot of variables to juggle, but where Schauffele seriously fell short was another spot where the variables were at a minimum: on the putting surface. This past season marked the first time in his career that he bled strokes to his PGA Tour counterparts with the putter in hand. He ranked 139th overall, lost almost 0.20 strokes per round and even switched putters during the postseason for a hot second.Strokes gained: Putting by yearYearSG: PuttingRank2025-0.184139th20240.51012th20230.6675th20220.34332nd20210.48016th20200.36633rd20190.24446th20180.19666th20170.40227thMuch like how driving can set up a player, putting bleeds into the rest of one's games. If putting stalls, well, it is more difficult to score, more difficult to scramble, and players are less likely to get up-and-down from greenside bunkers. Schauffele is a prime example of this. In 2024 -- albeit in the best season of his career -- he ranked first on the PGA Tour in scrambling and 12th in strokes gained putting. This past year, again, he ranked 139th in putting and 136th in scrambling. His conversion rate dipped from 71% to 58%. His sand-save percentage dropped by about 5%, too. One-putt percentage by the same clip.These are all numbers about his saves, but scoring figures paint a similar picture. He averaged about two fewer birdies per tournament and played the par 3s and par 4s in an over-par fashion. This came after a season where he led the PGA Tour in par-3 scoring and played the par 4s under par. If you're doing that, you're winning major championships or two in the case of Schauffele.There is good news, however. Schauffele surged past the field in his lone start of the FedEx Cup Fall to pick up a win in Japan. Although the numbers from the tournament were tracked incorrectly, based on the all-important eye test, Schauffele passed with flying colors on the greens. The same rang true at Bethpage Black where he was a bright spot for the U.S. team. There are myriad reasons to be bullish on Schauffele heading into 2026. His driving continually got better, his iron play remained sharp, and he proved in a different sense that he is tough as nails. Perhaps most important of all? He is not going to putt this poorly again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 12 matchup on 'Sunday Night Football' pits NFC contenders as the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Rams (8-2) are tied with Philadelphia for the best record in the conference and are riding a five-game win streak. L.A. knocked off Seattle, 21-19, in Week 11. Tampa (6-4) sits atop the NFC South but has dropped three of its last four, most recently falling to Buffalo, 44-32. The Rams have won eight of the last 10 matchups between the teams. The Bucs have ruled out Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), while receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) is active for the first time since Week 5.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The Bucs won the last matchup, 16-13, back in 2022. The latest Buccaneers vs. Rams odds have Los Angeles as 7-point home favorites. The over/under for total points scored is 49.5 via SportsLine consensus. L.A. is at -368 on the money line (risk $368 to win $100), with Tampa at +290 (risk $100 to win $290).

Despite the outcome versus Buffalo last week, Tampa did put up 32 points on the scoreboard, which is its second-most of the season, despite not having Godwin, and the Buccaneers could take advantage of a slumping pass for rush the Rams. L.A. hasn't recorded a defensive sack in back-to-back games and has just one QB takedown over its last three games. Los Angeles also gave up its second-most rushing yards of the year (135) last week versus Seattle, so there are defensive holes that Tampa's top-10 scoring offense can exploit. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverRecent spread results favor L.A. which is 4-1 ATS during its five-game win streak, while Tampa is just 1-3 ATS over its last four. Recent on the field results also tilt in favor of the Rams, who have won eight of the last 10 meetings between the teams, including in the postseason. This year, Matthew Stafford is the MVP favorite as he leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (27) for a Rams team which is well balanced on both sides of the ball. L.A. has the No. 6 scoring offense and the No. 2 scoring defense, making it one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. The Rams also boast the second-best turnover differential (+10) in the league and have the second-best ATS record at 7-3. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Buccaneers vs. Rams picksSportsLine's model has simulated Rams vs. Bucs 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

This is the second year in a row that the Wings have won the top pick. Last year they selected Paige Bueckers, who went on to win 2025 WNBA Rookie of the Year. Franchises winning the No. 1 pick in back-to-back years has become a trend in the WNBA over the last decade. The Wings are the fourth team to have back-to-back No. 1 picks since 2015, joining the Seattle Storm (2015, 2016), Las Vegas Aces (2017, 2018, 2019) and Indiana Fever (2023, 2024). The Wings had the best odds to receive the top pick at 42%, so it was no surprise when they won. In fact, the lottery wound up going chalk. The Minnesota Lynx will pick No. 2, followed by the Storm, Washington Mystics and Chicago Sky. Per the WNBA, this is the fifth time in league history that the lottery results matched the order of chances held by the lottery teams. 2026 WNBA Draft first round orderNote: The expansion Tempo and Fire will be slotted in after the lottery.

Spanish center Awa Fam has the most upside, but she is only 19 years old and no international player has gone No. 1 since Lauren Jackson in 2001. UCLA center Lauren Betts will also receive consideration for the top pick, and there are a number of talented guards, including TCU's Olivia Miles, who could play their way into the mix. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Mets figure to be big players in free agency this offseason (as they have been every offseason, lately), and they might have tipped their hand about which direction they are looking Sunday, trading long-time outfield stalwart Brandon Nimmo to the Rangers in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien.It's a big-name trade, but the impact for real life may revolve more around the fact that the Mets now have a wide open spot to chase after Kyle Tucker or another premier outfielder in free agency. For Fantasy Baseball, the impact might not be huge either, though it should make us a bit more open to the possibility of a bounceback season for Semien, at least. So that's where we'll start. Semien's Fantasy value seems to be in free fall. He finished as the No. 23 second baseman in Fantasy in 2025, and it wasn't just because he missed 35 games, his first time missing more than seven games in a season since 2017. Even when Semien was on the field, the play wasn't up to his usual standards. His strikeout rate creeped up to 17.4%, the highest it has been since 2021, and his overall line fell to .230/.305/.364, leading to the lowest wOBA of his career at .295, 11 points lower than his 2024 mark.But if you crack under the hood, things don't look quite as dire. Semien's athletic traits seem intact, to start with. He remains a very valuable defender, for example, and his sprint speed was still in the 81st percentile in 2025, right in line with his 2024 mark. His bat speed is also basically unchanged, going from 68.7 mph to 68.3 to 68.4 in the three seasons BaseballSavant.com has been tracking it. \nIn fact, Semien's damage on contact actually rebounded a bit last season. His xwOBA on contact was .341, up from .329 in 2024, and his average exit velocity moved in the same direction. The uptick in strikeout rate distracted from that, and likely stemmed from a slip in his contact skills. Given his age – Semien turned 35 midway through September – it doesn't make much sense to bet on a bounceback in that regard, even if his swing decisions and swing speed don't look much different than they did before.But there are a couple of reasons to think this trade could lead to better days for Semien, or at least a more gentle final decline phase for his career. For one thing, Semien actually underperformed his expected stats in 2025, putting up that .295 wOBA with a .318 xwOBA; for his career, Semien has overperformed his expected wOBA by about 10 points. And he might be more likely to do so by getting out of Globe Life Field, where he had a .277 wOBA last season compared to a .311 mark on the road. Citi Field, the Mets' home, isn't necessarily a great place to hit, ranking 21st in park factor for hitters over the past three seasons; Globe Life Field ranks second-to-last ahead of only Seattle. You certainly shouldn't expect a vintage Semien season in 2026, or anything. He'll likely continue to be a big drain on your batting average even in a best-case scenario, and you're probably looking at a ceiling of 25 homers. But he could run more in New York to go along with a potential bounce back in overall hitting, making him a reasonable candidate for a top-12 ranking at a weak second base position. \nAs for Nimmo, he was clearly the better hitter in 2025, and his ability to get on base is something the Rangers could really benefit from at the top of the lineup. However, despite being a few years younger than Semien, there are some bigger red flags in his athletic profile that make the possibility of a steep drop off in the coming years pretty scary. I'm not necessarily projecting that for 2025, and as a No. 3 outfielder, he remains a decent bet for Fantasy.  But it's not like there's a ton of upside to get excited about here, and with a downgrade both in his home ballpark and lineup, it's fair to discount Nimmo a bit. He's still in that No. 3 outfielder range, but if you want to push him down to around 40th or so, I wouldn't complain to much – I would rather take the bet on Jakob Marsee, Jurickson Profar, or Mike Trout, to name just three outfielders currently being drafted behind Nimmo in very early ADP. Ultimately, it's a slight upgrade for Semien and a slight downgrade for Nimmo, but not an earth-shattering deal either way. The earth may start to tremble a bit if the Mets take advantage of the newfound hole in a corner outfield spot by chasing Tucker in free agency, as I suspect they now will. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season is headed toward crunch time. As we wind down in Week 12, only six full weeks of regular-season action remain until the start of the playoffs. That means, while the postseason picture is far from finalized, the race for playoff berths -- and top seeding -- is well underway.Some preseason favorites like the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles are well on their way to the dance. Others, like the reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs and defending AFC South champion Houston Texans, are on the outside looking in, but making a late push. Meanwhile a slew of surprise contenders, from the New England Patriots to the Denver Broncos to the Indianapolis Colts, are currently challenging for the right to an early-playoff bye.Where, exactly, do all the playoff contenders sit? Which teams would be in the postseason if the schedule were halted today? And which clubs still have a shot to sneak into the mix down the stretch? Below is an updated rundown of the entire playoff picture, complete with remaining schedules for primary contenders:Complete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:\nAFC standingsNew England Patriots (10-2)Denver Broncos (9-2)Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Baltimore Ravens (6-5)Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (10-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Giants, vs. Bills, @ Ravens, @ Jets, vs. DolphinsDrake Maye is still on an MVP-caliber run as the face of Mike Vrabel's lineup, and the remaining slate sets them up well for the Patriots' first AFC East title since Tom Brady's final season with the club in 2019. Three of the Pats' final five opponents have losing records, and three of those five fall within the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (9-2)Remaining schedule: @ Commanders, @ Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, @ Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver is buoyed by Bo Nix's late-game composure and a stellar defense led by Vance Joseph. Dates with the rival Chiefs and Chargers in the final two weeks of the season will likely determine whether the Broncos can rob Kansas City of its 10th straight division crown. But this group is all but a lock to play January ball.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, @ Jaguars, @ Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, @ TexansCan Daniel Jones rediscover the early-year efficiency that made him a stunning breakout? He'll have to do so against some stingy defenses down the stretch, with almost every one of Indianapolis' remaining opponents boasting a top 10 scoring \"D.\" Accordingly, the Colts might be the safest bet to slip in these standings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Baltimore Ravens (6-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals, vs. Steelers, @ Bengals, vs. Patriots, @ Packers, @ Steelers\nLamar Jackson hasn't exactly lit it up since returning from a hamstring injury, so it stands to reason he's still feeling the effects of said issue. Fortunately for Baltimore, the defense has turned a major corner since October, putting the team in decent position to stay ahead of, or at least keep pace with, the slumping Pittsburgh Steelers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, @ Chiefs, @ Cowboys, vs. Texans, @ BroncosAmong the current wild card contenders, the Chargers might be in the most danger of losing their spot entirely. The Raiders in Week 13 should be very beatable. Otherwise, however, the Bolts will be up against some of the NFL's best defenses while struggling to keep Justin Herbert comfortable behind a depleted offensive line.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Remaining schedule: @ Titans, vs. Colts, vs. Jets, @ Broncos, @ Colts, vs. TitansThe mercurial Jaguars roared back to life in Week 11 by smashing the Chargers and escaped with an OT win against the Cardinals in Week 12. They've got a very favorable schedule moving forward. Two dates with the rival Titans bodes well for Liam Coen's squad, as does a matchup with the Jets.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (7-4)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. Jets\nJosh Allen is still capable of playing Superman, as evidenced in Buffalo's Week 11 win over Tampa Bay. But Sean McDermott's defense has been more volatile. New England may be out of reach atop the AFC East, but the Bills have a relatively clear path to a wild card berth if they can claim three or four of their final six matchups.In the huntThe Texans (6-5) aren't to be written off in the South despite C.J. Stroud's recent absence, with DeMeco Ryans' defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL. The Chiefs (6-5) finally rediscovered their late-game flair against the Colts in Week 12, but can Patrick Mahomes and Co. straighten out the offense? And the Steelers (6-5) have bigger issues than Aaron Rodgers now battling a wrist injury, with Mike Tomlin's defense a boom-or-bust operation.NFC standingsLos Angeles Rams (8-2)Philadelphia Eagles (8-3)Chicago Bears (8-3)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4)Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Green Bay Packers (7-3-1)San Francisco 49ers (7-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (8-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Buccaneers, @ Panthers, @ Cardinals, vs. Lions, @ Seahawks, @ Falcons, vs. Cardinals\nMatthew Stafford is slinging it with as much, if not more, confidence than he did in his title-winning Rams debut. That means L.A. is poised to feast on lesser clubs like Carolina, Arizona and Atlanta moving forward. The real question is whether Sean McVay's group can also outduel heavyweights like the Bucs and Lions.2. Philadelphia Eagles (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, @ Chargers, vs. Raiders, @ Commanders, @ Bills, vs. CommandersThe reigning Super Bowl champions are more rugged than explosive, but Vic Fangio's defense was playing lights out before blowing a huge lead in a loss to the Eagles. The NFC's No. 1 seed is still within reach, but the Eagles have competition and face a huge showdown with the Bears in Week 13.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Chicago Bears (8-3)Remaining schedule: @ Eagles, @ Packers, vs. Browns, vs. Packers, @ 49ers, vs. LionsThe No. 3 seed is where bigger questions arise in both conferences. Chicago, after all, has not necessarily been a clean operation with Caleb Williams at the controls. But the unit keeps winning under Ben Johnson's watch. Now comes a slew of big tests against more formidable foes like Philly and Green Bay.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4)Remaining schedule: @ Rams, vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, @ Panthers, @ Dolphins, vs. Panthers\nEvery year, the Bucs scrape their way through the NFC South race, regardless of who's healthy around Baker Mayfield. The remaining schedule suggests a fifth straight division crown is well within reach, though Week 12's matchup with the Rams could be a better litmus test for how far Tampa Bay is poised to go in January.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, @ Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, @ Panthers, @ 49ersEven after falling to the rival Rams in Week 11, Seattle should hang around in the race for the NFC West title due to Mike Macdonald's physical defense. It helps the Seahawks have a couple upcoming matchups with young and/or replacement quarterbacks; Week 13's date with Sam Darnold's old friends in Minnesota should be spicy.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Green Bay Packers (7-3-1)Remaining schedule: @ Lions, vs. Bears, @ Broncos, @ Bears, vs. Ravens, @ VikingsRaise your hand if you expected them to be trailing the Bears at this point in the year. Matt LaFleur's offense has been more scattershot than usual, but the NFC North is still up for grabs with four divisional matchups still on tap. We expect this group in the postseason one way or another. But it'll still be a fight.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. San Francisco 49ers (7-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, @ Browns, vs. Titans, @ Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksBrock Purdy finally returned in Week 11, taking over for long-term substitute Mac Jones, and San Francisco's attack hit new heights. All year, the 49ers have hung around, though, and now their defense should get some confidence-boosting matchups by facing three straight inferior clubs in Carolina, Cleveland and Tennessee.In the huntThe Lions (7-4) are probably out of the mix for the No. 1 seed they held a year ago, but Dan Campbell's unit still has too much talent on both sides of the ball to be written off, as Jahmyr Gibbs' explosive Week 12 proved. The Panthers (6-5) have an outside chance to leapfrog the Bucs in the South if Bryce Young can find a way to stay steady under center.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Top-10 scoring offenses meet on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at SoFi Stadium at 8:20 p.m. ET. It should be a fertile setting for offense with Los Angeles averaging 27.2 points per game, while Tampa Bay averages 25.2 points. The NFL DFS player pool for this showdown slate includes big names like Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Baker Mayfield and Emeka Egbuka.Injuries are a factor, especially for Tampa Bay, with Mike Evans (collarbone) and Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) both out. However, Chris Godwin (fibula) is active for the first time since Week 5, though he is expected to be on a snap count. How should that impact your NFL DFS lineups?

One of the top receivers in the league, the third-year pro out of BYU has put together a 73-850-4 receiving line thus far despite missing a game due to injury. He's found the end zone in four of his past six games, and the Rams added a new wrinkle last week as he took two carries as well, and he already ran for a 45-yard touchdown earlier this season. The Bucs rank 21st in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers, setting up a golden opportunity for Nacua to return value in this spot. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bucs tight end Cade Otton. He had a quiet day last week against the Bills, but he's just two weeks removed from a big 9-82 day against the Patriots. He hasn't been targeted less than five times in his past six games, and with Mike Evans still on injured reserve, Otton will likely continue to be a big target that Mayfield can lean on, especially since the Rams have allowed three TE touchdowns over the last three weeks. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Buccaneers vs. RamsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "description": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are now 90 minutes from their first MLS Cup appearance in their history after defeating FC Cincinnati 4-0 at TQL",
    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are now 90 minutes from their first MLS Cup appearance in their history after defeating FC Cincinnati 4-0 at TQL Stadium on Sunday. As has been the case during the playoffs, the Herons have been able to lean on their talisman in Messi, who opened the scoring with a header in the first half before he added a hat trick of assists, being involved in all four goals. That's his sixth goal of the MLS Cup playoffs so far, but this game was far from a solo effort by the Argentine. \nWith Luis Suarez available following his suspension, manager Javier Mascherano was left with an important choice of putting him back in the lineup or continuing on with 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti. Mascherano continued with Silvetti, and he put in a professional performance, assisting Messi's opening goal before adding to Miami's lead with a lovely finish of his own to make it 2-0. With only six appearances for Inter Miami following his move from Newell's Old Boys in August, you would've thought that Silvetti was leading the line the entire season with how his movement synced up with Messi and Tadeo Allende while Suarez looked on from the bench.As Suarez is 38, we could be seeing the future of the nine for Inter Miami taking hold in the playoffs now. Silvetti already has a goal and two assists in two playoff appearances, and it'd be hard for Mascherano to take him out of the XI with the Eastern Conference final on the line. Miami have yet to win a trophy this season, so capping things off with an MLS Cup title would be a sweet way to end the season, and there's a chance that they may be able to continue things at Chase Stadium to also close the stadium out on a high with the new Miami Freedom Park set to open in 2026.\nIf New York City FC defeat the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night, Miami will not only host the Eastern Conference final, but they'll have hosting priority for the remainder of the playoffs due to having more points in the Supporters' Shield standings than any of the remaining teams outside of the Union. If the Union win, they'd host the final.Playing home or away hasn't been an issue for the Herons, who have found their balance during these playoffs. New the end of the season, Mascherano gave Rocco Rios Novo the starting job at goalkeeper over Oscar Ustari, and he has run away with it, and when it has mattered, key decisions by the manager have made the difference. Miami have gone more than 200 minutes without conceding a goal during the playoffs, and changes such as Rios Novo are the reason behind that.\n Messi may be what powers this team, evident by being invovled in every Miami goal this postseason, but for the supporting cast to keep him in the playoffs, Mascherano has done an excellent job responding to adversity. This win also extends the careers of Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, who will retire at the end of the season, while giving Evander and FC Cincinnati a long offseason to think about the opportunities missed during this playoff run. But Miami will march on with nothing but winning the MLS Cup on their minds. With Messi's supporting cast on all cylinders, they just may get there too.\n            ",

They're behind the Philadelphia Eagles in the race for the conference's top seed by virtue of a head-to-head loss, but they are tied for the best record in the NFC. They have a chance to keep the good times rolling here, as a win would mark their six consecutive victory since they lost two out of three in Weeks 3 through 5.Bet Buccaneers vs. Rams at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Tampa has lost two in a row and three of its last four and has seen its lead in the NFC South cut to just a half-game. The Bucs remain banged up, with Mike Evans and Bucky Irving, among others, still out for this game and with no firm timeline for their respective returns. The have a significantly softer stretch of schedule coming up to end the season, with this being the toughest game remaining on their schedule.\nWill the Rams continue stacking wins, or will the Bucs get back on the horse? We'll find out soon enough. But before we give you a few key things to know about the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Rams vs. Bucs liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETWhere: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NBC Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -6.5; O/U 49.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet Rams vs. Bucs and other NFL Week 12 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager.\nRams vs. Bucs: Need to knowStafford set up for success: The Bucs have a pass-funnel defense that is far better against the run than it is against the pass, which typically pushes opponents into pass-happy game plans. The Bucs are second in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and only 20th in passing success rate. With Puka Nacua in the slot and Davante Adams on the outside, the Rams have two obvious passing-game mismatches. This game sets up well for Stafford. Bucs looking to bounce back: Tampa has lost two in a row to AFC East opponents, falling in back-to-back games to the Patriots and the Bills. When you go back to before their bye, they have lost three of their last four, with the lone win during that stretch coming against the Saints. (They also lost to the Lions.) They have wins over the Seahawks and Niners this year, but of late they have struggled against the high-level teams. They have a chance to reverse that trend here before moving into a stretch run where they won't be tested with nearly as tough of matchups. Important injuries: Not only are Mike Evans and Bucky Irving out for Tampa, but Quentin Lake is out for Los Angeles after suffering a dislocated elbow and heading to injured reserve. The Bucs could also be without both Jamel Dean and Haason Reddick, so they're not just banged up on offense.\n        \n            \n                Week 12 NFL QB Power Rankings: Broncos' Bo Nix nears top 10; Browns' Shedeur Sanders debuts\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRams vs. Bucs pick, prediction\nThe Buccaneers always seem to find a way to score -- even against the best defenses, of which the Rams are one. But their own defense is a significant pass funnel (i.e., it's easier to throw against them than it is to run), and that's dangerous against a team with Matthew Stafford playing at as high a level as he's hit in nearly every game this year. I think the Rams win this one, but the Bucs, as is their wont, either keep it close or find a way to backdoor cover. Prediction: Rams 31, Bucs 26\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The staff was informed of the decision in the afternoon. The Golden Bears are 6-5 this season but just suffered an embarrassing 31-10 loss to rival Stanford in Week 13. Former Washington State coach Nick Rolovich, currently a senior offensive assistant with the Bears, will be the interim head coach, per a source. \nIt's been an uneven year overall for Cal. It began the season 3-0 with a lot of momentum thanks to the presence of freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele. Things have been much more uneven since, however. The Bears were blown out 34-0 by San Diego State in nonconference play, and they're just 3-4 on the season in the ACC. Wilcox, 49, was once considered one of the top up-and-coming coaches on the West Coast -- so much so he was a candidate for Oregon when Mario Cristobal left the program following the 2021 season. It's been a difficult run for Wilcox in the time since. The Bears haven't produced a winning season since 2019, and they're just 22-27 over the last four seasons. \nCal currently has a pair of interim athletic directors. It's expected that general manager Ron Rivera will have a large say in the upcoming coaching search to replace Wilcox. \n            \n    ",

But it does happen. And my official guess: It happens this week for a third time this season when the rankings refresh on Monday. And again, it will be Purdue that loses the No. 1 spot despite remaining undefeated, if indeed voters make the switch.The preseason No. 1 Boilermakers fell from No. 1 to No. 2 in Week 2 despite a 2-0 start with double digit wins over Evansville and Oakland -- surmounted by then-No. 2 Houston jumping one spot. Purdue reclaimed the No. 1 ranking last week after defeating Alabama and Akron. But they're positioned to fall back from No. 1 again, as you can gather by this predictive diatribe now, despite a perfect 2-0 week that featured wins over Memphis and Texas Tech.\nArizona's just been that good. Two wins over top-25 teams were on its resume entering the week after defeating then-No. 3. Florida on opening day and No. 15 UCLA last week, good enough to potentially give it the best resume in the sport. That put the Wildcats at No. 4 in last week's rankings. A true road win Wednesday over No. 3 UConn has them poised to leap again. And there should be no doubt about which team has the best resume in college basketball.I don't think it'll be unanimous, to be clear. Voters who had Purdue at No. 1 may keep it at No. 1, the idea being you have to quite literally lose a game to lose the No. 1 ranking. Houston and Duke may even continue to earn first-place votes. But at the very least, Arizona, which earned two first-place votes last week, will have at least significantly cut into Purdue's grip at No. 1, if not outright taking the spot.\nI'm just the messenger. That's not my argument nor how I'd necessarily approach the topic. But every week I predict how AP voters will react to the week's results. And that -- along with the below top 25 -- is my official prediction.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Two wins over teams ranked No. 3 and another win over a team ranked No. 15. Yeah, that'll do. It's the best resume in college basketball, and it should be enough to make the Wildcats No. 1 on Monday.

It has a road win over No. 8 Alabama and a weekend win in the Baha Mar championship over No. 15 Texas Tech, 86-56. Yes: Purdue blasted Texas Tech by 30 points.

Thitikul birdied the 10th and 13th holes, while her Thai friend dropped a shot on the par-3 12th to return the lead to five shots.\nFrom there, it was getting to the finish line and getting soaked with bubbly on the 18th green. She joins Jin Young Ko as the only back-to-back winners of the CME Group Tour Championship.Thitikul finished at 26-under 262 for a four-shot victory.The victory ensured that she will be named the LPGA Player of the Year and claim the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average, the two biggest awards in women's golf.\nKorda becomes the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2010 to go from a seven-win season to not winning the following year.\n            \n    ",

Since finishing 9-4 overall and finding a spot inside the final AP Top 25 poll to conclude the 2021 season, the Razorbacks sputtered under Pittman's guidance despite a bevy of coaching staff changes and roster alterations annually in recruiting and through the transfer portal.       \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    James FranklinPenn State fired Franklin    six games into his 12th season with the Nittany Lions -- amid a disastrous three-game slide. The No. 2 team in the preseason AP Top 25 just two months ago, the Nittany Lions slipped to 0-3 in Big Ten play following a stunning 22-21 home loss to Northwestern in Week 7 -- a game in which they were a three-touchdown favorite. The massive upset was Penn State's second in a row after falling at previously winless UCLA on Oct. 4, making it the first FBS team since 1978 to lose back-to-back games as favorites of at least 20 points.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Trent DilferUAB moved on from Dilfer    six games into his third season with the Blazers.

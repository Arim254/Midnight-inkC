The Over has hit in seven of the last 10 Coastal Carolina games, including one push. The Over is 4-2 in the last six Louisiana Tech games. Coastal Carolina quarterback Samari Collier's status is uncertain after an injury late in the season, and the model has quarterback Tad Hudson, who could start if Collier doesn't play, passing for more than 195 yards passing and two touchdowns, while Louisiana Tech running back Omiri Wiggins will rush for nearly 80 yards and one touchdown. The teams are projected to combine for 57 points as the Over clears in nearly 60% of simulations. The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 70% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Louisiana Tech vs. Coastal Carolina, and which side of the spread hits in nearly 70% of simulations?

    "body": "\n        Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic sustained a left knee injury at the end of the first half during Monday night's game against the Miami Heat. The team ruled him out for the second half and the three-time MVP underwent an MRI Tuesday that confirmed a hyperextended left knee that will keep him out for at least four weeks. While losing Jokić for a month is far from ideal for the Nuggets, it's a far better outcome than a season-ending injury, which was part of the fear when he went to the ground grabbing at his knee. Jokić fell to the ground after making accidental contact with teammate Spencer Jones, who was guarding Jaime Jaquez Jr. Jokić immediately fell while grabbing his left knee after making contact with Jones. He was quickly surrounded by members of the team's training staff. \n\"Immediately, he knew something was wrong,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman told reporters after the game. \"Hey, this is part of the NBA. Anybody who gets hurt in this game, it's kind of gut-wrenching, especially somebody as special as he is. We'll find out more tomorrow. We'll move on as a team. Obviously, right now, I'm more concerned just about him as a person and the disappointment of going through something like that.\"\nJokić, 30, is in the midst of another MVP-caliber season. A three-time league MVP and the 2023 NBA Finals MVP, Jokić is averaging 29.9 points and is leading the league in both rebounds (12.4) and assists (11.1) per game for the Nuggets, who are off to a 22-10 start. His MVP candidacy is now in jeopardy due to the NBA's 65-game minimum for the award. Even a return shortly after the four-week re-evaluation would put him up against that minimum, and one would expect some injury management to be part of his return protocol on back-to-backs when he first gets back into the lineup. Bad luck would be better than the luck the Nuggets have had this year from an injury standpoint. Aaron Gordon is currently out with a hamstring injury, Cameron Johnson is expected to miss 4 to 6 weeks after injuring his knee earlier this month, and Christian Braun is out indefinitely after suffering a significant ankle sprain last month. \nNow they will be missing Jokić for a month, making for an extremely challenging January. The Nuggets are currently third in the West, but are just three games ahead of the Suns in the 7-seed. By the time Jokić returns, they may be battling to avoid the play-in rather than fighting for homecourt advantage in the first round. How they fare in his absence, which will shift an even greater burden onto Jamal Murray, may determine how they handle his return. They may view the All-Star break as an opportunity to steal Jokić an additional week of recovery, but that would be an absence of more than six weeks to reach that point. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the new year just around the bend, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Reds still hoping to add outfielderThe Reds have already this offseason added outfielder JJ Bleday via free agency and outfielder Dane Myers via trade. Even so, Cincy is still in the market for outfield help, the Athletic reports. The Reds are likely to do that via trade, and more specifically they'll look to deal from the rotation in order to get another outfielder to put in their mix for 2026 and beyond. The Reds are coming off a 2025 campaign in which they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in a full season since 2013. However, they claimed the third and final wild-card spot in the National League despite an offense that ranked 26th in the majors in OPS+. Marlins, Dodgers pull off minor tradeThe Marlins have acquired outfielder Esteury Ruiz from the Dodgers in exchange for right-handed prospect Adriano Marrero, Miami announced on Monday evening. To make room for Ruiz on the 40-player roster, the Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment. \nRuiz, 26, has a .639 OPS and a -1.2 WAR across parts of four MLB seasons. In 2023 as a member of the A's, he led the American League with 67 stolen bases. Marrero, 18, worked 33 innings in the Dominican Summer League last season, his first in professional baseball. Okamoto in U.S. as posting window nears endJapanese first baseman Kazuma Okamoto, in keeping with the rules of the MLB-NPB posting system, must sign by 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4., when his 45-day posting window closes. With the clock running out, Okamoto is now in the U.S. to visit interested teams in person, Yahoo Japan reports. The Pirates, Padres, and Angels have previously been reported to have some level of interest in Okamoto.\nWe ranked Okamoto, 29, as the 22nd-best free agent available this offseason. He's spent his entire career with the Yomiuri Giants and hit .322/.411/.581 with 15 home runs in 77 games around an injury to his non-throwing elbow in 2025. Okamoto has played third base most of his career, though he's seen more action at first in recent years, and is expected to stay there long-term.\n            ",

Diggs' attorneys appeared Tuesday in court.\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,\" the Patriots said in a statement. \"Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"Diggs is scheduled to be in court Friday, Jan. 23 for his arraignment. That date falls two days before the AFC Championship Game.  \"We are aware of the matter and have been in contact with the club,\" the NFL said in a statement. \"We have no further comment at this time.\"  \nThis news comes less than a week before New England caps its 2025 regular season at home against the Miami Dolphins. The 13-3 Patriots already clinched a spot in the NFL playoffs by winning the AFC East, and could still capture the No. 1 seed if they beat Miami and the Denver Broncos lose to the Los Angeles Chargers. Diggs is an important piece for New England as it eyes its first postseason run since 2021. He emerged as quarterback Drake Maye's favorite target in what represents his first season back from an ACL tear.The veteran Diggs, who has 970 yards receiving on the year, is just 30 yards away from becoming New England's first 1,000-yard receiver since Julian Edelman in 2019. He comes off a six-catch, 101-yard performance against the New York Jets. His 82 receptions for 970 yards are both team highs. \nDiggs is in the first year of a three-year contract worth $69 million. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana coach Curt Cignetti never minces words and delivered some of college football's most notable comments over his dominant, two-year stretch. From \"Google Me\" to not being surprised after a road win at Oregon, Cignetti's nature commands respect.Cignetti's boring-by-design, top-ranked and unbeaten Hoosiers are on the verge of battling blueblood Alabama for the first time in program history Thursday at The Rose Bowl. His players do not concern themselves with the Crimson Tide \"mystique\" coming in, he said.\"You probably know more about the mystique than they do,\" Cignetti said. \"Our guys just know what they see on tape.\"Blunt and succinct. The follow-up centered around the Hoosiers' path to College Football Playoff glory.\n\"The only goal right now is to have as good a day as we can today,\" Cignetti said. \"We've got progress to make in our preparation. When we get done today, this morning, with media, it's important we have a great day and that we have a realistic perspective what it takes to meet the challenge, gives us the best possibility. \"What you're talking about are things in the past, which I've probably fielded that question a hundred times, right? But it's a good question. It's great. There's a lot of excitement. But we're here to play in the playoff game and our 100 percent focus is on the here and now.\"The Alabama 'mystique'Alabama lost two of its final four regular-season games prior to the 34-24 win over Oklahoma in the CFP first round. Alabama trailed 17-0 in the first half of that one before Zabien Brown's interception return for a score late in the second quarter sparked a comeback.\nThere's nothing unnerving about an Alabama's rushing offense at 109.3 yards per game, which ranks 120th with inconsistent quarterback play. Only Texas Tech's Behren Morton brings a lower QBR than Ty Simpson, who did throw two touchdown passes in the CFP opener, among teams still left in the playoff.The Alabama \"mystique\" developed during Nick Saban's illustrious tenure, which included six national championship game appearances over a seven-year stretch at one point in the playoff era with three titles. The glamour deteriorated sometime thereafter after Alabama suffered two regular-season losses in 2022 and lost to Michigan at the goal line in overtime during a playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl in Saban's final game.Ironically, Alabama is back in that same setting this week, hoping to post its best win of the Kalen DeBoer era. The Crimson Tide have had a different look and overall makeup the last two years under their new coaching staff, a more finesse approach offensively and less aggression on the other side of the football.\nDeBoer did not appreciate Alabama receiving labels as soft after its season-opening loss at Florida State. Alabama responded by winning 10 of its next 11 games to reach the SEC Championship before a 21-point loss to Georgia brought the Crimson Tide to reality as the playoff's No. 9 seed.Cignetti's Hoosiers brought a far more predictable run to No. 1 with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza asserting himself as the frontrunner early after a win at Oregon and solidifying the honor with a final-second drive at Penn State and win over Ohio State in the Big Ten finale.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two months of the 2025-26 NBA season set up what could have been the greatest MVP race of all time. Nikola Jokić is currently on pace to set new single-season records for PER, BPM and Win Shares per 48 minutes. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ranks eighth, third and second all-time in those respective metrics, but is ahead of Jokić in EPM for the second consecutive season, which is relevant as EPM is the metric with by far the strongest predictive history when it comes to MVP. Looking for more straightforward measures of excellence? Jokić currently leads the NBA in both rebounds and assists while Gilgeous-Alexander's Oklahoma City Thunder are still on pace to go 70-12. Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging slightly less than one point per minute, which only Wilt Chamberlain and Joel Embiid (in just 39 games) have ever accomplished. Jokić is a couple of free throws shy of a 60-40-90 shooting season, which the NBA has never seen before. These are two of the greatest individual seasons of all time through two months.And yet, as things sit now, the MVP race between them is probably over. On Monday, Jokić suffered a knee injury that, in the moment at least, appeared potentially catastrophic. He was thankfully spared the worst outcomes. A hyperextended knee will keep him sidelined for at least a month, but it won't cost him the season. It will, however, almost certainly cost him a chance at a fourth MVP award.Jokić hasn't missed a game yet this season, playing in all 32 of Denver's contests to date, but let's say he's out until the end of January. The Nuggets have four back-to-backs in their January schedule, loading their slate with 18 total games between now and the beginning of February. That's the exact number of absences it takes to remove a player from award eligibility. If Jokić returns on Feb. 1, ironically against the Thunder, or any later, he's out of the MVP race. If he comes back sooner but misses games later on due to caution or other injuries, he'll fall out of the race. At this point, the odds of him playing 65 games are nearly zero.\nThat doesn't explicitly guarantee Gilgeous-Alexander wins MVP. He could get hurt too. But the gap between Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander and the eligible field is vast. Take EPM, the MVP predictor stat. Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league at +10.1. Jokić is second at +9.7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, who himself is almost certainly going to be ineligible having missed 13 games thus far, is third at +9. Nobody else is even a +6.Gilgeous-Alexander has the eighth-highest BPM of all time. The next best mark from this season belongs to Victor Wembanyama, who's ranked 115th. Luka Dončić is in third place for PER... at 95th all-time to Gilgeous-Alexander's third. I could give you 100 guesses and you'd probably never land on which current player comes the closest to Gilgeous-Alexander's second-place all-time Win Shares per 48 minutes ranking. It's Mark Williams... all the way down at 117th. In other words, there's a vast statistical canyon here. Gilgeous-Alexander is the NBA's second-leading scorer on the league's best team with all of the metrics in his favor. If he plays 65 games, he's going to win MVP.And that puts him in pretty rarified air. There are only 15 multi-time MVPs in league history, and of those 15, just 10 have reached two MVPs through their age-27 season: Bob Pettit, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokić. Not bad company to keep.\nHe would have two immediate obstacles to claiming a third. The first is history. No one since Larry Bird has won three straight MVPs. Not Jordan. Not James. Not Jokić. As we learned during Jokić's attempt at a third trophy, narratives swing hard against prospective three-peaters. And if Gilgeous-Alexander doesn't get his third next season, it gets far harder from there. Every MVP since James in 2012 has been between the ages of 24 and 28. The 2027-28 campaign will be Gilgeous-Alexander's age-29 season. The Thunder have already claimed back-to-back No. 1 seeds and are well on their way to a third, so it's possible that, by then, they're simply over the regular-season grind as an organization.But this is still a historically dominant scorer playing on a team that figures to be atop the league practically indefinitely. He's going to factor into most of the MVP races until the end of his prime and, as Jokić's injury this season shows, it doesn't take much to clear the field in the era of the 65-game minimum. Odds are, there's another MVP for Gilgeous-Alexander in here somewhere. The more he claims, the more unimpeachable his legacy becomes. There are nine three-time MVPs in history, five four-time winners, three five-time winners and a lone six-timer.For now, he's set up to win just his second trophy, but at this age and with this team, there's not really an upper-limit at play here. If he can make it through the next three months and change intact, Gilgeous-Alexander will already have more MVP trophies than Kobe Bryant. He'll match Stephen Curry, the player he's seemingly succeeded as the NBA's best point guard. And while championships are not assured, the Thunder are as well-positioned to compete for them moving forward as any team ever has been. \nIt's too early to really get into all-time rankings where Gilgeous-Alexander is concerned, but there are very, very few players who have ever accomplished what Gilgeous-Alexander is poised to do by the end of this season. We're watching an all-timer here, and if there's a silver lining to Jokić's injury, it's that it may well put Gilgeous-Alexander's greatness into perspective. He may be neck-and-neck with Denver's three-time MVP, but this year at least, he's head and shoulders above everyone else. For the next month or so, he will somewhat definitively be the NBA's best player and this spring, there's a trophy waiting to reward him for that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Baylor shook college basketball to its core with its midseason acquisition of former NBA Draft pick James Nnaji, who joined the Bears' roster on Christmas Eve and became eligible to play immediately. Don't blame Baylor coach Scott Drew, some anonymous coaches told CBS Sports, for simply acting within the NCAA rules with the controversial addition to his roster. Arkansas' John Calipari said the same when he went on the record in defense of Drew.But that doesn't mean Calipari is a fan of the move. On the contrary, he unleashed a seven-minute postgame diatribe against the NCAA's eligibility rules, questioning why Nnaji -- who spent the last four years in the EuroLeague -- and others with professional experience should be allowed to play college basketball in the first place.\"I don't blame coaches,\" Calipari said following No. 18 Arkansas' Monday win over James Madison. \"I've got friends that are playing with 27-year-olds and they feel bad. I said, 'Don't feel bad.' We don't have any rules. Why should you feel bad? Let me give you this, real simple: the rules bes the rules. If you put your name in the draft -- I don't care if you're from Russia -- and you stay in the draft, you can't play college basketball. Well, that's only for American kids. What? If your name is in that draft and you got drafted, you can't play, because that's our rule. But that's only for American kids. OK.\"Nnaji is the first player to join a college roster after being selected in the NBA Draft. The No. 31 overall pick in 2023 has not played an NBA game, though, which the NCAA compliance department concluded makes him eligible for competition.\nThis is far from the first instance of a student-athlete holding professional experience. Numerous college basketball players came to the United States after playing professionally overseas, and seemingly every year there is a case of a former professional athlete in one sport or another signing with a college program.Calipari argues that the eligibility loophole is a detriment to high school recruits.\"Does anybody care what this is doing for 17- and 18-year-old American kids?\" Calipari said. \"Do you know what this opportunity has done for them and their families? There aren't going to be any high school kids. Who other than dumb people like me are going to recruit high school kids? … I'm going to keep doing it. But why would anybody else if you can get NBA players, G League players, guys that are 28 years old, guys from Europe?\"\nWhat can be done to prevent these eligibility anomalies from becoming more mainstream? Calipari introduced a few potential measures. The first is that if a player leaves their name in the draft, they cannot play college basketball. Second, if a player joins a roster in the middle of the season, they must sit until the following year. The Arkansas coach also said that NIL collectives should not be involved in recruiting.Calipari called for a specific change to the transfer portal, as well.\"If your coach leaves or is fired, you can transfer without penalty,\" Calipari said. \"You can do it once. And if the coach is fired or leaves, you can end up doing it twice. But after that you gotta sit out.\"The NCAA has seen many of its eligibility rules across multiple sports challenged in court. Enforcing stricter regulations in college basketball would almost certainly come with pushback.\nTo that end, Calipari sent a message to the NCAA: \"Let them sue us.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nikola Jokić suffered a left knee hyperextension during the Nuggets' loss at Miami on Monday. That's good news, relatively speaking. There was legitimate fear of an ACL. The bad news is Jokić is expected to be out at least four weeks, and probably more than that as that is just the date for reevaluation. That changes quite a lot -- both for the Nuggets, who are currently sitting right on the West's 10-loss cut line for a top-four seed, and for what was shaping up to be a photo-finish MVP race.SGA is the runaway MVP leader nowJokić hasn't missed a single game this season, but with the Nuggets slated to play 16 games over the next 28 days, he'll finish with a maximum 66 games played. The cutoff for MVP is 65 games played. That mean Jokić would have to come back on the shortest timeline possible and not miss one game the rest of the season to be eligible for MVP. Not going to happen. This totally clears Gilgeous-Alexander's path to a second straight MVP (-450 to win, per BetMGM), and that would change his historic standing pretty considerably. Going from one to two MVPs is a big leap. Kobe Bryant never won a second. Neither did Shaq. Kevin Durant only has one. \nAll told, only 15 players in NBA history have won multiple MVPs, with 10 of them having won at least their second by the time they turned 27: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Jokić, Moses Malone, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tim Duncan and Bob Petit. If this happens, Gilgeous-Alexander would become the 16th to win at least two and the 11th to do so by the age of 27. With two MVPs, he would jump into the class of Curry, Duncan, Antetokounmpo and Petit and Steve Nash -- with a long runway in front of him and a team built to keep him in MVP position for years to come. Can a sleeper MVP emerge?It's unlikely if SGA stays healthy, but it's worth mentioning the guys who are now elevated into the tier where circumstances could break their way and they have one less hurdle to jump with Jokić out. These guys would include Cade Cunningham (+4000), Jalen Brunson (+6600) and Jaylen Brown (+25000), who are leading the top three teams in the East right now and are having absolutely incredible seasons. \nTyrese Maxey (+15000) is doing the same, but the Sixers almost certainly aren't going to win enough games to give him a real chance. In the West, Kevin Durant (+100000) and Alperen Sengun (+100000) would likely split each other's vote from Houston. Victor Wembanyama (+5000) has already missed 12 games, so he'll probably end up ineligible. Luka Doncic (+375) is the West's wild card. If the Lakers were to get red hot and take over Denver's spot in the standings as a top-three team, he could get some love if he puts up crazy numbers. Anthony Edwards (+20000) is someone to watch for the same reasons if the Wolves, currently No. 6, make a huge run. At the very least, all these guys are now in position to get higher votes than they were before Jokić went down. But again, something unforeseen would have to happen to SGA and/or the Thunder for someone else to actually win. \nWhere does this leave the Nuggets?This is the big question. Denver is currently No. 3 in the West but tied in the loss column with the No. 4 Rockets and No. 5 Lakers. As well as they've played, they're only three games above the play-in line in what is a bumper-to-bumper Western Conference race. If things go even a little off the rails over the 16 games Jokić is set to miss at a minimum, they could find themselves in a nasty fight for a top-six seed. The good news is the Nuggets have gotten marginally better with Jokić off the court than they have been dating back to the championship season, but let's keep this in proper perspective. They still struggle in a big way without him, as any team would absent the best player in the world.*Numbers per Cleaning the GlassSeasonNet rating without Jokić2025-26-8.22024-25-9.82023-24-11.12022-23-11.6Beyond the numbers, the Nuggets are equipped with more players who can scale up their offensive output this season. Jonas Valanciunas will slide into the starting center spot. Tim Hardaway Jr. can crank up. Cam Johnson has finally gotten on track from 3. Peyton Watson can play. Aaron Gordon is due back from injury soon. Jamal Murray is having the best regular season of his career. There's a big difference, however, in scoring the way Murray has with Jokić running the show and consuming so much attention and doing so as the No. 1 option on whom defenses will now be disproportionately focused. It doesn't bode well for the Nuggets that so far this year, when Murray has had to play without Jokić, they have been outscored by eight points per 100 possessions with what would rank as a bottom-five offense and defense, per CTG. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Constructing a college football roster is wildly different now than it was even three years ago, as the transfer portal, NIL and revenue sharing completely reshaped the way coaches and programs must operate. There are plenty of teams that use the ability to (legally) pay players and the portal to their advantage, but the newness of everything related paying players and the lack of regulations in college football, due to the ever-weakening NCAA, created a number of challenges. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian detailed one major problem he hopes to see addressed after a reporter asked about how he approaches building through the portal. Texas doesn't have much issue with investment or resources, but Sarkisian explained that the lack of a certification process for agents can lead to some absurd situations. \"I think it's all so strategic, right? It's one about need. It's two about money and the cost and where's the market and which agent you're dealing with,\" Sarkisian said. \"There are some agents that are rational, and there are some agents that this is the first time ever being an agent — I don't know if they are even licensed to be agents, but all of a sudden they get to be agents because we have no certification process in college football. In the NFL, you have to be certified. In college football, it may be their college roommate their freshman year who's their agent right now, and this guy is throwing numbers at you and it's like, we can't even deal with this. Like, you just move on. It's unfortunate. And we'll get there in college football, but right now it's a tough situation.\"\nCoaches complaining about NIL and the portal often amount to sour grapes, but Sarkisian's point about the challenge of dealing with agents which have no previous experience or understanding of the market is a legitimate one. That said, you have to wonder if this is fresh in Sarkisian's mind due to any of Texas' opt-outs, as they have 13 players who announced intentions to enter the transfer portal and won't play in the Citrus Bowl. Among them are the Longhorns top three running backs, headlined by Tre Wisner, and their second-leading receiver, DeAndre Moore Jr. Eventually one would think some governing body will emerge that can provide some form of regulations on that sort of thing and require certification to help everyone out -- as players would be better served being represented by more professional agents. However, it's not clear when that will happen as the fear of anti-trust litigation led the NCAA to await congressional action, which has yet to materialize in any meaningful way. \nIn the meantime, coaches and GMs will have to deal with the occasional green agent who asks the world, which even a program with seemingly endless resources like Texas has to laugh off. \n            ",

Each of their last seven wins has come by at least eight points, and Boston has covered the spread in 11 of its last 12 victories. The Jazz are home Tuesday, but they are 1-3 over their last four in Utah and are 12-19 overall on the season.

USC is 9-3 in Year Four under Riley, for its most wins since Riley's first season, and has the No. 11 scoring offense in the nation at 36.5 points per game. The passing attack has fueled the offensive success, with USC fifth in passing yards (297.3 yards per game), while also ranking 14th in yards per rush (5.4) and adding 174.8 rushing yards per game. The Trojans will be without WR1 Makai Lemon, who is preparing for the NFL Draft, but quarterback Jayden Maiava, who threw for 3,431 yards, will play. TCU can't say the same for its 3,000-yard passer, as Josh Hoover entered the transfer portal and won't play.

Holloway's various portal adds, including top scorer ex-Samford/Miami-Fl guard AJ Staton-McCray (recert foul issues but still 13.1 ppg), are keying an attack scoring nearly 15 ppg more than a year ago. Meanwhile, even the recent return of oft-injured point guard Sean Jones hasn't lifted Marquette, which at 5-8 continues as a major disappointment for Shaka Smart, and already 0-2 in the Big East.\" Back Seton Hall at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more college football and basketball picks on Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

Now, though, that commitment will, according to the Athletic, \"be deferred in the range of three-to-five years,\" with an unknown payout structure. The arrangement with Rendon will theoretically allow the Angels to be more active on the free-agent market or in assuming salary commitments via trade. The Angels initially signed Rendon prior to the 2020 season to a seven-year, $245 million free-agent contract coming off a strong tenure with the Nationals. While Rendon was highly productive during the abbreviated 2020 campaign, injuries and broad-based decline took firm hold thereafter. Through the first six years of Rendon's Angels tenure he put up a total WAR of just 3.9 at a cost of more than $200 million. Prior to joining the Angels, Rendon amassed a WAR of 34.2 in parts of seven seasons with Washington. As well, Rendon didn't play at all in 2025 after undergoing a second hip surgery in the spring, and he also appeared unlikely to play in 2026. Since 2021, Rendon has averaged just 41 games played per season. \nFrom the team standpoint, Rendon's Angels contract stands as one of the worst in MLB history. He's expected to retire once the buyout is complete, ESPN previously reported.As for the Angels, they presently have Christian Moore penciled in as their third baseman, but they may now pursue an upgrade at Rendon's former position. Available free agents include Eugenio Suárez and Alex Bregman, although the latter appears more likely to go to team better positioned to contend in 2026. On the trade market, the Cardinals are trying to find a home for Nolan Arenado, who's a native of Newport Beach. \nThe Angels are coming off a 72-90 season in 2025, and overall they've endured 10 straight losing seasons. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first top-five matchup of the College Football Playoff will take place in the quarterfinals at the Orange Bowl, with No. 4 Texas Tech squaring off against No. 5 Oregon. The Ducks enter the game with one CFP win under their belts this postseason, rolling over James Madison by a 51-34 final score in the first round. The Red Raiders earned a bye to the quarterfinals after going 12-1 in the regular season and winning the Big 12 Championship, setting a slew of school records in what is already one of the most successful seasons ever for Texas Tech. It should be no surprise that these two teams have reached the point of being two wins away from playing for a national championship. Texas Tech and Oregon both rank in the top 11 nationally for scoring offense and scoring defense, as well as total offense and total defense. They have a combined 24-2 record, and the combined margin of those two losses is just 14 points. It may be the first-ever appearance in the College Football Playoff for the Red Raiders, and just the third for the Ducks, but these are two programs that have clearly mastered the art of roster-building in the modern era and will be considered contenders on a frequent basis. Even though the future is bright for both schools and programs in this celebratory moment, the focus is on the present and doing what's necessary to advance to the CFP semifinal at the Peach Bowl and continue the pursuit of a national championship. Because while 12 wins and a playoff appearance have made this a successful campaign, neither of these top-five title contenders is ready for the season to end yet.   Oregon vs. Texas Tech: Need to know for Orange BowlTexas Tech among the most dominant teams all-time: The Red Raiders have outscored their opponents 555-142 overall, boasting an FBS-best +31.5 average point differential. And this is not a season that has been skewed by one or two blowouts and a handful of nail-biters along the way. Each of Texas Tech's 12 victories have come by at least 20 points, making this year's group just the fifth team in the AP poll era (since 1936) to record 12 or more wins by 20-plus points. The 2018 Clemson Tigers hold the record with 13 wins by 20+ points, the Red Raiders have tied themselves with 1971 Nebraska, 2013 Florida State and 2018 Alabama as teams to win by 20 points or more a dozen times. In search of explosiveness: The Orange Bowl may feature two of the top defenses in the land, but those groups will be tested by two of the most explosive offenses around. Oregon leads the nation with 91 plays of 20-plus yards this season, but Texas Tech is right on their heels ranking second with 90. The skill talent on both teams is capable of turning ordinary plays into extraordinary gains, making it key for both of those elite defenses to be dialed in on every detail.  \nDante Moore is a difference maker: Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could have an NFL Draft decision in his future, but first he's got an opportunity to extend what's been a stellar first season as the Ducks' starter. The one-time Oregon commit who started his career at UCLA before transferring back, Moore spent last season backing up Dillon Gabriel before assuming the starter's role in the offseason. Heading into the Orange Bowl, Moore is tied for No. 3 nationally in completion percentage (72.4), fifth nationally in passer rating (170.08) and tied for seventh with 28 touchdown passes on the year. He was locked in during Oregon's CFP opener, completing 19-of-27 passes for a career-high 313 yards and four touchdowns in the 51-34 win, showing no rust from the layoff heading into the postseason.  Where to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech live  Date: Saturday, Jan. 1 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Florida  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Oregon vs. Texas Tech prediction, picks  \nThis game sets up to be a chess match throughout the afternoon, with both Oregon and Texas Tech looking to set up and eventually execute explosive plays against elite defenses. It's a chess match that will be fascinating to watch play out and likely set up a close game deep into the second half. It's just at some point we're going to need a quarterback to make a game-saving or game-winning play and right now I'd rather side with Dante Moore in that discussion. He's made some huge throws late in games this season and I like his odds more to be able and do so again.  Pick: Oregon -2.5 \n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        Naturally, all eyes in the NFL are currently fixated on what the playoff picture will look like as we rocket toward the regular-season finale in Week 18. However, only a select few franchises will actually enter the race for a Lombardi Trophy this season. As for the others, they'll be picking themselves up by their bootstraps and start planning for a better tomorrow in 2026. Within that group that is on the outside looking in on the postseason are organizations that could be reevaluating their head coaching position as Black Monday looms. Already, there are two open jobs in the NFL in the New York Giants and the Tennessee Titans after they fired their head coaches midseason. However, more are expected to follow and be open by this time next week. When the dust settles on those firings, the next question will center around who could be the next coach up. Below, we're going to highlight some new blood who could enter the conversation this cycle. Specifically, we'll be ranking the top 10 candidates who have no prior history of being an NFL head coach. So, while the likes of Robert Saleh, Kliff Kingsbury, Mike McCarthy, Brian Flores and other veteran coaches will certainly be at top of mind, we'll exclude them for this exercise to take a look at some up-and-comers. 10. Grant UdinskiCurrent position: Offensive coordinator, Jacksonville JaguarsIf you're outside of Jacksonville, you probably haven't heard of Udinski, but he'll be an intriguing name to follow this hiring cycle and in the years to come until he gets scooped up. Earlier this month, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported that Udinski, who turns 30 in January, could be getting head coaching interviews as early as this cycle. Of course, given Udinski's age, he may still be a few years away from securing a job, but it's not hard to see why he's garnering interest. Last year, he was the assistant OC and assistant quarterbacks coach with the Minnesota Vikings, who saw Sam Darnold resurrect his career with a 4,300-yard season. While he does not call plays for the Jaguars, Odinski has been a central piece to Trevor Lawrence finally clicking and leading an offense that is in the upper echelon of the league in scoring. \n9. Mike LaFleurCurrent position: Offensive coordinator, Los Angeles RamsWhenever someone is under the Sean McVay umbrella, they're seemingly destined to get looks as a potential head coach at some point. For LaFleur, the younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, he could prove to be one of the latest in that regard. The 38-year-old has served as Los Angeles' OC since the 2023 season, and while he largely doesn't call the plays in L.A., he's helped spearhead the most prolific offense in the NFL this season. Los Angeles leads the NFL in points per game (30.1) and is second in total yards per game (394.6). Along with his connection to McVay, LaFleur also branches from the Kyle Shanahan tree, working under him as the passing game coordinator in San Francisco from 2017 to 2020 before leaving to become the offensive coordinator for the New York Jets under Robert Saleh. That stint in New York has the potential to hurt him as he did call plays over his tenure there, and the results were lackluster with Zach Wilson as the main signal-caller. Still, his pedigree under McVay will likely warrant him a look or two. 8. Anthony WeaverCurrent position: Defensive coordinator, Miami DolphinsThe Dolphins are on the outside looking in on the playoffs and are potentially looking at a transformative offseason, particularly as they are projected to move on from Tua Tagovailoa in some capacity. While the season looked like it was going to result in an unmitigated disaster after a 1-6 start, they did level off, thanks in large part to Anthony Weaver's defense. Over the last nine games, where the club has gone 6-3 down the stretch, the former defensive end oversaw a unit that is allowing just 20.1 points per game entering Week 18. During his first year on the job in 2024, the Dolphins were a top five defense in the league in total yards allowed. That should set up the 45-year-old to garner some interviews. \n7. Lou AnarumoCurrent position: Defensive coordinator, Indianapolis ColtsAnarumo has been a popular head coaching candidate dating to his days as the defensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. However, he's yet to elevate to that role. After six seasons in Cincinnati, the 59-year-old was let go by Cincinnati after the 2024 campaign, but has landed on his feet quite well, quickly being hired as the defensive coordinator of the Colts. While most of the attention in Indy has been paid to the offense beginning with Daniel Jones and recently surrounding Phillip Rivers, Anarumo's defense has quietly been solid. They are among the best run defenses in the league and in the top half of the NFL in takeaways. Not only that, but Cincinnati's struggles defensively in 2025 only further prove he wasn't the problem. This stint with the Colts has seemingly boosted his stock back up to the point where he could once again have his fair share of interview requests coming in. \n        \n            \n                NFL coordinators with something to prove: Which ones are trying to keep job, which ones could be head coaches?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n6. Todd MonkenCurrent position: Offensive coordinator, Baltimore RavensMonken became a fascinating candidate a year ago after coming back to the NFL following a successful stint as the OC at Georgia and pulling the strings of a high-octane offense with the Baltimore Ravens. Over the 2023 and 2024 seasons in Baltimore, Monken's offenses were essentially top 10 across the board. During that stretch, Lamar Jackson also won the NFL MVP in 2023 and nearly won it again last season. This year, however, the Ravens offense has stalled out, in part, due to Jackson not being healthy. While that's a valid reason for the unit dropping off, it likely dents Monken's stock at touch. Nevertheless, the 59-year-old still should be one of the more popular candidates, particularly for teams looking for someone with an offensive background. 5. Jeff HafleyCurrent position: Defensive coordinator, Green Bay PackersHafley is in his second stint coaching in the NFL, initially entering the league in 2012 as an assistant with the Buccaneers before making stops with the Browns (2014-2015) and 49ers (2016-2018) as their defensive backs coach. After that, he dipped back to the collegiate level for some time, working as the co-defensive coordinator at Ohio State for the 2019 season before taking on the head coaching role at Boston College. He's since spent the last two years as the DC in Green Bay and has steered the ship of some of the best defenses in the league. In Year 1 during the 2024 campaign, Green Bay was top five in the NFL in total yards and takeaways, and top 10 in the league in points allowed. This year, Green Bay has continued to be one of the sturdier defenses, but the unit did take a hit after losing star pass rusher Micah Parsons to a torn ACL. In spite of that, Hafley has shown he can be a strong defensive play-caller and has head coaching experience (albeit in the college circuit), making him a strong candidate this go around. \n4. Chris ShulaCurrent position: Defensive coordinator, Los Angeles RamsAs we noted with LaFleur above, if you're a coordinator who is even remotely attached to Sean McVay, you're going to get attention during hiring cycles. That said, Shula's affiliation with McVay shouldn't be what has NFL decision-makers turn their attention toward him. Instead, it's the strong play by Los Angeles' defense over his tenure. Since assuming the DC role in 2024, the Rams have the fifth-highest pressure rate in the NFL and sixth-highest sack rate (including playoffs). He's taken a young unit and helped put L.A. in the thick of the Super Bowl conversation this season, where the Rams are holding opponents to 20.4 points per game, which is in the top third in the NFL. Shula's defense also has the third-lowest red zone touchdown rate (46.9%) and eighth-lowest third-down conversion rate (36.2) entering Week 18. Of course, Shula's blue blood background as the son of former Bengals head coach David Shula and the grandson of the late Hall of Fame coach Don Shula doesn't hurt his chances. 3. Klint KubiakCurrent position: Offensive coordinator, Seattle SeahawksKubiak has bounced around quite a bit over the last few years, but the next step in his career path should be as an NFL head coach. Most recently, Kubiak, the son of former NFL head coach Gary Kubiak, has served as the offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints in 2024 and is now in that role with the Seattle Seahawks. In both spots, he's impressed. \nWhile the numbers don't exactly show it, Kubiak had a Saints offense punching above its weight class in 2024. When he left for Seattle this year, the numbers began backing up what our eyes told us during Kubiak's Saints tenure. With the Seahawks, Kubiak has formed an offense that is second in the league in scoring entering Week 18 and tied for fourth in the NFL in yards per play. Kubiak has continued the revitalization of Sam Darnold and, in some respects, even has him playing better than he did with Minnesota last year. Kubiak has also helped wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba set franchise records in receiving yards and currently leads the league in that category. If you're looking for an offensive-minded coach, you'd be hard-pressed to find many as promising as Kubiak. 2. Jesse MinterCurrent position: Defensive coordinator, Los Angeles RamsMinter tops this list when it comes to defensive-minded head coaching candidates this cycle, who haven't had a kick at the can already. The 42-year-old started in the NFL working under John Harbaugh as an assistant with the Baltimore Ravens (2017-2020) before eventually finding his way to Jim Harbaugh, where he served as his defensive coordinator at Michigan from 2022 to 2023. There, he helped the Wolverines win a College Football Playoff National Championship before following Harbaugh to Los Angeles to work under him as his defensive coordinator for the Chargers. Over the last two seasons, Minter has had the Chargers defense playing at an elite level. In 2024, L.A. was the No. 1 scoring defense in the league. The unit is currently allowing the seventh-fewest points per game (20.1) in the NFL entering Week 18 this year, and is in the top half of the league in both turnovers and sacks. With the Harbaugh pedigree on his résumé, it won't be surprising to see Minter as a head coach sooner rather than later. \n1. Joe BradyCurrent position: Offensive coordinator, Buffalo BillsBrady will be a highly sought-after candidate this cycle after the 36-year-old has impressed over his tenure as the offensive coordinator in Buffalo. Last season, he helped Josh Allen to an MVP award, while orchestrating an offense that finished No. 2 in the NFL in scoring and No. 10 in the league in total yards. This season, Buffalo's offense has taken a little bit of a step back, but one could argue that it has more to do with personnel than it does with anything related to Brady. Despite some questionable play at wide receiver, Brady has Buffalo entering the final week of the regular season ranking sixth in the league in scoring and fifth in total yards. The Bills also have arguably the NFL's best rushing attack, spearheaded by Allen and James Cook. Brady is the prototypical young, offensive-minded coach that organizations seem to love hiring. The question is whether or not the right opportunity comes around that forces Brady's hand to leave Josh Allen's side. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.This is a baseball column and we'll get to our favorite sport in a second, but first, the NFL provided me with some good material this past weekend. First, we need to recognize that there's been an \"all-or-nothing\" mentality that has permeated sports fandom and media these past several decades and it has long been a pet peeve of mine. I've discussed it before, like when people say a team \"has never won anything\" if it didn't win the ultimate championship, be it the World Series, Super Bowl, etc. Such a phrase is used as a pejorative, to the point that the suggestion is any player or coach or team that hasn't won the big championship is a colossal failure. Winning games or even divisions or even conferences/leagues is shoved aside as nothing -- a failure, even. These people would say the 2025 Blue Jays were failures. What a joke. What goes hand-in-hand with that thought process, then, is the suggestion that every single game not carrying playoff implications is \"meaningless.\"\nFor example, Philip Rivers' return to the NFL these last few weeks was not only a desperation move by the Colts, but also turned into a feel-good story, given his five-year hiatus and his age. The Colts, of course, have lost all three of his starts and were eliminated from playoff contention before Sunday's game, rendering it \"meaningless.\" I loved Rivers' quotes afterward, via The Athletic: \"Those games we played in the backyard, and we were 10 years old, (they) weren't meaningless, right?\" he asked rhetorically. \"Nobody gave a riff about those. But you went home crying, or you went home happy, you know? So, there's no such thing …\"Everything we do matters.\"Man, that last line. I love that so much. He's spot on.It made me think back to when Joe Burrow had healed enough to be medically cleared to play and there were shouts from all over the place that he shouldn't waste his time coming back, given the Bengals' uphill climb. Why would he bother to play when they can't make the playoffs, they cried.Um, because he's making tens of millions of dollars a year to play football? How about that? It's his job. He's paid to play. Credit to Burrow for wanting to play and continuing to play. Why are so many people so eager to call for players to just stop playing? It's infuriating.It all goes back to this all-or-nothing mindset. There's no reason to even bother playing a game unless it leads to a championship. What a terrible way of thinking about professional sports. \nThis is an entertainment business built on fans loving and caring about the sport. We learn to love and care at a young age. Think about all the kids who might get to attend one game per year or even just love seeing certain players on a screen at home. That's how leagues sustain themselves decades into the future. Demanding players stop playing can hurt in building future fan bases. Don't even get me started on this load management nonsense from the NBA. Players are paid to play the game. They are paid handsomely because they are so talented and, thus, entertaining to watch. That's why we keep coming back. I'm incredibly pro-player in labor and salary situations, but that doesn't mean I think they should rest whenever some people think they should. They are the talent and the product and the paying public deserves to watch the talented product. To believe that all the best players should be shut down due to being eliminated from playoff contention goes against the fabric of professional sports.We hear plenty of this every single year in baseball. It drives me crazy. Let's picture a superstar player in September with his team being eliminated. Basically, just picture most of Mike Trout's career (sorry!). Someone might say, \"what reason is there for Trout to keep playing?\" I'm glad this faux person has asked. Let's run down the reasons.\nProfessional pride. This is easy. Pro sports are a competition. Just because your team has been eliminated from the playoffs doesn't mean you should drop the professionalism and try less hard. Play your butt off every time you step between those lines. Competition. Every September, there are a good number of games between teams fighting to make the playoffs/for positioning within the playoffs versus teams that have been eliminated. Every team fighting for playoff position deserves the opponents of the teams they are fighting in the standings to play just as hard in September as they did in April and May. This is a league-wide competition. You don't lay down for an opponent.Individual stats matter for every player. Even if a player is signed to a long-term deal that can't be voided, he still owes the game his very best every time out. Ultimately, this is a league that is supposed to be built on merit. Those kids making MLB debuts in September deserve the chance to prove they belong against the best. Pre-arbitration players are still building seasonal stat lines that will help determine future salaries. Players heading toward free agency are in a similar boat. This is a competition both on a team level and on an individual level. Meritocracies demand the best competition.It's for the fans. The simplest way to put this came from an old Joe DiMaggio quote. When asked something along the lines of why he plays so hard every single game, even in games that don't seem to \"matter,\" he is quoted as saying, \"because there might have been somebody in the stands today who'd never seen my play before and might never see me again.\" That's exactly right. Again, think about some kids who might be attending their first Major League Baseball game. I'm picturing a game late in the season between two teams already eliminated from playoff contention, meaning demand for tickets is low and the prices might work out for families who can't afford a game in the middle of the summer between two contenders. These people are owed the best product just as much as anyone else. Now, since I used a DiMaggio quote, please don't mistake this for one of those misguided \"players today just aren't the way they used to be\" takes. There are plenty of players with that mindset nowadays. Julio Rodriguez in 2023 said, \"It's always 100%. You want people to know who you really are. And I feel like you've got to show that every time on the field. I want people to know me for who I am and not, 'Oh he might be having a bad day or look he's lazy today.' No, I try hard. I want to keep that consistent.\"Look at games played by Marcus Semien in 2019, 2021-24. Check out Pete Alonso on an annual basis. We could keep going. So many of the players want to be out there every single day. And yet, you get pushback to \"rest\" guys or sit them because some have decided that games not impacting who makes the playoffs don't matter. \nThey matter. Like Rivers said, everything here matters. If there are injury issues, sure, sit out and get healthy. But if a player is medically cleared to play, a full season is owed to the fans who pay the player salaries in indirect fashion.  Every game matters in pro sports. \n            ",

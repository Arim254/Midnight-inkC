L.A. has allowed both the second-fewest rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, in addition to the team ranking third in total defense and fourth in third-down defense.

Entering NFL Week 14, Kansas City (6-6) is the 10th seed in the conference after losing three of its last four, including a Thanksgiving Day defeat to Dallas, 31-28. Houston (7-5) is the No. 8 seed but has won four in a row, including a 20-16 victory over Indianapolis last Sunday.

Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

    "body": "\n        Sue Bird received a standing ovation at Gampel Pavilion as her No. 10 jersey was officially retired by UConn. Geno Auriemma stood by her side while calling her \"the greatest point guard to play basketball, man or woman.\" Once she got the microphone from him, Bird joked that he had never said that in front of her.She has often said that UConn feels like family. This weekend, more than all the championships and personal accomplishments, she highlighted that Storrs, Conn. helped shape her as a player and as a person. `This is home,\" she said. \"This is where it started. So to see what we are about to see, my number up in the rafters, the rafters next to these other legends, it's an incredible, incredible honor. Hard to put into words.\"\nBird joined Rebecca Lobo and Swin Cash as the only two other players from the program to get that honor so far. Maya Moore will be next, but it has to happen after her induction into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame because that is a requirement for jersey retirements at UConn.\n\"I think it represents how in a list of some incredible people, how unique some really were for a lot of different reasons,\" said Auriemma, who has coached UConn to 12 national championships. \"The amazing thing about these three, and Maya, the fourth, was the incredible amount of success they had after they left here. That as great as their accomplishments were here, what they've done since they left has been nothing short of incredible.\"Bird earned two national championships during her time with UConn while amassing an impressive 114-4 record. She became the program's first ever No. 1 overall WNBA Draft pick in 2002, and then went on to win four WNBA championships with the Seattle Storm, as well as five Olympic gold medals with Team USA. Bird officially retired in 2022, but her impact is still being felt at UConn and elsewhere.\nBird got video messages from former teammates and other UConn greats, which were played at the arena throughout the game. These included videos from Lobo, Cash, Breanna Stewart and Diana Taurasi. \n\"That No. 10 is one of the big reasons why I went to Connecticut,\" Taurasi said. \"I'm proud to call you a teammate, sister and a fan for life. We all love you. Congratulations.\"The current Huskies were also excited to celebrate Bird. They wore the c-ball throwback uniform, the same one Bird used to wear, on Sunday during their 102-35 win against DePaul. Earlier this week, UConn shared clips of players thanking Bird for her impact on women's basketball.\"If you are playing basketball and you want to play the right way, you want to play like Sue Bird,\" Azzi Fudd said. \"You want to be a leader like her. You want to be a floor general like her. You want to have that kind of IQ. \n\"To see what she was able to accomplish here, the adversity that she faced here, in the W, and what she's been able to do, I think players now have to give her so much credit and thank her. Give her all her flowers because she really helped pave the way to make things possible. So thank you Sue for making UConn what is is now, helping build the W, and helping grow my love for basketball.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 14, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 15 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Shedeur Sanders, QB, BrownsSanders has found his way onto the NFL radar and more importantly the Fantasy radar with an explosive Week 14 performance against the Titans. Only Josh Allen scored more Fantasy points than Sanders in Week 14. The rookie Browns quarterback nearly racked up 40 Fantasy points (38) with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns. He added a fourth touchdown on the ground where he also added 29 yards. If Sanders continues to find success in the screen game, on vertical passes and as a scrambler in the red zone, he could make his way onto the Fantasy radar this playoffs. Tony Pollard, RB, TitansThe Titans may have found something on the offensive side of the ball by leaning on Pollard in the run game. Against a stingy Browns run defense that has stopped almost every back it's faced, Pollard ripped off 161 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Perhaps more importantly, he obliterated any timeshare with Tyjae Spears on route to 25 carries. Pollard is worth scooping back up off the waiver wire for the stretch run.\nRyan Flournoy, WR, CowboysFlournoy put up big Fantasy numbers earlier this year when CeeDee Lamb was hurt and that was the case again in Week 14 after Lamb left with a concussion. Flournoy racked up 113 receiving yards on nine receptions and a touchdown. He also saw a whopping 13 targets despite not starting the game. Flournoy could continue to be a surprising factor if Lamb is forced to miss time with a concussion. He may be worth firing up as your Flex in Week 15 if Lamb is out. Harold Fannin Jr., TE, BrownsIf Fannin is still on your waiver wire, and he remains there in many leagues, it's time to scoop him up. Fannin is a favorite for Sanders and the Browns pass game is starting to heat up a bit. He racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets via eight receptions in Week 14. He's worth starting as an every-week TE. \nTim Patrick, WR, JaguarsTrevor Lawrence continues to make major strides in Liam Coen's passing game over the last three games and that's good news for Jaguars receivers. With Brian Thomas Jr. failing to take hold of the role he earned in his rookie season -- albeit mostly with Mac Jones at quarterback and in an entirely different scheme -- Patrick was able to stand out in Week 14. Patrick finished with 78 yards on five catches and a touchdown. Given the injury situation with the Jaguars receivers this year and the steady improvement in the pass game, he's worth a speculative stash and add in deep leagues. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Juventus lost 2-1 on Sunday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona against Napoli and showed that the work of the coach, Luciano Spalletti, needs more time. The Azzurri won thanks to the brace of former Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who joined Napoli in the summer of 2025, and proved that Antonio Conte's side are back on track and now leading the Serie A standings with a one-point margin on Inter. On the other hand, Juventus showed that they are still struggling to create chances and suffered, despite scoring one goal in the second half with Kenan Yildiz, well assisted by USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie. The team coached by Spalletti probably played their worst match of the season, and some numbers showed all the concerns of the fanbase and the manager.\"We didn't produce as much as we could, but we need to sit down and talk because we still showed the same issues. In my opinion, we can do better than today, we gave them an incredible number of chances. If you don't lead it yourself, you end up being a passenger to others who make decisions and you have to adapt. Every time they get a set piece, they make a block, we couldn't find countermeasures. Maybe we allowed them to get too comfortable, but these are all decisions that have to be taken on the spot and the result depends on the decision you make\", he said during the post-match press conference. The injury of Dusan Vlahovic, who will be out for several weeks after undergoing surgery, underlined the poor impact of Jonathan David this season, who struggled and failed to create chances to score in the second half. With his contract expiring in the summer of 2026, Vlahovic must soon clarify his future, as Juventus need to know whether they can count on him moving forward and given his performances and impact this season, it's clear they desperately do.\nThe Napoli match was more than disappointing for Spalletti, who lost his first game since he was hired to replace Igor Tudor on Oct. 30. Since then, Juventus won four matches and drew three in all competitions before losing to Napoli on Sunday, a match that showed they still need much more work. It was clear how much they struggled in the attacking phase: their 0.24 xG against Napoli was their lowest of the season, matched by season-worst totals in touches inside the box (eight) and shots (five). Juventus posted their poorest attacking numbers of the campaign against Conte's side, showing they are still firmly a work in progess. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Hideki Matsuyama has victoriously bookended 2025, following a season-opening win with another triumph in the Hero World Challenge, the last event of the campaign. Making his first appearance at the tournament in seven years, Matsuyama reigned victorious over Alex Noren in a playoff with a birdie on the first extra hole clinching his victory.Matsuyama utilised a final-round 64 to post a 22-under total for the tournament. He matched when Noren rolled in a birdie putt from just outside 18 feet on the 72nd hole. The two were featured in the penultimate group, yet they were able to skirt past 54-hole leader Sepp Straka, who finished the week at 21 under, and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler -- the two-time defending champion at this event -- who finished at 20 under alongside J.J. Spaun in a tie for fourth.First played in 2000, the Hero World Challenge now has six multiple-time winners. Matsuyama joins the list that includes Davis Love III, tournament host Tiger Woods, Graeme McDowell, Viktor Hovland and Scheffler. In the last nine playings of the event, Matsuyama, Scheffler and Hovland have combined for six victories.Despite not having eyes on the leader at the onset of the day, Matsuyama made his move early and often from three strokes behind. The man from Japan rattled home three birdies in a four-hole stretch from Nos. 3-6, taking advantage of the two early par 5s at Albany Golf Club.\nStraka did well to match the pace of his hottest pursuer as the Austrian reached 20 under for the tournament thanks to three birdies in his first six holes. He grabbed another birdie at the turn to post a front-nine 32 before making his way to the inward half of the golf course, where Matsuyama was already making an impression.From 116 yards on the left side of the fairway of the par-4 10th, Matsuyama manoeuvred a wedge just long and right of the pin, where it then took a couple of bounces and spun back into the hole. From two behind into a share of the lead, Matsuyama never looked back as he began to build on his advantage.\nA birdie on the long par-4 13th gave Matsuyama a two-stroke lead as it started to appear he would cruise into the winner's circle. However, just as the tournament began to look in hand, Matsuyama saw Noren appear quickly in his rearview mirror. \nWinning twice on the DP World Tour this fall, including the league's flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship, the Swede made his push late. As Matsuyama continued to pile up pars -- he made par on his final five holes -- Noren started to string birdies together.He found the surface in two on the par-5 15th to make a stress-free birdie before knocking in a 19-foot effort on the difficult par-4 16th to give himself a heartbeat. Both Noren and Matsuyama narrowly missed chances on the par-3 17th, setting the stage for the finisher where Noren ultimately came through with one last circle on his scorecard to force a playoff.\"I aimed left edge,\" Noren said. \"It was quite nice, clear putt, actually. Some other putts, you don't know exactly what it's doing, but this one we were pretty clear on it.\"\nBack to the tee box, the two went as neither Straka nor Scheffler was able to join the fun. Scheffler made a heroic par save on the par-4 16th to stay within two strokes of the lead, but once he missed a 14-foot birdie opportunity on No. 17, his chances were all but dashed. Straka, on the other hand, made birdie on his final hole to eke closer to the final winning score but was upended by a poor bogey on the par-4 16th just two holes prior.That meant the date was set for only two, and after both players found the short grass with a fairway metal, an approach contest materialised with Matusyama ultimately getting the better of Noren. Striking his second, twirling his club and barking at his ball to sit, Matsuyama stuffed his iron shot to near tap-in distance to give himself his second win of the year and his second win at Tiger's tournament.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin wasn't asked about all of the outside noise following the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens that propelled Pittsburgh into first place in the AFC North. But Aaron Rodgers was, and the veteran quarterback didn't mince works while addressing the recent speculation regarding his coach. \"Means maybe you guys will shut the hell up for a week,\" Rodgers said. Rodgers played a big role in Pittsburgh's win that should quiet some of the noise surrounding his coach, at least for now. He threw for 284 yards that included the game-winning, 38-yard score to running back Jaylen Warren. Rodgers, who turned 42 last week, also ran for his first touchdown since joining the Steelers. \nOn Sunday, the Steelers showed a resolve that has become synonymous with Tomlin's teams over the years. Despite its recent losses, the growing outside noise and facing a team that ran roughshod over them their their previous two meetings, the Steelers made enough plays on both sides of the ball to get a much-needed win that put them back into first place in the AFC North with four weeks to go. \n\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said afterward. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. ... Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"Tomlin has received criticism for not having more success in the playoffs during his first 18 years as the Steelers' coach. A hallmark of Tomlin's tenure has been his ability to field competitive teams year in and year out -- regardless of the circumstances -- while never having a losing season. Pittsburgh's resolve undoubtedly played a role in Sunday's win, which has now put the 7-6 Steelers back in the driver's seat in terms of winning the North and the subsequent playoff spot that comes with it. Of the Steelers' final four opponents, only the Lions (whom they will face in Week 16) have a winning record. \nWhile Tomlin surely still has his detractors, the noise regarding him and his future with the Steelers should be dialed back this week as Pittsburgh readies itself for a prime time matchup against the suddenly-surging Dolphins. \n            ",

It was Daniels' first game back from dislocating that same left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. After throwing an interception to Minnesota edge defender Andrew Van Ginkel, Daniels was trying to chase down Van Ginkel when Isaiah Rodgers (legally) came in and shoved Daniels to the ground.\nDaniels was in clear pain leaving the field, and Marcus Mariota came in on the ensuing drive; Mariota's first drive also ended in an interception. Daniels entered the medical tent and emerged with a towel over his head and without the arm sleeve he had been wearing over his elbow. Washington ruled him questionable to return.Daniels suffered a plethora of injuries this season. He sprained his knee in a Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed the next two games. He came back and helped lead the Commanders to a Week 5 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but Washington lost in Week 6 to the Chicago Bears, and in Week 7, Daniels suffered a hamstring strain in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game before returning in Week 9, when he suffered the dislocated elbow.Despite entering Week 14 with a 3-9 record, Washington wanted Daniels to return when medically cleared to help him gain reps and build toward next season. Daniels had nearly a week and a half of limited practices before being a full participant Thursday and Friday ahead of the Vikings game.\n\"I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,\" Quinn said on Nov. 24. \"It's a skill, just like throwing and processing. And so, all those things are important.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas freshman guard Darryn Peterson, the possible No. 1 pick in June's 2026 NBA Draft, returned to the lineup for the first time after missing his team's last seven games due to a hamstring injury. Peterson logged 23 minutes and recorded 17 points, three rebounds and an assist in an 80-60 win over Missouri on Sunday.\"I thought he did fine,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told reporters after the win. \"I didn't think he pushed it. That's not because of his (hamstring), that's because he's sick. I was nervous he wasn't going to play. ... I thought he did fine, but I didn't plan on playing him 17 and a half minutes the first half. I wanted to play about 14, and then when he got however many he got to start the second half, he was gassed. If it had been a close game, it may have been different, but I wasn't going to try to play him over 27 anyway.\"\nPeterson, one of the most highly touted guard prospects to come out of the high school ranks in years, made his collegiate debut against Green Bay last month, finishing with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists. Against North Carolina on the road, Peterson scored 22 points in a 87-74 loss.Self told reporters last month that Peterson's hamstring issue had been lingering for \"weeks,\" but he played through it in the early part of the season. Notably, Peterson didn't finish an exhibition game against Louisville due to a cramping issue and also exited the second half against Green Bay due to cramps.\n        \n            \n                Tomorrow's Top 25 Today: Michigan expected to be No. 1 in college basketball rankings; Arizona, Duke make case\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat makes Darryn Peterson an elite NBA prospect?Peterson started to create some separation among his peers to become the NBA's No. 1 overall pick in the summer. However, if you ask 10 people who follow the draft closely to predict the first three picks in the draft, you might get 10 different answers. While the top pick has been dominated by forwards, wings and bigs in recent years, Peterson has a chance to become the exception.\nIn CBS Sports' NBA Draft prospect rankings by Adam Finkelstein, Peterson was ranked No. 1, ahead of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Duke's Cameron Boozer -- both of whom are wings/forwards at the NBA level.He finished as the top-ranked prospect in last year's recruiting class and begins this draft cycle in the same place. Peterson is a big, playmaking guard who continues to improve each year. His overlap of positional size, length, strength and shot creation is unmatched in this class. In fact, he may be the best domestic guard we've seen in several draft cycles. If the shot-making we've seen early on at Kansas proves sustainable, he could be even better than expected. The last guard taken with the No. 1 pick was Cade Cunningham in 2021. Since 2010, only six prospects who have gone No. 1 have been classified as a guard. Although Cooper Flagg has been utilized as a point guard through the first few weeks his NBA career by the Dallas Mavericks, he is a traditional wing at the NBA level.Part of the intrigue around Peterson is his potential to be a volume scorer at the NBA level. Peterson is also a talented defensive prospect who can defend at a high level because of his size and athleticism. But what stands out the most -- and why he may ultimately go No. 1 -- is his shot making that is second to none in this class. \nPeterson has all the makings to be an elite scorer at the next level.\n            ",

Notre Dame landed at No. 11 in the final set of playoff rankings, which made it the first team out of the 12-team bracket. The selection committee's decision to exclude Notre Dame in favor of Miami, which ranked 10th and snagged the last at-large bid, came after weeks of ranking the Fighting Irish ahead of the Hurricanes. Notre Dame and Miami were both idle during conference championship weekend. \"As a team, we've decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,\" Notre Dame wrote in a statement. \"We appreciate all the support from our families and fans, and we're hoping to bring the 12th national title to South Bend in 2026.\" Notre Dame finished the regular season with a 10-2 record. The Fighting Irish lost their first two games against a pair of ranked opponents in Miami and Texas A&M -- who both made the College Football Playoff -- before winning their final 10 games in a row. \nNotre Dame's winning streak included victories against Mountain West champion Boise State and No. 16 USC. That wasn't enough to keep the Irish ahead of Miami when it really mattered. \"There is no explanation that could possibly be given to explain the outcome,\" Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua said to Yahoo Sports. \"As I said to Marcus (Freeman), one thing is for sure: Any rankings or show prior to this last one is an absolute joke and a waste of time. Why put these young student-athletes through these false emotions just to pull the rug out from underneath them having not played a game in two weeks and then a group of people in a room shatter their dreams without explanation? We feel like the playoff was stolen from our student-athletes.\"This is the first time since 2016, and just the second time since 2009, that Notre Dame will not compete in a postseason game. The Fighting Irish made it all the way to the College Football Playoff National Championship last season before suffering a 34-23 loss to Ohio State. \nNotre Dame is the latest in a growing string of college football teams to opt out of bowl games. The Big 12 fined Iowa State and Kansas State after they decided to decline their postseason opportunities. Granted, both the Cyclones and the Wildcats are undergoing coaching transitions this offseason and neither were in playoff contention. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee was never going to please everyone with its 2025 bracket. The decision to hold Notre Dame out of the 12-team field was a move that left the Fighting Irish and much of the college football world stunned. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua said Notre Dame feels as though a playoff berth was \"stolen\" from its players after its controversial slide behind Miami in the final top 25 rankings.Hours after learning it would not be included in the 12-team CFP bracket, Notre Dame announced it will not participate in bowl season.\"As a team, we've decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,\" Notre Dame wrote in a statement. \"We appreciate all the support from our families and fans, and we're hoping to bring the 12th national title to South Bend in 2026.\" The Fighting Irish entered conference championship week on the right side of the projected cut line and two spots ahead of the Hurricanes in the rankings. Neither team played a game this week, yet the committee felt it had enough evidence from the season-long results to swap them and put Miami in the field as the No. 10 seed.\n\"There is no explanation that could possibly be given to explain the outcome,\" Bevacqua said to Yahoo Sports. \"As I said to Marcus (Freeman), one thing is for sure: Any rankings or show prior to this last one is an absolute joke and a waste of time. Why put these young student-athletes through these false emotions just to pull the rug out from underneath them having not played a game in two weeks and then a group of people in a room shatter their dreams without explanation? We feel like the playoff was stolen from our student-athletes.\"This marks the second time in as many weeks that Notre Dame dropped in the rankings in favor of another CFP contender. Alabama leaped over the Fighting Irish at the end of the regular season despite winning by a smaller margin over Auburn than Notre Dame did over Stanford. Marcus Freeman's team won 10 games in a row but fell out of favor with the committee down the stretch, leading to one of the most questionable snubs of the playoff era.\"My feelings and the feelings here are just shock and, really, an absolute sense of sadness for our student-athletes,\" Bevacqua said. \"Overwhelming shock and sadness. Like a collective feeling that we were all just punched in the stomach.\"\nMiami's head-to-head win over Notre Dame in Week 1 proved decisive in determining which of the two bubble teams earned the final at-large playoff berth. The question facing the committee is why it took until Dec. 7 for that result to matter. The Fighting Irish ranked ahead of the Hurricanes in every set of CFP rankings before Sunday.The committee's explanation was that the head-to-head comparison only came into effect once the two teams were separated by one spot.\"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said. \"The one metric we had to fall back on was the head-to-head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"\n            ",

They're still on the outside of the playoff picture and looking in, though, so they also need to keep stacking victories to remain in the hunt for the postseason.\n        \n            \n                Week 14 NFL playoff picture: Which teams can be eliminated -- and which matchups will reshape the race\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will come away with the win?

Kansas City is 6-6 and in 10th place in the AFC. The Chiefs probably need to win all five of their games down the stretch of the season to even make the playoffs. They can maybe go 4-1 and still have a chance to get into the dance. They begin with this game against Houston, then finish out December and early January with games against the Chargers, Titans, Broncos and Raiders. There should be two gimme wins on that schedule against Tennessee and Vegas, but the other three contests are difficult matchups against playoff hopefuls. It's not going to be easy to make the needed run for a postseason spot.Texans playoff hopes. Houston is 7-5 and in eighth place in the AFC. The Texans have more paths to the postseason than do the Chiefs because not only can they compete for a wild card berth, but they can also potentially win the AFC South. The Jaguars and Colts are only a game ahead of the Texans at 8-4 apiece. Houston has this game against Kansas City, followed by games against the Cardinals, Raiders, Chargers and Colts to close out the season. They should be able to beat Arizona and Vegas, but again, the other three games are difficult ones against playoff hopefuls. It won't be easy for them to make the needed run for the postseason, either.Kansas City's O-line injuries. The Chiefs will be without both of their starting tackles for this game. Josh Simmons went on injured reserve with a wrist injuries and Jawaan Taylor has already been ruled out with triceps and knee issues. They could also potentially be without guard Trey Smith, who has yet to practice this week due to an ankle injury. That'd leave them down three important starts in front of Patrick Mahomes. Houston's dominant defense. The Texans are shutting down everyone in their path right now. Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, in particular, are totally taking over games, while the rest of the defensive front is also making things incredibly difficult for opposing offenses and the secondary's coverage has been remarkably sticky throughout the year. This is a unit playing at an extraordinarily high level at a key moment of the season, and given the matchup and Kansas City's injury issues up front, could pose a significant challenge for the Chiefs. Chiefs vs. Texans prediction, pick\nI'm going down with the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid ship. \nPick: Chiefs 23, Texans 16 | (Kansas City -3.5, Under 41.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

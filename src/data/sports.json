    "body": "\n        Bettors will need to have their heads on a swivel in Week 9. In correlation with Halloween, the upcoming slate has a chance to be more trick than treat. The NFL is coming off a couple of weeks where favorites have dominated. That includes Week 8, where favorites went 11-2 ATS. That 84.6% cover rate was the best since Week 16 in 1985. (Yes, you read that right). When you pair that with the Week 9 slate of games opening with nine home underdogs, there's the possibility for carnage as water finds its level.That puts an ever greater emphasis on trying to find the mismatches this week and locate possible upsets, so that we ride with the underdogs instead of feeling their wrath. Below, we've identified five games where we could see upsets in Week 9.NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

On the one hand, it was surprising to see the Bills as a home underdog with Highmark Stadium being one of the toughest places to play in the entire NFL. On the other hand, the Chiefs do seem to have flipped a switch in recent weeks, with Patrick Mahomes looking more like his old self just in time to square off against Josh Allen.\nThis rivalry has been one of the best in recent NFL history, but it is one-sided depending on when these games are played. In their all-time head-to-head, Mahomes bests Allen with a 5-4 record. However, four of those victories have come in the playoffs. In the regular season, Allen is the dominant one with a 4-1 record against Mahomes. Given that this game is being played in November and not January, Allen could have a leg up, making a home upset live no matter how well K.C. is playing. Arizona Cardinals at Dallas Cowboys (-3)When: Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Where: AT&T Stadium (Arlington)TV: ABC | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Cardinals ML odds: +130Kyler Murray is slated to return in Week 9 after being sidelined for the Cardinals' previous two games due to a foot injury. That's great news for Arizona as Murray is unbeatable when he's in Dallas. Literally. The Cardinals quarterback and Texas native is 9-0 in his football life at AT&T Stadium, ranging from high school, college, and the NFL.While we note that history partially in jest, Murray and the Cardinals have an outstanding matchup against a poor Dallas defense. They are giving up 6.2 yards per play this season and are allowing opposing quarterbacks to register a combined 112.0 passer rating against them. Both of those figures are at the very bottom of the league.\nWhile the Cowboys defense should give little resistance to the Cardinals offense, Arizona has a defense that could give Dallas some fits. They are holding quarterbacks to an 85.8 passer rating against (eighth in the NFL) and sturdy on third down, ranking sixth in the league with a 35.6% conversion rate. There's a clear path for Arizona to come out with an outright win in Week 9. Jacksonville Jaguars (-3) at Las Vegas RaidersWhen: 4:05 p.m. ET | Where: Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas)TV: Fox | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Raiders ML odds: +146Both of these teams are coming off the bye in Week 8, so they'll have an equal rest advantage. While The Jags (4-3) are heads and shoulders above the Raiders (2-5) in the win-loss column, they are not a set-and-forget favorite. Jacksonville is coming off back-to-back losses where the offense has gone silent, averaging 9.5 points per game.Through seven games, Trevor Lawrence has registered an 80.6 passer rating, which would be the lowest of his career since his rookie season if he holds. Part of the problem has been protection, as he's been sacked 20 times already. That's a long way in saying that the Jaguars offense isn't the most trustworthy unit at the moment, especially in a game where Maxx Crosby could take over.\nWhile Geno Smith is hardly trustworthy, the Raiders are expected to get back two key weapons in the passing game in wideout Jakobi Meyers and tight end Brock Bowers. That should give Las Vegas a boost and keep them within range of the spread/possible upset. Chicago Bears (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsWhen: 1 p.m. ET | Where: Paycor Stadium (Cincinnati)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Bengals ML odds: +120The Bengals defense is bad, and just allowed Justin Fields and the previously winless New York Jets to drop 39 points against them in Week 8. With that in mind, it's not surprising to see them as home dogs. However, it's flown a bit under the radar how poorly Caleb Williams has been playing in recent weeks. He's gone back-to-back games with zero passing touchdowns and one interception.Even worse, he has a league-low 16% off-target rate on his throws this season despite having the longest average time to throw (3.21 seconds). If that persists in Week 9, Cincinnati's defense may get some gifts that could help push the club to a win. \nOn the other side, Joe Flacco has been an upgrade over Jake Browning at quarterback and has effectively been able to get the football to his playmakers like Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Flacco has eight total touchdowns and zero turnovers in his three starts with Cincinnati. With that in mind, just a slight improvement on defense (maybe aided by Williams) should help the Bengals if Flacco keeps his play up. Denver Broncos vs. Houston Texans (-1.5)When: 1 p.m. ET | Where: NRG Stadium (Houston)TV: Fox | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Broncos ML odds: +100C.J. Stroud finally looked like his old self in Week 8, logging his first 300-yard passing game of the season. Arguably, the biggest reason for his return to form last week was that he took zero sacks in the win over San Francisco. Will that continue, or what that a one-off performance from the offensive line? Something tells me that Stroud won't go unscathed in Week 9 against a Denver pass rush that is the NFL's best.The Broncos are tied for fifth in the league in pressure rate and lead the NFL with 36 sacks on the year, which is 10 more than any other team. If Denver continues that stellar pace, Stroud could be thrown off his game and put the Texans offense back into neutral.\nEven if the Broncos can't get home, their prowess in the red zone is a major mismatch. Denver is holding opponents to touchdowns on just 40% of their trips to the red zone, which is tied for the NFL's best. Meanwhile, the Houston offense is scoring touchdowns on just 42.1% of trips, which is second-worst in the league. If all the Texans can muster are field goals, they'll have a hard time defending their home turf.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Guess who's nearing lock status for an appearance in the 2025 Big Ten Championship Game? During a season of firsts, Indiana adds another program first to its laurels this fall if Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers beat up on a favorable slate down the stretch.Looking over more than a dozen Big Ten Championship Game tiebreakers, top-ranked Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana are running roughshod through the conference and make things easy on conference officials by cruising next month.However, the path to Indianapolis is a bit trickier for the unbeaten Buckeyes, who could see pressure from a few others inside the top 25 with only one conference loss up to this point. The Big Ten produced four playoff teams last season and could equal that number in a couple of week if Michigan, Iowa or USC is able to win out from here and get to a 10th victory.\n        \n            \n                Mapping out 2025 SEC Championship Game scenarios: Paths for Alabama, Georgia, Texas A&M and more contenders\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a comprehensive look at each team's path to the 2025 Big Ten Championship Game entering the final month of the regular season:\n\n    \n                                        \n    Indiana (8-0, 5-0)Clearest path: The Hoosiers have the most favorable stretch of games to finish out the season, perhaps in Cignetti's coaching career. That's not hyperbole; Indiana's remaining opponents are a combined 1-17 in conference play this season. Avoid a massive upset as a double-digit favorite and the Hoosiers will play in Indianapolis.Chaos scenario: Perhaps Penn State gives Indiana trouble at Beaver Stadium on Nov. 8? The Hoosiers have only beaten the Nittany Lions twice all-time, but this season's vastly different than those others. It's Indiana with the better team this time around despite Penn State being ranked No. 2 this fall before capsizing under recently fired coach James Franklin.Tiebreaker talk: Indiana's road win at Oregon was one of the single-most impressive victories across college football this season and put the Hoosiers in the driver's seat within the league title race. That's an important tiebreaker should both teams finish with one conference loss, along with the last-second win at Iowa on Sept. 27.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Ohio State (7-0, 4-0)Clearest path: Whatever Ryan Day's telling his team this season, it's working. They've blistered every squad they've played, and defensively, there's not an elite in the country performing at a more dominant clip. Win out and the Buckeyes are a guaranteed top four seed in the playoff and will be wearing scarlet at Lucas Oil Stadium.Chaos scenario: The Buckeyes' most competitive Big Ten games this season came on the road against Washington and Illinois, a pair of 18-point victories. They've dominated in conference play and will be multi-touchdown favorites against Penn State, UCLA, Purdue and Rutgers next month before the potential fly in the ointment -- Michigan.Tiebreaker talk: If unbeaten and top-ranked Ohio State loses to the Wolverines on Nov. 29, that could create a multi-team tie for second place in the conference standings and may send Oregon to the league title game against Indiana based on record against the three tied teams' common opponents.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Oregon (7-1, 4-1)Clearest path: The Ducks need help. There's no yellow brick road to Indianapolis since the Hoosiers and Buckeyes are unbeaten heading into Week 10 in conference play, and Oregon already lost to one of those titans at home. Finishing 11-1 and getting some rest before the playoff might result in a better showing in December this time around.Chaos scenario: Indiana or Ohio State losing twice would be an early Christmas present for the Ducks if Dan Lanning's team wants a crack at defending its conference crown. That's unlikely and would take World War III down the stretch within the conference from a collection of bad teams suddenly playing well for that to come to fruition.Tiebreaker talk: Oregon will play for a conference title if the Ducks beat Iowa, Minnesota, Washington and USC and get some assistance from Michigan against Ohio State during rivalry weekend. That would create a three-team tie and Oregon has the edge there since the Wolverines would hold a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Buckeyes and Michigan's lone Big Ten loss -- USC -- would've been a win for the Ducks.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan (6-2, 4-1)Clearest path: Control what you can control. That's got to be the message for Sherrone Moore with his team entering the final stretch. If the Wolverines take care of business against Purdue, Northwestern and Maryland, then the home finale against Ohio State could be for a spot in Indianapolis. They do not control their own destiny, however, even by winning out.Chaos scenario: Grab a chair for this. Michigan needs to win its last four games -- including a victory over the Buckeyes for the fifth straight year -- and must get another loss by USC since the Trojans hold a head-to-head tiebreaker. Also, Oregon needs to lose to Minnesota or Washington, which aids the Wolverines in avoiding getting into -- and losing -- a three-team, one-loss tiebreaker situation.Tiebreaker talk: Much of this changes if Indiana struggles in November with multiple losses and the entire conference title conversation is thrown for a loop, but that's not happening. For the most part, Wolverines fans won't sweat losing any sort of tiebreaker in getting to Indianapolis if it means beating Ohio State, finishing 10-2 overall and getting into the playoff.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Iowa (6-2, 4-1)Clearest path: The Hawkeyes are a late stop against Indiana away from being unbeaten in the Big Ten and ranked inside the top 10 this season. Really. With opportunities next month against nationally ranked Oregon and USC, the Hawkeyes could torch most current playoff projections by staying hot and running the table.Chaos scenario: Picture this -- Indiana wins out and Ohio State loses to Michigan during rivalry weekend. Where would that leave Iowa, in a three-way tie for second place with the Buckeyes and Wolverines? Iowa would get the nod since its record against common opponents with Michigan would be 4-0 vs. the Wolverines 3-1 (loss to USC).Tiebreaker talk: Laid out above, Hawkeyes fans are going to be glued to Ohio State-Michigan in late November as long as this team doesn't get tripped up over the next four weeks and beat Nebraska on Black Friday.\n\n    \n                                        \n    USC (5-2, 3-1)Clearest path: Think USC would love a do-over against Illinois? That late blown lead is the only game keeping the Trojans out of the Big Ten's top-tier at this junction. The rebound win over Michigan was much-needed, and if USC wins out from here, it applies pressure to Indiana and Ohio State at the top.Chaos scenario: Excluding Indiana from the conversation, USC will play in Indianapolis if the Trojans go 5-0 next month and Michigan beats Ohio State on Nov. 29. That would put USC in a three-way tie for second and gives the Trojans the nod due to their head-to-head win over the Wolverines.Tiebreaker talk: Getting to the playoff should be the goal for Lincoln Riley with a Big Ten title game appearance secondary. If USC wins out, including victories over Iowa and Oregon, the 10-win Trojans should be in the at-large mix when the selection committee meets for a final time in December.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Entering the final month of the regular season, 11 of 67 Power Four teams are still searching for their first conference victory. Assessing the remaining schedules of those struggling squads, it appears likely that we'll top last year's tally of three P4 teams that finished winless in league action.A year ago, those three teams were Purdue, Mississippi State and Oklahoma State. Those three are once again winless in league action as calendar is about to flip to November. For now, they have plenty of company.If Penn State and Michigan State are still among the Big Ten's crop of four winless teams in league play come Nov. 15, something will have to give since they play each other that day. But outside of those two, none of the other nine Power Four teams still in search of a league victory play one of their winless brethren.The situation looks particularly bleak for Purdue and Wisconsin. The Boilermakers play ranked opponents in three of their final four games, and the other contest is on the road against a 6-2 Washington team. Wisconsin plays four teams with records of 5-3 or better down the stretch.\nThis year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented.Bottom 25 Rankings^ Joined Bottom 25 this weekBluegrass bluesOn the heels of a 4-8 season, Kentucky will exit October without a victory against a Power Four opponent. Fire Mark Stoops, right? Well, it's not that simple. As the Lexington Herald-Leader reported, Stoops would be owed nearly $38 million within 60 days if he's fired. That's different than many coach buyouts, which can be spread out over the life of the contract and mitigated by a coach's future earnings. With Auburn, Florida and Tennessee Tech up next, maybe the Cats can catch fire and salvage their season. But based on what we've seen so far, it seems unlikely.25. Kentucky^24. Purdue (22)23. Arkansas (25)22. Louisiana-Monroe^21. West Virginia (21)Worthless winsTypically speaking, a victory for any team in the Bottom 25 is regarded as such an impressive achievement that it results in a big jump. Often, a Bottom 25 team will escape the ranking altogether after a victory. But in South Alabama's case, a 38-31 win at Georgia State barely moved the needle. Why? Because it was against Georgia State. That's what we call a Bottom 25 Battle Royale, and you don't get much credit for beating one of the few teams who are actually worse than you.\n20. Louisiana (21)19. South Alabama (18)18. Florida State (20)17. Colorado State^16. Northern Illinois (11)No. 1 vs. No. 11 (sort of)The idea of Ohio State being ranked No. 1 and Penn State being ranked No. 11 for their Week 10 showdown would have made perfect sense before the season. ... until you were told that Penn State is No. 11 in the Bottom 25. Even being No. 11 in the AP poll at this juncture would have been a disappointment for the Nittany Lions in what was supposed to be an \"all in\" year. But disappointing is an insufficient term to describe Penn State's level of failure in 2025. Which is exactly why it would be so funny if this were the year it beat Ohio State for the first time since 2016.15. Tulsa (19)14. Eastern Michigan (17)13. North Carolina (15)12. UTEP (14)11. Penn State (11)\nWisconsin hits a milestoneIt's too early to call it an offensive renaissance, but Wisconsin hit a major milestone in its 21-7 loss to Oregon, as the Badgers snapped a 14 quarter touchdown drought. Yes, that's correct. Between the first quarter of October and the final quarter of October, the Badgers did not score a touchdown. But the long nightmare ended late this past Saturday with Hunter Simmons' 2-yard touchdown pass to Lance Mason. Will Wisconsin score more than two touchdowns in November? The opponents are all 5-3 or better, so it might be close.10. Nevada (12)9. Wisconsin (10)8. Oregon State (9)7. Boston College (7)6. Middle Tennessee (6)Bad CharlotteCharlotte was doing the dang thing through a quarter and a half. The 49ers led North Texas, one of the American's top teams, by a score of 17-7. From there, they showed why they've become a mainstay in the seediest rungs of the Bottom 25. North Texas outscored Charlotte 47-3 over the final two and a half quarters. The 49ers gave up 27 points in the fourth quarter alone as Mean Green quarterback Drew Mestemaker tossed for a school record 608 yards. When it was all said and done, Charlotte surrendered 754 yards.\n5. Charlotte (5)4. Georgia State (4)3. Oklahoma State (3)2. Sam Houston (2)1. UMass (1)\n            ",

Authorities are still in search of the vehicle, which they said was fraudulently removed from a fabrication business between Oct. 20 and 22 and driven to the Atlanta area last week.Effortless Motors customized the $180,000 vehicle for O'Neal and arranged transport through FirstLine Trucking LLC, among other shops. Investigators are looking into the logistics of the shipping process and have yet to locate the luxury SUV, although they have identified suspects and received search warrants from the Lumpkin County Sheriff's Office. Effortless Motors also offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the vehicle's recovery.\n        \n            \n                You can't fake 'fam-uh-lee' forever: Brian Kelly's end came fast, but his LSU downfall was years in the making\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAuthorities are investigating FirstLine Trucking LLC's role in the vehicle's transport.

He worked with Effortless Motors since 2023 on multiple vehicles.\n\"We take the security and trust of our clients very seriously,\" Abdelrahman said. \"This was a highly coordinated criminal act targeting the transport company's network.

The Toronto Blue Jays took Game 4 Tuesday, beating Shohei Ohtani on the mound and at the plate for a 6-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. That means the series is now a best-of-three, with one more game in Los Angeles and at least one in Toronto.The Dodgers are trying to become the first back-to-back World Series champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees. The Blue Jays are looking for their first title since back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with an ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.The Blue Jays (94-68) have home-field advantage over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

Can they continue to hold down Mookie Betts? Is George Springer actually able to play? \nGame 5 predictionThe Dodgers' offense hasn't done much of anything in more than two games' worth of innings at this point, and I don't think Trey Yesavage will be as skittish as he was in Game 1. (The same applies to Blake Snell.) Toronto's swinging the bats much better right now. I have them eking out a close Game 5 win, giving the Blue Jays two chances to win the World Series at home in Games 6 and 7. -- Mike Axisa\n            \n    ",

Lane Kiffin and the Rebels picked up a big road win against Oklahoma in Week 9, giving them a clear path forward to the CFP field. \nSouth Carolina, meanwhile, has been one of the underperforming SEC teams this season. The Gamecocks almost pulled off a shocker against Alabama last week, but fell just short. They've lost both their road games by more than a touchdown thus far, and the trends point to comfortable win for the Rebels in this one. \"The Rebels (-10) won impressively at Williams-Brice last season in 27-3 romp,\" Marshall told SportsLine.\"The  Gamecocks have to feel a bit snakebitten, losing last three outright. SC is 0-2 vs. the line on road this season. Ole Miss, meanwhile, is 4-1 vs. the line at Vaught-Hemingway this season.

    "description": "\n        The WNBA has offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collect",
    "body": "\n        The WNBA has offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement, according to ESPN. The current CBA will expire on Friday (Oct. 31) unless the two sides agree to an extension or a new deal beforehand. Per ESPN, the players would only accept an extension \"under the right circumstances,\" but those circumstances \"do not yet exist.\" This would not be the first time that the two sides have needed an extension to complete negotiations on a new CBA. In fact, an extension was necessary to complete the current CBA. In 2019, the two sides announced a 60-day extension before agreeing to a new deal in Jan. 2020.If the two sides cannot agree to an extension, or the extension comes and goes without another extension or a new deal, the next step would be a work stoppage. At that point, all league business would cease -- players would not even be able to access practice facilities -- but negotiations would continue. \nThe WNBA has never lost games to a work stoppage, but it has come close. In 2003, there was still no deal in place by early April and then-NBA commissioner David Stern issued an ultimatum to come to terms on a new CBA by April 18 or the season would be cancelled. The two sides did just that. As a result, the 2003 WNBA Draft was delayed, as were preseason games. WNBPA senior advisor and legal counsel Erin Drake told The Athletic on Tuesday that the two sides will not agree on a new CBA before Oct. 31. \"We have worked hard to be able to say on Friday, we did it. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen,\" Drake said. \"In a dance, it takes two to tango. And it has been difficult to find a beat, to find a rhythm and to find the same sense of urgency [from the league], just to be frank, to get this done.\"\nIn a statement released to ESPN, the league responded by stating it had made an offer to the players on Oct. 1, which had been ignored until Monday. \"We have been negotiating with the Players Association in good faith and with urgency for several months with the goal of finalizing a new collective bargaining agreement as quickly as possible,\" a WNBA spokesperson told ESPN. \"Throughout this process, we have been clear that our top priority is reaching a new collective bargaining agreement that addresses players' ask for significant increases in pay, benefits and enhancements to their experience, while ensuring the long-term growth and success of the league and its teams.\"We urge the Players Association to spend less time disseminating public misinformation and more time joining us in constructive engagement across the table.\"\nThe WNBA and the WNBPA have been embroiled in a bitter labor dispute for over a year. In October of 2024, the players announced their intention to opt out of the current CBA. \"This is a defining moment, not just for the WNBA, but for all of us who believe in progress,\" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said in a statement at the time. \"The world has evolved since 2020, and we cannot afford to stand still. If we stay in the current agreement, we fall behind.\"Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.\"\nIn recent months, the tension between the players and the league, and specifically commissioner Cathy Engelbert, has heightened. Most notably, WNBPA vice president Napheesa Collier delivered a scathing rebuke of Engelbert during her exit interview following the conclusion of the Minnesota Lynx's season. \"We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world,\" Collier said, while also accusing Engelbert of making disparaging remarks about players, including Caitlin Clark.Engelbert later addressed the criticism during her pre-Finals press conference. \n\"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa and every single player in our league,\" she said. \"They are at the center of everything we do. I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and me personally do not care about them or listen to them, and if the players in the W don't feel appreciated and valued by the league, then we have to do better and I have to do better.\"The main sticking point between the two sides is the revenue sharing model. Under the current CBA, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, reports indicate that players only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive.While Engelbert and NBA commissioner Adam Silver have both publicly supported raising player salaries, they have pushed back on revenue sharing. \n\"I think share isn't the right way to look at it because there's so much more revenue in the NBA,\" Silver said earlier this month. \"I think you should look at absolute numbers in terms of what they are making. They are going to get a big increase in this cycle of collective bargaining and they deserve it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Giannis Antetokounmpo put together a dominant performance on Tuesday night to lead the Milwaukee Bucks past the New York Knicks on national television, then brushed off rumors that over the summer he had contemplated a future in the Big Apple. As Antetokounmpo sat at the podium after putting up 37 points, eight rebounds and seven assists on 16 of 22 shooting in the Bucks' 121-111 win, he was asked about an ESPN report that the Knicks were the only team that he had interest in playing for outside of Milwaukee. \"Who said that? I don't read that. I don't remember that. Right now I'm here, representing my team and that's it,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"We beat the Knicks. [The trade rumor] doesn't really matter. What matters right now is we have a game in two days against Golden State, try to stay locked in and get two in a row. I didn't read that article. Try to stay away from all that -- rumors, speculation and trades and all this. It doesn't concern me one bit.\"\n        \n            \n                Mike Brown bemoans Knicks players 'standing and watching' as offensive growing pains cost them vs. Bucks\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAntetokounmpo has been phenomenal to start the season. He's scored at least 30 points in all four of the Bucks' games, and is averaging 36.3 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists on 69.5% shooting. He seemed to have some extra juice on Tuesday as he helped the Bucks improve to 3-1, though he said it was only because the Knicks swept the Bucks last season. \nIn one sequence in the third quarter, Antetokounmpo rose for a big block on Mikal Bridges, then threw down a slam on the other end, which forced a Knicks timeout. He gestured for the crowd to rise to its feet as he walked to the bench, and appeared to yell, \"This is my city!\" followed by something else. (He claimed postgame that he then added, \"I love when it's tough. I thrive when it's tough. When you make it tough, I thrive.\" The video does not appear to corroborate that.)\n\"Yeah, for sure, there was a lot extra [to this game]. They swept us last year. Swept us,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"They were way better than us last year and we didn't make it tough for them. It was very easy, in my opinion. And as the leader of this team, I remember. I don't forget things and I try to, from early at shootaround, set the tone for the team and try to remind them 'last year, they swept us, same as the Cavs.' So I think the team responded in the best way, so I'm happy.\"Antetokounmpo has been asked about trade rumors multiple times in the last month, starting with media day, when he acknowledged that there was truth to offseason reports that he had thought about leaving Milwaukee. During training camp, though, he made it clear that he was committed to the Bucks for the remainder of the season and would give the team his all as long as he remains in town. \n\"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said on Oct. 8, one day after Shams Charania's ESPN report. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\"During that same Oct. 8 press conference, however, he also said that he could change his mind in \"six, seven months\" if the team is not heading in the right direction. As a result, the trade rumors are going to follow him until he signs an extension with the Bucks, asks for a trade or hits free agency, which he can do in 2027 if he opts out of the final year of his deal. \nFor now, though, it's clear that the entire saga has not affected his performance on the court. \n\"I don't have time [to be distracted]. I'm not going to lie to you. I have four kids, I have a seven-month old, two-year old, four-year old and five-year old. So brother, I don't have time to read [rumors]. Even if I wanted to pay attention to stuff like that, my life doesn't let me,\" Antetokounmpo said Tuesday. \"I have four little gremlins running around, I have my craft that I gotta improve, and then I gotta lead the team and then I've got other things. I got my wife, I got my mother, I got my brothers, I gotta go to church. Man, I ain't got time for all that. So I'm being very, very honest with you. I just love playing basketball and I try to speak on the court.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are officially one week into the NBA season and the level of competition across the league has been unreal. It seems like every national TV game has gone to overtime, if not double overtime. Victor Wembanyama is playing a brand of basketball never before seen. Stephen Curry is cooking up his regular dishes. Luka Doncic is averaging 46.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists. But on some level, none of that is surprising. We knew the Knicks were going to shoot more 3s under Mike Brown (and indeed they are) and we knew the Celtics were probably going to struggle (and indeed they have). But what about the stuff we didn't see coming? That could be a long list (are the Jazz good?), but I'm going to focus on five of the best first-week surprises. Austin Reaves is your total-point leaderReaves' legit card has long been stamped, but this is something else. Through four games, Reaves is averaging 35.8 PPG. His 143 total points are tied with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for tops in the league entering play Tuesday. He went for 51 on Sunday in a win over the Kings, missing a triple-double by one assist and becoming the first player in history to record at least 50 points, eight rebounds and eight assists on 80% true shooting in a single game. \nHe then backed that up with 41 on Monday in a loss to the Blazers. \nDo the math, and that's 92 points in about 30 hours for Reaves, who is making quite the bid for a max contract when he becomes a free agent this coming summer. The numbers speak for themselves, but it's worth noting that Reaves did what he did against the Blazers, even though he was the clear focus of the defense with both Luka Doncic and LeBron James out. \nReaves has racked up a league-leading 51 free throws so far and he's not grifting. He's way more shifty than you think and a true tough-shot maker. He's one of two guys in the league averaging at least 35 points, eight boards and six rebounds (the other is Luka Doncic, who's only played in two games), and his 57/43/88 shooting splits are scorching by any standard, let alone at the volume Reaves has activated. Reaves' usage will surely dip when James returns, but playing like this, you can make a case that LeBron will be the one having to fit in around what might be the Lakers' new dynamic duo, both short and long term. A first All-Star selection could be in Reaves' sights if he continues at anything close to this level. \n        \n            \n                How scorching starts from Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić could redefine LeBron James' role on new-look Lakers\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJonathan Kuminga flipping script on Warriors sagaKuminga and the Warriors have gone from an arranged marriage to basketball soulmates in the blink of an eye. Through four games, Kuminga, who went for 24 points on 9 of 14 shooting, 10 rebounds and four assists in the Warriors' win over Memphis on Monday, is averaging career highs across the board: 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists with a through-the-roof 69.5 true-shooting percentage. \nKuminga has never been anywhere near this efficient. He's never rebounded like this. Passed like this. Defended like this. His sudden feel for the Warriors' play-off-Steph's-movement system, and his place within it, is palpable. Steve Kerr has glowed about Kuminga's maturity, and understandably so. After the tension of his contract saga this summer, to come back to a team that seemingly only signed him because no one else would trade much for him, and likely with the intention of still trading him before the deadline, and play with this kind of commitment to, well, the team is extraordinary stuff. On appreciably lower usage than he's required in the past, Kuminga is doing more than ever; gone are the solo-mission mid-rangers that he long shot at a paltry percentage. After a couple of bad shots in the season opener, he has played basically perfect basketball, and as such has seemingly cemented himself, at least for however long this keeps up, in both the starting and finishing lineup. \nAgain, when the Warriors signed Kuminga to a two-year, $46.5 million deal this summer, with the second season being a team option, it was widely regarded as a contract priced to move. But if Kuminga keeps playing like this, barring some sort of superstar deal in which Kuminga is the central outgoing figure, Golden State might not be able to afford to lose him. \nThe Bulls are undefeated!Everyone's favorite \"what the hell is their plan\" punchline has started the season with wins over the Pistons, Magic and Hawks -- all teams widely considered to be fringe Eastern Conference contenders -- by way of a 104.4 defensive rating that is tied with Oklahoma City for the class of the league. That won't continue. But the Bulls look genuinely good with a deep roster quietly full of quality NBA players, six of which (Nikola Vucevic, Josh Giddey, Ayo Dosunmu, Kevin Huerter, Matas Buzelis and Tre Jones) are averaging 13 PPG or more. They contest every shot (even if there's always shooting luck baked into early-season defensive metrics, this is evident), and they're rebounding at a top-five rate to punctuate all those stops. In Monday's win over Atlanta, eight guys scored at least 12 points, led by Dosumnu's 21 off the bench. Vucevic has been on fire all year, albeit probably unsustainably. Giddey is playing like an All-Star. Dosumnu, a lights-out defender, has cashed nine of his 15 3-pointers. If you haven't already scored a seat on the Buzelis hype train, sorry, no room left. \nThings are about to get tough for the Bulls, who face the Knicks twice, Sixers, Bucks, Cavs, Spurs, Pistons and Nuggets in eight of their next 10. We'll see if this is something to really talk about or just a phony hot start from a team once again headed straight for the play-in, but something tells me this is a team that is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of opponents this year. Ajay Mitchell is breaking outJust when you thought the Oklahoma City Thunder, with their young championship roster and 11 potential first-round picks rolling in over the next seven drafts, couldn't get any richer, here comes Mitchell and probably the breakout player of the young season. \nIt hasn't come entirely out of left field. You saw his ability last season in irregular/mop-up stints and he was a Summer League star, but there was just no room for him to get consistent minutes. He wasn't part of the playoff rotation. But with Jalen Williams, Isaiah Joe and Kenrich Williams all sidelined to start the season, Mitchell has taken full advantage of his time to shine by scoring at least 14 points in all four games off the bench. \nAnd this isn't supplementary stuff. He has been a legit go-to scorer in crucial stretches, almost impossible to guard at times with his elite balance, shifty/stop-start cadence and deft gray-area touch in traffic. MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander says Michell just \"knows how to play,\" and as generic as that assessment may sound, it couldn't ring more true. Watch the footwork. The instructional-video perfection on his show-and-go drives. The craft of his pump fakes. His midrange pull-up bag is deep; he can do it going both ways, and his downhill acceleration hits like a punch. \nThis is actually laughable that OKC, with all its talent and future assets, has a guy this good just hanging around in the depth-chart shadows. Every team in the league would kill for a backup point guard like this; the Mavericks, Rockets, Timberwolves, or a half-dozen other teams would jump at the chance to insert him as their starting point guard right now. This is not a fluke. This dude can flat out play. He's going to be a major contributor for the Thunder even when all these guys get back, and he just may become one of the league's hottest trade assets as the deadline nears. As if the Thunder need any more of those. \nA buffet of 50 piecesThe regular season is one week old and we've already had four 50-point performances. Aaron Gordon went nuts in Denver's opener against the Warriors with 50 on 10 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put up a career-high 55 in a double-overtime win over the Pacers. Austin Reaves, as noted above, hung 51 on the Kings on Sunday. And on Tuesday, Lauri Markkanen gave the Suns 51. This marks just the second time in NBA history that we've had four 50-point games in the month of October (Wilt Chamberlain did it four times himself in 1962, and Blake Griffin, Stephen Curry, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving did it in 2018). That gives us four nights, beginning Tuesday, to break the record with one more 50-piece. Frankly, the record should already have been broken. Luka Doncic went to the line with 48 points against the Timberwolves but was only able to split the free throws before being pulled to end on 49. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Following his team's 6-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 4 of the World Series on Tuesday night, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hinted at possible lineup changes moving forward. \"I think so,\" Roberts said to reporters when asked whether he was considering making adjustments to his batting order ahead of Game 5. \"I'm going to think long and hard and it might look a little bit different tomorrow.\"That's an unexpected dilemma for a team that during the regular season led the National League in OPS, runs scored, and home runs and across all of MLB ranked second to only the New York Yankees in those categories. Those trends, however, have not carried over into the World Series, which is now tied 2-2. \"We haven't found our rhythm,\" Roberts said of the team's offensive performance against Toronto thus far. \"We haven't. It sort of draws dead at certain parts of the lineup and different parts, different innings, different games. Guys are competing. Certainly, in the postseason, you're seeing everyone's best.\n\"But, yeah, my hope is we regroup tomorrow, gather the information that we had from [Trey] Yesavage, and keep him in the hitting zone and understand what that split does, which is certainly helpful, and when we get the fastball, really get on it.\"The Dodgers through the first four games of the series have scored 17 runs, which doesn't sound like a disastrous total until you consider that Game 3 spanned 18 innings. Overall, the Dodgers in the World Series are batting .214/.315/.377 and just .207/.294/.207 with runners in scoring position. That's out of character, and it's why Roberts is pondering changes. At an individual level, Mookie Betts, Andy Pages, Tommy Edman, and Kiké Hernández -- that's almost half the lineup – have struggled badly. That quartet against the Blue Jays has combined for a slash line of just .147/.203/.162. No matter how good the rest of the lineup has been, it's hard to score runs when you're lugging that around. In particular, it'll be interesting to see if Roberts adjusts Betts, who's batted in the No. 2 spot behind leadoff man Shohei Ohtani in every game of the playoffs and almost every game of the regular season. \nBy the sounds of it, Roberts is going to push every button he can to wring more offense out of a lineup that's been mostly tamed by Toronto. That's not exactly a sign of desperation for L.A. -- the series is tied, after all -- but it is that things need to get better or they risk getting worse for the defending champs. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series is tied again and is now down to a best-of-three series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays.The Blue Jays got to Shohei Ohtani in Game 4 Tuesday and he was on the hook for four runs, including a two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shane Bieber, on the other hand, held the Dodgers hitters to just one run, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kiké Hernández. The Game 4 win ties the series at 2 and guarantees at least one more game in Toronto on Halloween. The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. \nThe Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners.

In the deal, the Steelers reportedly sent a sixth-round pick in exchange for Dugger and a seventh-round pick. To pave the way for the addition of Dugger, the Steelers are placing safety DeShon Elliott on injured reserve with a hyperextended knee, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport. Elliott was injured in last Sunday's loss to the Green Bay Packers. Dugger was a longtime starter in New England under Bill Belichick, but had fallen out of favor some under first-year coach Mike Vrabel. Dugger was reportedly available on the trade market before the start of the regular season as he was demoted to the second team. In seven games with four starts in 2025, Dugger has registered 17 combined tackles, but missed Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns due to a knee injury. \n        \n            \n                Steelers reportedly signing veteran safety Darrick Forrest as Mike Tomlin looks to fix sagging secondary\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDugger, who signed a four-year, $58 million contract extension in 2024, has started 69 of the 81 games he's played for the Patriots after the team selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. Dugger was the second defensive player traded by the Patriots on Tuesday. The team also reportedly shipped defensive end Keion White to the San Francisco 49ers. \nThe Steelers are hoping that the addition of Dugger will help a secondary that has struggled recently. In Sunday's 35-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers, quarterback Jordan Love carved up the Steelers to the tune of 360 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Steelers also reportedly signed former Washington Commanders safety Darrick Forrest to their practice squad earlier Tuesday. This came after the team worked out veteran safeties Vonn Bell and Eddie Jackson.The Steelers got off to a 4-1 start, but have dropped consecutive games to the Cincinnati Bengals and the Packers. In those games, Pittsburgh's defense has given up 688 passing yards and six touchdowns.\nThe Steelers will attempt to end their two-game losing streak when they take on the Indianapolis Colts in Week 9.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- The Blue Jays had just lost an 18-inning affair in which they had the Dodgers on the ropes multiple times. They were trailing 2-1 in the best-of-seven World Series with an exhausted bullpen. One of their best hitters was out of Game 4 with an injury and another one of their best hitters is playing hurt. If the starting pitcher faltered in Game 4, the series was likely as good as over -- because good luck beating these Dodgers three times in a row.The ball was given to Shane Bieber, and the veteran righty bested Shohei Ohtani. And now with a 6-2 Blue Jays win, the 2025 World Series is tied at two games apiece. The Fall Classic has been shrunk down to a three-game series. It will end in Toronto this weekend. \"There's no choice,\" Bieber said after the game of needing to step up after the 18-inning Game 3 marathon. \"What, are you going to feel sorry for yourself? It's the World Series, right? We're down one game. So now we find ourselves even, with a chance to take the lead, and take the lead back to Toronto after tomorrow. So, yeah, there wasn't much to say. Guys were tired. We left it all out there last night, and everybody's proud of each other. It was a grueling game, but at the same time you got to be able to turn the page, and we were able to do that and show up today with an excitement to go win another World Series game. So that's where we found ourselves. We really feel like we've got no choice, and we continue to grind and continue to play for each other and we'll find ourselves in a good spot.\"Bieber wasn't in the Blue Jays rotation much this season. He wasn't even on the team at the halfway point. The former Guardians ace was rehabbing from Tommy John surgery entering this season, his final year under contract with Cleveland (there's a $16 million player option for next year). The Blue Jays took a low-risk flier on him at the trade deadline, grabbing him in exchange for a Double-A pitcher named Khal Stephen. Bieber ended up becoming the first pitcher ever to miss the first four-plus months of the season via injury and then win a World Series game.\nThe thought process at the time of the trade might not have necessarily been \"Bieber will start what is essentially a must-win in the World Series,\" but surely there was an aim to have him ready and available to make some huge starts down the stretch and into the playoffs. \"We didn't initially know it was gonna be Game 4 of the World Series,\" Kevin Gausman said with a laugh. \"Having a guy of his expertise, his stature as a Cy Young winner, you feel pretty confident. He can make an adjustment, too, being not as crisp in the first, with his ability to find his breaking ball.\"Bieber allowed a second-inning run on a sacrifice fly from Enriqué Hernández before locking in. His final line: 5 ⅓ innings, four hits, one earned run, three walks, three strikeouts.\n\"For a guy that got here at the deadline, he's -- I mean, to me, he seems like he fits in really well,\" manager John Schneider said after the game. \"It's a really good complement to the starters that we have here, and it's so nice to have a group like that, that just kind of get it, you know? It's not an easy thing to do, get traded from the only team you've been with and then just have your life kind of flipped upside down in a new country and things, with a family. But he just settled in really well, and these are the spots that we acquired him for. And it's asking a lot of him, based on what he's been through with the recovery from the surgery and stuff. But he's enjoying it and he's embracing it and he's been a huge part of us getting here.\"Again, if Bieber had faltered early in this game, you could probably close the door on the Blue Jays' chances to win their first title in 32 years. Piecing together a marathon from the bullpen again wasn't going to fly, and the Dodgers are probably too good to take down three straight games. Bieber stepped up, though. \"We have confidence in him anytime he goes out there,\" said Gausman. \"He's awesome,\" said Ernie Clement. \"He just kept them off balance all night and made it easy for us on defense. Just an awesome game.\" \nReally, you have to credit the entire Blue Jays team. They fell behind early but bounced back. We've seen them rebound repeatedly. It happened so many times in the regular season. They came back from an 0-2 hole in the ALCS against the Mariners and then won Games 6 and 7 after returning to Toronto following a gut-punch of a loss in Game 5. They were trailing in Game 1 of the World Series before having an offensive explosion. And now, after an 18-inning loss that could have been devastating, they went out and hit the ball hard and got great pitching and defense. Oh, and did we mention that one of their best offensive players (George Springer) is hurt? No matter. The Blue Jays bounced back and evened the series. \"I think this is a quote from Herb Brooks,\" said Clement, citing the hockey coach who famously won the gold medal with the 1980 USA Olympic team. \"But we are a team of uncommon men. I think a normal team would've folded today and we are not normal. I think we're the best team in baseball and we got out of bed today with our hair on fire and ready to play.\" \"It did sting. We poured our hearts into that game, everyone,\" said Game 3 starter Max Scherzer, who noted that the loss wasn't quite the gut punch it seemed like from the outside. \"What we saw from everyone in this clubhouse gave us reason to believe in each other. We responded in a big way tonight.\" \nBieber was front and center. Remember all that talk leading up to Game 4 on whether or not the Blue Jays would even pitch to Shohei Ohtani? Bieber did walk Ohtani in the first inning, but after that, he struck him out twice. Those were the first two outs Ohtani made at Dodger Stadium since NLCS Game 3 on Oct. 16. \n\"Any time you can do that, keep the baseball,\" quipped Clement. Bieber's stuff wasn't overwhelmingly dominant or anything. It hasn't been most of this year, his first back since that surgery. It's tough, that first year back. Bieber just did his thing with command and guile. You could say he gutted his way through the fifth inning and into the sixth when the Jays just desperately needed a good start.He did leave two runners behind, but Mason Fluharty came out of the bullpen to pick Bieber up, much like Bieber picked up the entire bullpen in this one by working into the sixth inning. \n\"The identity of this team, the guys in that clubhouse,\" Bieber said after the game. \"It's hard to describe, other than it's an absolute pleasure each and every day. I think coming off of what could be a back-breaking loss last night, it was an absolute pleasure to show up today and see guys are, nobody changes, nobody ever wavers, nobody ever hesitates. It's the same group of guys each and every day that continue to put the work in, continue to compete, continue to rely on each other, and it's an absolute pleasure to play for them.\"And while we have to give credit to Fluharty and Chris Bassitt, normally a starter who was nails in relief in this one, let's not forget Bieber. Let's say the Jays do squeak out a close win in Game 5 with heavy workloads for their top relievers and then go on to win the World Series. Bieber shouldering the load into the sixth inning in Game 4 will have been vital to setting up Game 5. Now circle back to that trade in July. Bieber hadn't thrown an MLB pitch since April 2, 2024. He had only gotten up to 59 pitches in his minor-league rehab assignment while looking to return from major surgery. The Blue Jays thought it was worth a shot to grab him. \nIt was well worth it. Game 4 of the 2025 World Series proved as much. And the Blue Jays are now two wins away from their first World Series title since that legendary Joe Carter home run in 1993.\n            ",

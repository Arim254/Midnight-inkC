    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props like Kenneth Walker III anytime touchdown (-190) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1. You can only see the Seahawks vs. Patriots picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for Super Bowl LX that can be combined into an NFL SGP that returns $15,000 on just a $10 bet, and which optimal first touchdown scorer prop pays out 25-1?

New England famously won Super Bowl 49 on a fabled goal-line interception, but both teams are much different now. Bill Belichick was on the sidelines for the Pats back then while Tom Brady was under center. Now, former New England star Mike Vrabel is wrapping up his first season as the team's head coach while getting great quarterback play from second-year star Drake Maye. As for Seattle, gone are Pete Carroll and Russell Wilson and in are Mike Macdonald and Sam Darnold. Both quarterbacks have been in the spotlight not just with their play, but due to injuries ahead of Super Bowl 60. Now, both teams have released their final official injury reports on Friday, Feb. 6. Here, we break down the biggest Super Bowl injuries for bettors to know and share what the latest NFL betting odds look like at DraftKings Sportsbook for Super Bowl 60. For more Super Bowl 60 betting analysis and expert picks, visit SportsLine.Super Bowl 60 injuriesSeattle Seahawks vs. New England Patriots (Sunday, Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET)NE QB Drake Maye (right shoulder and illness, no injury designation)NE LB Robert Spillane (ankle, questionable)NE LB Harold Landry (knee, questionable)NE DT Joshua Farmer (hamstring, questionable)SEA S Nick Emmanwori (ankle, no injury designation)SEA FB Robbie Ouzts (neck, questionable)\nAll in all, both teams are in really good shape on the injury front entering the weekend. Both teams presented good news on Friday as New England didn't list star quarterback Drake Maye with any designation, and the same is the case for Seattle's standout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori. Maye was limited at times with a shoulder injury and even missed practice last week with an illness. Emmanwori suffered an ankle injury at practice on Wednesday and didn't practice Thursday, but he was a full participant on Friday. Additionally, Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who has been dealing with an oblique injury this postseason, was a full practice participant Thursday and Friday after being limited throughout the playoffs. Two Patriots starters on defense -- linebackers Harold Landry and Robert Spillane -- are questionable to play, as is rookie defensive tackle Joshua Farmer. Spillane had 97 total tackles this season and was limited Thursday and Friday while Landry had 8.5 sacks in the regular season and was limited Wednesday and Friday but didn't practice Thursday. For Seattle, starting rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts is questionable with a neck injury that caused him to miss the NFC title game. The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites in Super Bowl 60 over the Patriots, and the total is 45.5. Seattle is a -230 money line favorite (wager $230 to win $100) while the Patriots are +190 underdogs (wager $100 to win $190). The Seahawks are 14-5 against the spread this year and are 10-9 to the Over. The Patriots are 14-6 against the spread and 12-8 to the Over. Both teams finished the regular season with 14-3 overall records. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

The Pistons are on the second half of a back-to-back after a surprising loss to the Wizards on Thursday.

McConnell, who is $4,400 on FanDuel and $4,100 on DraftKings.

Both the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots have concluded their slate of practices and are now simply waiting to kick off Super Bowl LX on Sunday. With these on-field preparations now in the books, we also have a final look at the health statuses for both franchises as they've released their final injury reports of the week. Coming into Super Bowl week, the injury storylines surrounding both of these clubs centered on their quarterbacks. Sam Darnold had been nursing an oblique injury, while Drake Maye had been working through an injury to his right throwing shoulder. Their situations cleared up as the week progressed, but there was some concern for Seattle defensive back Nick Emmanwori, who suffered an ankle injury this week at practice. Below, we'll provide an update on Emmanwori and reveal the game statuses for both Seattle and New England.Seattle Seahawks (-4.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, streaming on PeacockTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawksRobbie OuztsFBNeckQuestionablePatriotsJoshua FarmerDLHamstringQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableRobert SpillaneLBAnkleQuestionableSeahawks: The most notable development for Seattle is that Emmanwori carries no injury designation, meaning he will play on Super Bowl Sunday despite that ankle injury. After missing Thursday's session, Emmanwori was back in the fold Friday as a full participant. Offensive tackle Charles Cross was also upgraded to a full participant after being limited at the start of the week, so the Seahawks are quite healthy coming into this matchup. \nPatriots: New England is also pretty healthy. All eyes were fixated on Drake Maye, but the second-year quarterback opened up the week as a full participant at practice, and that remained the case through Friday. He has no injury designation, meaning he is good to go. Linebacker Robert Spillane is listed as questionable after missing Wednesday's practice and being limited on both Thursday and Friday, but has been adamant when speaking to reporters this week that he'll suit up. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Former Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is joining the Los Angeles Rams' coaching staff, ESPN reported on Friday. Kingsbury spent the last two seasons with Washington. He oversaw the development of quarterback Jayden Daniels, the 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, as the Commanders advanced to the NFC Championship but parted ways with the franchise after a 5-12 record in an injury-plagued 2025 season.Kingsbury and Rams coach Sean McVay had been speaking for the last two weeks about the partnership, according to ESPN. After Kingsbury didn't land the offensive coordinator job with the New York Giants, the path was clear for him to head back to the West Coast. Kingsbury's job title for 2026 is unclear at the moment, but the Rams have a vacancy at offensive coordinator after Mike LaFleur was hired by the Arizona Cardinals last week. The Rams lost to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship but received good news Thursday night when quarterback Matthew Stafford announced his return for his 18th NFL season during his MVP acceptance speech. \n\n        \n            \n                Three voters turned NFL MVP race upside down: How Justin Herbert and Josh Allen helped Matthew Stafford win\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore returning to the NFL as an offensive coordinator in 2024, Kingsbury served as a senior offensive analyst under Lincoln Riley at USC. Before that, Kingsbury was the coach of the Cardinals for four seasons, finishing with a 28-37-1 record during his lone stint as a head coach in the league. Kingsbury also had a six-year run coaching Texas Tech, his alma mater. He amassed a 35-40 record during that span and led the Red Raiders to three bowl games. Kingsbury, 46, interviewed for the vacant coaching jobs of the Baltimore Ravens and Tennessee Titans earlier this cycle. The Ravens hired former Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, while Tennessee tabbed San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh as the next coach.\nWith Kingsbury, the Rams are adding another respected offensive mind to their staff. Los Angeles passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase was a coveted name in the coaching carousel, but will stay with the team. McVay said this week that an \"extensive search\" for LaFleur's replacement will take place with \"in-house candidates\" in contention for the offensive coordinator role. \n            \n    ",

For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too.

    "body": "\n        Just in time for the World Cup, James Rodriguez has a new club, joining Minnesota United as a free agent. The Colombian national team captain was last at Club Leon in Liga MX, departing after a strange time there. While Roriguez joined as part of the club ramping up to compete in the Club World Cup, they ended up being banned from the tournament, and Rodriguez departed after the end of his contract after making 14 appearances and scoring three goals and assisting two more.Now 34, Rodriguez heads to the North Star State on a six-month contract with a club option to extend  for another six months. This allows him time to get back up to speed ahead of the World Cup while adding a top attacker alongside Joaquin Pereya. While there may be questions about how much Rodriguez has left in his legs as he heads to MLS, one certain thing is that he can still pass with the best midfielders in North America.The chart below shows Rodriguez from his time at Club Leon, and there's a lot to like about the passing numbers that he brings. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            With Pereya, Bongokuhle Hlongwane ad Kevin Yeboah tasked with putting the ball in the back of the net, the Colombian midfielder can drop it in a bucket for attackers to run onto. He can also bring excellent set play delivery to a team that led the league in goals from set pieces, excluding penalties. Looking at their set piece goals, Minnesota led the league by five with 22 goals in 34 games played, and it's a number that could rise via Rodriguez.After goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair's departure for Inter Miami and head coach Eric Ramsay leaving for West Bromwich Albion, there will be questions about whether the midfield and backline can handle Pereya and Rodriguez being light on the defensive end of things, but it will still make for fun soccer this season. Wil Trapp and Nectarios Triantis started Minnesota's final game of the season in midfield, a conference semifinal loss to San Diego FC, and will need to be everywhere to protect the midfield this season.\nTrapp is 33, though, and there's always a point where it can become too much for defensive midfielders trying to keep up with the pace of play. If Minnesota can avoid that, they'll be in a great place this season with Rodriguez in the squad, but having such an attacking luxury doesn't come without drawbacks. It's all about balance when competing on all fronts, and that's a task that will now fall on new head coach Cameron Knowles. It's also easier to defend when your team can put the ball in the back of the net, and Minnesota United should score early, often, and frequently this season.  \n            ",

The Americans certainly have the team to compete for another gold medal thanks to a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars, and they will look to keep their strong start going on Saturday against Finland. The Americans were dominant to open Olympic play on Thursday with a 5-1 win over Czechia. Hayley Scamurra led the way with two goals, team captain Hilary Knight went top shelf late in the second period to extend the lead to 4-1 and Aerin Frankel stopped 13 of 14 shots in net to help the Americans open Olympic play on a positive note.\nAlong with Canada, Team USA is one of just two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.Team USA is poised to retake its place atop the international hockey hierarchy, and it enters the Olympics as the favorite to win gold. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, it's another two-horse race between the U.S. (-155) and Canada (+115), at least on paper. The next closest gold medal contenders are Czechia (+6000) and Sweden (+6000).As is typically the case, the Americans have put together a roster that's loaded at every position, and there's a good mix of experience and youth. Knight is making her fifth Olympic appearance, and star Kendall Coyne Schofield will make her fourth Olympic appearance. Defenders Megan Keller and Lee Stecklein are also familiar with the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, rising stars Taylor Heise, Carlone Harvey and Laila Edwards are getting their first taste of Olympic action.The Americans continue this Olympic journey with a matchup against Finland on Saturday, and we'll keep you up to date with each result along the way.\nU.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 USA vs. Finland | Saturday, Feb. 7 | 10:40 a.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Switzerland | Monday, Feb. 9 | 2:40 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 edition of the World Baseball Classic is a month away and, Thursday night, rosters for all 20 teams were announced. Team USA is loaded and the early favorite to win the tournament, though they are hardly a lock. Japan is the defending WBC champion, and the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Venezuela are also sporting stacked rosters.            All 20 rosters can be viewed here. The Mets lead the way with 17 players participating in the WBC, though 11 of the 30 MLB teams are sending at least 12 players to the tournament, and 18 MLB teams are sending at least 10. The Astros and Nationals are the laggers with three WBC players apiece. Every other team is sending at least five players to the WBC.           Here now are six takeaways from the WBC roster announcements.                      1. This is the best USA roster ever           Both on paper and according to the gory math. Baseball America ran the numbers and found that, based on the previous year's WAR, this is the best roster USA has ever sent to the WBC. Here are the totals via Baseball America:           2006: 109.5 WAR in 20052009: 101.6 WAR in 20082013: 78.2 WAR in 20122017: 86.9 WAR in 20162023: 100.0 WAR in 20222026: 118.1 WAR in 2025A reminder how little this matters: USA went 3-3 and was eliminated in the second round in 2006, and the 2017 team went 6-2 and won the WBC. Ultimately, the WBC is small sample sizes on top of small sample sizes, and anything can happen once you get out of pool play and into a single-elimination format. It's baseball. Randomness reigns supreme.           \nOn paper, this is the best roster USA has ever taken into the WBC, especially pitching-wise. The Americans will start their rotation with reigning Cy Young winners Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal, and have Joe Ryan and Logan Webb backing them up. It's the best USA rotation and roster in WBC history. Now it just has to work.                      2. The Dominican Republic has the pitching to match its lineup           The Dominican Republic's lineup reads like an All-Star Game lineup: Junior Caminero, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Manny Machado, Ketel Marte, Jeremy Peña, Geraldo Perdomo, Julio Rodríguez, Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis Jr., and more. It is a deeper and more powerful offense than even what USA will run out there, plus the defense could be excellent depending who plays where.           Of course, that is more or less the same lineup the Dominican Republic had in the 2023 WBC, when they went 2-2 and rather embarrassingly failed to advance out of the first round. The 2026 team will have much better support on the mound though, with Brayan Bello, Cristopher Sánchez, and Luis Severino joining erstwhile ace Sandy Alcantara. The 2023 rotation included Roansy Contreras and late career Johnny Cueto, and just wasn't very imposing behind Alcantara and Cristian Javier.           \nSimilar to USA, this is the most talented roster the Dominican Republic has ever taken in the WBC, at least on paper. I suspect this group has a pretty big chip on its collective shoulder too after that disappointingly quick exit in 2023. The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and, regardless of what happened in 2023, is on the short list of top contenders in 2026.                      3. Insurance issues really hurt Puerto Rico           No team lost more important players to insurance trouble than Puerto Rico. They'll be without stalwarts José Berríos, Victor Caratini, Carlos Correa, and Francisco Lindor because they were denied insurance, and also Javier Báez because he tested positive for marijuana during the 2023 WBC. Báez is serving a two-year period of ineligibility (April 26, 2024, to April 26, 2026) from World Baseball Softball Confederation events. (MLB has permitted marijuana use since 2020, though it is still banned by the WBSC.)           With no Báez, Correa, and Lindor, Puerto Rico's infield will feature eight-time All-Star Nolan Arenado and several players not yet proven at the MLB level: Edwin Arroyo (Reds), Darell Hernaiz (Athletics), and Luis Vázquez (Orioles). The rotation without Berríos will lean on Yankees' top pitching prospect Elmer Rodríguez. Martín Maldonado, who announced his MLB retirement in October, and Christian Vázquez, and unsigned free agent, will handle catching duties in Caratini's absence.           \nLosing important players is bad enough. To make it worse, Puerto Rico will host Pool A in San Juan, so the team will be without so many of its biggest stars while playing games on home soil. To be sure, Puerto Rico has legitimate MLB players on its roster (Arenado, Seth Lugo, Heliot Ramos, etc.), but the team is not nearly as strong as it could be, largely because their key players were not cleared by the insurance company used by MLB and the MLBPA. What a shame.           4. Italy is a sleeper           A common theme this WBC is teams having their best ever roster. That is true for Italy, who will start their rotation with Aaron Nola and Michael Lorenzen. They're the two best starters Italy has ever had in the WBC (sorry, 2023 Matt Harvey). They'll build a more than respectable lineup around Jac Caglianone, Dominic Canzone, Jakob Marsee, Vinnie Pasquantino, and Kyle Teel. Brewers' 2025 first-round pick Andrew Fischer is on the roster as well. He'll provided even more lefty might.           Italy advanced to the second round in 2023 and the separator for the team this year could be a bullpen that includes several legit MLB-caliber arms: Gordon Graceffo, Matt Festa, Alek Jacob, Ron Marinaccio, Kyle Nicolas, Adam Ottavino, and Greg Weissert. Pitchers are on hard pitch limits in the WBC and they're especially restrictive in the early rounds. A good bullpen can make all the difference and Italy will have its best WBC bullpen ever. The paisans are firmly on sleeper watch going into the WBC.           \n           5. Several free agents are playing           The WBC is a chance for players to represent their countries, first and foremost. For some players, it's a chance to show big league teams that hey, I can still do this, and you should sign me. Several unsigned free agents will play in the WBC, most notably former MVP Paul Goldschmidt. He is on USA's roster and will back up Bryce Harper at first base, and possibly pinch-hit against tough lefties in the late innings. Goldschmidt was part of USA's WBC-winning team in 2017.           Other unsigned free agents on WBC rosters include Jon Berti (Italy), Tommy Kahnle (Israel), Germán Márquez (Venezuela), Jose Quintana (Colombia), Tomoyuki Sugano (Japan), Ramón Urías (Mexico), and Christian Vázquez (Puerto Rico). Some will sign in the weeks leading up to the WBC and some could very well sign after the WBC. For these unsigned free agents, the WBC is a chance to prepare for the season and showcase themselves as much as it is a chance to represent their countries.                      6. Remembering some guys           The WBC has a knack for bringing players out of retirement. The best example is Eric Gagne suiting up for Canada in 2017, nearly a decade following his last MLB appearance. This year's WBC will feature former White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramirez. Now 44, Ramirez is on Cuba's roster despite not playing in the big leagues since 2016, and not playing anywhere since 2018. Ramirez will be the oldest player ever to play in the WBC.           \nOther players returning to the field in the WBC after being out of baseball for some time include Erisbel Arruebarrena (Cuba), Phillippe Aumont (Canada), Lucius Fox (Great Britain), James Paxton (Canada), and Vance Worley (Great Britain). Aumont and Worley have not pitched professionally since playing in the last WBC.           The WBC is really great, really entertaining baseball featuring players passionately representing their countries. It's also a great time to remember some guys, and the 2026 WBC certainly delivers on that front.           \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A specific blueprint for getting to the Super Bowl doesn't exist. Championship-caliber rosters can be built under the salary cap in a variety of ways.The New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks were two of the NFL's most aggressive teams in free agency. A big spending spree that pays instant dividends with a Super Bowl trip is rare.The following chart outlines the cap charges for the Patriots' and Seahawks' key contributors throughout the season at each position and on special teams. That's 30 players for the Patriots and 31 for the Seahawks. Both teams have 15 players on offense. The Seahawks have one more defensive player than the Patriots, who utilize 15.Dead money -- a salary cap charge for a player no longer on a team's roster -- is also tracked. The NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement's $315 daily amount for participating in a team's voluntary offseason workout program is included in the cap numbers.\nPositionPatriotsSeahawksQB$8,336,984$13,400,000RB$8,544,975$5,404,810WR$16,721,019$16,317,554TE$16,518,585$2,764,375OL$39,399,856$16,948,402Edge$17,803,602$25,872,976Interior DL$30,149,215$23,761,940LB$15,270,050$6,330,658CB$21,303,206$16,122,714S$2,921,846$12,889,390ST$2,864,537$12,668,398Dead Money$51,962,585$79,838,929The NFL salary cap is $279.2 million for the 2025 league year. Each team's actual salary cap (known as the adjusted salary cap) typically differs from the league's set amount because unused cap room can be carried over from one year to the next, and other adjustments can further increase or decrease cap space.The leaguewide average is $293.485 million, according to NFLPA data. Only two teams, the San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns, have a larger adjusted salary cap than the Patriots. Carrying over $34.855 million of unused cap space from the 2024 league year is the primary reason New England's adjusted salary cap sits at $322.5 million.Despite New England holding a little more than a $46 million advantage over Seattle's $286.39 million adjusted salary cap, the salary cap expenditures are fairly close. Seattle's are $271.362 million, while New England's are $275.234 million. The Patriots are carrying over the NFL's most cap space to the 2026 league year at $47.27 million.\nSeattle's key contributor cap spending skews heavily toward the defensive side of the ball. That isn't surprising considering the Seahawks arguably have the NFL's best defense. It's $54.835 million on offense and just under $85 million on defense. The Patriots have a more even distribution, with $85.521 million devoted to offense and $87.4 million to defense.Dead MoneyDead money exists because of how salary cap accounting rules operate. Signing bonuses, option bonuses and certain roster bonuses are prorated -- or spread evenly -- over the life of a contract for a maximum of five years. When a player is released, traded or retires, the remaining proration of these salary components immediately accelerates onto his team's current salary cap.There are two major exceptions to this general rule. Only the current year's proration counts toward the salary cap if a transaction occurs after June 1. The bonus proration in future contract years is delayed until the next league year beginning the following March. A team can also release two players each league year prior to June 2 (known as a post-June 1 designation) who will be treated under the salary cap as if they were released after June 1. With a post-June 1 designation, a team must carry the player's full cap number until June 2 even though he is no longer on the roster. The player's salary comes off the books at that time unless it is guaranteed.\nThis means dead money is typically a sunk cost where money isn't owed to a player. Only when salary guarantees remain at release will there be a payment associated with dead money.Both teams have significant dead money. New England's sits at $51.96 million. Safety Kyle Dugger, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in late October, carries the biggest charge at $11,094,067.The Seahawks are essentially operating with one hand tied behind their back because of a below-average adjusted salary cap and $79.8 million of dead money. Wide receiver DK Metcalf's $21 million is tied for 2025's seventh-largest dead money charge after he was traded to the Steelers in March. Seattle has three other dead money charges larger than Dugger's: defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones, wide receiver Tyler Lockett and quarterback Geno Smith at $14,072,918, $13.895 million and $13.5 million, respectively.\nOFFENSEQuarterback Neither team has a high-priced quarterback. The Seahawks signed Sam Darnold to a three-year, $100.5 million contract averaging $33.5 million per year (worth a maximum of $115.5 million through incentives) with $55 million in guarantees, including $37.5 million fully guaranteed at signing, during free agency. He's a good value considering the average salary for 2025 starting quarterbacks -- excluding those on rookie contracts -- is $44,067,508 per year, according to NFLPA data. Darnold's $13.4 million cap number ranks 20th among quarterbacks. It's $100,000 less than Smith's dead money.A high-caliber quarterback on a rookie contract, like 2024 third overall pick Drake Maye, is the most valuable commodity in the NFL because of the roster flexibility it provides. Maye's cap number is $8,336,984. The Patriots will have at least one more year of a cost-effective cap number before he becomes eligible for a contract extension after the 2026 regular season.Running back The Patriots have a bigger investment at running back because Rhamondre Stevenson ($5,543,696 cap number) is the only ball carrier of consequence on a veteran deal. Stevenson signed a four-year, $36 million extension (worth up to $48 million through incentives) averaging $9 million per year with $17.116 million fully guaranteed in 2024. TreVeyon Henderson led the Patriots in rushing with 960 yards. The 2025 second-round pick has a $2,031,199 cap number.\nKenneth Walker III ($2,693,517) and Zach Charbonnet ($1,884,114) split carries for the Seahawks. Charbonnet is missing the Super Bowl after tearing the ACL in his left knee during a divisional playoff game against the 49ers.Wide receiver New England's big-ticket item at wide receiver is Stefon Diggs ($10,501,260). The Patriots signed him to a three-year, $63.5 million contract (worth a maximum of $69 million through incentives) with an extremely team-friendly structure in March, a couple of weeks into free agency, despite the right ACL tear he suffered midway through the 2024 season. Mack Hollins ($4,059,765), another free-agent pickup, took the most offensive snaps for a Patriots wide receiver during the regular season with 656.Seattle's combined dead money for Metcalf and Lockett ($34.895 million) is more than double its actual wide receiver cap charges. Jaxon Smith-Njigba ($3,939,238) was just named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year. The Seahawks didn't hesitate to sign Cooper Kupp ($9,478,820) to a three-year, $45 million contract in March after the Los Angeles Rams released him. There was a glaring need at wide receiver because of Metcalf's and Lockett's departures. Acquiring Rashid Shaheed from the New Orleans Saints for 2026 fourth- and fifth-round picks was a great trade-deadline addition. His cost for half the season was $2.1 million.\n\n        \n            \n                Inside the 3 traits that make the Seattle Seahawks' Jaxon Smith-Njigba a nightmare for defenses\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTight endIt's experience versus youth at tight end. Hunter Henry has New England's fifth-largest cap number at $11,509,765. Austin Hooper's $5,008,820 cap number is just over 80% more than the collective cap hits of 2024 fourth-round pick A.J. Barner ($1,157,597) and 2025 second-round pick Elijah Arroyo ($1,606,778), who are both on rookie deals.Offensive lineSeattle's entire starting offensive line -- besides Abraham Lucas ($4,663,474) -- is on rookie contracts. Left tackle Charles Cross ($6,812,701) signed a four-year, $104.4 million extension averaging $26.1 million per year with $75 million in guarantees in January. Because the deal was completed after the regular season, proration of his $25 million signing bonus couldn't begin in the 2025 league year and will instead run from 2026 through 2030. The Seahawks used the 18th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft on left guard Grey Zabel, who has a $3,362,794 cap number.Right guard Michael Onwenu is the only holdover from New England's 2024 offensive line and carries the team's largest cap number at $21,008,820. He signed a three-year, $57 million deal averaging $19 million per year with $36.5 million fully guaranteed in 2024. Right tackle Morgan Moses ($4,704,725) and center Garrett Bradbury ($4,608,820) were free-agent additions. Left tackle Will Campbell ($7,943,715) was selected with the fourth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nDEFENSEEdge rusher Seattle's edge rotation is headlined by DeMarcus Lawrence ($8,286,483) and Uchenna Nwosu. Lawrence left the Dallas Cowboys after 11 seasons believing he couldn't win a Super Bowl there, signing a three-year, $32.5 million contract with $18 million in guarantees in free agency. Incentives and escalators can push the deal to $41.5 million. Nwosu's cap number dropped from $21,283,333 to $12,450,853 after he took a $7.05 million pay cut to remain in Seattle. His reworked deal also includes $3 million in not-likely-to-be-earned incentives.New England's most productive pass rushers came via free agency. Harold Landry ($8,509,450) signed a three-year, $43.5 million deal (worth up to $48 million through incentives) with $26 million fully guaranteed. K'Lavon Chaisson ($3,979,135) received a one-year, $3 million deal worth up to $5 million through incentives. Chaisson and Landry led the Patriots with 7.5 and 8.5 sacks, respectively. Landry has been slowed by a knee injury that kept him out of the AFC Championship Game.Defensive interiorThe Patriots are the only NFL team that has signed two interior defensive linemen to contracts averaging at least $20 million per year. Christian Barmore signed a four-year, $84 million extension (worth up to $92 million through incentives) with $41,822,128 in guarantees in 2024. Milton Williams' four-year, $104 million free-agent deal with $63 million in guarantees ($51 million fully guaranteed at signing) made him the NFL's third-highest-paid interior defensive lineman at $26 million annually. Barmore and Williams carry New England's second- and third-largest cap numbers at $15,109,450 and $14,009,750.\nLeonard Williams is Seattle's highest-paid defensive player. He signed a three-year, $64.5 million deal averaging $21.5 million per year with $43.85 million in guarantees in 2024. Williams has Seattle's largest cap number among players under contract at $15,094,715. 2024 first-round pick Byron Murphy II carries a $3,664,075 cap figure.Linebacker The Patriots allocate more resources to off-ball linebackers. Robert Spillane ($9,010,080) signed a three-year, $33 million contract averaging $11 million per year with $20.6 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent. Incentives can push the deal to $37.5 million. New England also matched the Las Vegas Raiders' two-year, $13.508 million restricted free-agent offer sheet to retain Christian Elliss, whose cap hit is $4,850,505.Ernest Jones was a key Seahawks re-signing, receiving a three-year, $28.5 million contract worth up to $33 million through incentives and escalators. He earned second-team All-Pro honors this season.\nCornerback New England turned to free agency to pair a veteran with Christian Gonzalez ($4,127,784), a 2024 second-team All-Pro. Carlton Davis signed a three-year, $54 million contract averaging $18 million per year with $34.5 million fully guaranteed. Incentives can push the deal to $60 million. Davis has New England's fourth-largest cap number at $12,001,890.The Patriots also rewarded Marcus Jones with a three-year, $36 million extension averaging $12 million annually (worth up to $40.5 million through incentives) in October. His 2025 cap number rose from $1,656,032 to $4,213,532.The bulk of Seattle's cornerback cap charges come from Devon Witherspoon and Riq Woolen. Witherspoon, a Pro Bowler in each of his first three seasons, leads the group with an $8,697,910 cap hit. Woolen's $5,437,244 cap charge stems from his fourth-year salary escalating to the $5.346 million second-round restricted free-agent tender after his original-ballot Pro Bowl selection as a rookie in 2022.Safety The Patriots have a minimal investment at safety after trading Dugger and releasing Jabrill Peppers during roster cutdowns. Free-agent pickup Jaylinn Hawkins ($1,810,080) has been a tremendous value.Seattle's safety cap charges are nearly 4.5 times higher than New England's. Julian Love ($6,120,131) is the highest-paid safety on either roster after signing a three-year, $33 million extension with $18.6 million in guarantees in 2024. Nick Emmanwori ($2,113,667) has drawn comparisons to Ravens All-Pro Kyle Hamilton because of his versatility. The 2025 second-round pick finished as the Defensive Rookie of the Year runner-up.Special teams The special teams cap charges are night and day. The Patriots have punter Bryce Baringer ($1,084,694) and kicker Andy Borregales ($909,273) on rookie contracts.The Seahawks have the NFL's highest-paid punter in Michael Dickson at $4.05 million per year. Dickson's $4,801,260 cap hit is the second-largest for a punter in 2025. Jason Myers carries the biggest kicker cap number at $6,826,465 and is the only kicker above $5.75 million.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With less than six weeks until Selection Sunday and conference races heating up across the college basketball landscape, Saturday is set to provide a platform for spectacular theater as the sport kicks into high gear near the homestretch of the regular season. On tap we have 21 ranked teams in action, three ranked vs. ranked matchups and one top-10 vs. top-10 showdown in the Big 12.  At the center of most people's attention will be an evening epic as No. 4 Duke travels to No. 14 North Carolina in college basketball's best rivalry. Duke is gunning for a fourth consecutive win over UNC, which it's not accomplished in more than a decade. And it is attempting to do so behind enemy lines vs. a Tar Heels team that -- don't look now! -- has won fourth straight and found a groove behind stars Caleb Wilson and Henri Veesaar.  \n        \n            \n                Duke vs. UNC: Cameron Boozer and Caleb Wilson set up rivalry's best NBA prospect matchup in last 40 years\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the Big 12, No. 8 Houston travels to face No. 16 BYU in Provo in a game that has Big 12 title and NCAA Tournament seeding implications. Houston has won the league every year since joining -- but BYU has lost just once all season at home.  In the Big Ten there is an equally large showdown as No. 5 Illinois, winners of 12 straight, travels to East Lansing to face No. 10 Michigan State. The Illini are tied for first place in the Big Ten standings with Michigan. With eight games remaining, a win in one of college basketball's best environments would do wonders for that team's conference title hopes.  \nWith so much at stake and so many tremendous games on tap, our team has picks below for some of the best we'll be watching closely. Those picks are below.  Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET    Oregon at No. 12 Purdue  \n1 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium: Oregon is 0-13 against Quad 1 and 2 opponents this season. The Ducks have the longest losing streak in the conference and have gone from a preseason tournament team to a group hoping not to finish last in the Big Ten. For Oregon to pull the upset, this has to be a low-scoring game. I don't see that happening, even if Bittle returns to the lineup. Purdue cruises to an easy win and gets back on track for good. Pick: Purdue -19 (Salerno)  \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            PUR -19.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Oregon\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n      No. 4 Duke at No. 14 North Carolina  \n6:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): One extra layer is North Carolina's potent, quick-strike transition attack against a Duke transition defense that has been shaky multiple times this year. Duke's halfcourt defense can force UNC into some hiccups, but if the Tar Heels can get out in the open floor, there are buckets to be had. Ultimately, these frontcourts look close to a draw. Is Duke's backcourt this much better than UNC's? I can't quite get there. Pick: North Carolina +5.5 (Trotter)\n  \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            DUKE -5.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

I know which side I lean. Perhaps it's a trap with the Illini here -- MSU is largely unshakeable at home under Tom Izzo -- but the Spartans are 5-5 as home favorites against the spread this season.

This is a spot Kelvin Sampson-coached teams typically pounce on, and a chance to remain in Big 12 title contention for his Cougars is more than enough ammo to get Houston up and ready for a potential shootout. Pick: Houston -1.5 (Boone)     \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UH -1.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Remember how just last week Yankees general manager Brian Cashman was pushing back against the narrative that his team is simply \"running it back\" with basically the same team from last season? Yeah, this won't help. The Yankees are finalizing a deal to bring back free agent first baseman Paul Goldschmidt on a one-year deal, according to ESPN.Goldschmidt, 38, is in the twilight of an amazing career that might one day land him in the Hall of Fame. Last season, he hit .274/.328/.403 (104 OPS+), but that was held up by a really hot start that didn't last. In his last 90 games, Goldschmidt hit .223/.274/.330 and by the time the playoffs came around, he wasn't a regular starter. The opening for playing time in 2026 for Goldschmidt would be the right-handed hitting side of a platoon at first base with lefty-swinging Ben Rice. Rice hit just .208 against lefties last season, so there's an opportunity for Goldschmidt to grab at-bats against tough lefties, at least to start the season. \nTo this point, Goldschmidt has played in parts of 15 MLB seasons. He's a career .288/.378/.504 (137 OPS+) hitter with 2,190 hits, 477 doubles, 372 home runs, 1,232 RBI, 1,280 runs, 174 stolen bases and 63.8 WAR. The seven-time All-Star and 2022 NL MVP ranks 16th all-time in WAR among first basemen. \n            \n    ",

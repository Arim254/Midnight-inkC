In 2011  I played completely shit faced drunk in at least 8 games,\" Jammer wrote.Jammer said that football players deal with real-life issues just like everyone else, no matter how much money you make or how famous you are. He also lamented the fact that his public revelation was shocking enough for people to bypass the message itself. He was trying to be vulnerable to reach those who are currently struggling.\"U know why n----- kill themselves? Because they can't b vulnerable,\" Jammer posted. \"So all that shit just gets trapped with nowhere to go. To embarrassed to ask for help. Family watching them deteriorate. But go ahead bash me for being vulnerable. I ain't dead n---!!\"\nJammer was a former No. 5 overall pick of the Chargers out of the University of Texas in 2002. The outside corner was a consistent presence in the San Diego secondary for 11 years, and contributed to five playoff trips. That includes the 2007 season, when the Chargers fell to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. In 172 career games played for the Chargers, Jammer recorded 721 tackles, 138 passes defensed, seven forced fumbles and 21 interceptions. During Jammer's alleged \"drunk\" season in 2011, he recorded 53 tackles, eight passes defensed and zero interceptions in 15 games played. It was one of two seasons with the Chargers in which he failed to intercept a pass, and the first season in which Jammer did not record double-digit passes defensed. \nFollowing 2011, Jammer would go on to play one more season with the Chargers before finishing his career with the Denver Broncos in 2013. While he never made a Pro Bowl, Jammer was selected to the Chargers' 50th Anniversary Team in 2020. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Byes are done with for the 2025 NFL season, which means you have a full complement of Week 15 Fantasy football picks to choose from as the Fantasy playoffs arrive in mayn leagues. There are, however, player injuries, which is a season-long thing to deal with when composing a Fantasy football strategy. Nonetheless, the likes of Drake Maye, Jaxson Dart, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and Tetairoa McMillan are back in action after being on a bye. But who should start along side them in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups?Speaking of injuries, Daniel Jones (Achilles) was one of many casualties on Sunday, as those who have been riding him all season long at quarterback are likely seeking out some Week 15 Fantasy football advice. His absence has a ripple effect, and while Jonathan Taylor remains a must-start, where do the Fantasy football projections forecast for Colts pass catchers like Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren with the Colts uncertain on their quarterbacks plans and even bringing Philip Rivers in as an option?Before making your Week 15 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 15 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 15 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 15 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 15: The model is fading Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who ranks third at his position in both receiving yards and in Fantasy points, may not warrant a spot in Week 15 Fantasy football lineups. Warren is a by-product of Indy's passing game, which just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, has Anthony Richardson on IR, and has third-strong rookie, Riley Leonard (knee) dealing with his own ailment, leading to the Rivers signing this week. Warren had season lows in both catches (2) and yards (15) on Sunday, with Leonard playing most of the game. Not much more is expected on Sunday versus Seattle, which has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 6 total defense. Warren sits outside the top 15 in Fantasy football TE rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr., despite him being the RB50 in standard leagues and being started in just 35% of leagues this week. Rodriguez has leapfrogged Jacory Croskey-Merritt on the depth chart, as the former has more touches each of the last three weeks. He hasn't disappointed with more opportunities as Rodriguez has at least 52 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five straight games. With the Giants' league-worst run defense on tap, as New York allows the most yards per carry and the second-most rushing yards per game, Rodriguez should find his way into your Week 15 Fantasy football lineups.

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    OF/DH Kyle Schwarber, free agentSchwarber, one of the game's most productive hitters, hasn't yet chosen which team he'll suit up for during the coming regular season. He has, however, declared that he'll play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. Schwarber has averaged a 135 OPS+ with 47 home runs per season over the last three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Will Smith, DodgersSmith, fresh off winning a second World Series title in a row, will be in the squat for Team USA as he pursues an international championship to add to his collection. Smith has developed into one of the best backstops in baseball and over the past three seasons has amassed a 125 OPS+ and 12 Wins Above Replacement.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    INF Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson will be making his first WBC appearance after blossoming into a star with the Orioles in recent years. Over the course of his first four seasons in the majors, he's compiled a 134 OPS+ and more than 21 Wins Above Replacement. His experience at shortstop and third base could come in handy, depending on the rest of the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2B Brice Turang, BrewersTurang is fresh off a breakout season with the Brewers that saw him post new career highs in home runs (18) and WAR (5.6). He's a high-quality defender capable of stealing a base as well, giving him a broad base of skills.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Garrett Cleavinger, RaysOne of the game's more underrated relievers, Cleavinger figures to be DeRosa's go-to lefty in the WBC. He threw 61 ⅓ innings with a 2.35 ERA in 2025, and struck out 33.7% of the batters he faced. That was a top-15 mark among relievers, and fourth highest among lefties. Cleavinger held same-side hitters to a .187 batting average and .274 on-base percentage this past season, his sixth in the majors and fourth with Tampa.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Griffin Jax, RaysJax, one of the most sought after relievers at the 2025 trade deadline, will be part of USA's bullpen in the WBC. The former Twin/current Ray had an unsightly 4.23 ERA this past season, though his underlying numbers are off the charts good. Jax's 35.0% strikeout rate and 18.1% swinging strike rate are among the very best in baseball thanks to a monster sweeper and upper-90s fastball. Few pitchers are as good at missing bats as Jax. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two years of the College Football Playoff's 12-team era painted a clear picture of today's NIL realities. That is, while programs can still compete at the highest level with modest budgets, the most surefire path to a prominent seed and national championship contention is to invest an extreme load of money into a star-studded roster. Some of the biggest spenders from the 2025 offseason find themselves, to no surprise, at the top of this year's bracket.Overachievers prove every year that money is not always everything. They require a special blend of coaching acumen and talented players who, in many cases, earn paychecks at wealthier programs at season's end. Doing more with less can result in a CFP berth, but time and time again, the playoff process separates the haves from the have-nots by the end of the national championship game.Programs over the last five years displayed their NIL capabilities on the recruiting trail and with their player retention efforts, providing evidence of where they stand in the national pecking order.Here are the 2025 CFP participants grouped into NIL spending power tiers.Elite spenders\n    \n                                        \n    Ohio StateThe Buckeyes were not shy about the $20 million price tag associated with their roster a year ago. That investment put Ohio State effectively in its own universe, and while other programs will catch up, it will always have an advantage in the revenue-sharing era as perhaps the most valuable and recognizable brand in the sport. Acquiring and retaining an inordinate amount of college football's biggest stars -- Julian Sayin, Jeremiah Smith and Caleb Downs chief among them this year -- comes with an astronomical financial burden that Ohio State has proven more than willing to tackle.\n\n    \n                                        \n    OregonOregon's relationship with Phil Knight has made playing for the Ducks a lucrative opportunity. With the Nike co-founder committed to doing what it takes to win a national championship, Oregon continues to inch closer to a full breakthrough. That could come as soon as this season, but if not, it is probably only a matter of time. Dan Lanning stacked the most loaded recruiting classes in program history on top of each other and has the No. 3-ranked haul in the 2026 cycle, per 247Sports. The aggressive NIL operation makes his elite talent acquisition both possible and sustainable.\n    \n                                        \n    Texas TechThere is a new player in the college football arms race, and it resides in West Texas. Billionaire booster Cody Campbell made a bold investment into Texas Tech football ahead of last offseason's transfer portal cycle, paving the way for the Red Raiders to acquire game-changing newcomers like David Bailey, Lee Hunter and other immediate contributors responsible for delivering the best season in program history. Campbell's financial backing sets Texas Tech up to compete perennially at the top of the Big 12 and perhaps stockpile enough talent to contend for national championships.\n    \n                                        \n    MiamiMiami has been at the forefront of the NIL picture since Mario Cristobal took the head coaching job in 2022. The Hurricanes' efforts reached a new level last offseason when they went all-in on acquiring top transfer Carson Beck on a $4 million deal and turned heads with a $2 million annual commitment to five-star offensive line recruit Jackson Cantwell. Cristobal has long been one of the sport's most talented recruiters. He will only become more dominant if the Hurricanes continue to spend like an upper-class program.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Texas A&MTexas A&M athletes across all sports received $51.4 million in NIL revenue from July 2024 to June 2025 with an extreme majority of that distributed across men's sports. The most telling part of that number is that the Aggies nearly tripled their war chest from the year prior. Is it a coincidence that the surge in NIL spending came in conjunction with Texas A&M's best season on the football field since 2012? Probably not, considering prized transfer pickups KC Concepcion and Mario Craver were two of the SEC's most productive wide receivers and proved instrumental in elevating the offense to a playoff-caliber level.Big spender\n    \n                                        \n    Ole MissBefore he departed for LSU, Lane Kiffin became almost synonymous with NIL and the transfer portal at Ole Miss. It was his aggressive approach in those regards that helped the Rebels gain a first-mover advantage, string together the best seasons in program history and emerge this season as a true contender for championships at the conference and national levels. The question now is whether Ole Miss will sustain that willingness and ability to spend at such a competitive rate.Good, but maybe not as elite as you think\n    \n                                        \n    AlabamaNot all that dissimilar to professional stars leaving money on the table to allocate to their supporting casts, Alabama players at the start of the NIL era in many cases were willing to take a discount to play for Nick Saban. While that allowed the Crimson Tide to spread its wealth and build deep, immensely talented rosters, it also meant the program would have to play catch-up after Saban's retirement. To be clear, Alabama is doing just fine on the recruiting trail (Kalen DeBoer just signed the nation's No. 2-ranked class), but its payroll is a hint more modest than some of the other programs in its realm.\n\n    \n                                        \n    GeorgiaAs a recent two-time national champion with arguably the top active coach in college football, Georgia can afford to be a bit more selective with how it allocates its NIL dollars. Playing for the Bulldogs is such an immense draw that Kirby Smart can outrecruit his competitors with less reliance on paychecks and more emphasis on the potential to win titles and find success down the line in the NFL. Still, Georgia spends handsomely where it needs to, and it hit a home run last offseason in acquiring SEC receiving leader Zachariah Branch through the portal.\n    \n                                        \n    OklahomaBrent Venables was among the coaches this year who took a pay cut and gave part of his salary back for NIL and revenue-sharing purposes. While the $1 million he agreed to forgo is only slightly more than a drop in the bucket, it showed that Oklahoma recognizes its needs and is willing to be creative in how it funds its roster. The Sooners may not be at the top of the spending ladder, but it is not far off and proved its competitiveness in that space when it went big in the transfer portal and made splashes like landing John Mateer and then-highly regarded running back Jaydn Ott.Solid spender\n    \n                                        \n    IndianaThe Curt Cignetti hire and immediate success that came with it invoked a jolt of energy into the Indiana football program and, with it, a surge in investment. The Hoosiers flexed their financial muscles when they paid up to secure Cignetti with a long-term contract. They spent significantly in the transfer portal to fill roster holes and, most notably, acquired a Heisman Trophy finalist in Fernando Mendoza. And with contributions from Mark Cuban and ideal alignment inside the athletic department, the Hoosiers appear to have staying power as a college football new blood.\nGreat for a Group of Five school\n    \n                                        \n    TulaneThe transfer portal displayed last winter the chasm between the Group of Five and Power Four levels. That reality hit Tulane hard. Quarterback Darian Mensah left to become the highest-paid known player in college football history at Duke, and he was just one of the standouts from the 2024 Green Wave roster that earned paydays at other schools. But while Tulane operates on a lower NIL tier than its power conference counterparts, it is in a strong position by Group of Five standards. Less than a handful of programs at this level have more spending power than the Green Wave.Okay for a Group of Five school\n    \n                                        \n    James MadisonAn excellent string of coaches helped James Madison transition smoothly into the FBS, but even while the Dukes cemented themselves as perennial Sun Belt championship contenders in short order, they have some catching up to do with Group of Five frontrunners in the NIL space. Unless James Madison continues to hit home runs with its coaching hires, it may not have a distinct edge over the other programs contending for the fifth College Football Playoff automatic bid. For a school just four years into its FBS existence, though, its immediate success gives a high floor and ample momentum.\n            ",

He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including.

Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to 'Thursday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Falcons vs. BuccaneersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Falcons running back Bijan Robinson. The Pro Bowler is as consistent a Fantasy player as any running back, as he has at least 88 scrimmage yards in all but one game. That includes 124 total yards versus Tampa in Week 1, as he has back-to-back outings versus the Bucs with 100-plus yards and a touchdown. Robinson ranks second amongst all running backs in 2025 in receiving yards, which should certainly come in handy on Thursday. That's because the Buccaneers have allowed the most receiving yards to opposing running backs. In Week 14, Tampa allowed sixth-round rookie RB Devin Neal of New Orleans to have 84 total yards and a score, which could be Robinson's Fantasy floor for TNF. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Bijan Robinson to go Over 76.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield, who has diced up Atlanta's defense recently. Mayfield has three passing touchdowns in each of his last three starts versus the Falcons while also averaging 27 rushing yards over this stretch. The Falcons defense also allowed three passing touchdowns last week and has given up an average of 278 passing yards over the last four games, despite facing the likes of Tyler Shough, Tyrod Taylor and Bryce Young. The Falcons defense, however, has kept its last four opponents to an average of under 100 rushing yards, so the Bucs should lean on Mayfield's arm on Thursday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine. Bet Baker Mayfield to go Over 214.5 passing yards at DraftKings right here:\nHow to set 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

    "body": "\nIt has been a strange run for Paris Saint-Germain as a mixture of injuries and bad luck has seen them fall to second in Ligue 1 behind Lens. Luis Enrique's men will have yet another blow as they travel to face Athletic Club, with Ousmane Dembele and Lucas Chevalier being ruled out of the match. Dembele will miss out due to illness, while their new starting keeper, Chevalier, is recovering from an ankle injury. With five wins in their last five matches, PSG will feel good about their chances despite the injuries, but their 5-3 victory over Tottenham last time out in Champions League play also shows what can happen if they don't focus.\nHow to watch Athletic Club vs. PSG, oddsDate: Wednesday, Dec. 10 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio de San Mamés -- Bilbao, SpainLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Athletic Club +370; Draw +280; PSG -135Dealing with injuries has been the name of the game for the Parisians this season, and they'll still be without Achraf Hakimi, who is facing a race against time to recover from an ankle injury before the Africa Cup of Nations. But with those injuries, young players such as Senny Mayulu and Ibrahim Mbaye have been able to play significant minutes, which will be important in the long run. This is similar to last season, when teenagers were part of PSG's run to winning the Champions League, and for them to repeat as champions, depth will be important yet again.Travelling away from home, they'll face an Athletic Club side that has struggled this season. Having won only two of their last five matches, this is a team on only four points through five Champions League fixtures. The jump from Europa League to Champions League was expected to bring struggles for the side, but no one could've predicted that they'd be this significant. Only scoring four goals in the league phase so far, there are only three sides with fewer goals to their name, and things won't get any easier facing PSG on Wednesday.Inaki and Nico Williams haven't been enough to push this team into contention, and facing PSG's attack, they'll need everything that they can get. No team has scored more goals than PSG's 19 during he league phase, as even without Dembele available, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has paced the attack and the team has fallen in line to create chances.Losing this match could all but end Athletic's chances of making it out of the league phase, but in order to win, Ernesto Valverde's side will have to show something that they have yet to do this season to topple a team as dangerous as PSG.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Philadelphia Eagles are 8-5 following their 22-19 overtime loss Monday night to the Los Angeles Chargers. Philly lost three straight games, and quarterback Jalen Hurts delivered one of the worst performances of his NFL career.The reigning Super Bowl MVP completed 21 of 40 passes for 240 yards and a career-high four interceptions. Hurts also rushed for just eight yards and lost a fumble. Believe it or not, that came on the same play in which he threw an interception. It was a bad showing on a national stage, which leads to many questions.During a Wednesday interview on 94WIP in Philadelphia, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was asked if Hurts was \"definitely\" his starter for the Week 15 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders. Sirianni replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"Tanner McKee and Sam Howell sit behind Hurts on the depth chart. WIP then asked Sirianni if there was a possibility the Eagles make a change under center if Hurts continues to struggle.\n\"Nah, I think that's ridiculous,\" Sirianni said. \"I know every time I go out on that field with Jalen Hurts as our quarterback, we have a chance to win the game. And that's something that's been proven. We've won a lot, a lot of football games.\"\nHurts has thrown for 2,754 yards, 19 touchdowns and six interceptions, while averaging 25.9 rushing yards per game. That's down from 42 rushing yards per game in 2024. The Eagles' struggles on offense are well-documented, if not hard to ignore thanks to outspoken wide receiver A.J. Brown. While there may be concerns about the Eagles' ability to repeat as Super Bowl champions, they have time to regroup and prepare for another playoff run.\nThe Eagles have the third-easiest remaining schedule in the NFL, according to CBS Sports Research. They play the 2-11 Raiders this week, the 3-10 Washington Commanders twice and the 9-4 Buffalo Bills. With a 1.5-game lead over the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East, the Eagles have a good chance to become the first repeat champion in the division since 2004. While it's true the Eagles don't look like one of the best teams in the NFL right now, it's clear that Sirianni has the utmost confidence in his quarterback. \n            \n    ",

For the first time in 11 years, we've made it to Week 15 without a single playoff berth getting clinched. Also, there are five division races currently separated by one game or less, marking the first time in NFL history we've seen that many races with so little separation this late in the year. This unpredictability has led to a situation where the Kansas City Chiefs are most likely going to miss the playoffs for the first time in Patrick Mahomes' career.So will this unpredictable season have an unpredictable ending? Glad you asked. We usually wait until January to make our playoff predictions, but we decided we're going to bring them to you a little bit earlier this year by trying to predict who's going to win the Super Bowl this year. Since no one has clinched a playoff spot, we had Stephen Oh of SportsLine project who's going to make the postseason by simulating the rest of the season. \nBefore we get to our playoff predictions, let's check out our playoff field based on Oh's projections. AFC1. Patriots2. Broncos3. Jaguars4. Steelers5. Bills6. Texans7. ChargersNFC1. Rams2. Packers3. Eagles4. Buccaneers5. Seahawks6. 49ers 7. BearsNow that we know what the projected playoff field looks like, let's get to our predictions, starting with the wild card round. Wild card roundAFCNo. 7 Chargers 23-20 over No. 2 Broncos. Getting stuck playing the Chargers in the wild card round would definitely be a worst-case scenario for a Broncos team that has lost three straight to Los Angeles. Justin Herbert is very familiar with the Broncos defense and always seems to play well against them. In Week 3, Herbert threw for 300 yards in a 23-20 win over the Broncos, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him get near that passing number again. No. 6 Texans 20-17 over No. 3 Jaguars. There's a reason they say defense wins championships, and that's because a good defense can carry you a long way in the postseason. That's good news for the Texans, because they have the best defense in the NFL. These two teams split their season series with both games being decided by one score, so if they meet in the playoffs, it feels like we'd see another one-score game. We're going to give the slight edge to the Texans due to their dominant defense. No. 5 Bills 27-17 over No. 4 Steelers. The Steelers have lost six straight playoff games dating back to the 2016 season, and it's hard to see that drought ending here. Pittsburgh would need to play a perfect game, and even then, it would be hard to see them beating Josh Allen and the Bills.NFCNo. 2 Packers 24-17 over No. 7 Bears. These two teams met in Week 14, and although it was a close game, the Packers felt like the better team. Jordan Love outplayed Caleb Williams, and if we get a rematch in the playoffs, that feels like a scenario we'd see once again. No. 6 49ers 27-20 over No. 3 Eagles. It seems like the Eagles have time-traveled back to 2023. For the second time in three years, they're in the middle of a late-season collapse. Based on how they're playing, Philly feels like a one-and-done team in the playoffs. No. 5 Seahawks 30-20 over No. 4 Buccaneers. The Bucs actually beat the Seahawks in Week 5, but not much has gone right since then. The Bucs offense has been struggling over the past few weeks, and a big reason for that is because Baker Mayfield is banged up. The Bucs are certainly capable of winning this game, but based on how they're playing right now, the Seahawks seem like the safer pick. Breakdown: We have five out of six home teams LOSING in the opening round, which sounds about right in this season of unpredictability.\nDivisional roundAFCNo. 1 Patriots 23-20 over No. 7 Chargers. The Chargers have only played in one divisional round game over the past 10 years, and it ended with a loss to the Patriots in 2019. Unfortunately for the Chargers, history is going to repeat itself here. In the first playoff game of his career, Drake Maye outplays Justin Herbert to lead the Patriots to the win. No. 5 Bills 19-16 over No. 6 Texans. These two teams met back in Week 12 with the Texans pulling out a 23-19 win on a Thursday night. The big difference this time around is that this game is going to be played in Buffalo. Josh Allen will have his hands full with the Texans defense, but we'll say Buffalo finds a way to win on a last-second field goal. NFCNo. 1 Rams 27-24 over No. 6 49ers. The last time these two teams faced off in the postseason came in 2022 when the Rams topped the 49ers, 20-17, on their way to winning Super Bowl LVI. Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan are pretty evenly matched in the coaching department, so this feels like a game that will come down to which defense can make more big plays. If that's the case, I have to go with the Rams. No. 2 Packers 24-16 over No. 5 Seahawks. Sam Darnold seems to melt down whenever he's put in a big game, and that's what happens here. With the Seahawks forced to go on the road to face one of the best defenses in the NFL, the Packers force Darnold into throwing multiple interceptions.Breakdown: If these predictions hold up, that would give us a final four of the Bills, Rams, Packers and Patriots. Three teams that have won multiple Super Bowl titles and one team (the Bills) that has never won a Lombardi Trophy. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nConference title gamesAFC ChampionshipNo. 5 Bills 23-20 over No. 1 Patriots. Every year that Josh Allen has made the playoffs, there's always been a giant roadblock standing between him and the Super Bowl. In his last five playoff appearances, the Bills have had their season ended by either Patrick Mahomes (four times) or Joe Burrow (one time). With no Mahomes, no Burrow and no Lamar Jackson, Allen doesn't waste what might end up being his best chance to get the Bills to a Super Bowl. The 2024 MVP wills his team to a win here. NFC ChampionshipNo. 1 Rams 22-19 over No. 2 Packers. The Packers have won five straight games against the Rams, but four of those have been in Green Bay. Since adding Matthew Stafford, the Rams have gone undefeated in home playoff games, going 3-0 (and that record is 4-0 if you include their Super Bowl win over the Bengals, which was at SoFi Stadium). This has all the makings of a classic with the Packers defense trying to slow down the Rams' vaunted passing attack, but in the end, Stafford leads L.A. to the victory. Breakdown: If this Super Bowl happens, the city of Buffalo better add some direct flights to San Francisco, because everyone is going to want to be on hand to watch the Bills' first Super Bowl appearance in 31 years. Super Bowl LXBills versus Rams: The last time we saw these two teams on the same field came during the 2024 season, when Los Angeles topped Buffalo, 44-42, in what ended up being one of the craziest games of the year. If we get this matchup in Super Bowl LX, we could be in for even more craziness. \nThe Bills have struggled to stop the run this year, and you can bet Sean McVay will look to take advantage of that. On the flip side, the Rams are 1-3 this year when their opponent scores 25 points or more, so if Josh Allen can turn the game into a shootout, the Bills would certainly have a chance to win. Super Bowl prediction: Rams 34-27 over Bills. In the season of unpredictability, we get a crazy postseason where six lower-seeded teams pull off upsets. But in the end, we arrive at not-so-unpredictable ending with a No. 1 seed winning it all. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Just four weeks remain in the 2025 regular season, and the NFL is coming off one of the entire campaign's more hectic slates. Upsets sprinkled throughout the weekend, including arguably the most jarring of all with the New Orleans Saints taking down the Buccaneers in Tampa, Florida. While that upset wasn't on our bingo card last week, we did correctly pinpoint the Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans as live dogs.Now, we turn our attention to Week 15, which is an absolutely loaded crop of games, including the first CBS slate featuring teams with a combined .600+ season win percentage in December or later in the last 10 years. Playoff stakes hinge on several contests, putting each snap under the microscope. On top of projecting these games to be wildly entertaining, there's a number of home underdogs, which always puts our antenna up. As we once again identify some favorites that could be on upset alert for Week 15, three of them are trying to win and cover on the road, which is always a tall ask.All lines via DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at New England PatriotsWhen: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET | Where: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough, Massachusetts)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Patriots ML odds: -105The fate of the AFC East could be determined on Sunday when Buffalo rolls into Foxborough to take on the Patriots. The second of two matchups between these division rivals this season, New England goes for the sweep after defeating the Bills in Buffalo in Week 5. However, the Patriots look to do it as underdogs despite being at Gillette Stadium.\nPart of the reason why the Bills may be favored is that this game simply means more to them, so they could be playing with more desperation. They are currently two games back in the division but also still fighting for wild card positioning as the No. 6 seed. They are also getting MVP-like play from Josh Allen, who tallied four total touchdowns last week in a come-from-behind win over the Bengals.While you can make the case as to why the Bills are favored, the Patriots should be a tough out, especially since they're fresh off the Week 14 bye. In their previous matchup, New England was able to bottle up James Cook (15 carries for 49 yards), while getting strong contributions from Stefon Diggs (146 yards on 10 catches) in the receiving game. If the Patriots can roll out a similar formula, there's a path to victory. Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsWhen: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET | Where: Paycor Stadium (Cincinnati)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Bengals ML odds: +114We had Cincinnati as a live dog last week, and it looked like the Bengals were going to pull off the upset over Buffalo for a minute, but they collapsed in the fourth quarter. That was the unofficial death blow to their playoff hopes, but they are still a difficult matchup for clubs down the stretch with Joe Burrow under center. Similarly, Baltimore's playoff hopes had a dent put into them with a loss to the Steelers in Week 14. While the Ravens had a couple of calls go against them in the losing effort, they still don't look quite right.\nSpecifically, Lamar Jackson is uncharacteristically dull. Whether it's due to injury or something else, the Ravens quarterback is lacking the explosion we've come to expect from him whenever he drops back. Last week, he completed just 54% of his passes and had a brutal interception. If that play continues from Jackson, that'll keep the Bengals within range throughout the afternoon -- and if Burrow can make a handful of plays, it wouldn't be surprising whatsoever to see them pull off the upset win at home.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLos Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4)When: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET | Where: Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City, Missouri)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Chargers ML odds: +160The Chiefs' season is on life support after Sunday night's home loss to the Texans. It was another outing in which the K.C. offense looked totally out of sync, and Patrick Mahomes put together arguably the worst game of his career. The three-time Super Bowl champion completed just 42.4% of his throws with zero touchdowns and three interceptions. One could argue that Mahomes is due to rebound. After watching them throughout this season, though, it's hard to see that actually unfolding in Week 15.That's especially true as he faces a Chargers defense that just picked off Jalen Hurts four times on Monday night. Yes, Los Angeles is set to be on the road in a short week. But the Chargers, still jockeying for position in the wild-card race and within spitting distance of the Denver Broncos for first place in the AFC West, enter this game with plenty of motivation.\nGreen Bay Packers (-2.5) at Denver BroncosWhen: Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET | Where: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Broncos ML odds: +114Everyone is going to fade the Broncos this week after Sunday's brutal beat to the Raiders, especially in conjunction with the Packers taking control of the NFC North with a win over the Bears, but that's not how these things work. While there are certain things that carry over from game to game, this heavyweight matchup is its own animal -- and the fact that Denver blew a cover as time expired in Week 14 won't have any bearing on Week 15.A much more tangible angle for this game is how dominant the Broncos have been at Mile High this season, entering Sunday with a perfect 6-0 record. While Green Bay is 4-1-1 straight up on the road this season, Jordan Love and company are 2-4 against the spread away from Lambeau Field, so they've played in some tight games. If this is another coin-flip contest, the Broncos have shown us that they can squeak those out.Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)When: Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET | Where: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: Fox | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Lions ML odds: +200The Lions' defense is banged up in a major way, most notably losing Brian Branch for the year due to an Achilles injury. Given the issues that they've had on that side of the ball, it's understandable to see the odds drastically in favor of the Rams here, especially after Los Angeles posted 45 points in a blowout win over the Cardinals. That said, Detroit's offense is still one of the NFL's most potent units and just dropped 44 points in a win against the Dallas Cowboys.\nIf this turns into a track meet, I think that's something Dan Campbell's team would welcome, as it'd give the Lions arguably their best chance to pull off the upset. It also shouldn't be overlooked that the Lions have the rest advantage in this matchup after playing last Thursday. For a team that's been dealing with a ton of injuries, that small break could be just what the doctor ordered to get a touch healthier and surprise folks in Week 15.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWeek 14 was a rough one for favorites -- the worst week for perceived \"better\" teams in 2025. Should Week 14's results impact which favorites or underdogs to back in Week 15? If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 15, you need to see what SportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman has to say. He's put together two money line parlays for Week 15, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.NFL three-team favorite money line parlay benefitsBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.In Week 14, NFL betting favorites had their worst performance in 2025, finishing with a record of 8-6. So far this season, favorites have won 141 of 207 games, for an overall success rate of 68.1%. What does this signal for Week 15? Will the favorites bounce back or will the dogs bark louder? Take a look at Jeff's top money line parlay featuring favorites.Week 15 NFL money line favorites parlay\nPhiladelphia Eagles over Las Vegas RaidersThis represents an ideal bounce-back spot for the Philadelphia Eagles after their Monday Night Football loss -- a game in which they sacked Justin Herbert seven times and out-gained the Chargers by 90 yards. Despite playing overtime, Philadelphia's defense wasn't on the field excessively. The Eagles committed five turnovers, including four by Jalen Hurts. Now facing one of the league's weakest offenses in the Raiders (4.5 yards per play, ranked 30th), Philadelphia is positioned to end its losing streak decisively. Philadelphia's defense has also neutralized tight ends this season, allowing the fewest receiving yards (428) and fourth-fewest receptions (51) at the position. This effectively removes Brock Bowers, Las Vegas' primary offensive weapon, from being a game-changing factor.Advanced metrics back how awful the Raiders have been on offense. The Raiders own a dismal -6.5% DVOA while averaging just 15.1 points per game (32nd) and 17.1 yards per point (31st). Philadelphia's +3.2% offensive DVOA creates a commanding 9.7-percentage-point advantage before even accounting for defensive disparities. The Eagles' elite pass defense (77.3 passer rating allowed, third best) should completely neutralize Las Vegas' anemic passing attack.Compounding the Raiders' struggles, Geno Smith has been particularly ineffective in outdoor games this season, and with freezing temperatures forecast for this matchup, Las Vegas faces a perfect storm of unfavorable conditions. The Eagles are positioned to dominate both sides of the ball in this lopsided home contest. I would never use the 'L' word, but this is as close as you can get.San Francisco 49ers over Tennessee TitansI will get right to the point: This is as close to a certainty as sports betting provides. The Titans have the worst offensive DVOA in the entire dataset at -8.2%, while the 49ers' elite +9.1% DVOA creates a 17.3 percentage-point efficiency gap. Tennessee's third-down conversion rate (29.4%) is the lowest recorded in recent history, and its 15.5 points per game are historically anemic. Looking at total DVOA, the Titans are ranked 32nd (-32.5%) while the 49ers are ranked 11th (+8.4%). This line should be closer to -14, and the money line should be well north of -1100.Tennessee faces its second consecutive road game while coming off a rare victory -- a classic letdown spot. Meanwhile, San Francisco gets two weeks to prepare coming off their bye. The 49ers are simply the better team --more talent, better coaching and a massive home-field edge. Kyle Shanahan will exploit Tennessee's defensive weaknesses, and the Titans don't have the firepower to keep pace. This is a strong parlay spot.Dallas Cowboys over Minnesota VikingsThis marks the Minnesota Vikings' third road game in four weeks. Minnesota has proven to be an extremely volatile team, suffering a 26-0 shutout loss at Seattle two weeks ago before rebounding to dominate the Washington Commanders 31-0 last week. This inconsistency makes them difficult to trust in challenging road environments. Dallas has extra time to prepare and get healthy after playing last Thursday.The Cowboys command a substantial offensive advantage anchored by elite production. Dallas leads the NFL with 275.5 passing yards per game, demonstrating consistent aerial dominance. This presents a significant matchup problem for a Vikings defense that ranks 21st in road opponent passer rating, indicating Dallas should exploit Minnesota's secondary vulnerabilities. The Vikings' aggressive approach compounds this issue -- they blitz 48% of the time (ranked first in the NFL), yet Dak Prescott thrives against pressure, ranking fourth in passer rating (101.0) when facing extra rushers. Minnesota's defensive strategy plays directly into Dallas's strengths.Dallas dominates the all-time series 19-15 and has controlled recent matchups, winning five of the last six meetings. Most notably, the Cowboys have won three consecutive games against Minnesota, outscoring the Vikings 91-47 while covering the spread in all three contests.NFL three-team underdog money line parlay benefitsA very popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time. Here's Jeff's three-leg money line parlay consisting exclusively of underdogs.Week 15 NFL money line underdog parlay\nLos Angeles Chargers over Kansas City ChiefsThe Kansas City Chiefs' dynasty is coming to an end, at least for this season. They are 1-4 straight up and 0-5 ATS in their last five games. While the Chargers capitalized on five takeaways on Monday Night Football, Jim Harbaugh's coaching performance has been exceptional. His ability to consistently win games despite fielding a severely depleted offensive line has positioned him as a legitimate NFL Coach of the Year candidate. Los Angeles hasn't won at Arrowhead since 2021, but multiple factors converge to make this their best opportunity to break that drought. The Chargers have posted an impressive 13-4 record after Week 8 over the past two seasons, demonstrating consistent late-season performance, when it matters most.The Chargers already defeated Kansas City once this season in Brazil during Week 1. Los Angeles enters Week 15 at 9-4, a superior record to the Chiefs' 6-7. Los Angeles holds the fifth seed in the AFC playoff race, while Kansas City's chances of making the postseason have collapsed to roughly 16%, requiring them to win all four remaining games.The pressure on Kansas City is immense, and the wear from sustained playoff runs appears to be taking its toll. The Chiefs' discipline has notably declined, with penalty frequency rising from 5.5 per game last season (tied for fifth) to 7.0 per game this year (21st). This erosion in fundamentals suggests a team struggling to maintain the focus and execution that defined their championship years. Given these converging factors, the Chargers at +180 (DraftKings) represent exceptional value in this matchup.Cincinnati Bengals over Baltimore Ravens I was on the Baltimore Ravens -5.5 points last week, thinking the Steelers' defense would be exhausted after spending over 41 minutes on the field. Last week's result was unexpected, and a controversial call reversing Isaiah Likely's touchdown may have cost the Ravens. Despite this, Baltimore still had scoring opportunities. They gained 8 yards on a completion to Derrick Henry, but their crucial third-and-2 play failed, resulting in a 3-yard loss. The Ravens were never realistically positioned to cover the 5.5-point spread as the fourth quarter unfolded, but they should have secured the outright victory.The Ravens seek redemption after the Bengals defeated them 32-14 three weeks ago as 7.5-point road underdogs. Baltimore's recent underperformance has raised concerns about team dynamics and coaching, but the Ravens remain motivated for this divisional matchup. Historically, both the Steelers and Ravens have struggled in their immediate games following their rivalry matchups, creating a profitable fade opportunity.Cincinnati's offense is a significant threat. The Bengals rank in the top 15 for scoring and top 10 for passing yards per game, and they excel at third-down conversions. The Bengals convert third downs at 48.4%, nearly 10 percentage points higher than the Ravens' 38.6% defensive rate. The Ravens can't generate points in the red zone (30th) while the Bengals have been much more successful (17th), especially since the return of QB Joe Burrow.  Baltimore's pass rush is a key weakness, ranking 31st in sack rate. If Cincinnati's offensive line holds, the Bengals are well-positioned to capitalize and score consistently. The market has overestimated Baltimore's defensive reputation and underestimated Cincinnati's efficiency in key situations. My betting model projects the Bengals to outscore the Ravens by 2.24 points. Detroit Lions over Los Angeles RamsThe Detroit Lions present compelling value as +200 underdogs at DraftKings in their upcoming matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Despite the Rams' impressive 10-3 record and position as the NFC's top seed, advanced metrics and matchup dynamics indicate Dan Campbell's Lions are well-positioned to secure a road upset. The Lions rank second in the NFL with 0.495 points per play, trailing only Seattle, while leading the league with a dominant 30.3 points per game. Detroit's +1.0 net yards per play sits just behind the Rams' +1.2, suggesting these teams are more evenly matched than the betting line indicates.Detroit's offensive firepower under Jared Goff has proven superior in head-to-head competition. The Lions defeated the Rams 24-23 as 5.5-point favorites in the 2024 Wild Card playoff game, with Goff completing 25 of 36 passes for 241 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit also prevailed 26-20 in overtime as 5-point home favorites in Week 1 of the 2024 season.Since Dan Campbell took over play-calling duties, Detroit has operated more efficiently on offense, reducing defensive snaps and keeping the unit fresher. While the Lions are banged up in the secondary, they successfully contained the Cowboys' elite receiving threats in CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens.Detroit has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games, and coming off a victory, conventional wisdom suggests a letdown spot. However, the Lions' offensive firepower, proven success against this opponent, and underdog value at +200 make them an attractive play in this matchup.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        After more than six years of being recognized as one of boxing's top rising prospects, unbeaten 27-year-old junior middleweight Vergil Ortiz ",
    "body": "\n        After more than six years of being recognized as one of boxing's top rising prospects, unbeaten 27-year-old junior middleweight Vergil Ortiz Jr. enters arguably the biggest fight of his career on Saturday, and one that could finally put him on the doorstep of a major fight. Ortiz (23-0, 21 KOs) will return to his home base of greater Dallas when he headlines a fight card (DAZN, 8 p.m. ET) from Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, in a 12-round bout against former title challenger Erickson Lubin (27-2, 19 KOs) for the interim WBC belt at 154 pounds. A victory would likely set Ortiz up for a showdown against unbeaten Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis, a former unified welterweight champion, in one of boxing's most anticipated fights of 2026.  Considering the extended lull in the boxing calendar over the second half of 2025, this weekend's junior middleweight duel simply can't come fast enough. But the bigger impact of the bout has to do with Ortiz's up-and-down career in recent years, where everything from illness-induced layoffs to big names ducking him have slowed down his growth. It's not that Ortiz is lacking the kind of quality wins to justify the hype that has long surrounded him. It's just that he has so consistently missed out on the kind of step-up, breakthrough fight that would've propelled him to stardom and status as a world champion.\n\n        \n            \n                Claressa Shields signs $8 million, multi-fight contract in first of its kind deal\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's why Ortiz has found himself so excited and motivated to face the 30-year-old Lubin, a battle-tested puncher whose only pro defeats have come against elite foes like former undisputed champion Jermell Charlo and former unified titleholder Sebastian Fundora (the latter of which was boxing's best fight in 2022). \"[Lubin] is a dangerous fight because he has intellect, he has experience and he has power,\" Ortiz said at the October kickoff press conference to announce the fight. \"He likes to fight. I've seen his fights before, he legitimately goes in there to fight people. I respect that about him but he's also a smart fighter, as well. When you have both of those in the equation, that's when you have a dangerous fighter.\"Six years ago, Ortiz burst upon the scene at 147 pounds and was seen by many as a future champion in waiting with power in both hands and an ability to box just as strong as his willingness to trade on the inside. Stoppage victories over the likes of Mauricio Herrera, Antonio Orozco, Maurice Hooker and Egidijus \"Mean Machine\" Kavliauskas followed, although Ortiz was noticeably held back from the title picture by being unable to draw fights against the welterweight titleholders. \nJust as it seemed as if Ortiz was about to break through, a recurring and scary battle with the muscle disorder rhabdomyolysis caused him to withdraw from multiple fights and eventually sit out a full two years. The illness, which affected his weight cuts, also forced the 5-foot-10 Ortiz to move up to 154 pounds. Less than two years into his new experiment at junior middleweight, however, Ortiz has become an instant force, even though his inability to lure titleholders into fights continued to follow him. Ortiz began with a pair of first-round knockouts against Fredrick Lawson and Thomas Dulorme before getting up off the canvas twice to edge Serheii Bohachuk (a replacement for the injured Tim Tszyu) via majority decision in a bonafide fight-of-the-year contender in 2024.Then, in February, Ortiz scored his biggest win to date when he relied on his boxing skills to outpoint former titleholder Israil Madrimov. The performance was as mature a victory as Ortiz has produced and instantly placed him, despite not owning a world title, in consideration among the best fighters in the division. \nOrtiz talked about his long road to the Lubin fight during a recent DAZN-produced \"Face 2 Face\" digital series that paired the fighters against one another across a table.\"You fought for a world title against Charlo in your third year. I didn't get that opportunity,\" Ortiz told Lubin. \"I was trying to get that opportunity. I just didn't get it. I was trying to fight Hooker and whatever 147-pounders there were. I didn't get to fight [Terence] Crawford or [Errol] Spence; they were trying to fight each other. I just didn't get those opportunities, man. You can think what you want but that's just what it came down to.\"    If it were up to Ortiz, he would've already fought Ennis (35-0, 31 KOs) earlier this year. In fact, Ortiz has been very outspoken about the fact that he claims he signed a contract to be Ennis' debut opponent at 154 pounds only for the native of Philadelphia to switch course and face relatively unknown Uisma Lima, whom Ennis knocked out in less than one round last month. \nEnnis turned out to be just another big name that avoided him. But Oscar De La Hoya (who promotes Ortiz) and Eddie Hearn (Ennis' promoter) have both shared their interest in making a non-title fight between them next year in which the winner would become the uncrowned champion of the division. But once Ortiz signed on the dotted line to fight Lubin, any future talk of an Ennis fight was silenced until he gets a chance to handle his business in the ring. \"I don't want to talk about anyone if it's not Lubin,\" Ortiz said. \"I'm here for Lubin and I'm not fighting anyone else that's not Lubin.\"\nOrtiz may not have been able to draw any of the current titleholders at 154 pounds -- a group which includes Xander Zayas (WBO), Bakhram Murtazaliev (IBF), Abass Baraou (WBA) and Fundora (WBC) -- but a victory over Lubin would put him on the fast track to potentially becoming the division's top fighter.  \"[Lubin] has been in there with the best and I just want to fight the best. That's what it is,\" Ortiz said. \"I don't have anything against anyone, I'm just a competitive person. I respect anyone that gets into that ring, especially right now. It has been really hard to get fights. I haven't fought since February and we have been trying. I'm really glad we got one, especially with [Lubin] calling me out. \"It's going to be electric.\"\n            ",

The contract is for three years. Stammen, 41, becomes the 24th manager in franchise history. \"Craig has been a strong presence in our organization for nearly a decade,\" Padres president of baseball operations AJ Preller said in a statement. \"He possesses deep organizational knowledge and brings natural leadership qualities to the Manager's chair. As both a player and in his post-playing career, Craig has displayed an ability to elevate those around him. His strength of character, competitive nature and talent for bringing people together make him the ideal choice to lead the Padres.\"As a player, Stammen pitched for parts of 13 seasons in MLB, including six with the Padres from 2017 through his final season in 2022. Since retiring as an active player, Stammen has worked for the Padres as a special assistant in the player development department.\nThe hiring of Stammen will come as a surprise to some, as legendary slugger Albert Pujols had very recently appeared to be far along in the interview process and seemed to be the frontrunner for the Padres job. Stammen inherits a Padres team that went 90-72 before falling to the Chicago Cubs in the Wild Card Series. Soon after the team was eliminated, then-manager Mike Shilt resigned from the post in a surprising move. Shildt guided the Padres to the postseason in each of his two seasons on the job. Overall, the Padres have made the playoffs in four of the last six seasons. \nWhile the Padres figure to contend again in 2026, Stammen nonetheless steps into a bit of an uncertain situation in San Diego. The rotation is primed to take significant losses, as both Dylan Cease and Michael King are pending free agents and Yu Darvish will miss the entire 2026 season after undergoing major elbow surgery. As well, the farm system has been gutted by Preller's recent win-now trades and ownership's ongoing willingness to sustain the team's high payroll is left to question. \n            \n    ",

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue reported that no injuries occurred but that the structure suffered catastrophic damage.Around 4:30 a.m. local time, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue were called and responded to a large fire. Upon arrival, firefighters saw \"two structures on the property fully involved\" in the fire and described the flames \"as tall as the trees,\" per NBC Miami. The team on site then called for backup. Battalion chief Victoria Byrd said twenty units, including a hazardous materials team, were at the property.Part of the home collapsed, leading the rescue team to go into \"defensive attack.\" The firefighters attacked the fire from the air and ground until it was extinguished. \"Due to the privacy wall and a lot of the tree cover, it was very difficult to access, with only one point of entry,\" Byrd said.The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. \nFire officials said \"the home was unoccupied\" when the fire began. The Heat were in Denver to face the Nuggets Wednesday to wrap up a four-game road trip. Their team plane landed around 5 a.m. local time on Thursday. Spoelstra went to his home after the team returned to Miami and was seen walking around outside the scene as fire officials worked to diminish the fire. \nThe fire did not spread to any other homes on the street. \n            \n    ",

Those eligible free agents are ones who have never before received the QO and who spent the prior season with only one team (e.g., players traded during the season cannot receive the QO). The QO is set as the average of the top 125 salaries for a given year, and for the 2025-26 offseason it's $22.205 million. Eligible players who accept the QO will play the 2026 season under that salary and those who turn it down become free agents, albeit with the QO attached. That attachment means that the free agent's former team is entitled to compensation in the form of an additional draft pick. The position of that draft pick depends upon the team's status when it comes to the luxury tax and revenue-sharing debits or credits. On the other side, a team that signs a free agent with a QO attached is penalized with the loss of a draft pick, and just as the compensation format the position of that draft pick depends upon the signing team's classification when it comes to the luxury tax and revenue sharing.\n        \n            \n                MLB qualifying offer: Predicting which players will receive the QO and how the $22 million deal works\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMost QO decisions are obvious. Premium free agents receive one without much thought, just as the much less coveted class of free agents do not. It's in the middle ground that interesting decisions lie -- first on the club side and then, if offered, on the player side. Players presented with a QO this offseason will have until 4 p.m. ET. on Nov. 18 to accept or reject the offer. Those who accept in essence agree to a one-year contract for 2026 and those who reject proceed into free agency. Below you'll find a rundown of every player who received a QO before Thursday's deadline. \nBo Bichette, Blue Jays\nAs one of the most coveted free agents on the market, Bichette was a lock to receive the QO from the Blue Jays, the team with which he's spent his entire career, and indeed that's what happened. The 27-year-old shortstop enjoyed a strong rebound season in 2025 after a down year in 2024. For his career, Bichette boasts an OPS+ of 121 and a WAR of 21.0 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Will he accept? Highly unlikely\n            \n    ",

That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's supply just below. O's kick off free agency with Taveras signingIt's not a major signing, but it is indeed pairing of team and free agent, which means the offseason has arrived in earnest. The Orioles have reached an agreement with veteran outfielder Leody Taveras on a contract, reports MLB.com.\nTaveras, 27, is a switch-hitter who can play center and has some speed on the bases. For his career, he has an OPS+ of 84 across parts of six MLB seasons with the Rangers and Mariners. He's likely to fill the fourth outfielder role in Baltimore for 2026. \nMattingly eyeing managerial vacancies?Don Mattingly will leave his post as the Blue Jays' bench coach coming off the team's World Series loss to the Dodgers, according to the New York Post. The motivation reportedly isn't retirement but rather Mattingly's pursuit of one of MLB's two remaining managerial vacancies. The Rockies and Padres remain in need of a manager for 2026, although the Padres have been heavily involved with Albert Pujols during the interview process. Mattingly boasts plenty of managerial experience, as he previously skippered the Dodgers and then Marlins for a total of 12 seasons. Over that span, Mattingly amassed a record of 889-950 (.483) in the dugout and led the Dodgers to three straight division titles and the Marlins to a postseason berth during the abbreviated 2020 season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Despite seeing all three of their top players deal with various injuries, the Los Angeles Lakers are off to a 7-2 start that has them second in the Western Conference and looking like a legitimate title contender. The most notable of those absences has been LeBron James not playing yet due to a sciatica issue. The Lakers issued a positive update Thursday on James' status, noting he is cleared for basketball activities and will begin ramping up to 5-on-5 work. The Lakers will re-evaluate James in 1-2 weeks to see how his body is responding to getting back on the court. On top of James sitting out all nine games, Luka Dončić missed four games with a lower leg injury and Austin Reaves sat out their last two games with groin soreness. However, when those two have played, they've been spectacular to step up in James' absence. Dončić averages a ridiculous 40.0 points, 11.0 rebounds and 9.2 assists per game, while Reaves averages 31.1 points and 9.3 assists per game.\n        \n            \n                In LeBron James' absence, the Lakers have grown into the sort of championship contender he said he wanted\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBeyond those two stars, the Lakers got great play from Rui Hachimura and all three of their major offseason acquisitions. Deandre Ayton looks good as the starting center, averaging 17.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, Jake LaRavia brought them much-needed 3-point shooting off the bench and Marcus Smart has given them an edge on the defensive end and another ball-handler when Reaves and Dončić are off the floor. \nEven with lineup instability due to injuries, the Lakers are thriving on offense with the sixth best offensive rating in the league and have managed to cobble together a league average defense despite their personnel limitations. It's been an impressive start to the season for this Lakers roster and coach JJ Redick, who is getting the most out of his guys, no matter what combination is on the floor. The Lakers will be thrilled to get the future Hall of Famer back on the court, but it doesn't come without its challenges. James has a preferred style of play and Redick's task will be figuring out how to get him going without diminishing what the others have done so far. All three of James, Dončić and Reaves will have to give a bit to make it all work, with Reaves likely the one to cede the most responsibility to the other two. \nHaving to figure out how to make all his best players work together will be a welcome challenge for Redick after playing lineup roulette each night with various injuries. The good news is they learned some of those lessons last year, but it won't be a surprise if there are some growing pains early in James' return to the floor as they work out exactly how the dynamic looks with this roster this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A classic rivalry will have its next installment on 'Thursday Night Football' to kick off NFL Week 10 as the Denver Broncos host the Las Vegas Raiders. Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The Broncos swept the season series in 2024, after the Raiders had won each of the previous eight meetings. The latest Raiders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 9.5-point favorites. The over/under for total points is 42.5. Denver is at -532 on the money line (risk $532 to win $100), with Vegas at +394 (risk $100 to win $394).

Meanwhile, Denver hasn't lived up to being a heavy favorite this season, going just 1-3 against the spread when favored by at least a touchdown. The Broncos have also gone just 1-4 straight up over their last five Thursday games as short turnarounds haven't worked in their favor.Vegas does have several standouts who can make this game competitive, starting with Geno Smith, who is coming off a four-passing touchdown on Sunday. Three of those were caught by Brock Bowers, who had missed the three previous games. Rookie Ashton Jeanty is averaging 94.6 scrimmage yards over his last five games, with five total touchdowns over that stretch. Then, there's Maxx Crosby on defense, and the four-time Pro Bowler has three sacks over his last three games and ranks third in the NFL with 13 tackles for loss. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverDenver has arguably the best defense in the NFL, ranking first in a number of categories. The lead the league in the most important of defensive metrics, with the top-ranked third-down defense, as well as the No. 1 redzone defense. A big part of that success is the unparalleled ability for Denver to take down the quarterback. The Broncos' 40 sacks are the most in the league, and that puts them on pace for 76 on the season, which would break the NFL's single-season record of 72 sacks by the 1984 Chicago Bears.On offense, the Broncos are simply a different team at home, with TNF taking place in Denver. The team is averaging 31.3 points at home, compared to 20 points on the road, while the Raiders equally struggle much more when leaving Vegas. Just as Denver averages 31.3 points at home, the Raiders allow 31.3 points on the road, and Las Vegas has scored just five touchdowns on offense across four road games. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $150 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Broncos vs. Raiders picksFor the NFL Week 10 'Thursday Night Football' game of Raiders vs. Broncos, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 47 total points.

    "body": "\n        Being the most accurate passer in college football is a surefire way to etch your name into the Heisman Trophy picture. Completing throws at a historic rate will make that candidacy even stronger. Doing all of that as the leader of the No. 1 team in the sport is worthy of frontrunner status. That's a real-life résumé entering Week 11, and it belongs to Julian Sayin.Sayin is one of four quarterbacks in the top tier of the Heisman race as the regular season enters its home stretch. He, Fernando Mendoza, Ty Simpson and Marcel Reed all boast odds of +650 or better, per FanDuel, to hoist the trophy at next month's ceremony in New York City.Reed has the most modest outlook of the four but will take the biggest stage of the bunch this weekend when No. 3 Texas A&M hits the road to square off against No. 22 Missouri. It is one of just two ranked matchups on the week and the only one that features a legitimate Heisman hopeful, so Reed has an opportunity to shine with the whole nation watching. If he comes through, he could surge to the front of the race.Here is the full Heisman Trophy outlook for Week 11 of the college football season.\nHeisman Trophy odds entering Week 11QB Julian Sayin, Ohio State (+180)QB Fernando Mendoza, Indiana (+220)QB Ty Simpson, Alabama (+350)QB Marcel Reed, Texas A&M (+650)QB Gunner Stockton, Georgia (+2500)WR Jeremiah Smith, Ohio State (+4000)RB Jeremiyah Love, Notre Dame (+4000)QB Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt (+4000)QB Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss (+4000)Stock up: Julian Sayin asserts stardom as new frontrunnerThis late into the season, it is impossible not to recognize Saying for what he truly is -- the orchestrator and top standout in a monster of an Ohio State offense. It becomes clearer by the week that he is not simply a product of an excellent system and the beneficiary of elite play from the stars that surround him but rather the engine that makes it all work.Sayin leads the nation with an 80.7% completion rate and would set an NCAA record in that metric if the season ended today. His efficiency is off the charts, as he also paces college football in passer rating and adjusted yards per attempt. The last time the first-year starter completed fewer than 70% of his passes in a game? The season-opener. His first career start. Against an outstanding Texas defense.It is now obvious why Sayin pushed for the starting job last year as a true freshman. The former five-star recruit and No. 1 quarterback in the 2024 class is more than just a toolsy, young prospect. He is a bona fide star who seems to get better with each and every outing.\n\n        \n            \n                Julian Sayin is no passenger on Ohio State train: Heisman leader is steering Buckeyes through dominant season\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nStock down: Diego Pavia, Haynes King slip to edge of contentionIt was always going to take strong team finishes for Diego Pavia and Hayes King to stay in the running. The margin for error is smaller at No. 16 Vanderbilt and No. 17 Georgia Tech than it is at perennial College Football Playoff-contending programs, fair or not. With both teams falling last weekend -- the Commodores to Texas and the Yellow Jackets in upset fashion at NC State -- that margin got even slimmer.Pavia was a surging, top-five candidate a week ago. Individually, he did nothing to hurt his case with a four-touchdown, 400-yard effort against the Longhorns. He caused more trouble for Texas' stout defense than nearly any other quarterback all year. King was among the most tantalizing dark-horse contenders entering last week and, like Pavia, pieced together a stellar individual showing with more than 500 total yards and four touchdowns.The problem for both of them is that team success factors heavily into the Heisman calculation, losses almost always overrule individual performances.\nLongshot of the week: QB Dante Moore, Oregon (+5500)Dante Moore has a chance to put No. 9 Oregon's loss to Indiana and his early departure against Wisconsin in the rearview mirror over the final four weeks of the regular season. The Ducks face one of the toughest remaining schedules of any CFP contender and therefore have plenty of opportunities to make splashes on the national stage. Moore was a Heisman frontrunner earlier in the year and has been terrific outside the two aforementioned hiccups, so if he returns to form and the Ducks win out, he could be right back in the Heisman mix come December.Week 11 performances to watchOh, what could have been. No. 2 Indiana at Penn State. No. 4 Alabama vs. LSU. Two matchups that in the preseason looked like CFP play-in games but now feature a couple of interim staffs and diminished stakes. At least a couple of Heisman hopefuls will still be in action.Marcel Reed at MissouriOne of the two biggest games of the week sends Reed on the road for a third straight time against a top-25 foe. How well the vaunted Texas A&M offensive line protects Reed against the formidable Missouri defensive front will go a long way in determining whether he remains at the forefront of the Heisman race.\nFernando Mendoza at Penn StatePenn State has far more NFL bodies on defense than either of Indiana's final two opponents, so this should be the last real test for Fernando Mendoza before the potential Big Ten Championship Game and CFP. It's a test that he should pass with flying colors given the state of affairs in the Nittany Lions' program.Ty Simpson vs. LSUEverything that applies to Mendoza's matchup against Penn State goes the same for Ty Simpson against LSU. It is a clash with a talented defense that has little left to play for and an opportunity to notch a win over a big brand.Dante Moore at IowaA difficult stretch run for Moore and Oregon opens with a tricky spot on the road at No. 20 Iowa. The Hawkeyes are always dangerous at home, where their defense typically plays lights out. Moore, healthy after leaving his last game early, seeks a bounce-back performance against one of the better defenses he will see all year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 10 NFL schedule kicks with the Denver Broncos vs. the Las Vegas Raiders in an AFC West showdown on 'Thursday Night Football.' The games starts at 8:15 p.m. ET, and daily Fantasy football players will have to be creative when looking for production since this game only has an over/under of 42.5, the fourth lowest of the week. Denver has an elite defense, while Las Vegas has struggled offensively, so can you trust Las Vegas players like Geno Smith, Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty as NFL DFS picks?On the Denver side, Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and JK Dobbins will all be popular for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, with Vegas just trading away Jakobi Meyers, could veteran Tyler Lockett make an impact in daily Fantasy football lineups, or could tight end Michael Mayer be more involved in the passing game?

The second-year pro was dominant as a rookie, but has been limited by injuries in 2025. He got back on the field in Week 9, however, and put up a massive 12-127-3 receiving line against the Jaguars. Denver's defense is elite, but the Broncos have given opposing tight ends a little space as they ranked outside the top 10 in Fantasy points given up against the position, so Bowers is one Las Vegas player who could do some damage on Thursday. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, who has an over/under of 71.5 rushing yards. Dobbins hasn't been much of a touchdown threat, but he's been a high-floor option in recent weeks due to his total workload. He's averaging more than 14 carries per game over the past three weeks, and he's averaged an efficient 5.2 yards per carry during that span. With Denver favored by more than a touchdown, there's a good chance that the game flow will allow him to see plenty of carries. Additionally, the Raiders allowed Travis Etienne of Jacksonville to go for 115 scrimmage yards last week. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Raiders vs. BroncosMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        Less than five years ago, Pat Fitzgerald was considered a top 10 coach in the power conference ranks. He landed ahead of names like Jim Harbaugh, Kyle Whittingham and James Franklin in the 2021 CBS Sports Coach Rankings.Now, after a three-year hiatus from the sidelines after his ouster amid hazing allegations from his time at Northwestern, Fitzgerald is back on the market and poised to capitalize on the chaos of the 2025 coaching carousel. Eight Power Four jobs have already opened -- nine if you count Stanford -- and more are coming.Fitzgerald reached an August settlement in his wrongful termination lawsuit against Northwestern that has cleared the way for his return to coaching. All indications are that he'll be able to find a home, perhaps even at a Power Four school.In an appearance on ESPN's College Gameday podcast this week, Fitzgerald said that \"I feel 100 percent vindicated\" and added that his candidacy for jobs has been well-received within the industry.\nFollowing his August settlement with Northwestern, Fitzgerald released a statement reiterating that he \"had no knowledge of hazing ever occurring in the Northwestern football program, and that I never directed or encouraged hazing in any way.\"\"The rush to judgment in the media in July of 2023 and the reports that suggested I knew about and directed hazing are false and have caused me, my wife, and my three sons great stress, embarrassment, and reputational harm in the last two years,\" Fitzgerald said in the statement.So with his separation from Northwestern now complete, where might the 50-year old Fitzgerald land? Given the success he had with the Wildcats in what is regarded as one of the nation's most-challenging jobs, there's no doubt he'll be of interest to a number of programs Here's a look at the best potential fits.\nCurrent openings\n    \n                                        \n    StanfordFitzgerald spent 17 seasons navigating the terrain at an institution with lofty academic standards and still regularly produced quality football teams. He understands how to navigate the political dynamics at a university where sports aren't necessarily the top priority and would presumably be comfortable at Stanford in that environment. The Cardinal are 3-6 this season while operating under 63-year old interim coach Frank Reich. Assuming general manager Andrew Luck moves forward with making a full-time hire from outside the program, Fitzgerald would have to be on the shortlist of candidates.\n    \n                                        \n    UCLAWinning big in football at UCLA right now is about doing more with less and winning on the margins at a program with some inherent disadvantages. That's what Fitzgerald did at Northwestern, and he's also familiar with the Big Ten. The Bruins' athletic department is cash-strapped, and now there are even questions about whether the Rose Bowl will remain the program's home stadium. The challenges also include lots of cross-country travel for Big Ten games. This job wouldn't be easy, but it could be a great reentry point for Fitzgerald to prove he's still got it.\n    \n                                        \n    Penn StateLanding the Penn State job after three seasons away from coaching would be a coup for Fitzgerald, and there are plenty of reasons to believe it could be a fruitful marriage. Fitzgerald reached 10 wins on three occasions between 2012 and 2017 and appeared in the Big Ten Championship Game in both 2018 and 2020. If he achieved those results at Northwestern, just think what Fitzgerald could achieve while backed with the resources of one of the Big Ten's historical powers. However, given the university's scandal-ridden past, making this hire would bring some optical challenges that the Nittany Lions might prefer to avoid.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Arkansas Arkansas is reportedly making an all-in push for James Franklin. Assuming that fails, Fitzgerald could be a great fallback option. The doubters are already screaming, \"but can he recruit in the SEC?\" That's the wrong question to ask in this era. Money does the recruiting, not the coach. If the Razorbacks like Franklin because he's a veteran leader with a winning track record, then Fitzgerald checks many of the same boxes. No, he doesn't have SEC experience, but if the Razorbacks are serious about putting money into their roster and Fitzgerald hires the right offensive coordinator, this could work.Potential openings\n    \n                                        \n    WisconsinWisconsin fans know Fitzgerald well from their many years together in the Big Ten West. From a cultural standpoint, he would be a natural fit if the Badgers move on from Luke Fickell. It's easy to imagine Fitzgerald taking a bunch of farm-fed three-star prospects and turning Wisconsin back into a respectable Big Ten outfit. However, the Badgers may be thirsting for an offensive-oriented hire amid the program's horrendous ineptitude on that side of the ball. Who Fitzgerald would hire as his offensive coordinator is a significant question that he'll need to answer for any job. It seems especially pertinent at this one.\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan StateMoving on from Jonathan Smith after just two seasons might be rash, but the Spartans are on a six-game losing streak and just 8-13 during his tenure. Fitzgerald would be a comfortable potential replacement. Given how porous the Spartans have been defensively during Smith's tenure, landing a coach with his track record would be a sensible shift.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sometimes a hunch turns out to be dead on. Last week, I cautioned folks to tread carefully with favorites on a white-hot heater. We leaned heavily into underdogs for the Week 9 slate, and that proved to be the right pivot at the right time. It led to us nailing several of our underdog bets, including three dogs covering within my five locks of the week and two pulling off outright upsets -- which I also predicted.That put us back on track with the locks. After a 4-1 ATS run in Week 9, we're back above .500 for the year in that section and looking to build on it from here. So let's get rolling.Teams on bye in Week 10: Dallas, Cincinnati, Tennessee and Kansas City. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

While some suspect this is the spot where that run ends, I'm not one of them. I think the Buccaneers are too banged up offensively and don't match up well against New England's defense.\nRunning back Bucky Irving's status is still up in the air, which could leave Tampa Bay without its top back while facing the NFL's No. 1 run defense. As for Baker Mayfield's pass-catching group, it's depleted. Mike Evans won't play as he continues to deal with injury, and Chris Godwin's status is uncertain. That could leave Emeka Egbuka as the top target. The rookie came out hot, but he has just 117 receiving yards over his last three games and now could be blanketed by Christian Gonzalez.All of that feels like a recipe for this Bucs offense to struggle, opening the door for New England to squeak out another win and move to 5-0 on the road in 2025.Projected score: Patriots 27, Buccaneers 20The pick: Patriots +2.5\n        \n            \n                Will the Patriots grab the No. 1 seed?

I think Green Bay looked ahead to this game -- and for good reason. This is a heavyweight showdown that could have No. 1 seed implications in the NFC. Ultimately, I see this as a bad spot for Green Bay on a couple of fronts.\nFirst, Philadelphia will be well-rested coming off its Week 9 bye and has historically fared well in this spot, owning a 4-0 post-bye record under Nick Sirianni. The second reason I'm wary of Green Bay on Monday night is the absence of Tucker Kraft, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. He has been the key cog in the offense, leading the team in receiving yards. With such a young receiver room, it may take some time for the offense to find its new rhythm, and the Eagles' revamped, post-deadline defense isn't the group that will give them many opportunities to do so.Also, don't sleep on this angle: It was the Packers who proposed banning the \"tush push\" last offseason. The vote failed, but they were the ones driving the attempt to remove it from the league. You can bet Sirianni will use that as a motivator in this head-to-head matchup.Projected score: Eagles 23, Packers 21The pick: Eagles +2.5Buffalo Bills at Miami DolphinsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)There's a twinge of concern that this could be a letdown spot for the Bills after taking down the Chiefs last week, but I'd be more worried if they weren't trailing New England in the division race. They know they can't afford to lose more ground, and the Dolphins aren't equipped to put up much of a fight.\nMiami was just blown out at home by the Ravens last Thursday, which led to the team parting ways with general manager Chris Grier. It also feels like both Mike McDaniel and Tua Tagovailoa's days are numbered. Meanwhile, Josh Allen -- who is currently boasting career highs in completion percentage (70%) and yards per attempt (8.2) -- has owned the Dolphins. The Bills quarterback is 14-2 and averages three total touchdowns per game against his division foe.I can see Buffalo getting up big and Miami rolling over.Projected score: Bills 33, Dolphins 20The pick: Bills -9.5Arizona Cardinals at Seattle SeahawksSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The Cardinals will be rolling with Jacoby Brissett in this game. While Arizona's offense has functioned much better with Brissett under center than it did with Kyler Murray earlier in 2025, I'm not convinced he can keep pace with a Seattle team that looks like a sleeping giant in the NFC.Defensively, Seattle should be able to get after Brissett, as the Seahawks enter Week 10 with the third-most sacks in the NFL (27). They're also tied for the third-fewest yards per play allowed (4.7) and rank fifth in points allowed per game (18.8). Pair that with an offense that sits top five in scoring and tied for first in yards per play, and Seattle simply feels like too much, especially at home.\nProjected score: Seahawks 27, Cardinals 17The pick: Seahawks -6.5\n        \n            \n                Why the Cardinals look better with Jacoby Brissett -- and what it really means for Kyler Murray's future\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJacksonville Jaguars at Houston TexansSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)With C.J. Stroud ruled out with a concussion, the Texans will turn to Davis Mills in Week 10. While Stroud's absence obviously lowers Houston's ceiling, I still like the Texans in this spot. Mills is a capable backup, and this matchup is more about fading Jacksonville than anything else.The Jaguars offense is simply hard to believe in, especially with Trevor Lawrence struggling. He ranks 32nd among 33 qualified quarterbacks in completion percentage this season (59.7%), and Jakobi Meyers' arrival doesn't magically solve those issues. This is an even tougher matchup for Jacksonville considering Lawrence now faces arguably the best defense in the NFL.Houston leads the league in points allowed per game (15.1) and yards allowed per game (267.4). I expect the Texans to disrupt Jacksonville's offense enough that Mills won't need to do any heavy lifting to keep Houston in control.\nProjected score: Texans 23, Jaguars 20The pick: Texans -1.5Rest of the bunchRaiders at Broncos (Thursday)Projected score: Broncos 27, Raiders 17The pick: Broncos -9.5Falcons at Colts (in Berlin)Projected score: Colts 30, Falcons 20The pick: Colts -6.5Giants at BearsProjected score: Bears 27, Giants 21The pick: Bears -3.5Ravens at VikingsProjected score: Ravens 24, Vikings 21The pick: Vikings +4.5Browns at JetsProjected score: Browns 23, Jets 20The pick: Browns -2.5Saints at PanthersProjected score: Panthers 24, Saints 20The pick: Saints +5.5Rams at 49ersProjected score: Rams 27, 49ers 24The pick: 49ers +3.5Lions at CommandersProjected score: Lions 33, Commanders 20The pick: Lions -8.5Steelers at ChargersProjected score: Chargers 27, Steelers 23The pick: Chargers -3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're more than two weeks into the NBA season and not everything has gone as predicted. The Orlando Magic and Atlanta Hawks, two fashionable picks to make noise in the Eastern Conference, stumbled at the start and are still trying to find their footing. The same can be said about the Grizzlies, Kings, Mavericks and Pelicans in the Western Conference. There are plenty of squads that are disappointed and might even have reason to panic. Naturally, there are teams at the opposite end of the spectrum and have so far defied varying expectations (to the extent that some had any at all). These franchises have played well enough in the early going to wonder if they might be onto something, a group that coming into the season wasn't so much under the radar as underestimated. 1. Los Angeles LakersIt's hard to underestimate a team that has arguably the greatest player of all time, even at an advanced age, along with a guy in his prime who made first-team All-NBA in five straight seasons. But while having LeBron James and Luka Dončić definitely raise the Lakers floor, there weren't a whole lot of people predicting that L.A. would have a high ceiling this season in the overloaded Western Conference. (Five of our eight staffers, including me, had them as a play-in team in our preseason predictions.)Beyond those two and Austin Reaves, the roster looked pretty thin on paper. Further complicating matters was the fact that James, who will turn 41 in December, was unavailable to start the season while recovering from sciatica. LeBron still hasn't played, and Luka missed four of the team's first nine games due to a combination of finger and leg injuries, as well as rest. \nAll of that should have spelled doom for the Lakers. Instead, they've won five straight and are 7-2 -- including 3-1 without Luka in the lineup. Remarkably, L.A. is fifth in offensive rating and second in eFG. Without LeBron and with Doncic intermittently available, Reaves (who missed the last two games with a groin injury) stepped up big-time. He had 51 points in a win at the Kings, 41 in home loss to the Blazers, and 28 including the game-winner against the Wolves in Los Angeles. That last game also introduced much of the world and Ant Edwards to the emergence of Jake LaRavia, who the Lakers grabbed during the offseason without much fanfare. \nThe Lakers beat the Spurs and Victor Wembanyama at home in a nail-biter on Wednesday night to extend their winning streak, but the Lakers most impressive outing to date might have been against the Blazers earlier this week. It was the second night of a back-to-back, on the road, and head coach JJ Redick decided to sit Dončić and Reaves against a plucky Portland team with a top-10 defensive rating. The Lakers won with a starting lineup that featured Rui Hachimura, Dalton Knecht, DeAndre Ayton, Marcus Smart and LaRavia. Nick Smith Jr, who is on a two-way contract, scored 25 points in 27 minutes. Considering how many key players have been in and out of the lineup for the Lakers, they'll happily take this start. \"It's become a thing in our routine, to approach the game the right way with some professionalism, and it's starting to spread,\" Ayton said after the Blazers win. \"Guys deep in the bench showing up with 25 points. That's legit. That's big time, to be honest. No Luka. No LeBron. No Reaves. That's something you just have to take a deep breath on and wonder if what we're doing back here is really fundamentally sound.\"\n2. Portland Trail BlazersOK yeah they faceplanted in the aforementioned Lakers game. But this is the quietly doing work team that no one outside of the Pacific Northwest saw coming. The Blazers just handed the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder their first loss of the season on Wednesday night. Yes, the Thunder were missing three of their five starters from their championship season, but if we're going to give OKC credit for being ridiculously deep (they are) when they win, then Portland gets a salute for picking them off on a night when the Thunder were forced to use that talented bench in a loss.Last season the Blazers were among the group I thought should hard tank and instead they actually tried at the end of the season. Then they acquired Jrue Holiday coming off an is-he-cooked year with the Celtics, who salary dumped him for prudent cost cutting measures, which elicited a lot of what's-happening dog-head-tilt questions from me. And so naturally the Blazers are 5-3 with Holiday looking like the two-way star he's been his whole career (minus last season). Deni Avdija is scoring nearly eight points more per game than last season for a team that plays fast and is second in pace. The Blazers are eighth in defensive rating and led at that end by Toumani Camara who is everywhere all the time. No one looks at the schedule and thinks oh cool let's get on a plane and fly to the corner of the NBA map to play a bunch of try-hards. It's a perfect Portland team. 3. Milwaukee Bucks Even after swiping Myles Turner out from under the Indiana Pacers (and their evidently ungrateful fans) this offseason, there wasn't a lot of optimism about this Bucks team headed into the season. Damian Lillard's Achilles injury led to the controversial decision to waive and stretch his contract, adding $22.5 million per season over the next five years to the Bucks' books for a guy who is now employed by Portland. \nThat move allowed them to pair Turner with Giannis Antetokounmpo, but it also made padding out the rest of the roster more difficult. The narrative all summer was when — rather than if — things would get bad enough that Giannis would finally ask out of Milwaukee, a storyline that Antetokounmpo didn't exactly squash when he said he was \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season but reserved the right to change his mind in \"six, seven months.\" The whole thing felt like it was set up for another middle-of-the-pack finish in the Eastern Conference and a fourth straight first-round playoff exit before Giannis hit the highway and left Milwaukee in his rearview. It could still go down that way, but the Bucks have to be happy with their 5-3 start considering no one outside of Milwaukee expected much from this bunch. The Bucks are eighth in offensive rating and Giannis is flying (32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game with a cartoonish 70.7 eFG and 39.2 PER). The Bucks have also found production in unexpected places. Point guard threatened to be a real concern coming into the season, and the situation further deteriorated when Kevin Porter Jr, the early pick for the job, made it through nine minutes of the first game before a knee injury sidelined him. Into that void stepped Ryan Rollins, a guy who averaged 6.1 points and 1.9 assists in his first three NBA seasons. But since being installed as the starting point guard, Rollins is averaging 16.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 1.9 steals on a 62 true shooting percentage. \nThe Bucks couldn't have scripted a better start. Win some games. Remain relevant. And above all show Giannis they can still compete. 4. Chicago BullsIt's only seven games, but the Bulls have won six of them and sit atop the Eastern Conference standings. They were a fun watch toward the end of last season winning 15 of their final 20 games, but it's safe to say no one expected this. Josh Giddey has been the headliner, averaging nearly a triple double. Despite not having speedy guard Coby White who remains out with a calf strain, the Bulls have still attacked at every opportunity. They lead the league in drives and points in transition per game. They're second in points in the paint per game and third in 3-point percentage. That's the kind of modern shot diet you love to see. It all works out to them being eighth in offensive rating and points per game. \nThe Bulls have racked up big wins over Eastern Conference competition that includes the Hawks, Magic, Knicks and, most recently, the equally surprising Sixers. That last one didn't look like it was going to happen. The Bulls were down 24 at home on Tuesday night and appeared headed for a second straight loss. Instead they mounted a massive fourth-quarter comeback when Giddey drove the lane and found Nikola Vucevic in the corner for the game winner.\nThat was their first lead of the game. It should be noted that Giddey posted triple-doubles in each of his last two outings, becoming the first Bulls player to do so in back-to-back games since Michael Jordan in 1988. When you're in that kind of company and you're also perched atop the conference standings things are going pretty well. 5. Philadelphia 76ersThey're not without problems. They blew a big lead on the road in a loss at Chicago this week and followed that up with a loss at Cleveland the next night. That happens in the NBA, but they've still won five of their eight games. That beats what they went through last year when they won just 24 games all season and injuries to Joel Embiid and Paul George limited them to a combined 60 appearances. That prompted a late-season tank job that allowed them to draft VJ Edgecombe and salvage something positive from an otherwise brutal year.\nWith George yet to play this season and Embiid on a minutes restriction, the Sixers have turned to an allotment of fast young guards and wings that includes Tyrese Maxey, Quentin Grimes, Kelly Oubre and Edgecome. Their top four three-man combinations all include some variation of those guys.Maxey has been the driving force. He scored the most points in the first seven games of a season in franchise history and leads the league in points per game at 33.5The start represents a vast improvement. 6. Miami HeatLast season was a low point for a Heat franchise that fancies itself as one of the best organizations in the league. The Jimmy Butler drama dragged on longer than anyone wanted, and then Miami got kicked while it was down in a four-game sweep by the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. Their two best players, Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo, were terrible in that series. And then, roughly a month before the new season began, Herro had surgery on his ankle. He still hasn't played and is expected to be out until at least mid-November. \nThat didn't exactly inspire confidence, even though they added Norm Powell coming off a career season with the Clippers, and even though the Heat are in the watered down Eastern Conference. In our preseason predictions, no one on our staff had Miami any higher than the play-in. Maybe that's where they ultimately end up, but despite not having Herro the Heat have been hard to slow down. They're eighth in net rating and fourth in points per game. Early in the season Adebayo marveled at their new offensive approach where head coach Erik Spoelstra doesn't call many plays, instead trusting his players to read and react to the defense in real time and keep the ball moving. It's a fast, freewheeling style that has the Heat first in pace. (Adebayo left Wednesday's game at Denver with a foot injury after playing just eight minutes and did not return. That should have everyone in Miami holding their collective breath.)In the new system, Adebayo and Powell are averaging a combined 43 points, while Jamie Jacquez Jr has become a key contributor (17.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists in 29 min per game) after regressing in his sophomore season. Just when it looks like the Heat might have gone dry, Spoelstra finds a way to wring more out of the rag. \n            ",

The Broncos are coming off yet another fourth-quarter comeback against the Houston Texans, a game in which they won, 18-15. The Raiders on the other hand fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime, 30-29.While the Broncos are currently sitting atop their division, their lead over the Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) and Kansas City Chiefs (5-4) is one and two games, respectively. Additionally, Denver still has to have both meetings with Kansas City and it hosts Los Angeles in the regular season finale so there's no opportunity for the Broncos to take their foot off the gas.Click here to bet Raiders vs. Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Despite the Raiders' loss on Sunday, Smith turned in one of his best performances of the year, as he threw for 284 yards, a season-high four touchdowns against only one interception. He clearly missed tight end Brock Bowers, as the young star caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in his return to the lineup after missing the last three games due to a knee injury. As for the Broncos, their second-year signal-caller Nix passed John Elway for the most wins (17) in a quarterback's first two seasons in Broncos history. He registered the seventh game-winning drive of his career this past week, and his fourth this season. The 7-2 start is Denver's best since 2015, when Peyton Manning led the Broncos to a Super Bowl victory. What will happen this year?Where to watch Raiders vs. Broncos liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 6 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoStream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -9.5; O/U 42.5 (via FanDuel)Raiders vs. Broncos: Need to knowThe Broncos are streaking. The Broncos have now won six straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with the New England Patriots. Denver has also won nine straight home games, which marks the longest active streak in the league. Denver is dominating on defense and in the trenches. The Broncos defense leads the NFL in sacks per game (4.4), third-down percentage (28.2%) and red zone touchdown percentage (34.8%). Denver has recorded the most sacks (40) and is tied in allowing the fewest sacks (9) this season. Las Vegas is down a receiver. Vegas won't have wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in the lineup moving forward, as just before Tuesday's trade deadline the Raiders dealt him to the Jaguars for fourth- and sixth-round picks. The 28-year-old wideout caught 33 passes for 352 yards in seven games played this season. More pressure will be placed on leading receiver Tre Tucker, as well as rookies Dont'e Thornton Jr. and Jack Bech. History suggests Raiders are not-ready-for-prime-time players. The Raiders have lost seven straight road games in prime time, with their last win coming in 2017 against the Miami Dolphins on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Vegas has also scored fewer than 10 points in back-to-back prime-time games, and been out-scored 71-6 over the last two road games.Fourth-quarter kings: There's no denying that the Broncos offense has been Jekyll and Hyde for most of the season. It can look like one of the most anemic units in the league one moment, then drop 33 points in a quarter the next. The Broncos have four game-winning drives this season, which is tied for most in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and own the league's best fourth-quarter point differential (+66) during this current six-game win streak. No team should feel safe with a lead in the fourth quarter against Denver -- no matter how many points it is. Raiders vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nThe Broncos have made a habit of playing close games against inferior opponents. They struggled with the Tennessee Titans in the season opener, defeated the lowly New York Jets by just two points and needed a historic comeback to beat the New York Giants. It wouldn't surprise me to see this game come down to the fourth quarter, but I'll take Denver to cover the spread as long as the number is under 10. Smith is 0-5 against the spread in prime time since the start of last season, while Nix is 3-1 straight up and against the spread in his career in prime time. Pick: Broncos -9.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

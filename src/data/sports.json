    "body": "\n        The current DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Thursday features a three-game NBA slate that features LeBron James in action as the Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks at 10 p.m. ET. Although James will play in the NBA All-Star Game, he'll have time to rest after Thursday, which could lead to more minutes and larger usage. With James active and the Mavericks without multiple players, including Cooper Flagg (foot), the SportsLine Projection Model backs the Lakers to cover as 7.5-point favorites as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The model is also backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 13.5-point favorites against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup that will not feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal) or Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball bet for Northern Iowa vs. Belmont at 9 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)Combining the three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +541 (risk $100 to win $541). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nThunder (-13.5) vs. Bucks (-112)The Thunder certainly aren't the same team without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the lineup, but they are still 3-2 over their five games with the reigning NBA MVP out with an abdominal injury. They've won two of those three games by at least 27 points, with an average margin of victory of 24 points in the three wins. Oklahoma City is coming off a 136-109 win over the Suns on Wednesday to improve to 42-13 this season. Meanwhile, the Bucks are 4-4 in their eight games with Giannis Antetokounmpo out, but 1-3 against teams with a winning record. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 64% of simulations. Back the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Northern Iowa (+5.5) vs. Belmont (-118)\"Belmont saw its nine-game win streak snapped in an OT loss at Bradley, and now the Bruins return home to face a Northern Iowa team they dismantled by 13 in Cedar Falls,\" SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein said. \"But Northern Iowa is playing much better now. The Panthers just destroyed Murray State, the MVC's second-place team, 89-60 on the road, for their third straight win. None of Northern Iowa's last four opponents has scored more than 60 points. While the Bruins are highly efficient offensively, the Panthers hold opponents to 26.5 percent from deep. Northern Iowa has been an underdog six times this season. The Panthers have covered five of those -- the miss coming by 1.5 points at Bradley -- and beaten market expectations by an average of 8.2 points.\" Back Northern Iowa to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-7.5) vs. Mavericks (-112)This Dallas Mavericks lineup is certainly not what NBA fans expected to see on display at the start of the season. The Mavericks still haven't seen Kyrie Irving this season, who remains out with a knee injury. They traded away Anthony Davis. And now, No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, who has dominated lately, is out with a foot injury. The Lakers aren't at full strength either, with Luka Doncic (hamstring) out, but only Doncic and Deandre Ayton (knee, questionable) are on the LA injury report. Meanwhile, Dallas has eight players on its injury report as either questionable, doubtful or out. LeBron James should be additionally rested, as he hasn't played since Monday, and could take on a larger role with the upcoming break. The Lakers are 32-21 compared to the Mavericks at 19-34 this season, and the model projects the Lakers to cover in 67% of simulations.\" Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Breezy Johnson's time at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games, though, might belong in a class of its own. Four days after winning gold in the women's downhill ski and just moments after crashing out of Thursday's Super-G, Johnson got engaged to Connor Watkins on site.\nNBC Sports captured the entire proposal, with Watkins getting down on one knee and Johnson getting emotional.\"Breezy Noble Johnson, you have worked so hard and achieved so much, and yet you still find the time to love me, to make me feel special, and most importantly, you helped me love myself,\" Watkins said. \"And now that I know what that feels like, there's only one way I want to spend the rest of my life, and that is by your side. I love you Breezy. Will you marry me?\"The two joined \"TODAY\" to discuss the engagement.\nThough the Super-G didn't go as Johnson hoped -- and she also finished fouth alongside Mikaela Shiffrin in the women's team combined -- the downhill was an impressive and eventful triumph. Johnson had to not only overcome teammate Lindsey Vonn's devastating crash but the rest of the field, too.\"Part of what breaks your heart is that you're used to defying the odds,\" Johnson told CBS News about Vonn's injury. \"You're used to writing fairytale endings. And the reality is that those things get made into movies because they're so unlikely. And unfortunately, you can't always -- it's not always like the movies.\"\nJohnson's Olympics, though, have had a movie-like quality, with a little bit of triumph, a little bit of disappointment and a lot of love. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The International Olympic Committee banned Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych from competing in the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics after Heraskevych refused to refrain from racing in a helmet that honors athletes killed in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Heraskevych trained in the helmet, which depicts at least 20 athletes and coaches, as late as Wednesday before the IOC made its final decision to bar him from Thursday's race. The IOC said Monday that Heraskevych's helmet would not be allowed in competition, citing a rule against making political statements on the Olympic field of play. \"I never wanted a scandal with the IOC, and I did not create it,\" Heraskevych wrote in a statement on social media. \"The IOC created it with its interpretation of the rules, which many view as discriminatory. Although the IOC's actions have made it possible to loudly speak about Ukrainian athletes who have been killed, at the same time the very fact of the scandal distracts a tremendous amount of attention away from the competitions themselves and from the athletes participating in them.\"Heraskevych also posted a picture of his wearing the helmet during training after the ban was announced.   \nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams noted while speaking with the media that Heraskevych had the opportunity to \"express his grief\" on social media, during press conferences and in the mixed zone, where athletes interact with reporters following competitions. \"In the end, let me be clear, it's not the message, it's the place that counts,\" Adams said. \"That for us -- and not actually us. We are, in this sense, in a back seat. It's the message of the athletes, that the athletes reiterate to us time and time again. There are 130 conflicts going on in the world. We cannot have 130 different conflicts feature. However terrible they are, we cannot have them featured during the field of play.\"   Other prominent Ukrainian athletes have come out in support of Heraskevych. Boxer Oleksandr Usyk, a two-time undisputed world heavyweight champion and a gold medalist in boxing while representing Ukraine in 2012, added his voice on social media. \n\"I'm proud of you @heraskevych, for your courage and bravery,\" Usyk wrote. \"The helmet with portraits of fallen Ukrainian athletes is a tribute, not a rule violation!  Sport doesn't mean forgetting. True strength is having the courage to remain human, even in the toughest times.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Utah Jazz announced forward Jaren Jackson Jr. will undergo surgery to remove a pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) growth in his left knee. It will likely sideline the recently acquired two-time All Star for the rest of the season, per Chris Haynes of NBA on Prime. Jackson is expected to make a full recovery.\"Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a condition that causes the synovium -- the thin layer of tissue that lines the joints and tendons -- to thicken and overgrow,\" according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. \"The mass or tumor that results from this overgrowth is not cancerous and does not spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. However, PVNS is a progressive disease. It slowly worsens and can lead to bone damage and arthritis.\"PVNS usually affects the knee, although it can affect other joints as well. In most cases, surgery is needed to remove the damaged joint lining and the mass.\"The Jazz said the team discovered the growth in a post-trade physical that included an MRI of the knee and made the decision for surgery in concert with Jackson, his representation and multiple medical experts.\nUtah acquired Jackson from the Memphis Grizzlies on Feb. 3, two days before the NBA trade deadline, and sent three first-round picks to Memphis in return.Jackson, 26, had fit in smoothly early on with his new team, averaging 22.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.0 steals in three games for Utah, which had won two of three with him in the lineup.Jackson made the All-Star team in 2022-23 and 2024-25 and was the Defensive Player of the Year in 2022-23 as well. The Jazz planned to form an impressive front-court trio of Lauri Markkanen, Walker Kessler and Jackson next season. Kessler (shoulder) is out for the season.\nThis year, however, the Jazz are treading tenuous waters. They owe a top-eight protected first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, meaning if the Jazz land with the ninth pick or later in the lottery, it heads to the Thunder. The Jazz (18-37) have the sixth-worst record in the NBA, and they have shown clear signs of tanking in recent days. Against the Orlando Magic on Saturday, they led by seven entering the fourth quarter but benched Markkanen, Jackson and Jusuf Nurkic for the rest of the game in an eventual loss.If the season ended today with the Jazz having the sixth-worst record in the league, there's a 96% chance their pick would land in the top eight and they would keep the selection.Jackson finishes his season averaging 19.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 1.1 steals per game. He has played in at least 70 games just once in the past four seasons. His four-year, $205 million extension kicks in next season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After almost two years of rumors and speculation, the White Sox finally traded center fielder Luis Robert Jr. last month, sending him to the Mets for utility man Luisangel Acuña and righty Truman Pauley. Considering Robert hit 38 home runs and was a 4.9 WAR player in 2023, it's an underwhelming return, but his last two years were full of injuries and ineffectiveness.    Acuña is Ronald's younger brother and he's a utility guy who does his best work on the bases and in the field. Last season, he authored a .567 OPS with the Mets, but also went 16 for 17 stealing bases and played four positions (second base, shortstop, third base, center field). The White Sox figure to play Acuña most of the time in center field this season.    White Sox GM Chris Getz has spoken highly of Acuña since the trade, as GMs are wont to do, but there is one small problem: Getz keeps calling Acuña a switch-hitter, which he most certainly is not. He's a righty bat. Four times -- four! -- Getz has publicly called Acuña a switch-hitter:    \nIf it happens once, fine. People misspeak. But four times -- again, FOUR! -- is a bit of a problem. Getz doesn't know his player and also his staff has not bothered to correct him, which is another problem in and of itself. Things got to the point that Getz issued a statement Thursday regarding Acuña's handedness as a hitter.    \n\"So I probably have been getting carried away describing his versatility,\" Getz told Sox Machine. \"Why does it have to stop there? I called Luisangel and told him that even though he's just right-handed, we still love him.\"    On one hand, this is so stupid and silly that all you can do is laugh. On the other hand, the GM had to call a player and mend fences because he didn't seem to know which side of the plate he hits from. It's not a great look for Getz. It's not the end of the world either -- this will be forgotten in about a week -- but a basic detail like this should not escape the GM.    \nGetz's White Sox went 60-102 last season. That represents a 19-win improvement from their modern record 121-loss season in 2025. After trading Robert, the ChiSox used the savings to sign Seranthony Domínguez, Erick Fedde, and Austin Hays.    \n            ",

The goal is to cut down on pitch-tipping, specifically the base coaches positioning themselves in a way to pick up a \"tell\" on the pitcher.The Blue Jays and Dodgers were both asked to keep their base coaches inside the coach's box prior to Game 7 of the World Series last year, according to ESPN,. Two years ago, the Blue Jays and Yankees traded barbs after Toronto took exception to Yankees' third-base coach Luis Rojas wandering outside his box. This has become a greater and more widespread issue within the last year or so as teams look to pick up on the pitcher's pitches, sometimes with a base coach looking directly into the pitcher's glove to see his grip.\nSimilar to the foreign substance ban a few years ago, this is not a new rule. MLB will merely ramp up enforcement of an existing rule that has often been ignored over the years. Rule 5.03(c) covers the positioning of first and third base coaches:Base coaches must remain within the coach's box consistent with this Rule, except that a coach who has a play at his base may leave the coach's box to signal the player to slide, advance or return to a base if the coach does not interfere with the play in any manner. Other than exchanging equipment, all base coaches shall refrain from physically touching base runners, especially when signs are being given.Base coaches who violate Rule 5.03 are given a warning for the first offense and are ejected for the second offense, and are subject to further discipline from the commissioner. The base coaches are allowed to move once the pitch is delivered. This most commonly comes into play when the third base coach comes down the line to throw up the stop sign or wave a runner home.\nPicking up on a pitcher tipping his pitches, even by looking into his glove to see his grip, is not against the rules. That falls under on-field gamesmanship. Don't like it? Hide your grip better. Sign-stealing via electronic equipment has largely been eliminated thanks to the PitchCom system, so teams are looking for other ways to gain an advantage.\n            \n    ",

While this may technically be the time when things are supposed to slow down, they hardly ever do. Oftentimes, the NFL offseason can be just as chaotic and unpredictable as the regular season, with key pillars on the calendar making it a true 365-day league.Over the next few months, the main focus for teams will not revolve around a game on Sunday, but instead roster construction.

    "body": "\n        CHAMPAIGN, Il. -- Long-time \"Voice of the Illini,\" Brian Barnhart, climbed to his feet, readied a Tiger Woods-like fist pump and primed the vocals for his patented, \"He got it!\" call as Keaton Wagler whisked by and rose into the air with five Wisconsin defenders converging and the clock dwindling.Wagler passed up a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds of overtime against Michigan State on Saturday. Surely, this time would be different. Surely, this out-of-nowhere freshman sensation had one last trick in his bag to punctuate a 34-point, seven-assist Herculean effort.In an alternate universe, that 3-pointer goes in just like the 66 others Wagler has splashed in his cannonball-like entrance to the Big Ten.Alas, the iron was unkind, but a jump-cut to Wagler's face provided no hints. You get almost no emotion from Wagler during a game, aside from an occasional shoulder shrug after an old-fashioned three-point play or a subtle three-finger signal to his own bench after canning a parking-lot 3-pointer. \n\"It's kind of always just been taught to me to try not to show emotions on the court, like good or bad,\" Wagler says. \"My dad (Logan) taught me that. If I get mad or frustrated, he's always like, 'Don't show opponents that you're upset.' He always says, 'Don't show weakness.'\"This kind, skinny, under-ranked, ice-cold freshman is the person that the Underwood Family Business has chosen to build everything around. Coach Brad Underwood is pursuing Illinois' first trip to the Final Four since 2005. Offensive coordinator Tyler Underwood is on a chase to build the No. 1 offense in the country. Wagler is on a chase of something he didn't even know was possible. There are just five true freshmen in the long, proud history of Big Ten basketball who have averaged at least 17 points, four rebounds and four assists:\nMagic Johnson, Michigan State; No. 1 pick in the 1979 NBA Draft.Jalen Rose, Michigan; No. 13 pick in the 1994 NBA DraftD'Angelo Russell, Ohio State; No. 2 pick in the 2015 NBA DraftDylan Harper, Rutgers; No. 2 pick in the 2025 NBA DraftKeaton Wagler, Illinois; No. 150 recruit in the Class of 2025, per 247Sports (and that was the highest rating of all the recruiting services).Wagler is putting the final touches on a case to post the best season from a freshman guard that the Big Ten has ever housed in the one-and-done era, which dates back two decades. The numbers that Russell and Harper put up are comparable, but the teams are not. Russell's 2014-15 Ohio State club was 24-11 and earned a No. 10 seed in the Big Dance. Try as he might to flip the script, Harper's Rutgers squad finished under .500. Meanwhile, Wagler is leading an Illinois team that has national title aspirations and is tracking for a No. 2 or No. 3 seed. He's breaking both brains and models along the way.Best individual seasons from a Big Ten freshman since 2008, per Bart Torvik's Box-Plus Minus calculations:Keaton Wagler, Illinois: 11.8 BPMCody Zeller, Indiana: 10.9 BPMRobbie Hummel, Purdue: 10.8 BPMD'Angelo Russell, Ohio State: 10.8 BPMJaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State: 10.8 BPM\"I am surprised how fast my game translated to this level,\" Wagler said. \"I thought it might take a little bit for me to get used to the physicality and speed of the game.\"\nOh, he's adjusted all right. His 46-point eruption in Mackey Arena against then-No. 4 Purdue broke Illinois' single-game freshman scoring record. He gave then-No. 7 Nebraska 28 points and five dimes. He drained a halfcourt shot against Northwestern. He's posted a 30.7 assist rate in Big Ten play and a 2.4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio against league foes ahead of Sunday's clash against rival Indiana (1 p.m.  ET on CBS).\"Nothing,\" Brad Underwood said after the Wisconsin game when asked what else he could possibly need from Wagler. \"He needs help. He got picked up 94 feet, and they denied him. Not like that bothers him, but it's remarkable. Quite remarkable what he's doing. I didn't realize he had 34. It was the quietest 34 that there was. He's getting beaten on. Their bench stands up and claps when they commit a hard foul on him in the first half.  That's what teams are trying to do to him ... couldn't be prouder of him.\"Wagler points to a transformative summer in which he packed weight onto his thin frame with help from Adam Fletcher, Illinois' revered strength and conditioning coach. He survived Kylan Boswell's trial by fire and earned gushing praise from Illinois' senior guard. He learned what it was like to try and navigate a shot-blocker like 7-foot-2 big man Zvonimir Ivisic, who has go-go gadget arms and swats anything and everything. He convinced the Underwoods that he had to be in Illinois' starting lineup.\nOh, and made a friend.Tyler Underwood, 29, has become one of the premier offensive masterminds in college basketball. It was Tyler who convinced his dad to target Wagler on the recruiting trail. The dance between point guard and offensive coordinator is similar to the quarterback-playcaller tango on the gridiron. That mind-meld between Underwood and Wagler was built on the belief that there was more to this gangly big guard from Shawnee, Kansas, who is a little scrawny but can drill pull-up jumpers and seems to make the right play again and again and again.\"Before every game, he's always telling me, 'They can't guard you; just play how you always play,'\" Wagler said. \"Then, he just trusts me a lot to make decisions. Especially in late-game situations, he will just put the ball in my hands. He believes I'm gonna make the right play every time. We always mess around with each other, so it's a good relationship that we have. It honestly seems more like best friends, really. It's cool.\"\nThere's even more history on the line for Wagler, whether he likes it or not. No freshman has ever won Big Ten Player of the Year. Wagler is firmly in the thick of that race with Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg, Michigan State's Jeremy Fears Jr. and Purdue's Braden Smith. The beauty of this college basketball season is that there's a crescendo coming. The stakes are growing by the game, and Wagler knows what's coming down the pipe. Illinois has national championship aspirations, and he can help take them to the mountaintop if he keeps hooping like this.But in a lot of ways, Wagler wants to keep it all the same -- just keep taking the singles in his pick-and-roll game. Just keep firing from downtown if the defense relaxes for just a moment. Just keep rebounding, which is a major point of emphasis for his dad, Logan. \nWagler tries to get at least one offensive rebound per game and tip another one out for a second-chance opportunity. He has 46 offensive boards in 25 games this year. That keeps his dad and coach extremely happy. Just keep going back to the well with that patented tight spin move that he's used to de-pants defenders left and right since he added it to his holster his junior year at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. \"It's just always worked,\" Wagler says with a laugh. \"I just spin super quickly, and it's not a slow spin. It's just like a quick spin, and I get it out to my other hand before they can get to it. And then usually if a team starts to recognize it and try to come steal it, I can see them coming, so I'll hold it in tight and be able to kick it out. It's hard to stop even if teams know it's coming.\"His name might bring a shudder in Mackey's walls, but Wagler still hasn't dove headfirst into the NIL world. In an era of $3 million contracts for the biggest name in the portal and $1 million deals for role players, Wagler is primed to be the lowest-paid All-American by a country mile. \nHe had a small promotional deal with McLeod Express, a trucking company in Decatur, Illinois. The t-shirt business has been booming -- one features his shot chart from the Purdue masterclass, where he went 13-for-17 from the field, has been flying off the rack -- but that's about it on the money-making front.\"There is one shirt that has my face on it, I think I look crazy in,\" Wagler says.We'll get the R&D team on that, pronto.There's money to be made later. Wagler's summer schedule is already filling up. His May will be spent at the NBA Draft Combine. Illinois wing Andrej Stojakovic wants to jet back to his home country of Greece after the season to take another swanky vacation. Boswell earned the invite in August. Round 2 will have another visitor.\n\"Andrej was like, 'You're coming with us this time,'\" Wagler says. \"I think I'm on board for that.\"Just add that to the stack of invites that Wagler has earned, but the itinerary better keep June 24 clear. Wagler will have more history to make on that night.Maybe he'll even crack a smile.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the Super Bowl is over and it's seven long months until NFL action resumes, bettors are left with a couple of options. Some are taking a deep breath, perhaps calculating their profits and losses from the NFL season on a spreadsheet, celebrating or lamenting their luck from Super Bowl 60 wagers and perhaps preparing to turn their attention to another sport for the time being. Others are already exploring what NFL bets for next season they can make now. For this camp, DraftKings Sportsbook already has posted live 2026 NFL future odds for all potential division winners. This option not only provides a needed alternative to Super Bowl futures wagers, which historically are about the only such NFL future offered this time of year, but this market has proven to be a gold mine for NFL handicappers and bettors who have a talent for accurately pegging the projections of teams in the parity-heavy NFL. This past season serves as a prime example of the volatility in the NFL divisional winner futures market. The Philadelphia Eagles (-160) were the only favorite in the eight division races to reward their supporters as they repeated as NFC East champions with an 11-6 record. The seven others featured underdog winners, including two worst-to-first turnarounds. Those milestones were achieved by the New England Patriots (+550), who went from 4-13 to 13-4 on their way to a Super Bowl 60 appearance, where they were drubbed 29-13 by the Seattle Seahawks, and the Chicago Bears (+600), who conquered the talent-rich NFC North at 11-6 in their first season under Ben Johnson and reached the Divisional Round of the playoffs. It stands to reason that this upcoming season will likely feature at least one similar turnaround, and now is the best time to scalp potential value despite the uncertainty surrounding the NFL Draft and free agency that concerns all 32 clubs. However, even if you lean toward playing chalk, the good news is that zero teams come with a hefty price tag. The Eagles (-110) are the only repeat favorites, while the Ravens (-110) and Bills (-115) carry discount price tags to win their respective divisions. The following are the current DraftKings odds for every 2026 NFL division winner: Place NFL futures bets at DraftKings and get bonus bets:AFC East 2026 divisional oddsBuffalo Bills -115New England Patriots +115 New York Jets +2000Miami Dolphins +2000 AFC North 2026 divisional oddsBaltimore Ravens -110 Cincinnati Bengals +210Pittsburgh Steelers +450Cleveland Browns +1200 AFC South 2026 divisional oddsHouston Texans +160  Jacksonville Jaguars +180Indianapolis Colts +350Tennessee Titans +750AFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Chargers +175Kansas City Chiefs +175Denver Broncos +210 Las Vegas Raiders +3000 NFC East 2026 divisional oddsPhiladelphia Eagles -110 Dallas Cowboys +475 Washington Commanders +500New York Giants +700 NFC North 2026 divisional oddsDetroit Lions +160 Green Bay Packers +185 Chicago Bears +350 Minnesota Vikings +700 NFC South 2026 divisional oddsTampa Bay Buccaneers +115 New Orleans Saints +340 Atlanta Falcons +400 Carolina Panthers +425 NFC West 2026 divisional oddsLos Angeles Rams +155 Seattle Seahawks +160San Francisco 49ers +250 Arizona Cardinals +5000Initial sleeper/value leans:Here are our initial value/sleeper picks for each NFL division:AFC East, Patriots (+115): Of course, it's an inherent contradiction to call a Super Bowl participant a \"sleeper,\" but we can put the Patriots in the value category. This is one division in which we can safely rule out the massive underdogs and, though it could be a mistake to disrespect Josh Allen and the Bills, we weren't wild about their head-coaching hire in Joe Brady and the embarrassing public fallout amid the firing of former coach Sean McDermott that suggested organizational dysfunction. We'll take the plus-money price on the more stable team that appeared to be at least one year ahead of schedule with its memorable run to the Super Bowl. AFC North, Bengals (+210): For better or worse, Zac Taylor is the lone returning AFC North coach. Quarterback Joe Burrow's late-season return from injury showed that the Cincinnati offense still has immense upside. If the franchise can make the necessary moves to field a simply serviceable defense, the opportunity is there for the Bengals to take advantage of a division that is otherwise filled with transitional franchises. AFC South, Jaguars (+180): In their first year under coach Liam Cohen, the Jags were among the biggest surprises amid their 13-4 finish and playoff appearance. We understand that the elite defensive profile of the Texans, who finished the regular season with nice consecutive wins, is why they are the slight chalk. But as their playoff struggles illustrated, they could be facing a dilemma at quarterback while Trevor Lawrence and friends are likely to take another step forward. AFC West, Chiefs (+170): Last year, the Chiefs experienced regression with their record in close games and saw their season lost amid an injury to quarterback Patrick Mahomes. While this is far from a confident bounce-back spot for a club that has some areas to address, we still like the principle value of backing Mahomes and coach Andy Reid to return to prominence in the tight division, and the price overlay is a lot more enticing than the -250 or so tag that came with them for the past several seasons. NFC East, Giants (+700): The Giants appear to have the most promising profile to follow in the footsteps of the Patriots and Bears for a worst-to-first turnaround. They immediately nabbed the best coach in the division as winners of the John Harbaugh sweepstakes and, with a franchise quarterback in place, a strong defensive line and last-place schedule to feast upon, the needed elements are present. Moreover, the Eagles are shrouded in instability amid a new, unproven offensive coordinator and the uncertain futures of stars such as mercurial wideout A.J. Brown. NFC North, Bears (+350): The Bears appeared to be just hitting their offensive peak as the playoffs approached, and another step forward could make this club as potent as the one Johnson led while he was with the Lions. Their leaky defense is a major concern, but we've often seen one or two personnel changes or an adjustment in scheme make a huge difference for a specific unit. We expect the Lions, who swept the Bears last year, to return to relevance, but the price is nice for backing Chicago to continue its upward trajectory. NFC South, Falcons (+400): This club underachieved relative to its talent level the past two seasons and new coach Kevin Stefanski, who led the Browns to the playoffs in his first year with the franchise, could be poised to exploit the NFL's most vulnerable division. The recent legal troubles of breakout rookie defensive end James Pearce Jr. (he's currently facing five felony charges) is a massive concern for a defense that made major strides last season. Even so, this team should have enough talent to threaten for the NFC South title. NFC West, Seahawks (+160): With all due respect to the possibility of the proverbial Super Bowl hangover, it still stands to reason that the this division will likely come down to a Week 17 or 18 showdown for the Seahawks against the Rams or 49ers. This club has proven to answer the call in such spots under coaching wunderkind Mike Macdonald and, as such, we're tipping our proverbial hats by not fading the Super Bowl champions in their quest to repeat. Sign up with DraftKings and start earning bonus bets today:\n            ",

    "description": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – The first 48-team World Cup was always destined to have unique quirks but as FIFA closed out their week in Washington, D.C",
    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – The first 48-team World Cup was always destined to have unique quirks but as FIFA closed out their week in Washington, D.C., they came up with one final random twist for a week centered around Friday's draw. Representatives from the qualified teams gathered one last time on Saturday for a schedule reveal event, one so random that even president Gianni Infantino did not know what to call it when he entered the stage. The event, though, did serve a practical purpose – visiting national teams finally found out which stadiums they would play their opening games in, FIFA essentially splitting the experience of the luck of the draw in two parts.While head coaches waited to find out their exact opponents on Friday before pondering their side's strengths against their group stage foes, the major talking points from Saturday's schedule reveal were  the elements that await them regardless of the other team on the pitch. Whether they watched from up close or from a distance, many got a preview of a North American summer during this year's Club World Cup – a not-so-pleasant preview, to be exact. Hot and humid days were essentially experienced by all 32 club teams at the U.S.-based tournament, leaving World Cup coaches rooting for the best-case scenario in terms of logistics.Several got what they wanted and breathed a sigh of relief once the schedule was unveiled. The list included Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, who will open their World Cup against the Caribbean nation of Curacao at Houston's NRG Stadium, the first NFL venue to build a retractable roof. They will then take on Ivory Coast at Toronto's BMO Field and close out Group E action against Ecuador at MetLife Stadium in the New York suburbs in a match that kicks off at 4 p.m. local time.\"I think it's three good stadiums, climate [controlled] stadiums so it's more easy for us,\" Nagelsmann said. \"We're not used to this high temperature, less [so] than Curacao, but now it's in a climate [controlled] stadium, air conditions. It's more easy for us. Second game in Toronto, I think it's not that hot compared to Miami or other venues so at least the last game in New York, it will be very hot but … we'll try to travel as early as possible to the U.S. so that we can adapt to the temperature and we'll be very prepared.\"\nMuch like the temperatures, distance was top of mind ahead of a World Cup with a sizable geographic footprint. The 2026 tournament will be spread from coast to coast and features host cities as far north as Vancouver and as far south as Mexico City, which varies greatly from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the 2018 competition that was confined to Russia's western cities. Head coach Rudi Garcia considered himself lucky that Belgium will be confined to the west coast for their Group G games against Egypt, Iran and New Zealand. Belgium are targeting a base camp in Seattle following the draw.\"Our base camp will be the west coast so normally, we'll be in Seattle,\" Garcia said. \"We are lucky about that because we are in the west coast, but in the north of the west coast. Seattle, Vancouver, it will not be hot to play, just a long flight – or an important flight – to go to [Los Angeles]. Maybe it will be a little hotter but not so much. The particularity of our games, the two first games, is that we will play at noon, at 12 [p.m], so it's not so easy to prepare. We need to wake up the players earlier.\"Portugal were also on the receiving end of a favorable situation with two games at NRG Stadium – one against Uzbekistan and another against the winner of an intercontinental playoff – and a third at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, the last one a game against Colombia with a 7:30 p.m. local kickoff time that will at least ensure the sun will not be beating down on players. Head coach Roberto Martinez, a member of FIFA's technical study group during the Club World Cup, said the game-time conditions are just one part of navigating North America's unique summertime patterns.\n\"It really alerted me for many red flags and aspects we need to anticipate so from that point of view, it was essential to have that experience,\" Martinez said about the Club World Cup. \"Now, I stayed in Miami for a long time so we got to play in Miami. I'm really happy with that. We're going to play in Houston. … Red flags is the training times, what you should do in terms of the cooling breaks, in terms of the potential threat of a storm and logistics, where would you train before a game. There are many aspects with the logistics that are very unique, very different. It's never happened that three countries are organizing a World Cup. You can imagine that there are many aspects that are still a little bit unknown.\"Final World Cup preparations underwayAs a global soccer convention of sorts comes to a close in Washington, D.C., the focus for World Cup-bound teams immediately shifts to scouting the teams they will face six months from now. In March, though, those national teams will reconvene for their final international break before the World Cup. Portugal and Belgium have booked trips to North America to face World Cup co-hosts U.S. and Mexico, the pair of friendlies offering an important trial run with next summer's tournament now fully in sight.Those friendlies were confirmed before Friday's draw and Saturday's schedule reveal, the visiting national teams among several who wanted to get a feel for things in North America before the tournament began. Portugal's March schedule was mostly constructed with a visit to Azteca Stadium to face Mexico in mind in case a trip to the venue would be required during the World Cup, something that is now unlikely. They will also face the U.S. men's national team in Atlanta, where they could play knockout matches depending on their run.\n\"I think playing in the Azteca, for us, was the main point,\" Martinez said. \"Playing at altitude is not something we can do playing in Europe. In Europe, playing at 1,500 meters is nowhere near the preparation you need for the Azteca so for us, the aspect of reliv[ing] the big moments in '86. We all grew up having many memories of those moments in the Azteca so for us from a psychological aspect, I think it makes total sense to live that in March rather than in the opening game of our World Cup story.\"Martinez previously visited Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the Super Bowl 2017 but as a spectator, though playing against the USMNT offers a chance to face a team from North America. While the final member of Group K will not be determined until March, that spot could be occupied by Jamaica should they get through a playoff that includes New Caledonia and DR Congo.\"To be honest, I haven't seen them,\" he said of the USMNT. \"We were focused on our preparation and qualifying for the World Cup but we're excited because I think playing USA is the only opportunity to play Concacaf teams so we're really looking forward. Obviously, Mauricio Pochettino is a very experienced coach and the technical staff, and they worked at the highest levels in Europe so we know them very, very well so it'll be only good things about their work and their preparation for the team so I think it's a great game for both national teams to prepare for the World Cup.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Around the World in 80 Days isn't just the name of a famous novel, it's also likely going to be the theme for the San Francisco 49ers' season in 2026. The 49ers are going to serve as the home team for the NFL's game in Mexico City this year, per ESPN.Normally, that wouldn't necessarily qualify as a big announcement, but the 49ers are also playing in Australia, so they'll be doing a historic amount of traveling in 2026. With the two trips, the 49ers will become the first team ever to play multiple international games in nonconsecutive weeks.The Jaguars have played back-to-back games in London multiple times. Then there's the Vikings, who became the first team to play in two different foreign countries in a single season when they played back-to-back games in Ireland and England last year. In each of those instances, the Vikings and Jaguars got to cram two games into one trip, but that won't be the case for San Francisco.The 49ers' unprecedented international schedule will see them travel to Australia to play the Rams in a game that's expected to be played in Week 1.\nIf the 49ers do end up playing in Mexico City, that means they'll be traveling more than 38,100 miles in 2026, which would be the most ever for a team during a regular season in NFL history. The 2025 Chargers and 2016 Rams both topped 37,000 miles, but no team has hit 38,000 miles. (The Rams are also playing in Australia this year, and their current travel estimate is about 35,000 miles for the 2026 season.)The 49ers actually wanted to serve as the home team for the game in Mexico City, which is something owner Jed York revealed last week.\"For us, Mexico is one of our markets. We will most likely give up a home game this season to play abroad, and Mexico is always No. 1 on my list,\" York said. \nThe NFL has held six games in Mexico City over the past 21 years, and the 49ers have played in two of them, including the most recent one, which came against the Cardinals in 2022.Playing in Mexico City wasn't an option over the past three seasons because the NFL didn't hold any games in the Mexican capital, but that will change in 2026. During NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's annual news conference at the Super Bowl, he announced that the league would return to Mexico City for the upcoming season as part of a multiyear deal.\"We're heading back to Mexico City in December, which I think is wonderful for our fans in Mexico,\" Goodell said.\nThe game will be played at Estadio Banorte (formerly Estadio Azteca).Goodell said the Mexico game will be played in December, which means it will fall in either Week 13 or Week 14. (Under NFL rules, international games can't be scheduled after Week 14.) So the 49ers will be looking at going around the world in roughly 90 days, since the Mexico game will come about 90 to 100 days after their game in Melbourne.The 49ers' home schedule in 2026 consists of the Cardinals, Rams, Seahawks, Eagles, Commanders, Vikings, Broncos, Raiders and Dolphins, so San Francisco will be playing one of those nine teams in Mexico. You can probably rule out the Rams since the NFL won't send both 49ers-Rams games out of the country. The Commanders also seem unlikely since they're scheduled to play in Europe.Of the six games the NFL has held in Mexico City since 2005, two involved the 49ers facing the Cardinals, so Arizona could certainly be an option — especially since the Cards have marketing rights in Mexico. If the NFL decides to go with an AFC-NFC matchup, which has been popular for international games, then the Broncos would make sense. The Raiders are also popular in Mexico and have played two games there, but it would make more sense to keep that game in the Bay Area since the Raiders still have plenty of fans there from their time in Oakland.\nMexico will be one of nine international games this year. Here's a look at the full list: Melbourne, AustraliaLondonLondonLondonMunich Rio De Janeiro Madrid Paris Mexico CitySo far, we already know the \"home\" teams for three of those games: Rams (Australia), Saints (Paris), Cowboys (Rio De Janeiro). We also know three other teams will serve as international home teams, but we don't know where they'll be playing yet (Commanders, Lions and Falcons). Now, it's looking like the 49ers are the seventh known home team.Of course, if you're a 49ers fan, don't go booking a flight to Mexico City just yet -- nothing is official until the NFL announces it.\n            ",

    "body": "\nArsenal will be looking for their fifth straight victory in all competitions while maintaining their English Premier League lead when they visit Brentford on Thursday. The Gunners (17-5-3) have a six-point lead over Manchester City in the EPL table after cruising to a 3-0 home victory against Sunderland on Saturday. The Bees (12-3-10) are seventh in the Premier League table and won 3-2 at Newcastle following a big 1-0 victory against top-four Aston Villa the previous weekend.     Kickoff at Brentford, England's Gtech Community Stadium is set for 3 p.m. ET. Arsenal are -155 favorites on the money line in the latest Arsenal vs. Brentford odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, Brentford are +425 and a draw is priced at +290.

Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis for Arsenal vs. Brentford on Wednesday, Feb. 11.Arsenal vs. Brentford best betsArsenal to Win and Under 4.5 goals -110 (1 unit)Arsenal to Keep a Clean Sheet +137 (0.5 units)Arsenal will try to tighten their grip on the Premier League title race when they take on Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday. The Gunners remain six points clear of title rivals Man City at the top of the table after beating Sunderland 3-0 at the weekend. They're on a four-game winning streak in all competitions, so they'll carry a great deal of momentum into this game.Arsenal have the best away record in the league this season, with seven wins, three draws and just two defeats from 12 games. However, Brentford's home record is identical -- seven victories, three draws and two losses from 12 at Gtech. The Bees have the sixth-best home record in the division and are full of confidence right now. It promises to be a tight game and could be decided by a set piece or a moment of individual brilliance.Arsenal Dominate Head-to-HeadsBrentford secured promotion to the Premier League in 2021, ending a 74-year exile from England's top division. Their first Premier League game was against Arsenal, and they earned a famous 2-0 win in front of their jubilant home fans.That was a joyous occasion for Brentford, but their record against Arsenal has been dismal in the ensuing years. Since then, Arsenal have picked up seven wins and two draws from nine games against Brentford.Their latest clash took place at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium two months ago. Goals from Mikel Merino and Bukayo Saka earned the Gunners a deserved 2-0 victory. They had 64% of the possession, and Brentford didn't manage a single shot on target in the game.The Gunners have also won their last four away games against Brentford, scoring 11 goals and conceding just once. They've absolutely dominated the Bees in recent years, which should give them confidence as they travel to the Gtech.Arsenal's players could be feeling a little jittery, as they're bidding to win the Premier League title for the first time in 22 years. They're the -600 favorites to win the league with most sportsbooks, but they've choked several times over the past few years.However, they looked supremely composed in their 4-0 away win against Leeds on Jan. 31 and followed it up with a 1-0 win against Chelsea. They earned a third consecutive clean sheet when beating Sunderland 3-0 on Saturday, and their defense looks rock-solid right now.Arsenal have kept 13 clean sheets in 25 league games this season and have only conceded 0.68 goals per game, so they could thwart Brentford's attack.Brentford are Flying HighBrentford will be on a high after beating Newcastle 3-2 at St. James' Park on Saturday. The Bees have won their last two league games and are up to seventh in the league table, level on points with reigning champions Liverpool.Most pundits expected Brentford to be in a relegation battle this season. After all, manager Thomas Frank moved to Tottenham in the summer. They also lost their two best forwards, as Bryan Mbeumo moved to Man United and Yoan Wissa joined Newcastle.They've defied all expectations, so new manager Keith Andrews deserves a great deal of credit. This is a strong, athletic Brentford team, with a powerful spine. Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg are solid at the back, veteran Jordan Henderson patrols the midfield, and Igor Thiago and Dango Outtara have been very prolific in attack.They have no major injury concerns right now, although winger Kevin Schade is suspended. Meanwhile, Arsenal are missing Saka and Merino through injury. Captain Martin Ødegaard, and winger Leandro Trossard could also miss this game.Yet the Gunners have strength in depth. They're playing Wigan in the FA Cup at the weekend, so they can afford to play their best XI in this game then rest key players against Wigan. We could see a front three of Gabriel Martinelli, Viktor Gyökeres, and Noni Madueke, which would give Arsenal pace on the counter-attack. The Gunners have a world-class midfield and are always dangerous at set pieces.They can also call upon the likes of Kai Havertz, Eberechi Eze, and Gabriel Jesus, and that strength in depth could ultimately prove decisive, allowing them to secure a narrow away win. The last 10 games between these teams have seen Under 4.5 goals, so combining Arsenal to Win with Under 4.5 Goals looks appealing.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training camps opened this week and almost immediately, Major League Baseball saw three notable players succumb to hamate bone injuries: Francisco Lindor of the Mets, Corbin Carroll of the Diamondbacks and Jackson Holliday of the Orioles. Lindor and Carroll are expected back by Opening Day, but Holliday's return will be \"measured in weeks\" after the regular season starts, according to president of baseball operations Mike Elias.The first question that comes to mind with every sports fan out there: why do we only seem to see this injury in baseball? For starters, that's not actually true, even though MLB players do seem to dominate the headlines. Golfer Bryson DeChambeau, for example, missed two months in 2022 after fracturing his hamate bone. But it's all about the equipment.\"This injury is unique in that it only really occurs with a direct blow over the most prominent part of the hamate bone, known as the hook of the hamate,\" Dr. Rodney Benner, an orthopedic surgeon in Indianapolis, told CBS Sports. \"As such, the only way it usually happens is when the end of a bat, golf club, hockey stick or some other object directly impacts the area. Hitters in baseball get jammed or a forceful check swing, which causes the end of the knob if the bat to impact the hamate. This can also happen grounding a golf club or making a similar motion with a hockey stick.\" The next place our minds go is to the preventative aspect. Is there anything hitters can do? The answer is not a ton, really. \n\"There are pads that can be worn over the hook of the hamate to try and cushion the area,\" Benner said. \"Unfortunately fractures of the hamate can still happen.\"And then there's the power. Players returning from broken hamate bones and subsequent surgery have long been assumed to lose their power, at least temporarily. In going back though the last 10 seasons of data, there isn't actually evidence of a loss of power upon return. Here are some prominent cases with decent samples of statistics on both sides of the injury.In 2016, Francisco Cervelli was slugging .293 before the injury (49 games) and slugged .352 after his return (52 games).It was only a 12-game sample before the end of the season, but in 2016 Mark Reynolds returned to hit .281/.378/.500. He was hitting .283/.354/.446 before the injury.Superstar José Ramírez came back for three games in late September after his hamate injury. He homered twice in his first game back and once in his second. Tommy Pham dealt with this in 2020. He hit .207/.316/.293 in 23 games before the injury and .222/.300/.370 in eight games after his return to close the season before hitting .375/.400/.458 in six playoff games. Aristides Aquino homered in his first and fourth games after returning in 2021. Mike Trout in 2023 returned for just one game before re-injuring his wrist to end his season. He was himself to start 2024, homering six times in the first 11 games. Still, it's always possible there are lingering issues, as with any procedure.For years, we've heard stories, including from famed surgeon Dr. James Andrews, about youth players and their parents asking to have preventative Tommy John surgery without even having torn the ulnar collateral ligament in their elbow. Could we apply that mindset here and see players wanting to have their hamate surgery (removal of the bone) without it actually being injured?\nFormer All-Star Andrew Benintendi had his hamate bone removed after breaking it in college, only to somehow break it again in 2022. It was unclear at the time if the bone had regrown or not been fully removed.\"I am not aware of anyone advocating for removing the hook of the hamate to prevent injury in an athlete that does not have pain or other symptoms associated with it,\" Benner told CBS Sports. \"However, athletes can experience chronic pain in the hamate from repetitive trauma to the area, as opposed to a one-time acute injury on a specific swing. Nonsurgical treatment is possible in chronic cases in those athletes, but there is a high risk of continued symptoms or progression of the injury resulting in a complete fracture and subsequent surgery. It is possible to fix the hook of the hamate with a screw, but nonunion (failure of healing) of the fracture is common, so many athletes have the hook excised rather than fixed. Excision can usually result in rapid return to play within 6-8 weeks. However, mild strength loss and tenderness in the area can limit the ability to swing the bat effectively in the early phase of return to play. The ulnar nerve, one of the main nerves in the wrist and hand, is also nearby, so nerve complications are possible with surgery.\"The expectation here is that, while players continue to get bigger and stronger -- swinging harder -- while facing pitchers that throw harder and harder, we'll continue to see this injury pop up predominantly in baseball. The good news is it's a relatively quick-and-easy procedure and players are back to being themselves shortly thereafter. May that be the same for Lindor, Carroll and Holliday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've reached the NBA All-Star break, which will allow most players some needed rest before the final two months of the regular season. But for some rookies, they'll have the honor of competing in the Rising Stars competition during All-Star Weekend. All of the suspected names are on the rosters. No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, however, will miss the showcase due to injury. Kon Knueppel and VJ Edgecombe, amongst other top players in the 2025 class will still be there. They've all been drafted by a trio of coaches -- Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady -- to three teams. A fourth team of G League players will compete in the tournament on Friday night in L.A.There should be some exciting matchups with this crop of players. But before we get to the All-Star break, let's take a look at where the rookies stand at this point in the season.    5. Cedric Coward, Grizzlies    \nIt's been a rough few games for Coward, who in his last five games is averaging just eight points. He missed a game against the Trail Blazers with a shoulder issue, and played just 11 minutes against the Warriors after colliding with teammate GG Jackson, which forced him to remain out. But while his scoring is floundering as of late, his ability to impact the game in other ways is why he's still so high on this list.    Take the five-point outing he had against the Kings. He only shot the ball six times, but he also had seven rebounds and six assists, and finished the game with a plus-minus of +11. Most of those assists in that Sacramento game were a product of Coward just making the right read. He's making quick-hit touch passes to guys cutting to the rim. Or leading the break in transition and getting it to the right guy to put up a shot. That's an important skill to already have down as a rookie.     \nCoward's not forcing up his shot over three defenders, he's finding the open guy on the perimeter and generating a great look for his teammates. It's an encouraging sign for the Grizzlies that even when Coward isn't putting up points, he's able to still be impactful in other ways.        4. Derik Queen, Pelicans    \nQueen's scoring has declined since December when he was putting up 15 a night, but that was to be expected as the Pelicans got healthier. However, it's pretty apparent that Queen is a foundational piece for the future, so it seems like a disservice for him to be getting fewer touches -- especially when the Pelicans have no intention on competing this season with a 15-41 record.    Still, though, Queen is showing flashes of being an offensive hub for New Orleans. Someone who can create offense and attract defensive pressure and setup his teammates for easy looks. Ideally, the Pelicans would probably love it if Queen and Zion Williamson could be an elite offensive duo playing off each other long term, but in reality, that might not be something New Orleans can do.    \nWilliamson is best when he has the ball in his hands and he's able to get downhill and make decisions in space. That can't happen as much when Queen is on the floor, because the former Maryland product is entirely an on-ball threat. When that tandem shares the floor together this season, the Pelicans have a net rating of -9.1 The offense stalls at a 108.0 rating, which is surprisingly worse than the team's season average of 112.4. The defense is even worse when Queen and Williamson are on the floor together, relinquishing 117.1 points which is only slightly better than the team's average of 118.0.    This appears to be heading in a direction where the Pelicans have to make a decision on the long-term fit of Queen and Williamson next to each other. Because as of right now, it seems like Williamson's presence is stifling Queen's development.    3. VJ Edgecombe, 76ers    \nThere was a play in an early January matchup against the Knicks that perfectly encapsulated what Edgecombe brings to the Sixers. On defense, he closes out late to Mikal Bridges setting up for a corner 3-pointer, and somehow blocks the shot. The Sixers corralled the ball, and Edgecombe was immediately signaling to give him the ball in transition and he cuts to the middle, uses his speed and athleticism to get by Tyler Kolek with no issue and sails to the rim for a dunk.   \nLet's just talk about the first half of that play. I'm not even sure how Edgecombe got out to Bridges that quickly, let alone alter the shot for it to sail behind the backboard. And then to immediately still be connected to the possession and get a bucket on the other end? Mind-blowing for a rookie. When Edgecombe makes plays like that, you can see the extra boost of energy it gives the Sixers. He's struggled to score efficiently since early January, but he's also averaging five rebounds and nearly five assists a game. He hasn't racked up points at the rate he was doing early in the season, but I don't think anyone expected for that to keep up as the Sixers got healthier.   But the reason Edgecombe remains in Philadelphia's starting lineup and sits so high in this ranking, is because he still has those handful of plays each game that make you shake your head in disbelief. In an embarrassing blowout loss to the Knicks on Wednesday, Edgecombe hit a couple filthy turnaround midrange jumpers that really stood out in what was an otherwise demoralizing loss for the Sixers.       2. Kon Knueppel, Hornets    \nWith each game Knueppel plays, he's constantly making history. He's the first rookie this season to each 1,000 points. In doing so, he became the fourth-fastest player to reach that milestone in NBA history. Knueppel did it in 53 games, putting him behind Zion Williamson (44 games), Victor Wembanyama (49 games) and Paolo Banchero (51 games).  \nHe's teetering on a 50/40/90 season, and if he does, he'll become the first rookie ever to accomplish that feat. Knueppel's the best rookie shooting prospect we've seen since Stephen Curry, but even the greatest shooter of all time wasn't making 3s on this volume. The brilliance of Knueppel is how he's able to shake free from a defender to get his shot off. He's an off-ball movement savant, setting screens to cause traffic jams for multiple defenders, only to release out to the 3-point line and pull up from deep.  Even if the screen isn't primarily for him, he's still using it to cause just an ounce of confusion to the defense to create space.  Or he'll fake like he's coming up for a dribble hand off, only to juke his defender and slide back over to get off a corner 3-pointer.  \nIt's undeniable that Knueppel is the best shooter in this class, and he's surely benefiting from two great offensive players in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, who draw tons of defensive attention which allows for Knueppel to get open more often than not. But Knueppel's more than just an elite shooter, he's shown flashes of being able to score off the bounce, which will be an important skill for him to continue developing. However, in this loaded offense, there isn't a ton of room for him to explore the other aspects of his game as much. That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially when the Hornets have been on a roll lately.      1. Cooper Flagg, Mavericks    \nIn the last 10 games, Flagg has been averaging 25.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists. He's shooting nearly 50% during that stretch, and unfortunately the Mavericks have gone 2-8 during that span. Or perhaps not unfortunately, as the Mavericks' trade deadline deal to send Anthony Davis to the Washington Wizards was as clear of an indication as ever that this team is rebuilding around Flagg. The day-to-day results don't matter as much for the Mavericks now, but what does is Flagg's development. He continues to live up to all the hype. His efficiency has been a standout feature of his offensive game, where he's regularly shooting over 50% from the floor most nights. Flagg's already proven to be a mid-range master, making 49% of his shots from between 4-14 feet from the basket. That ranks in the 80th percentile in the league, and it's evident that the mid-range shot is going to be Flagg's bread and butter over. His 3-point shot is his weakest offensive skill, but his month-to-month splits show some improvement. He's already shooting 46.2% from deep in February (only four games), which is an encouraging sign that he's capable of making those shots. \nBut the No. 1 overall pick has played with such poise, and gets even better in clutch situations. His defense is also lightyears ahead of where most rookies are, which was one of the major selling points of him entering the league. He's leading this Rookie of the Year race (-750 odds at FanDuel) over his former Duke teammate in Knueppel because of how much responsibility placed on his shoulders with the Mavericks. Knueppel is benefiting from the likes of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, and while he's also freeing himself up to get the ball, Knueppel isn't being asked to carry the offense.That's what's asked of Flagg, who has been at the center of Dallas' offense all season, even when Davis was healthy and on this team. It's not just that he's being tasked with more, he's performing at a high level while doing so. He's been efficient, and on most nights is the reason Dallas finds itself in so many clutch situations with his play on both sides of the floor. The downer here, is that Flagg may miss some time, as the Mavericks announced Wednesday night that he suffered a left midfoot sprain. The injury occurred during Dallas' Tuesday night loss to the Suns earlier this week, though it didn't stop Flagg from playing 36 minutes in that game. He'll miss All-Star weekend, so we'll see if he has to miss more time after the league's annual week break.  \nIf Flagg is sidelined for more than just a few games, that leaves the door open for Knueppel to perhaps take the lead in this race. Because while Flagg is leading the way, the gap between him and Knueppel is not too wide.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New Year festivities are well over, and with the PGA Tour into its second month of the 2026 season, resolutions are being tested. Whatever goals and aspirations were set forth by professional golfers are already being evaluated, especially by those who realized in the offseason that they need to improve key areas of their games.While some were undoubtedly proud of what they accomplished in 2025 when reviewing their film, others were certainly disappointed, motivated to right their wrongs as the 2026 season began.With players like Rory McIlroy beginning their PGA Tour seasons -- meaning the signature event fields you see on television going forward will be much more complete -- let's take a look at a year-end audit of how some of the biggest names in the game stood at the end of 2025.Some players experienced material changes -- Cameron Young on the greens, Xander Schauffele with the driver -- while others (Scottie Schefter) were immensely consistent.\nStrokes gained ...Off the tee🔺 Rickie Fowler (+90 spots): After losing strokes off the tee for the first time in his career in 2024, Fowler fought back in a major way. The former Players Championship winner experienced his best driving season since 2018 and set up the rest of his game, allowing him to gain strokes throughout the bag. At 37 years old, Fowler finds himself inching towards the big 4-0, but if he continues to drive the ball like this, he will have chances to win some golf tournaments.🔺 J.J. Spaun (+70): For all the discussion about his iron play, Spaun's driver is where he saw the biggest gains. The U.S. Open champion was just about a half stroke better per round with the big stick in hand, allowing him to enter the upper echelons of professional golf. He gained both distance and accuracy, and in doing so, gained recognition. The world No. 6 memorably drove the green on the 71st hole at Oakmont and split the fairway on the last to put the championship on ice.🔺 Hideki Matsuyama (-106): Matsuyama's ups and downs have always been a little weird, and 2025 was much of the same. He won The Sentry in record-setting fashion the first week of January and did not register another top 10 until October. The main culprit proved to be the driver as he experienced the worst off-the-tee season of his career. The good news is he found something late, leading to three straight top 10s around the world, including his win at the Hero World Challenge. Matsuyama's strong play has continued into the early portion of 2026.\n🔻 Xander Schauffele (-91): There were a few factors to go into Schauffele's decline: (1) he had a monster 2024 season, (2) he was injured to start 2025 and (3) when he did return, he did so in the state of Florida (i.e. a lot of water on those golf courses) with a new driver in hand, which he ultimately bagged. The two-time major champion's driving splits were checkered for most of the year, but he started to swing with more confidence towards the end of the season. The win in Japan was huge going into 2026, where he needs to prove he can play more like he did in 2024 than 2025.Other notables: Harris English (+37), Keegan Bradley (+35), Sahith Theegala (-107), Tom Kim (-68), Wyndham Clark (-66), Tony Finau (-60)Approach🔺 Justin Rose (+102): He has been alternating good and bad seasons with the irons over the last four years, and 2026 was a good one for Rose. The Englishman became the oldest player since Phil Mickelson to find the winner's circle on the PGA Tour at the St. Jude Championship and finished 72 holes trailing no other player at the Masters (for the second time in his career, mind you). Even at 45, Rose believes he still has a golden summer in his future, and given how he performed in big spots in 2025, it's worth believing him -- especially considering how he's started 2026 with another trophy.\n🔺 Tommy Fleetwood (+86): It's easy to look at the putter, but the approach play soared to new heights for Fleetwood in 2025. The Englishman was the third-best player in the world this year, behind only Scheffler and Rory McIlroy, and that is because his iron play kept pace. He claimed his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Tour Championship and then claimed another on the DP World Tour in India. Fleetwood's last 17 worldwide starts in 2025 produced two wins and seven top-four finishes.🔻 Tony Finau (-133): Just about everything was down for Finau in 2025, but his iron play was the most alarming. After a season where he trailed only Scheffler, Finau became a middling player with his scoring clubs in hand. Considering how the rest of his game sets up, the big-hitting right-hander must find his groove in this area, especially from 100-150 yards, where he was poor compared to his peers.🔻 Sungjae Im (-80): It's tough to comprehend his 2025 season. It was equal parts impressive and frustrating. Im somehow managed to play his way into the Tour Championship despite finishing second-to-last in strokes gained approach on the PGA Tour. To put this in perspective, Im lost nearly 174 strokes over the course of the year to Scheffler, who led the way in this category.\nOther notables: Patrick Cantlay (+87), Jordan Spieth (+80), Ben Kohles (+65), Collin Morikawa (+39), Sepp Straka (+33), Sam Burns (-54), Cameron Young (-42)Around the green🔺 Keegan Bradley (+92): The U.S. Ryder Cup captain was a completely different man chipping and pitching in 2025. Bradley rode strong short-game performances in majors like the PGA Championship, where he finished T8, and also in his victory at the Travelers Championship. Always a reliable ball striker, Bradley's improvement made him one of the best from tee to green this season. It's because of this uptick that the 39-year-old will still have a chance to participate in a future Ryder Cup.🔺 Jordan Spieth (+77): He was often criticized due to the number of sponsor invitations he accepted to play signature events, but no one was bothered by that more than Spieth. The three-time major champion is intent on playing himself into those tournaments in 2026, and if the current trajectory holds, he will have a good chance of doing so. In his first season following a procedure on his left wrist, Spieth made gains throughout the bag. The issue is he was not spectacular in any singula rarea -- just above average in each with his around-the-green presence among those.\n🔻 Collin Morikawa (-103): Morikawa was insistent throughout the year that his iron play needed to improve, and that's tough to argue. It ranked fourth out of his six full-time seasons on the PGA Tour, even though he ranked third overall in the league. While that may be up for debate, what isn't is his short game. Morikawa proved incapable of keeping up with the big names on days when his ball striking went awry. It's those rounds that are holding him back, and it's his short game that will propel him forward on those days. 🔻 Maverick McNealy (-110): At first glance, it is surprising to see McNealy's name on this list, but it makes sense once you investigate his profile from 2025. The 30-year-old became a much more reliable ball striker this past season with his best driving year and his best iron year (by a wide margin) under his belt. His putting was solid for his standards, and if he can find gains chipping and putting, he can return to the winner's circle with this game in 2026.Other notables: Patton Kizzire (+82), Min Woo Lee (+55), Sungjae Im (+23), Xander Schauffele (-55), Akshay Bhatia (-43), Rory McIlroy (-29)\nPutting🔺 Justin Thomas (+146): He was the season's biggest gainer, going from a bottom 11 putter in 2024 to inside the top 30 with the wand. Thomas credited a conversation with Schauffele over practice habits, and it led to his win at the RBC Heritage, where he holed one from distance in a playoff over Andrew Novak.🔺 Cameron Young (+138): Thomas was the biggest gainer, statistically, but if the eye test had anything to say, it would have penned Young's name atop the list. The former Rookie of the Year nabbed his first career title at the Wyndham Championship en route to being selected for the U.S. Ryder Cup team, where he was brilliant in his debut. All signs point to him contending in major championships in 2026 and perhaps winning one if the putter stays on course.🔺 Scottie Scheffler (+55): It was the only category he could improve in this season, and guess what? He did just that. Scheffler employed the claw putting grip from inside roughly 15 feet and turned into one of the best putters in the world. The world No. 1 eased into his 2025 campaign after an offseason injury, but once he was full strength, his name was on the leaderboard for the full tournament. The way he rolled the rock at Royal Portrush was scary … scary good and scary, period, for the rest of the world.\n🔺 Rory McIlroy (+50): After years of seemingly missing every big putt, McIlroy made just about every one of them in 2025 -- the 72nd hole at Augusta National proving to be the outlier. (Hey, he still won!) McIlroy made putts on the final hole of regulation at The Players, Irish Open and DP World Tour Championship to force playoffs, reigning victorious in a couple of them. Always a strong putter and probably unfairly criticized -- due to some of those short misses and the well running dry in major championships -- McIlroy's 2025 proved to be the best putting season of his career.Other notables: Jake Knapp (+101), Garrick Higgo (+77), Tommy Fleetwood (+72), Jordan Spieth (+36), Adam Scott (-95), Taylor Pendrith (-92), Collin Morikawa (-83), Viktor Hovland (-72)\n            ",

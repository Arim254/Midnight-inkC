Bet it at bet365 here:\nRockets -2 vs. 76ers (-110)Houston has won four of its last five games and is riding a three-game winning streak, including victories over the Timberwolves and Spurs. The Rockets covered the spread as 4.5-point home favorites against San Antonio on Tuesday, as Alperen Sengun narrowly missed a triple-double. Second-year guard Reed Sheppard scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and has knocked down 11 triples over the last three games. Philadelphia has lost three of its last four games, so SportsLine's model has Houston covering the spread in 70% of simulations. Back the Rockets at bet365 here:Over 224.5 in Lakers vs. Clippers (-110)The Clippers have won 13 of their last 16 games, but they are coming off a 138-110 loss at Chicago on Tuesday, marking the third-most points they have allowed in a game this season. They have scored at least 110 points in six of their last seven games, while the Lakers have reached that mark in six straight games.

Penn State surrenders a staggering 57% shooting on two-point attempts. Furthermore, with leading scorer Freddie Dilione limited by an ankle injury, Penn State lacks the firepower to trade baskets in a high-efficiency game. This is a revenge spot for Wisconsin, who were upset as 11-point home favorites by the Nittany Lions last March.

The 76ers are 11-12 at home this season, which is the same record as Houston has on the road. The 76ers are 10-13 against the spread at home this season. They are set to play Game Five of a six-game homestand, and the 76ers are 1-3 straight up and ATS at home during this homestand. Meanwhile, the Rockets have won three straight games. Kevin Durant is averaging 25.9 points per game this season for Houston, along with Alperen Sengun at 21.5 ppg and Amen Thompson at 18.5 ppg. The model projects the Rockets to cover in 70% of simulations. Back the Rockets at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Warriors (-5.5) vs. Mavericks (-115)The Warriors had a tough initial showing in their first game following Jimmy Butler tearing his ACL, losing 145-127 to the Raptors on Tuesday. However, they had less than 24 hours to emotionally react and mentally and physically prepare for the loss of one of their most important players heading into a matchup against a team with a winning record. With more time to accept and adjust to their new-look lineup, the model expects a better performance from the Warriors (25-20) against a Mavericks team with an 18-26 record. Dallas has won three straight games, but two of those wins came against a 15-win Jazz team. The Warriors had a 126-116 win over the Mavericks on Christmas Day in a game where Butler scored only 14 points. The Warriors still have Stephen Curry, who is 10th in the league in scoring at 27.1 ppg, and the model projects Golden State to cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Warriors at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-1.5) vs. Lakers (+100)The Clippers defeated the Lakers at home, 103-88, on Dec. 20 in their last meeting, and the Clippers will host from Inglewood again on Thursday. The Clippers are coming off a 138-110 loss to the Bulls on Tuesday, but that was the second half of a back-to-back and that loss snapped a six-game winning streak. Kawhi Leonard (knee) missed that game, and although he's officially questionable, there is optimism that he'll play on Thursday. Although the Clippers are 19-24 overall, they are 11-9 at home this season. Leonard is averaging 28.2 points per game this season, with James Harden adding 26 points and eight assists per contest.

    "body": "\n        NFL DFS players will have their final multi-game slate of the year as Championship Sunday brings both the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. The Broncos and Patriots play at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. Rams at 6:30 p.m. ET. Injuries will play a big part in both matchups with Bo Nix (ankle) out for Denver and Zach Charbonnet (ACL) out for Seattle. Denver, especially, will have a new look on offense and daily Fantasy football players will have to craft a strategy around how to value backup Jarrett Stidham and the rest of the that offense without Nix. The latter's absence could affect the likes of Courtland Sutton, Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Sunday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks on Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the NFL Championship Sunday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for SundayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Rams receiver Puka Nacua. He's been a daily Fantasy stalwart all season with a massive 129-1,715-10 receiving line. He hasn't slowed much in the NFL playoffs, turning 28 targets into 15 catches for 167 yards and a score through two games. A new wrinkle has been using him as a runner. He's now had three straight weeks with multiple carries, giving him even more daily Fantasy value. The Seahawks are tough defensively, but he sliced them up for 12 catches, 225 yards and two touchdowns in Week 16. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Nacua Over 92.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III. He should see an already heavy workload expand against the Rams with Charbonnet done for the year. Walker's track record against the Rams this year was already strong as he totaled 275 scrimmage yards and two scores against them in their two matchups in the regular season. The Rams have also allowed 160-plus rushing yards in three of their last five games after doing so just twice over their first 14 games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Walker to go Over 86.5 rushing yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Sunday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday marks the first UFC event of the year, as well as the first UFC event of the Paramount Era, when UFC 324 comes to Las Vegas. The stacked card is headlined by an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje has already held the interim lightweight title once in his career, as well as holding the ceremonial BMF title, but has never managed to hold an undisputed UFC championship. Regaining the interim title on Saturday is likely Gaethje's last path to finally achieving that feat.To do so, Gaethje will have to get past a rising star in Pimblett, who is undefeated in his Octagon career and looking to score the biggest win of his career when he faces one of the most exciting fighters in MMA history.Subscribe to Paramount+ now to get access to UFC 324 for just $8.99 per monthThe rest of the card is loaded with former champions, rising contenders and familiar names.\nAs with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 324.  \n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Now more mature, Paddy Pimblett can make good on lofty expectations he had upon his UFC debut\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter going 31-25 for our best bets in 2025, we'll look keep our roll going to start the year on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Arnold Allen\tvs.\tJean SilvaJean Silva via KO/TKO/DQ or submission +120Silva is a -258 favorite and you can get a line on him to win via either KO or decision at -250. Still, it seems the value is in taking Silva by some form of stoppage. Allen is a tough fighter who has never been stopped in his career. But Silva is nasty and dynamic in his attack, presenting a lot of problems for opponents. Allen has also been sidelined since a July 2024 win over Giga Chikadze. Coming back after a year and a half on the sidelines and having to face someone who brings the kind of wild pace that Silva does is a big ask. Silva's game is a little too wild at times, and Diego Lopes delivered a crushing reality check with a TKO win over Silva in September, but Silva has the right kind of opportunity to bounce back in a big way against Allen, who has lost two of his three most recent fights.\nNatalia Silva\tvs.\tRose NamajunasNatalia Silva via decision (-225)The line has moved slightly, with Namajunas having been around +320 a few days ago and now sitting at +300. This is a tough fight for the multiple-time former strawweight champion. Silva is on an absolute tear right now, with a 7-0 record in the Octagon and back-to-back wins over former UFC champions Jessica Andrade and Alexa Grasso. Namajunas' best chance to win is to get the fight to the ground, but Silva has shown excellent takedown defense against very good fighters. Namajunas has found ways to claw back from the brink of falling out of contention several times in her career, but Silva appears to be at the head of the next wave of flyweights. Five of Silva's seven UFC wins have come via decision and Namajunas seems unlikely to get stopped in a three-round fight, even if Silva gets the win.Waldo Cortes-Acosta\tvs.\tDerrick LewisOver 1.5 rounds (-145)Heavyweight is always something of a crapshoot, and it's entirely possible that picking the over in a fight involving UFC's all-time leader in knockouts (Lewis with 16) is the wrong play. Still, Lewis is facing a man in Cortes-Acosta who has played it safe in many of his fights. While he has back-to-back impressive knockouts of Ante Delija and Shamil Gaziev, it feels like Cortes-Acosta knows that the easiest path to victory is probably to work for takedowns off of leg kicks and try to score a grinding win. Lewis is good at getting up after being taken down, but he only defends takedowns at a 52% clip. That should lead to a fight that gets past the halfway point unless Lewis can find the opportunity to land one of his patented bombs for an early knockout.Sean O'Malley\tvs.\tSong YadongSean O'Malley moneyline (-205)After winning the bantamweight title, O'Malley ran into the exact wrong kind of opponent in Merab Dvalishvili. Dvalishvili's relentless pace and takedown attack served as the perfect kryptonite to O'Malley's game. Fortunately for O'Malley, Yadong's game is nothing like that. Yadong does not have a strong takedown game and wants to operate on the feet. In the striking realm, O'Malley had the edge, with more creativity and sharpness, as well as high-level accuracy that should be enough for him to win almost every exchange. Add in that O'Malley knows this fight is close to do-or-die for his standing as a top bantamweight, and I expect the former champion to roll on Saturday night.\nJustin Gaethje\tvs.\tPaddy PimblettPaddy Pimblett moneyline (-230)Gaethje is the quintessential all-action fighter, and he has enough power to be a threat at any moment in any fight. Pimblett's length, creativity in pressuring with grappling and dynamic top game are going to present challenges for Gaethje, however. Gaethje is 37 and with a lot of miles on his body. He also has fought just once since his April 2024 last-second knockout loss to Max Holloway at UFC 300. There are too many things working in Pimblett's favor entering this fight to pick against him getting the biggest win of his career in the first main event of the Paramount era.Who wins Gaethje vs. Pimblett, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

The promotion begins with Paramount+ on Saturday night in Las Vegas with UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena. The main event sees an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.The pair are set to square off for a piece of the gold at 155 pounds while current titleholder Ilia Topuria remains idle. The hope is for Saturday's winner to eventually face Topuria later this year.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April.

    "body": "\n        The Texas Rangers and the Washington Nationals have agreed to a trade that will send left-hander MacKenzie Gore to Texas, the teams announced Thursday. The return to the Nats is five prospects, headlined by infielder Gavin Fien, a top draft pick last summer. Abimelec Ortiz, Devin Fitz-Gerald, Alejandro Rosario and Yeremy Cabrera are also headed back to Washington.Gore, 26, made his first career All-Star team last summer. In parts of four big-league seasons, he compiled a 4.19 ERA (98 ERA+) and a 2.64 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions have been worth an estimated 6 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference's calculations.\nThe Rangers no doubt are hoping to get even better pitching from Gore heading forward. At minimum, he's a relatively young southpaw with four average or better pitches and some track record of big-league competency. He's also under club control through the 2027 season.Gore, the No. 3 pick in the 2017 Draft, was acquired by the Nationals as part of the trade that sent superstar outfielder Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres. The Nationals also fetched shortstop CJ Abrams, outfielders James Wood and Robert Hassell, and pitcher Jarlin Susana in that deal. (They also added first baseman Luke Voit, though he's long since departed the organization.)\nTrading Gore is the first major roster move orchestrated by new Nationals lead executive Paul Toboni (he earlier this winter traded reliever Jose A. Ferrer to the Mariners for former first-round pick Harry Ford). Toboni was hired earlier this winter away from the Boston Red Sox. He's subsequently spent most of his time and energy assembling new front office and field staffs, with the latter being built around Blake Butera, the youngest manager Major League Baseball has seen since 1972.\n        \n            \n                MacKenzie Gore trade grades: Rangers set up impressive rotation; Nationals pick up haul and more questions\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpring training is still a few weeks away, but the Rangers' rotation now looks something like this: RHP Jacob deGromLHP MacKenzie GoreRHP Nathan EovaldiRHP Jack LeiterRHP Kumar RockerAs for the return to the Nats, Fien was the Rangers' first-round pick last summer. Here's the CBS Sports report on him: \nFien, the 12th pick in last summer's draft, was viewed as one of the top prep bats in the class. He already possesses a promising amount of strength and plate discipline and he should benefit from adding more muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame over the coming years. The question with Fien is whether or not that added weight will cause him to move off shortstop, thereby putting more onus on the development of his bat.Ortiz, who turns 24 next month, is a first baseman/right fielder. He spent time between Double-A and Triple-A last year, hitting .257/.356/.479 with 25 home runs and RBI in 130 games.Fitz-Gerald is a 20-year-old infielder who played in 31 games in rookie ball and 10 in Class A last season after being a fifth-round pick in 2024. In those 41 games, he hit .302/.428/.482 with seven doubles, six home runs and eight stolen bases.Rosario is the second-best prospect in this haul. The 24-year-old right-hander appeared in 18 games between Class A and High-A last season. He had a 2.24 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 129 strikeouts against just 13 walks in 88 ⅓ innings. Cabrera, a 20-year-old outfielder, hit .256/.364/.366 in 102 games at Class A last season with 12 doubles, three triples, eight homers and 43 stolen bases. He's spent most of his time in center field.\n            ",

Payton's quote was brought to Boutte's attention by media members on Thursday. \"I ain't seen it,\" Boutte said. \"They can rest in Cancun, too, at the end of the day. It is what it is.\" Never one to hide his feelings, Boutte said that the Texans are \"not too complicated on defense\" prior to New England's 28-16 win over Houston in the AFC divisional round. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, however, didn't take the bait when he was asked about Payton's comments. \"I think we're plenty motivated for the game,\" Vrabel said. \nWhile he risked giving the Patriots bulletin board material, Payton's comments may have been made in an effort to raise the confidence level of not only Denver's fans, but its players, too. The Broncos, after all, will try to beat the Patriots with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center after Bo Nix sustained a season-ending ankle injury during the end of last week's win over the Buffalo Bills. Payton's comments are a clear indication that he isn't giving his players a pass or a built-in excuse if Sunday's game doesn't go their way. It's clear that Payton still has the same expectations for his team. Payton wants Broncos fans to have the same expectations, too. As the AFC's top-seeded team, the Broncos are hoping that their fans can provide a home field advantage while making things difficult when Drake Maye and the rest of the Patriots' offense is on the field. Denver's home crowd certainly made its impact felt when the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC title games after the 2013 and 2015 seasons. \nIf Denver wins, Payton's comment will likely become part of Broncos' history. If the Patriots win, rest assured that New England players and fans will make sure that he never lives it down. \n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        These last two seasons from the New York Mets have been a roller coaster ride and, after the aggressive offseason undertaken this time around",
    "body": "\n        These last two seasons from the New York Mets have been a roller coaster ride and, after the aggressive offseason undertaken this time around, 2026 will again be quite the ride.Remember, the Mets were a punchline toward the start of 2024, falling as far back as 17 ½ games by mid-June, before they got awesome. They ended up in the NLCS. Then they signed Juan Soto and stormed out to the best record in baseball in 2025. They were 45-24 after a win on June 12, putting them on pace to win 106 games. We don't need to rehash what came next. This offseason, Mets president David Stearns has been very aggressive in remaking his MLB roster. They might not be done, but it feels like the only thing left would be at-the-margins tweaks. Let's take a quick look at how things look with spring training right around the corner. The lineup could look something like this: 1. Francisco Lindor, SS2. Juan Soto, RF3. Bo Bichette, 3B4. Jorge Polanco, 1B5. Marcus Semien, 2B6. Mark Vientos/Brett Baty, DH7. Francisco Alvarez, C8. Luis Robert Jr., CF9. Carson Benge/Tyrone Taylor, LF\nThat's a stellar 1-3 and the rest of the lineup has a lot of upside. Now, the rotation.  Freddy Peralta, Nolan McLean, David Peterson, Sean Manaea, Kodai Senga and Clay Holmes makes six. Tobias Meyers can serve as a swingman (long reliever/spot starter) and there's still youngster Jonah Tong, not to mention the returning Christian Scott, who had Tommy John surgery in 2024. There are, of course, question marks all over the place. Many will be answered in the positive, but there will be some answered in the negative. Bichette has to learn third base while Polanco has to learn first. Things could turn out just fine, given they are both moving downward on the defensive spectrum, but there's always a question of how learning a new position impacts a player. It can even affect the offensive output. It's not like there are zero questions on the offensive side for either player here. Semien was incredibly reliable and had posted 7+ WAR seasons three of the last four full years through 2023. He regressed in 2024 and then did so again last season to .230/.305/.364 (97 OPS+). Worse yet, he spent time on the injured list for the first time since 2017. He's now 35 years old. Age-related decline concerns are reasonable.Which Vientos are they getting? Could Baty make those flashes into consistency? How about Alvarez?Robert has been so injured and inconsistent in his career, but that 2023 season showed it's possible there's a star in there.McLean looked like an ace for eight major-league starts, but it was only eight starts at age 24. Which Peterson shows up? Which Manaea? Can Senga stay off the injured list? We didn't mention the bullpen yet, but all bullpens are volatile by nature and there are plenty of concerns with Devin Williams, Luke Weaver and A.J. Minter at the back end here.Every player listed above has somewhere from good to immense upside. I could have named a few others, too. \nFew teams have a bunch of surefire great players. The Mets look like they have at least two in Lindor and Soto and we might be able to add Peralta to that list. Then it's a bunch of question marks, but, again, there's no denying just how much upside so many of these players have. What if the Mets get 2023 Robert along with the best versions of Bichette and Polanco while Vientos looks like his 2024 self? Meanwhile, Manaea also parties like it's 2024 while McLean doesn't miss a beat and Senga stays healthy for 30 starts? Let's say Williams and Weaver are the best versions of themselves all year too. That's a dominant team right there.Things could fall apart, too. Of course they could. There are a lot of ways. It's a relatively risky bunch. \nSimply, this Mets team, as currently constructed, looks like a playoff-caliber team (-225 to make the postseason, per Caesars). If things totally come together and enough of the questions end up working out as best as could be expected, the Mets could well win the World Series. If enough of the concerns turn out negative, the 2026 season ends up in similar fashion to 2025 as they miss the playoffs. The most likely result feels somewhere in the middle, with the Mets making the playoffs and failing to make the World Series. Still, it's gonna be a lot of fun watching it all unfold. Riding roller coasters is an exhilarating activity. \n            ",

The Los Angeles' Chargers defensive coordinator is not going forward Thursday's scheduled meeting with the Browns, according to Cleveland.com. Minter's decision comes after former Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel withdrew his name from the team's coaching search. McDaniel since accepted an offensive coordinator position with the Chargers if he does not land one of the league's other head coaching openings. Minter's decision was likely based on his belief that he has other head coaching opportunities that are more certain, according to the report. He is, for example, considered to be a strong candidate for the Baltimore Ravens opening, which offers a roster that includes two-time MVP Lamar Jackson and future Hall of Fame running back Derrick Henry. With Minter out of the running, the Browns will move ahead in their search to find their next coach. The team conducted second interviews with defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, former Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and Los Angeles Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. \nThe Browns are in this position after firing Kevin Stefanski following a 5-12 campaign. Stefanski has since replaced Raheem Morris as the Atlanta Falcons' new head coach. While they are one of the NFL's historic clubs, the Browns have struggled to remain relevant since they fired Bill Belichick after the 1995 season. Upon their return in 1999, the Browns have had just three winning seasons and two playoff appearances, both which came under Stefanski, who also led Cleveland to its first playoff win in over a quarter century. \nCleveland's current roster includes likely 2025 Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett, but it also has several serious question marks, including at quarterback with Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson all under contract. Whoever becomes the next head coach will be tasked with determining which quarterback will be under center when the Browns being the 2026 season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After 13 NFL seasons, Travis Kelce still hasn't decided if he's going to come back for another year, but he may have offered a small hint about his future plans during the most recent episode of \"The New Heights\" Podcast, which he hosts with his brother, Jason. During this week's episode, Jason brought up the fact that Eric Bieniemy will be returning as the Chiefs' offensive coordinator. Bieniemy was originally hired by the Chiefs in 2013, which just happened to be Travis' rookie year in the NFL, so the two spent 10 years together before Bieniemy moved on in 2023 to take the Commanders' offensive coordinator job. After one year in Washington, Bieniemy moved on to the college ranks as the offensive coordinator for UCLA. In 2025, he returned to the NFL as the running backs coach for Ben Johnson in Chicago. Now, Bieniemy is returning to Kansas City and Travis definitely sounds excited. \"I love that, shit. I think it's great,\" Kelce said on the podcast. And now, we get to the part where Kelce may have hinted at a possible return. The 11-time Pro Bowler mentioned that he's already excited at the thought of seeing Bieniemy back at the team facility.  \n\"I can't wait to see him back in the building,\" Kelce said. \"He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.\"If Kelce retires, then he won't be in the building anymore, so he wouldn't see Bieniemy there, but if he sticks around for one more season, then it would give him a chance to play one more year with one of his \"favorite\" coaches of all-time. On the podcast, Kelce certainly sounded excited about Bieniemy's return. Retirement speculation aside, Travis seems pretty confident that bringing Bieniemy back into the fold was a smart move for the Chiefs. \n\"I think it's a marriage that's gonna pick up right where it left off,\" Travis said. \"E.B. and who he is as a coach, you can see kind of his personality, what he brings to the table in that Chicago team. I know Ben Johnson has his own version of that, he's a very tough guy, and what he did in Detroit, he brought over as well. And you can see those running backs over in Chicago and their body of work was definitely an Eric Bieniemy style of football.\"Although Kelce's future is still up in the air, he'll almost certainly be making his retirement decision before the start of free agency so that the Chiefs can make their offseason plans. Earlier this month, Travis made it sound like he wanted to see how his body feels before making a decision. \"Right now it's just finding that answer and seeing how the body feels after this [final] game and kinda when it all settles down,\" Travis said at the end of the 2025 season. \nOne of his teammates in Kansas City isn't buying any of the retirement speculation. Chris Jones thinks that Travis will definitely be returning to play at least one more season. \"I'm not buying it, he'll be back next year,\" Jones said in early January. \"I can't promise you anything about another man. This was a tricky year for us. I have faith in my dawg coming back.\"Although Kelce is 36, he showed in 2025 that he still has some juice left in the tank, catching 76 passes for 851 yards and five touchdowns, leading the Chiefs in all three of those categories. \nThere are a lot of reasons why Travis would potentially want to return for one more year. For one, he likely won't want to end his career on a low note, which is what would happen if he calls it quits after a season where the Chiefs went just 6-11. The 2025 season marked just the second time in 13 seasons that Kelce has missed the playoffs. Also, you'd have to think that Patrick Mahomes would love to have Kelce back. The Chiefs quarterback tore his ACL in December and he's going to be motivated to return with a vengeance in 2026 and he's probably love to see Kelce on the field with him when that happens. Kelce actually has a lot to think about this offseason. Not only does he have to consider his football future, but he also has to start planning for the rest of his life. He's currently planning a wedding with his fiancée, Taylor Swift, and the two are expected to tie the knot in June, according to Page Six. If Kelce does return, the Chiefs start their offseason workouts in April, so he'd definitely be staying busy until the wedding rolls around. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The week has been difficult for the Golden State Warriors, whose season became drastically altered with Jimmy Butler's torn ACL.  In the first game after losing Butler, the Warriors lost in a blowout, 145-127, to the Toronto Raptors. Toronto threw multiple defenders at Stephen Curry, forcing other players to beat them. It has been a frustrating week for coach Steve Kerr and company.With no threat of a second reliable scoring option in Butler, the Warriors are now a far easier team against which to game plan. It puts whatever slim chance the Warriors previously had at making a deep postseason run in jeopardy, unless they find the right trade before Feb. 5.While Golden State navigates waters without Butler, next season could represent even more uncharted territory. Kerr is in the final year of his contract, and according to The Ringer's Logan Murdock, several assistant coaches on Kerr's staff are \"operating under the premise that he will not return next season.\"Kerr said in September that he wants to see where things are at the end of the season before talking about a new contract.\n\"I love my job,\" Kerr said. \"I love what I'm doing every day. I can't wait to get to the building. Hopefully I'm here for another few years. But I think it makes sense for the organization and for me to see where this thing is at the end of the year -- where they are and where I am. Hopefully that means we run it back, we keep going with this group, that'd be awesome. But I like the fact we can do it how we want it.\"Kerr also said he was \"very comfortable\" entering this season on an expiring deal, as he, general manager Mike Dunleavy and owner Joe Lacob are all aligned.\"We talked about this -- there's no reason for discussion or concern, \" Kerr said. \"This is kind of a point in our relationship where let's just see how it is at the end of the year.\"\nThis doesn't sound like a situation where Kerr is itching to leave. This all might come down to what path the Warriors take in the wake of Butler's injury. If the Warriors go the nuclear route and decide it's time for a rebuild, then perhaps Kerr doesn't want to be the coach for that era.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. Ski & Snowboard has announced the names of the 97 individuals who have made the Winter Olympics team that will be competing in Italy next month. The list includes former Olympic gold medalists Mikaela Shiffrin, Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn, who is back after retiring several years ago.Shiffrin, a two-time Olympic champion and three-time Olympic medalist, is the most decorated alpine skier in history with 107 victories. Vonn retired in 2019, but has worked towards a comeback in the sport after successful knee surgery that helped ease the pain that forced her to stop her career. In December, the 41-year-old became the oldest downhill skiing World Cup winner, her 83rd World Cup win and her first victory since 2018.Another household name making a return is Kim, a snowboarder who gained popularity for her success at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. At 17, she was the youngest woman to land two 1080-degree spins in a row at the Games and was the youngest woman to win gold in the halfpipe.The Milano Cortina Games, spread across Northern Italy, will run from Feb. 6-22.Snowboarder Jamie Anderson, who was looking to make a comeback of her own after having two children in the last two years, did not make the team. Anderson said she was motivated by seeing others have families and continue their sports careers and sees it as a win that she had the opportunity to compete for a spot. Injuries also impacted her season. \"In many ways, making this team is even harder than the Olympics themselves,\" said snowboard program director Rick Bower. \"The depth of our field is incredible, and selection truly came down to the wire.\"On the men's side of alpine skiing, Olympic silver medalist Ryan Cochran-Siegle will be competing. Olympic champion and three-time Olympic medalist in cross country Jessie Diggins made the team for what will be her fourth and final Games. Red Gerard and five-time Olympian Nick Baumgartner are competing on the snowboard team.\"The athletes we are sending to the Games represent a large portion of Team USA and I am confident about the impact they will make in Italy,\" U.S. Ski & Snowboard president and CEO Sophie Goldschmidt said. \"More than the results, our athletes are also bringing some of the most captivating story lines to Milano Cortina, and we are so excited to see the impact they will have while representing their country in February.\"Here's a full breakdown of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard team by event.2026 U.S. Olympic Alpine Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenMary Bocock* Keely Cashman (2022)Katie Hensien (2022)AJ Hurt (2022)Breezy Johnson (2022)Paula Moltzan (2022)Nina O'Brien (2022)Mikaela Shiffrin (2014, 2018, 2022)Lindsey Vonn (2002, 2006, 2010, 2018)Jacqueline Wiles (2014, 2018, 2022)Isabella Wright (2022)MenBryce Bennett (2022)Ryan Cochran-Siegle (2018, 2022)Sam Morse* Kyle Negomir* River Radamus (2022)Ryder Sarchett* 2026 U.S. Olympic Cross Country Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenRosie Brennan (2018, 2022)Jessie Diggins (2014, 2018, 2022)Lauren Jortberg* Julia Kern (2022)Kendall Kramer* Novie McCabe (2022)Samantha \"Sammy\" Smith* Hailey Swirbul (2022)MenJohn Steel Hagenbuch*Zak Ketterson* Zanden McMullen* Ben Ogden (2022)James \"JC\" Schoonmaker (2022)Gus Schumacher (2022)Hunter Wonders* Jack Young*2026 U.S. Olympic Freeski Team(Past Olympic teams)HalfpipeWomenKate Gray* Svea Irving* Riley Jacobs* Abby Winterberger* MenAlex Ferreira (2018, 2022)Nick Goepper (2014, 2018, 2022)Hunter Hess* Birk Irving (2022)Slopestyle & Big AirWomenMarin Hamill (2022)Rell Harwood*Grace Henderson*Avery Krumme* Men\nMac Forehand (2022)Alex Hall (2018, 2022)Troy Podmilsak*Konnor Ralph*2026 U.S. Olympic Freestyle Ski Team, Moguls & Aerials(Past Olympic teams)AerialsWomenKyra Dossa* Kaila Kuhn (2022)Tasia Tanner* Winter Vinecki (2022)MenConnor Curran* Quinn Dehlinger* Derek Krueger*Chris Lillis (2022)MogulsWomenOlivia Giaccio (2022)Tess Johnson (2018)Jaelin Kauf (2018, 2022)Elizabeth \"Liz\" Lemley*MenCharlie Mickel* Nick Page (2022)Dylan Walczyk (2022)Landon Wendler* 2026 U.S. Olympic Nordic Combined Team(Past Olympic teams)MenBen Loomis (2018, 2022)Niklas Malacinski* 2026 U.S. Olympic Ski Jumping Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenAnnika Belshaw* Josie Johnson* Paige Jones* MenKevin Bickner (2018, 2022)Jason Colby* Tate Frantz*2026 U.S. Olympic Snowboard Team (Past Olympic teams)HalfpipeWomenBea Kim* Chloe Kim (2018, 2022)Maddie Mastro (2018, 2022)Maddy Schaffrick*MenAlessandro Barbieri* Chase Blackwell* Chase Josey (2018, 2022)Jake Pates (2018)Parallel Giant SlalomWomenIris Pflum*MenCody Winters (2022)SlopestyleWomenLily Dhawornvej* Hahna Norman* Jess Perlmutter* MenJake Canter* Sean FitzSimons (2022)Red Gerard (2018, 2022)Ollie Martin* Snowboard CrossWomenStacy Gaskill (2022)Hanna Percy* Brianna Schnorrbusch*Faye Thelen (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022)Men\nNick Baumgartner (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022)Nathan Pare* Jake Vedder (2022)Cody Winters (2022)*Denotes first-time Olympian \n            ",

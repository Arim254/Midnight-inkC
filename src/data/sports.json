The over has cleared in four of the last five Dodgers games, including three consecutive matchups. Meanwhile, the over has cashed in five of the last 10 outings for Philadelphia. In Game 1, Los Angeles beat Philly 5-3, as they combined for eight total runs. The Dodgers are expected to start right-hander Blake Snell (5-4, 2.35 ERA), while the Phillies will counter with Jesus Luzardo (15-7, 3.92 ERA). SportsLine's model has these teams combining for 9.5 total runs, with the over cashing in 69% of simulations. </p><h2>Chiefs vs. Jaguars (+3.5) (-118)</h2><p>The Chiefs have won two straight games and enter this contest 2-2. The Jags have also won two consecutive games, as they are 3-1. Thus far in 2025, Jacksonville is 2-0 ATS as the home team and 3-1 ATS in all games. A big reason for this success is that they are leading the league with a +9 turnover ratio. That defense has snagged nine interceptions and caused four fumbles. SportsLine's model projects that Jacksonville will cover the spread in 52% of simulations. </p><h2>Cubs vs. Brewers moneyline (-134)</h2><p>Milwaukee finished with an NL-best 97-65 record and cruised to a 9-3 win over the Cubs on Saturday. The Brewers went 42-21 as the home favorite and 61-36 after a win this campaign. On the flip side, Chicago has gone 21-26 as the underdog and 42-39 as the away team this season.

Chourio had to leave Game 1 Saturday due to a right hamstring injury, suffered in the second inning when Chourio legged out an infield hit, his third of the contest.</p><p>On Sunday, Brewers manager Murphy said preliminary testing on the hamstring was inconclusive and the team would further evaluate the situation before determining if Chourio could play in Game 2. Clearly they liked what they found.</p><p>\"I can't give you a definitive, but I know that we're going to test some things today. He's going to be out there today,\" Murphy said Sunday. \"I don't know that he'll do much, but the MRI came back and it's inconclusive and it's not a serious hamstring strain, but it's not necessarily something that won't limit him.</p><p>\"We're going to kind of see how he feels. He's going to go through some testing, and if he feels anything, we're going to shut it down.\"</p>\n<p>The concern had been a re-aggravation of an injury from the recent past. Chourio missed nearly all of August with a strained right hamstring, going on the IL Aug. 1 and coming off it on Aug. 30. </p><p>In the regular season, Chourio hit .270/.308/.463 (112 OPS+) with 35 doubles, four triples, 21 home runs, 78 RBI, 88 runs and 21 steals in the regular season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3158249/isaac-collins/\">Isaac Collins</a> replaced Chourio in left field on Saturday and he's plenty capable if the need arises. He had a 118 OPS+ and 2.1 WAR in the regular season. Having a player like Collins available to replace an injured Chourio is a testament to the Brewers' depth. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>On June 11, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> were all alone in first place with a perfect 9-0 record. All signs pointed to another trip to the Finals and perhaps back-to-back titles. Less than four months later, on Sept. 25, general manager Jonathan Kolb sat in front of the media and attempted to explain why the team had been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs and moved on from coach Sandy Brondello. </p><p>\"Ultimately, we determined that evolution and innovation is what is needed at this time,\" Kolb said. \"These decisions, they're never easy, nor should they be, but often, these decisions mark the fork-in-the-road moments for organizations, and you can stand still or you can embrace change and move forward. In my commitment to keep pushing the New York Liberty to new heights, we believe that embracing this change will bring a freshness and an energy to our group.\"</p><p>Injuries were the primary cause of the Liberty's downfall. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678052/jonquel-jones/\">Jonquel Jones</a> reaggravated an ankle sprain during a loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> on June 19 and didn't play for a month. Just days after she made her return, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678022/breanna-stewart/\">Breanna Stewart</a> suffered a right knee bone bruise on July 26 that sidelined her for just under a month. Add in minor injuries for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678007/sabrina-ionescu/\">Sabrina Ionescu</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677878/natasha-cloud/\">Natasha Cloud</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677821/kennedy-burke/\">Kennedy Burke</a>, as well as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29334556/leonie-fiebich/\">Leonie Fiebich's</a> weeks-long absence during EuroBasket, and the Liberty rarely had their best players together. </p><p>Their primary starting lineup only played together 12 times, and Stewart, Ionescu and Jones only started and ended 13 games together -- the Liberty won all 13. </p>\n<p>While they were healthy entering the playoffs, and buoyed by the arrival of former Finals MVP <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063689/emma-meesseman/\">Emma Meesseman</a>, injuries struck again immediately. Stewart sprained the MCL in her left knee in overtime of Game 1 of their first-round series against the Mercury. While they hung on to win that game, they were blown out at home in Game 2, and early in the winner-take-all Game 3, Fiebich fractured a rib. They would go on to lose Game 3 by six after managing just 14 points in the fourth quarter, all of which were scored by Stewart. </p><p>The Liberty's frustrating season was not only about poor health, however. Too often they lacked focus and a cutting edge, their offense fell apart against physical defenses and rebounding, which had been a key strength in recent seasons, turned into a major weakness. </p><p>No team had as much individual talent as the Liberty this season, but the their quest for a repeat, which started out with so much promise, ended in disaster. Now, instead of planning another parade, Kolb and company will enter one of the most consequential offseasons in franchise history hoping to fix what went wrong. </p>\n<h2>Season at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Record: </strong>27-17 (No. 5 seed)</li><li><strong>Offensive rating: </strong>105.8 (5th)</li><li><strong>Defensive rating: </strong>100.6 (6th)</li><li><strong>Net rating: </strong>plus-5.2 (3rd)</li></ul><h2>Biggest strength</h2><p><strong>Offensive skill</strong></p><p>The Liberty's offense was not as dominant as it has been in recent years, in large part due to injuries, and it got bogged down in the playoffs against a Mercury team with overwhelming athleticism and physicality. None of that takes away from the fact that the Liberty were an incredibly skilled offensive team. They led the league in true shooting percentage (57.4%) and assist rate (73.7%), and were second in 3-point percentage (35.5%). </p><h2>Biggest weakness</h2><p><strong>Rebounding</strong></p><p>The Liberty were an elite rebounding team during the first two years of this run. They were second in rebounding rate in 2023 (52.9%) and first in rebounding rate in 2024 (52.5%). This season, though, they got crushed on the glass. Their rebounding rate dropped to 48.5%, which ranked 10th out of 13 teams. In their season-ending Game 3 loss to the Mercury, they held Phoenix to 36.6% shooting, but lost in part because they gave up 11 second chance points. </p><h2>Key free agents</h2><ul><li>Kennedy Burke (unrestricted)</li><li>Natasha Cloud (unrestricted)</li><li>Sabrina Ionescu (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677974/isabelle-harrison/\">Isabelle Harrison</a> (unrestricted)</li><li>Marine Johannès (reserved)</li><li>Jonquel Jones (unrestricted)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677977/betnijah-laney-hamilton/\">Betnijah Laney-Hamilton</a> (suspended -- contract expired)</li><li>Emma Meesseman (unrestricted)</li><li>Breanna Stewart (unrestricted)</li></ul><p>It remains unclear when free agency will happen this winter due to the contentious labor battle between the WNBPA and the league, which shows no signs of being resolved. But whenever it does begin, there will be more free agents than ever. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29105418/kalani-brown/\">Kalani Brown</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678088/lexie-brown/\">Lexie Brown</a> are the only players not on rookie scale contracts who are under contract for 2026. Every other veteran set up their deals to hit free agency this winter with an eye on a major pay raise whenever the new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. </p>\n<p>The Liberty have relied heavily on veterans in recent years, so even by this offseason's standards, they have a lot of work to do. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850667/nyara-sabally/\">Nyara Sabally</a> and Fiebich are the only players under contract for 2026, while four of the five members of the team's primary starting lineup this season -- Cloud, Ionescu, Jones and Stewart -- are unrestricted free agents. So, too, is key midseason acquisition Emma Meesseman. </p><p>Ionescu, Jones and Stewart have all expressed a desire to return, and Kolb said he has the \"utmost confidence that they want to be back.\" Re-signing the Big Three will be the primary order of business for the Liberty. Even if this season didn't go to plan, they are all comfortably top-10 players in the league and have won a title together. As long as they are in town, the Liberty will be one of the best teams. </p><p>The bigger questions for the Liberty will be about how they want to build out the roster around that trio. </p>\n<p>\"The scouting report on us is probably to be incredibly physical with us,\" Kolb said during his exit interview. \"It's probably to push us out on the perimeter, and it's probably to be really, really physical. And I feel like our spacing has been a point of it's been an issue for us. I think that we tend to stagnate as the clock winds down on the pressure mounts and we go east–west a tremendous amount. Some of that could be personnel-based. We have to really look at that. </p><p>\"But in terms of being innovative, I think that our spacing principles are things that we want to really lean into. We took huge steps back defensively this year as a collective, especially on the glass, we plummeted. We have to find out why: is that personnel-based or not? So I think we want to get back to being who we have been, but also solving the problems that we still found success through.\"</p><p>It will be particularly interesting to see what the Liberty do with Cloud and Meesseman. They gave up two first-round picks to acquire Cloud, but Kolb didn't sound sold on the long-term fit with her and Ionescu in the backcourt. Meesseman was projected to be the piece that put them over the top this season, but she had a tough series against the Mercury and went scoreless in Game 3. </p>\n<p>Until the new CBA is in place and we know the rules for free agency, as well as key numbers such as the 2026 salary cap and the new maximum, minimum and rookie salaries, it's impossible to make any specific predictions about the Liberty's plans. Plus, they have another important matter to settle before free agency. </p><h2>Who should be the Liberty's new coach?</h2><p>Days after the Liberty's season came to an end, the team decided to part ways with Brondello, who led the team to its first title less than a year earlier. During Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023. </p><p>Despite all of Brondello's success, Kolb and the Liberty's brain trust felt it was necessary to go in a different direction to get the most out of their championship window. </p>\n<p>\"I don't feel this is a place we need to sell. I think this is a place that is a privilege to work at, and it's a privilege to have a fan base such as ours that is so impassioned that they're the soul of what we do. And if that resonates with a candidate, we'll be excited to learn more about them,\" Kolb said. \"I don't think we want to limit our scope on a candidate. I think that we want to have a really diverse pool of candidates to speak with. I also think these are opportunities for organizations to learn about ourselves from candidates, so we're excited about the opportunity.\"</p><p>Kolb said the Liberty would not rush through the hiring process, and added that the organization needed to \"nail\" their decision on a new coach. The Liberty will have no shortage of candidates, but in some ways that may make finding the right one even more challenging. </p><p>Current assistant coach Sonia Raman will likely get a look, as should top assistants from around the league such as Kristi Toliver, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1104986/rebekkah-brunson/\">Rebekkah Brunson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1671834/briann-january/\">Briann January</a>. But expect the Liberty to also look outside of the WNBA. Indiana Pacers assistant Jenny Boucek, Charlotte Hornets advisor Will Weaver and college coaches such as Notre Dame's Niele Ivey and Duke's Kara Lawson could also be in the mix. </p>\n<h2>Draft outlook</h2><ul><li>No. 41 overall</li></ul><p>The Liberty traded their 2026 first-round pick to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CT/connecticut-sun/\">Connecticut Sun</a> (who later shipped it to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/WAS/washington-mystics/\">Washington Mystics</a>) in the Cloud deal and sent their 2026 second-round pick to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/\">Chicago Sky</a> in exchange for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1669400/rebekah-gardner/\">Rebekah Gardner</a>. As a result, their only selection in the 2026 draft is their third-round pick, which comes in at No. 41 overall. </p><p>Third-round picks rarely even make rosters, let alone make impact in the league, so this year's draft will largely be irrelevant for the Liberty. </p><p>Here, it is worth noting that the Liberty do have some young talent in the pipeline, however. They own the draft rights to 20-year-old German forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29714661/annika-soltau/\">Annika Soltau</a> and 23-year-old Spanish forward Raquel Carrera. It's unclear if either will ever play in the WNBA, but they do offer the Liberty some options in terms of prospects. </p>\n            </div>",

After losing their first two games of the season to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>, the Chiefs (2-2) have won consecutive games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a>. With a win on Monday, Kansas City would create a three-way tie for first place in the AFC West with the Chargers and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> (both 3-2).</p><p>Like the Chiefs, the Jaguars also are on a two-game winning streak and also can move into a tie atop their division. After starting the season 1-1, Jacksonville has knocked off the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> in back-to-back weeks. If the Jaguars beat Kansas City on Monday, they would join the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> (both 4-1) as the teams with the best record in the AFC.</p><p>The Chiefs are 3.5-point favorites over Jacksonville. </p><p>Last week, for the first time this season, Kansas City looked like Kansas City of old. Chiefs quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> threw for 270 yards and four touchdowns in a 37-20 victory over Baltimore. Speedy wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26730787/xavier-worthy/\">Xavier Worthy</a>, who suffered a shoulder injury on the first drive of the first game of the season, saw his first significant action of the year, catching five passes for 83 yards and helping spark an offense that had averaged just 20.0 points a game over the first three weeks. Kansas City set season highs in points, total yards (382) and first downs (24).</p><p>However, Worthy is dealing with an ankle injury to go with his shoulder ailment. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/chiefs-xavier-worthy-expected-to-play-monday/\" target=\"_blank\">While he was downgraded to questionable for Monday's game, he is still expected to play</a></span>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Jaguars have been one of the biggest surprises in the league through four weeks. Jacksonville has been led this season by its playmaking defense. The Jaguars have forced 13 turnovers this season, which is the most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> through four weeks since the 2018 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>. Jacksonville has at least three takeaways in each of its four games this season. On Monday, the Jaguars will face a Chiefs offense that has committed only one turnover, which is tied for the fewest in the league. </p><p>The Jacksonville offense features one of the best running attacks in the NFL. The Jaguars average 144.0 rushing yards per game, which ranks fourth in the league.</p><p>While the Chiefs-Jaguars Monday Night Football game is the marquee attraction on the sporting landscape on the day, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes the MLB playoffs.</p><p>Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Oct. 6. <em>All times Eastern.</em></p><h2>NFL best bets, where to watch</h2><h3>Chiefs at Jaguars</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 8:15 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Jacksonville, Fla. | <strong>TV:</strong> ABC | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/game-forecast/NFL_20251006_KC@JAC/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a> -- Model: </strong>Jaguars +165 | <strong>Expert:</strong> Jaguars +3.5 -112 (R.J. White)</p><p>Kansas City has dominated the recent head-to-head series against Jacksonville. The Chiefs have won eight consecutive matchups against the Jaguars including the playoffs, and haven't lost to Jacksonville since 2009. Mahomes is 5-0 against the Jaguars, which is tied for his best record against any team, while completing 70.1% of his passes for 304.4 yards a game. He is the only quarterback in NFL history since 1950 to be 5-0 or better with a 70.0-plus completion rate and 300.0 passing yards per game against one team. But while Mahomes seemed to get back on track last week against the Ravens, White notes Baltimore was missing seven defensive starters by the end of the game. \"The Jags may be without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123606/travon-walker/\">Travon Walker</a> but are much healthier [than the Ravens] overall on defense, and the unit has played particularly well at home while ranking second overall in EPA per play on the year,\" White says.

In Game 1 on Saturday, the Dodgers got a go-ahead three-run home run from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2119659/teoscar-hernandez/\">Teoscar Hernandez</a> in the seventh inning en route to a 5-3 victory.

The SportsLine Projection Model gives the Phillies a 55% chance to win and gives an \"A\" grade to Philadelphia money line (+110).

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>When <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/400553/lebron-james/\">LeBron James</a> uttered the words \"I'm going to take my talents to South Beach and join the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIA/miami-heat/\">Miami Heat</a>\" on July 8, 2010, it sent shockwaves around the sports world. The television program, marketed as \"The Decision,\" became a massive inflection point in James' career, as he drew significant ire for leaving the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CLE/cleveland-cavaliers/\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> to create a Big 3 alongside Dwyane Wade and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/400537/chris-bosh/\">Chris Bosh</a> in Miami. James' \"Decision\" is without a doubt one of the biggest moments in sports history in at least the last 25 years, and on Oct. 7, he'll apparently be making another decision.</p><p>James shared a nine-second video on social media Monday that showed him walking up to an empty seat to sit across from an unidentified person already seated. The whole aesthetic of the video is giving 2010 \"The Decision\" vibes, right down to the fact that he's wearing a very similar shirt to the one he wore when he made the announcement that he was leaving the Cavaliers. The four-time champion posted the video with the caption, \"The decision of all decisions. October 7th. 12pm EST.  #TheSecondDecision.\"</p>\n<p>Naturally, everyone's thinking about the possibility of the all-time leading scorer in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> history announcing his retirement. It certainly has all the dramatic build up that one would expect from James, but perhaps it's something else entirely. Ahead of the anticipated news, let's look at three things James could possibly be announcing on Oct. 7. </p><h2>Imminent retirement</h2><p>The news that everyone is waiting for. James has kept it pretty close to the vest on when he plans to retire, and while he's probably asked about it every day, the face of the NBA hasn't given any significant insight on the matter. He<em> did</em> say at media day that he <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-not-planning-on-delaying-retirement-for-youngest-son-bryce-to-reach-nba-i-got-my-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\">isn't waiting on his youngest son, Bryce James, to join the league</a></span>, which unsurprisingly puts his retirement within the window of the next four years. He's also made cheeky comments about possibly <a href=\"https://x.com/SpectrumSN/status/1972755185819603333\" target=\"_blank\">not being at media day next season</a>, hinting this could really be the last dance. </p>\n<p>Announcing his retirement with something marketed as \"The Second Decision\" would be a full circle moment for James, but announcing it on social media feels like it doesn't match the gravity of the news. It's certainly marketed as something that could be a massive announcement, but it lacks some of the pomp and circumstance that has come with James' massive basketball decisions in the past. We got \"The Decision\" in 2010, and when James decided to head back to Cleveland in 2014, the announcement came in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers\" target=\"_blank\">stylized Sports Illustrated</a> cover with the words \"I'm coming home\" splashed across the page. He also wrote an open letter on why he wanted to rejoin the Cavaliers after winning two titles in Miami. James' decision to join the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Lakers</a> in 2018 wasn't as flashy, but it was a call back to when Michael Jordan announced his return to the NBA in the form of a <a href=\"https://x.com/KlutchSports/status/1013574315411849216\" target=\"_blank\">press release from his agency</a>.</p><p>There's a small chance James could be using tomorrow's announcement to tell the entire world that the 2025-26 season will be his last, but it just doesn't feel like<em> this</em> is the way that news would be delivered. Having it happen in the middle of the day with no big buildup, no television special or at the very least a podcast episode feels too anticlimactic.</p><h2>A clever (or not so clever) advertisement</h2><p>OK so let's assess<em> why</em> the news would be dropping on Oct. 7. Tuesday marks the two-week mark before the start of the regular season. It's also Amazon Prime Day, tied to a company which James has done advertisements for in the past, and -- perhaps most importantly -- it's National Taco Day. Let's break down why this could be an ad for each event.</p>\n<p><strong>NBA advertisement:</strong> James is about to embark on a record-breaking 23rd season in the league, a feat we may not see again. It's the league's 80th year of existence, a significant milestone that should certainly necessitate some sort of celebration of important touchstones throughout the NBA's history. So maybe this is one big advertisement for the NBA to drum up attention for the 80th season. Who better to do that than James, who has been at the center of some of the league's biggest and most memorable moments?</p><p><strong>Amazon:</strong> On June 14, James <a href=\"https://x.com/KingJames/status/1933888869973331968\" target=\"_blank\">posted an ad</a> on social media that played on the fact that he could be retiring soon. The teaser commercial is James fielding questions at a press conference, with someone asking, \"are the retirement rumors true? If so, what's next?\" As James prepares to answer the question, the video cuts to black. The caption attached is, \"I've been asking myself the same question…\" The full-length version of that ad was actually a promotion for Amazon Prime Day, and coincidentally Prime Day is happening again on Oct. 7 when James is set to make an announcement. This could just be the latest installment in a series of ads with the company.</p><p><strong>Taco Tuesday:</strong> You might laugh, but James' affinity for tacos is well known. He's made multiple social media posts in the past with him yelling \"Taco Tuesday\" while proving that he in fact does eat tacos on Tuesdays, and even tried to trademark the phrase \"Taco Tuesday\" six years ago. He was denied the chance to trademark the saying, but perhaps he's announcing some sort of taco advertisement or partnership on National Taco Day. This is certainly a stretch, but no stone will be left unturned in trying to decipher James' vague social media post.</p>\n<h2>A new partnership</h2><p>It would be a shame if all this marketing and the specific call back to the original \"Decision\" was wasted on the announcement of a new partnership. Imagine James saying, \"I'm going to take my talents to [insert sports betting/beverage/food company here].\" What a letdown. In reality, unfortunately, that could very well be what we get tomorrow. If that's the case, then well done to whoever came up with this idea, because you've forced me, hundreds of other sports writers and millions of fans to rack our brains about what this announcement could be.</p><p>Many of James' recent ads and partnerships have used his future retirement as the focal point, so this is probably no different. In reality the news will be about what new car brand James is partnering with, or promoting Amazon, so there will likely be some people letdown by the announcement. What's funny is given the number of times his retirement announcement has been teased through advertisements, whenever James<em> does</em> announce he's done, there will probably be a contingent of people who won't believe he's actually doing it unless there's some big media rollout attached with it. </p>\n            </div>",

This wasn't your run-of-the-mill one-off upset, either. This was the biggest victory of the post-Tom Brady era for the Patriots, and validation that this new regime, led by Maye and first-year head coach Mike Vrabel, has the arrow pointing up. And Sunday's statement win could prove to be the tip of the iceberg. </p><p>New England exits Week 5 at 3-2 on the season, and the road ahead sets the franchise up to go on a significant run. The Patriots possess the easiest remaining strength of schedule in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, with their opponents possessing a combined win percentage of .305. The next easiest schedule (belonging to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>) has an opponents combined win percentage of .411. </p><p>Specifically, the next month is a window where the winning should continue, starting in Week 6, where they travel to New Orleans to face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a> as a 3.5-point favorite. After that, they face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> on the road before back-to-back home games against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Atlanta Falcons</a>. Those opponents currently have a combined record of 5-14 through Week 5. </p><h2>Patriots remaining 2025 schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Week (Date)</th><th>Opponent</th></tr><tr><td><p>Week 6 (Oct. 12)</p></td><td><p>at New Orleans Saints</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 7 (Oct. 19)</p></td><td><p>at Tennessee Titans</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 8 (Oct. 26)</p></td><td><p>vs. Cleveland Browns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 9 (Nov. 2)</p></td><td><p>vs. Atlanta Falcons</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 10 (Nov. 9)</p></td><td><p>at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 11 (Nov. 13)</p></td><td><p>vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 12 (Nov. 23)</p></td><td><p>at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 13 (Dec. 1)</p></td><td><p>vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 14 </p></td><td><p>BYE WEEK</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 15 (Dec. 14)</p></td><td><p>vs. Buffalo Bills</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 16 (Dec. 21)</p></td><td><p>at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 17 (Dec. 28)</p></td><td><p>at New York Jets</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Week 18 (TBD)</p></td><td><p>vs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>New England will likely be favored in every game over the next month, meaning it could be looking at a 7-2 record entering Week 10. That's a remarkable development considering that it would nearly double the Patriots' win total from each of the previous two seasons (New England went 4-13 in both 2023 and 2024). And that's not accounting for matchups later in the season against more sub-.500 teams, including two against the currently winless New York Jets. </p>\n<p>At <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, New England is -150 to record 10 or more wins and -210 to reach the playoffs, so the odds are telling us that this trajectory is expected to slow down. Meanwhile, if the Patriots meet those expectations, Mike Vrabel's current odds of +1000 to win Coach of the Year have tremendous value. Already, this hype train has steamed out of the station thanks to this high-profile win over Buffalo, but the schedule is set up in such a way that the Patriots could be the hottest team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> by Halloween. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Gibson has been part of a three-man running back committee in New England alongside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125832/rhamondre-stevenson/\">Rhamondre Stevenson</a> and rookie TreVeyeon Henderson, but now Stevenson and Henderson figure to both see their share of the Patriots' carries increase. </p><p>Gibson had 25 carries for 106 yards, one touchdown and two fumbles prior to tearing his ACL as the third back in that group, along with 12 kick returns for 342 yards and one touchdown. </p>\n<p>Stevenson has remained the starter and lead back with 38 carries for 139 yards and three touchdowns, along with 13 catches for 154 yards. Stevenson has also had issues with fumbling the ball like Gibson, putting the ball on the ground three times in five games. Henderson, meanwhile, has 32 carries for 121 yards and a touchdown, with another 90 yards on 15 receptions.</p><p>The Patriots haven't been quite willing to lean on the rookie as much as some fans have wanted given the ball security problems of the other backs, but he figures to see the field more with Gibson out. Henderson will also likely take the lead in the kick return game, as he's returned seven kicks this season for 154 yards alongside Gibson, with Stevenson having two returns this season for 40 yards. </p>\n<p>New England will likely be in the market to add another back to their 53-man roster with Gibson done for the year. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3133899/terrell-jennings/\">Terrell Jennings</a> is the lone running back currently on the Patriots' practice squad, but they could explore outside options as well. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

A new season of UEFA Women's Champions League will begin with a bang on Tuesday as two European heavyweights meet in England, while the U.S. men's national team are officially back in session ahead of Friday's friendly against Ecuador.

Their new-look squad seems designed for maximum impact in the Champions League, a competition that is slowly resembling the new world order in the women's game. Lyon were once the serial winners of this competition with a record eight titles, most of them coming during a stretch from 2016 to 2020 when they won five in a row, but the French side have not lifted the title since 2022 and seem determined to end that streak this season.</p><p>Tuesday's match at Arsenal, though, will mark the first meaningful test for Giraldez as he tries to find the best starting lineup from a stacked roster. Lyon are off to a perfect start in the Premiere Ligue this season but the manager has had the luxury of rotation because of his team's dominance in the domestic league, the Champions League always serving as a truer test of their mettle.</p><p>Even the uncertainties of Lyon's newness, though, may not quash their status as the favorites in this game. They will have the benefit of playing an Arsenal team that is still full of quality but has started the season in a rough patch – they have just two wins in five Women's Super League games this season and are winless in three, an untimely run of inconsistent form before what could be their stiffest test of the league phase. The Gunners are still one of England's better attacking teams with 12 goals to start the season but they have kept just one clean sheet so far, complicating matters as they enter the Champions League for the very first time as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The stakes will be high from the get-go as the UWCL adopts the Swiss system for the first time this season, the field of competitors expanding from 16 to 18 for this season. Only the top four league phase teams will qualify directly for the quarterfinals, meaning every point will count for teams like Arsenal and Lyon as they target the most straightforward path to the May 24 final at Oslo's Ullevaal Stadion.</p><h3>Kick off Matchday 1 Tomorrow!</h3><figure><p><img alt=\"04-361495-uclw-25-cbssportshq-slate-1920x1080.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/06/44cd7392-4c0b-4e52-a9d6-5cb56e5ca6db/resize/670x377/b587d4ce96a4abe73a6629da58c7f101/04-361495-uclw-25-cbssportshq-slate-1920x1080.jpg\" /></p></figure><h2>🔗  Midfield Link Play</h2><h3>🇺🇸 USMNT's World Cup prep kicks into high gear</h3><p>The U.S. men's national team have convened in Austin as they continue their preparations for the World Cup on home soil, now just eight months away. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnt-roster-mauricio-pochettino-names-usa-squad-with-big-names-missing-ahead-of-key-friendlies/\">called up many of the team's heavy-hitters</a> for this month's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, the latest high-caliber opponents as the USMNT continues their streak of almost exclusively facing teams in FIFA's top 30 in the year before next summer's tournament.</p><p>This month's roster is a reflection of Pochettino's self-imposed deadline to begin whittling down the roster after a year-long player pool expansion project, one that has benefitted several players who cracked the squad. There are 12 players on the October roster who were not involved in the Copa America in the summer of 2024, the last squad assembled by Pochettino's predecessor Gregg Berhalter before his dismissal days after their group stage exit, and most of those players were not regularly in Berhalter's rotation. Pochettino's reinvention of the squad, though, means several of those players are realistically in the mix for World Cup roster spots, making this month's games a crucial chance to prove their worth.</p>\n<p>Mainstays like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun in attack and Antonee Robinson and Chris Richards in defense will likely earn meaningful minutes over the course of this international break, but who lines up alongside them will be worth keeping an eye on. The goalkeeper race, which seems to be coalescing around Berhalter's No. 1 Matt Turner and Pochettino's Gold Cup starter Matt Freese, will be a point of intrigue this month but the midfield picture is just as up in the air. A mix of veterans and fresh faces will take part in what could be a fierce battle for playing time, the group led by regular Weston McKennie in his first camp since March and Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, whose stocks have risen since Pochettino took over a year ago. Tyler Adams' absence for personal reasons this month means there is the potential for further experimentation and reinvention in the center of the park, making these some of the most competitive races as the World Cup roster slowly begins to take shape.</p><h3>🔗  Top Stories</h3><p>🇺🇸🇦🇺 <strong>LaLiga and Barca in Miami: </strong><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/uefa-reluctantly-gives-green-light-for-barcelona-to-play-laliga-match-in-usa-serie-a-to-play-in-australia/\" target=\"_blank\">UEFA gave the green light for Barcelona to play a LaLiga match in the United States</a></span> in December, despite opposing the idea.

The Gunners may find a way to turn things around at some point this season but against a Lyon team with a point to prove, expect the visitors to take home all three points and start their European campaign on a high.</li></ul><p>For more picks, predictions, expert tips and the latest betting news, don't miss out on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com's</a> betting home page.</p><h3>📺 What We're Watching</h3><figure><p><img alt=\"ucl-channel-golazonewsltter-5.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/04/30/836ecb6f-9788-4aa2-806b-5c08783357b2/resize/670x377/11e18475474f1695fb473768b5d488d9/ucl-channel-golazonewsltter.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Paramount+\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h3>What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network</h3>\n<div><p>🥅 <strong>Scoreline </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.paramountpressexpress.com/cbs-sports/releases/?view=108489-cbs-sports-golazo-network-continues-building-robust-247-programming-lineup-with-new-daily-highlight-show-scoreline\" target=\"_blank\">Daily</a>): Scoreline is the newest place for fans to catch up on all the biggest news and results impacting global football, match highlights from the top soccer competitions and all the can't-miss goals from the day's action, starting Thursday and airing seven days a week.</p><p>📺 <strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a> is a free 24/7 channel exclusively dedicated to offering unparalleled coverage of all the top soccer competitions worldwide.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>As Week 5 in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> reaches its conclusion, there remains just one winless team: The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>. Opponents outscored the Jets by 45 points over five contests, and New York is the only team since at least 1940 to register zero takeaways through five games. </p><p>It's safe to say that the Aaron Glenn era in New York is not off to a great start, as he just became the first coach in Jets history to begin his tenure 0-5. This franchise has been through some rough times, but is it possible the Jets are now the worst team in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>? Was the hiring of Glenn a mistake?</p><p>On Monday, David Saleh, the brother of the Jets' last head coach, Robert Saleh, took a shot at the franchise and team owner Woody Johnson, implying that the Jets made a big mistake when they dismissed his brother nearly a year ago. </p><p>\"Last year the Jets were 2-3 playing for first place in their division when (Woody Johnson) declared that 'the best roster in franchise history needed a spark,'\" David wrote. \"Since then the Jets  defense has gone from first to worst donning a record of 3-14.\" </p>\n<p>David then followed up his statement with some ironic hashtags, such as #allgasnobrake, #VictoryMonday and #thespark. </p>\n<p>David Saleh is correct. When the Jets fired his brother, Johnson came out and said this would immediately lead to more wins because of how talented the Jets roster was. </p><p>\"This is one of the most-talented teams that has ever been assembled by the New York Jets,\" <a href=\"https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/woody-johnson-new-energy-for-jets-coaching-change\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson said</a> on Oct. 8 of last year. \"I wanted to give this team the most opportunity to win this this season. I feel that we had to go in a different direction and that's why I did that today. The change that we made today, that I made, I believe will bring new energy and positivity that will lead to more wins starting now.</p>\n<p>\"I've been doing this for 25 years now. This is probably the best team I've had. I just felt that the best way to go forward with a new direction and taking Jeff Ulbrich and making him the interim head coach, I thought that would get the most out of this team and give us the best chance to do what we all want to, which is going to the playoffs.\"</p><p>Since firing Saleh, the Jets are 3-14. </p><p>Saleh went 20-36 during his four seasons as the lead man in New York. He went 4-13 in his first season back in 2021, then put together two straight 7-10 campaigns in 2022 and 2023. As his brother mentioned above, Saleh went 2-3 in 2024 before being handed his walking papers. </p><p>The Jets offense was putrid during Saleh's tenure, as it averaged the fewest points per game in the NFL during his 56 games coached (17.3). However, Saleh's defense finished top four in yards allowed per game in both 2022 and 2023, and ranked No. 2 in the NFL when he was fired.</p>\n<p>Not many lamented the firing of Saleh, as the fan base hoped for brighter days ahead. However, things have only gotten worse. </p>\n            </div>",

Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense. Their commitment to the run and the ability to produce on the ground game could eat up the clock and keep Mahomes and company off the field. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Chiefs vs. Jaguars picks</h2><p>For Jaguars vs. Chiefs on Monday Night Football, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 45 combined points.

Other than the return home, not much thus far has gone the way of the Yankees, who dropped the first two games of this best-of-five series and thus find themselves on the cusp of elimination. </p><p>Such straits can of course prompt managers to make changes, to try a different mix of talents and deployments in order to keep the season alive. That may indeed be the case with Yankees skipper Aaron Boone. On Monday, Boone was asked about the possibility of lineup changes for Game 3, and he said the following: </p><blockquote><p>\"We'll see. We'll see. Yes, but it could be the exact same too. That's something I'll kind of work through here the rest of the day and try to have my decision by this evening where I'll send it out. Could be one or two, but it could very well be the same too.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>That's something of a non-answer, which is to say it's common managerial phrasing. When asked more specifically about how veteran right-hander and deadline addition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507333/shane-bieber/\">Shane Bieber</a>, Toronto's Game 3 starter, might prompt such changes, Boone said this: </p><blockquote><p>\"Well, yeah, Shane Bieber, that is the thought. We're going up against Shane Bieber. That's how I'm going to formulate the lineup. Shane's been a reverse this year, been kind of both throughout his career, more of a neutral guy. Then you also have some consideration to what they have in the bullpen, how you space things out a little bit. It starts with the opposing starter.\"</p></blockquote><p>The Yankees faced right-handed starters in Games 1 and 2, and Boone used the same starting lineup in each game: </p>\n<ol><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a>, CF</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a>, RF</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, LF</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/\">Ben Rice</a>, 1B</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1630093/giancarlo-stanton/\">Giancarlo Stanton</a>, DH</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm/\">Jazz Chisholm</a> Jr., 2B</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066810/ryan-mcmahon/\">Ryan McMahon</a>, 3B</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117930/anthony-volpe/\">Anthony Volpe</a>, SS</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615315/austin-wells/\">Austin Wells</a>, C</li></ol><p>The likely path to change would be slotting in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> at first base instead of the lefty-hitting Rice even though Bieber is, as noted, right-handed.

Over Bieber's entire career, he shows traditional platoon splits for a right-hander, which means left-handed batters like Rice have been more productive against him at the level of offensive output. Against right-handed pitching this season, Goldschmidt has an OPS of just .619, while Rice has a mark of .860. </p>\n<p>It's worth noting that run prevention has been a much bigger concern for New York in this series, as it permitted a total of 23 runs in the first two games.

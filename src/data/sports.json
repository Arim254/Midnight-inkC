    "body": "\n        The Thanksgiving NFL games are amongst the most watched on a yearly basis, and that should certainly be the case with the middle matchup of Thursday's slate. It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) will return for Kansas City, while Cowboys OL Tyler Guyton (ankle) is out.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Cowboys have won five straight home matchups against the Chiefs. Kansas City is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Chiefs vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points is 53.5, an increase from opening at 51.5.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

    "body": "\n        Having teams that annually play on Thanksgiving like the Lions and Cowboys, as well as teams that make rare appearances, gives you several options with NFL DFS picks and a daily Fantasy football strategy. You could roster those with proven success on the holiday, like Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb. Or, you could heed the NFL DFS advice of picking those looking to put on a show on, possibly, their only career Turkey Day appearances. Amongst first timers to the NFL Thanksgiving Day tradition are Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Ja'Marr Chase, who returns from suspension.Joe Burrow is another in the Thanksgiving NFL DFS player pool who is expected to make his debut on the holiday, in addition to suiting up for the first time since Week 2 due to a toe injury, though he will not have Tee Higgins (concussion). How should Burrow's return and Higgins' absence impact your NFL DFS strategy, and which undervalued players should you target? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Thanksgiving, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Thanksgiving NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Thanksgiving DayPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for Thanksgiving is rostering Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce at $5,000 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. The 10-time Pro Bowler is having a resurgent season as he's on pace for his first 1,000-yard season since 2022 and is averaging his most yards per catch since 2020. Kelce has at least 73 receiving yards and a touchdown in each of his last two games versus Dallas, and the Cowboys have struggled defending tight ends this year. Just seven teams allow more receptions per game to the position than Dallas, which has seen opposing tight ends average 7.3 catches for 72.7 yards, with one total touchdown, over the last three games. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bengals running back Chase Brown ($7,200 on FanDuel, $6,500 on DraftKings), who has increased his scrimmage yards in each of the last six games, with 130 yards last week. Brown has ranked 11th amongst running backs in Fantasy points over this stretch and has five straight games with at least 100 total yards. Brown averaged 74 scrimmage yards with one total touchdown in his two games versus Baltimore's No. 1 run defense last year, and the Ravens are just 20th versus the run this season. Burrow's expected return should only help Brown, as he should see fewer stacked boxes with a more threatening passing attack. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Thanksgiving Day NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thanksgiving.

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 13 features a 16-game slate, including a number of key divisional matchups. Among the biggest is when the Green Bay Packers battle the Detroit Lions in an NFC North matchup on Thanksgiving Day. That will pit two of the conference's best quarterbacks in Jordan Love of the Packers against Jared Goff of the Lions. In an important AFC South battle, the Houston Texans look to pull within one game of the division lead when they meet the Indianapolis Colts. The Lions are -2.5, while the Colts are favored by 4.5 points as C.J. Stroud (concussion) is hoping to be cleared to play after missing the last three games.A non-divisional matchup with heavy AFC playoff race implications will be played on Sunday afternoon when Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills take on Aaron Rodgers, who missed last week's game, and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Buffalo has won four of the past five meetings, with the Bills pulling out a 31-17 win in the last meeting on Jan. 15, 2024. Sunday's largest spreads are Vikings vs. Seahawks (-11.5), Rams (-10.5) vs. Panthers and Raiders vs. Chargers (-9.5).Before making any Week 13 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

    "body": "\n        The NFL Thanksgiving Day games are often as anticipated as the food and family time which accompany the holiday, and the 2025 Thanksgiving NFL slate is among the best ever. Lions vs. Packers (+3) kicks things off at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Cowboys vs. Chiefs (-3.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Ravens vs. Bengals (+7) the 8:20 p.m. ET nightcap. Joe Burrow (toe) has been cleared to return in that one, with Ja'Marr Chase also back from suspension, though receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) has been ruled out. One could make an NFL parlay using those spreads, or incorporate NFL picks on the total, with the money line, or by inserting NFL props. Baltimore enters in on a five-game winning, and it's won four straight versus Cincinnati, making the Ravens an attractive option with your Thanksgiving NFL parlay.As for those prop bets you could include, there is no shortage of stars to target, including Burrow, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Derrick Henry. Prescott has multiple touchdown passes in five straight Thanksgiving Day games, but Kansas City has given up just 11 passing scores across 11 games this year. He has an over/under of 1.5 passing TDs versus the Chiefs, with NFL prop odds of -138 for the Over and an intriguing plus-money payout of +108 for the Under.

Not only has Baltimore won four straight versus Cincy, but the Ravens sport a 4-1 ATS record over their last five meetings. This season, Baltimore's defense is back to being elite as it has kept six straight opponents under 20 points, including a pair of top-10 scoring offenses in the Rams and Bears. Even with Burrow's expected return, the Bengals offense isn't on that level, especially with Tee Higgins (concussion), expected to be out. Cincinnati's defense, meanwhile, is the worst in the NFL.The Bengals rank dead last in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense, while working second-to-last in run defense and third-down defense. A lack of taking the ball away plays a big part in those rankings as Cincy has forced only one turnover, total, over its last four games, while Baltimore has nine takeaways over its last four. With these discrepancies, Baltimore is projected to win by double-digits and cover in well over 50% of simulations. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Ravens to cover here:How to make Thanksgiving NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Thanksgiving NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Thanksgiving Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 11-1 payout?

McCarthy last week, holding the No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft to 12 of 19 passes for 87 yards and two interceptions. It's not just McCarthy, as the Green Bay defense has been frustrating teams throughout the season, ranking fifth in the league in scoring defense (18.4 points per game allowed) and fourth in yards allowed (278.7 per game). Green Bay defeated the Lions, 27-13, in Week 1 this season, and although that game was at Lambeau Field, Green Bay's defense plays well both at home and away. The Packers held Jahmyr Gibbs to just 19 rushing yards on nine carries in Week 1. The model projects the Packers to cover the spread in 53% of simulations. Back the Packers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Chiefs (-3.5) vs. Cowboys (-105)The Cowboys may be coined \"America's Team,\" but the Chiefs are making a claim for that unofficial title behind the trio of head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. The Chiefs have made the Super Bowl in four of the last six seasons, including winning three titles. Despite a slower start to the season, the Chiefs still have the majority of their championship core and are coming off a 23-20 overtime victory against a Colts team that had just two losses entering the contest. Dallas has the No. 31 scoring defense at 28.5 ppg allowed this season, and the model expects Reid, Mahomes and Kelce to exploit that on a national stage. The model projects the Chiefs to cover in 55% of simulations. Back the Chiefs at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Bengals (+7) vs. Ravens (-110)\"Burrow and Chase are back, baby. Perhaps the league's best pass combo return -- QB Joe Burrow from injury rehab, WR Ja'Marr Chase from a spitting-related suspension. Their Cincinnati team is likely cropped out of the playoff picture, but the pair's return and the chance to spoil Thanksgiving night for the Ravens provides motivation,\" SportsLine expert Mike Tierney said. \"While Baltimore is on a roll, its offense lacks the dynamism of past teams, in no small part because QB Lamar Jackson deals with assorted minor injuries. His rush stats last Sunday -- seven carries, 11 yards -- suggest he is hesitant to, as the announcers say, \"use his legs.\" The Bengals have a habit of heating up down the stretch. They can light the fire big-time here.\" Back the Bengals at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Thanksgiving NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Thanksgiving best bets.

From Ohio State vs. Michigan (+9.5) to Alabama vs. Auburn (+5.5) to Virginia vs. Virginia Tech (+9.5), many may place Week 14 college football bets with their hearts as much as their heads. Not only can you make picks on those conference matchups, but a number of non-conference contests could factor into your college football betting strategy. South Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson, per the latest Week 14 college football odds, in an SEC vs. ACC battle.Others of that ilk include Florida vs. Florida State (+1.5) and Kentucky vs. Louisville (-3). Meanwhile, no team has performed better in college football picks against the spread than Texas Tech, which is 10-1 versus the line. The Red Raiders are 23.5-point favorites over West Virginia as the former seeks a win to secure its first-ever trip to the Big 12 Championship Game.

The Gators have been much more competitive since firing Billy Napier as the team has as many ATS wins (two) in four games under interim Billy Gonzales as it had in seven games under Napier. Florida won last year's matchup -- by 20 points on the road -- and it hosting this year's contest gives it a massive advantage. The Seminoles have not won or covered in an away stadium since 2023 as they are 0-8 both straight-up and against the spread over that run. In addition to Florida covering, the model forecasts the Under to hit in over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Virginia Tech (+9.5, 52.5) covers on the road versus No. 17 Virginia at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. It's impossible to ignore the outright dominance of the Hokies over their in-state rival in this series, as Virginia Tech has won 19 of its last 20 games versus Virginia Tech. The last few matchups haven't even been close, as Virginia Tech won by 20 points at home last year and prevailed by 38 points the last time UVA hosted in 2023. This year, the Hokies have played much better under interim coach, Philip Montgomery, as they've both outright won and covered three times under him, compared to being winless both straight up and ATS under former coach Brent Fry. UVA has dropped two straight at home ATS as the model forecasts this as a one-score game. The model projects the Hokies to cover well over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 14The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 14, and it's identified several A-rated picks involving major games. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you jump on?

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule is arguably the most anticipated to date and not just because of the three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday contest. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) doubtful to suit up. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-3) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Top Week 13 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 13 NFL picks is that the Falcons (-2.5, 39.5) cover at the New York Jets in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6.5, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\nFuzzy Zoeller, a two-time major champion and one of golf's most gregarious characters whose career was tainted by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods, has died, according to a longtime colleague. He was 74.A cause of death was not immediately available. Brian Naugle, the tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston, said Zoeller's daughter called him Thursday with the news.\"The PGA Tour is saddened by the passing of Fuzzy Zoeller,\" said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan in a statement.\" Fuzzy was a true original whose talent and charisma left an indelible mark on the game of golf. Fuzzy combined competitive excellence with a sense of humor that endeared him to fans and fellow players alike. We celebrate his remarkable legacy and extend our deepest condolences to his family.\"Zoeller was the last player to win the Masters on his first attempt, emerging from a three-man playoff in 1979. He famously waved a white towel at Winged Foot during the 1984 U.S. Open when he thought Greg Norman had beaten him; however, Zoeller went on to defeat Norman in an 18-hole playoff the next day.It was an incident at the 1997 Masters that affected his legacy in retirement.With Woods on his way to a watershed moment in golf -- the most dominant victory in Augusta National history -- Zoeller was asked to contextualize the 21-year-old golfer's performance by CNN.\"That little boy is driving well, and he's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win. So, you know what you guys do when he gets in here? You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it, and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. [at the Champions Dinner] Got it?\" Zoeller said.Zoeller smiled and snapped his fingers. As he was walking away, he turned and added, \"Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.\"Those remarks haunted Zoeller. Though he later apologized, he said 11 years later in Golf Digest that he received death threats for his comments, calling the situation \"the worst thing I've gone through in my entire life.\"\"If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I'm here to tell you they got their way,\" Zoeller wrote. \"I've cried many times. I've apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren't a reflection of who I am. I have hundreds of friends, including people of color, who will attest to that.\"Still, I've come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.\"Zoeller won 10 times on the PGA Tour, adding two PGA Champions titles to his pair of major championships.He was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana. Zoeller said his father was known only as \"Fuzzy,\" and he was given the same name.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WWE's biggest superstars are calling for reinforcements. Survivor Series takes place in San Diego with two blockbuster WarGames matches. CM Punk, AJ Lee, Roman Reigns, Becky Lynch, and Brock Lesnar are among the main event stars taking part.The WarGames format returns to Survivor Series for the fourth consecutive year. This year, WWE's top stars put their differences aside to form unlikely alliances for the match beyond. The Vision replaced Seth Rollins with Logan Paul, then bolstered their ranks with Drew McIntyre and Lesnar. Punk, Cody Rhodes, and The Usos responded by bringing Reigns into the fold. On the women's side, Lee and Lynch were late additions, bringing the tally of former women's world champions in their match to eight.Survivor Series also hosts John Cena's final pay-per-view match. Cena, the new Intercontinental champion, finally became a Grand Slam champion by beating Dominik Mysterio for the one title that eluded him for two decades. Former champion Mysterio gets his rematch after a lengthy run with the title.With so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what  the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action  goes down in San Diego.\n2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictionsCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, and The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) vs. Brock Lesnar, Drew McIntyre, and The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul) (WarGames match): I fear WWE leans on its classic playbook: Lesnar comes, Lesnar smashes, Lesnar leaves. The company's booking philosophy suggests that Lesnar will be last to enter the fray. He's the biggest star among The Vision's team, and his matches are typically short. The Vision's success in elevating its members is up for debate, but they definitely benefit from a win more than their opponents do. Punk, Reigns and Rhodes are essentially bulletproof. The Vision and McIntyre, specifically, are overdue for a win. Pick: The Vision wins -- Shakiel Mahjouri (also Brent Brookhouse)Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: I see no reason for Cena to win this match. The win over Mysterio was more of a career achievement award, allowing Cena to win the one title he had never held and become a grand slam champion. But Cena doesn't need the belt heading into his final match, and Mysterio holding a win over Cena would be perfect for Mysterio's character. He would be so obnoxious about defeating Cena that it would be a staple talking point in his promos for at least a year. That alone is a good enough reason for Mysterio to get the victory. Sometimes the decision is as simple as what benefits the promotion moving forward. Pick: Mysterio wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)AJ Lee, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, IYO SKY, and Rhea Ripley vs. Becky Lynch, Lash Legend, Nia Jax, and The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) (WarGames match): If WWE wants to level out The Vision's victory in the main event, they can give the heroes a win in the women's WarGames match. No one on Lynch's team desperately needs a victory, so it's hard to picture them edging out the fan favorites. Lee's team also has more main event stars, meaning one or two of them can parlay a victory into a world title program on Raw or SmackDown. Pick: Team AJ wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella's sole purpose here is name recognition. She's a semi-retired, part-time act coming off a rough return against Becky Lynch. By contrast, Vaquer is a talented full-time act with potential to become a major star for the company. Beating a WWE Hall of Famer will be a great feather in Vaquer's cap. Pick: Vaquer wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

The length of Curry's absence depends on how well he responds to treatment. While he will miss some time, Curry is believed to have avoided a serious injury. He sustained the injury while taking a charge with 3:24 left and was seen walking gingerly into the locker room during the final minute of Golden State's eventual 104-100 loss. \"When I heard it was a quad, I was actually relieved,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said afterward. \"Better than an ankle or a knee.\"\nBased on the report, Curry will miss at least the Warriors' upcoming home games against the New Orleans Pelicans and the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder. Golden State then begins a four-game road trip against the Philadelphia 76ers that will take place eight days after Curry's injury. The Warriors are 10-10 and in eighth place in the Western Conference standings. Defense, or lack thereof, has been one of the Warriors' biggest issues as of late. \n\"A lot of our hustle is dictated upon our offense,\" Warriors guard Jimmy Butler said after Wednesday night's loss. \"When we're making shots, oh, man, we're celebrating, we're cheering, doing all those things. When we're not, when the game's not going our way, we put our head down and we mope and we don't box out, and we don't get back. We foul. We do all the bad things.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For many, Thanksgiving is a day spent eating, spending time with family and, of course, watching football. The NFL has three games scheduled for Turkey Day and will have popular musical acts during halftime of all three matchups.The Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys always play on Thanksgiving and this year is no different. To kick off the action on Thursday, the 7-4 Lions are hosting the 7-3-1 Green Bay Packers in a huge divisional matchup at Ford Field at 1 p.m. ET. (Do note the change on the time from the Lions' traditional 12:30 p.m. kickoff.)The defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs, who sit at 6-5 and are fighting to get back in the playoff race, head to AT&T Stadium to face the 5-5-1 Cowboys. The game will be broadcasted on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ at 4:30 p.m.\nTo end the night, we have a second divisional matchup at M&T Bank Stadium between the 6-5 Baltimore Ravens and 3-8 Cincinnati Bengals at 8:20 p.m. The Ravens struggled with quarterback Lamar Jackson sidelined, but have been climbing their way back up the standings in recent weeks. And the Bengals should get a boost since it was announced that quarterback Joe Burrow is expected to be available for the game. He has be out since Week 2 with a turf toe injury.\nHere's a look at who will be performing at each game.Jack White in DetroitDetroit-native Jack White was the halftime performer at Ford Field when the Packers visit the Lions and had special guest, another Detroit legend, Eminem join him on stage. The rapper was also one of the executive producers of the show. White began hit set with his song, \"That's How I'm Feeling,\" before he introduced Eminem, who performed his hit, \"Till I Collapse.\" White also sang his hit song, \"Seven Nation Army.\"\nWhite is a singer, songwriter and producer, who was a member of multiple bands, including The White Stripes. He plays multiple instruments and has hits like \"We're Going to Be Friends\" and \"Blue Orchid.\" His album \"No Name\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album in 2025. He's won multiple Grammys, including for Best Rock Performance for \"Lazaretto.\"\nEminem's longtime manager and president of Shady Records, Paul Rosenberg, and Jesse Collins Entertainment served as co-EPs. Eminem and Rosenberg will consult the team on their halftime production through 2027.Gospel musician CeCe Winans performed the national anthem before kickoff.\nPost Malone in DallasLifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will be taking the stage at Jerry World. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas.

    "body": "\n        In some ways, money drives college basketball's lineups now more than ever, no matter how often certain coaches try to downplay it. High-priced free agent signings will get every opportunity to earn a lion's share of the minutes.But if recruiting rankings go out the door when a player steps foot onto campus, big non-conference games have a way of illuminating if changes to the rotation need to be made, regardless of who is making what. Let's dive into five key rotation battles that have our attention and are already looming large.\n    \n                                        \n    Inside the numbers of Arkansas' 5-man platoonThe battle between an offense-first center in Malique Ewin and a defense-first option in Nick Pringle has been pretty one-sided throughout the first month.\nPringle is up in the 24-minute range, while Ewin has earned just over 14 minutes a night.The defensive metrics tell the whole story. Arkansas' rim defense has predictably been much better with Pringle on the floor. The 6-10, 230-pound bulldog isn't an Olympic high jumper, but he's an interior enforcer. Arkansas' defense has been fantastic with Pringle in the game, allowing a minuscule 86.9 points per 100 possessions, according to hoop-explorer. Arkansas' defensive rating spikes dramatically -- not a good thing -- when Pringle exits the game.Arkansas' defensive rating with Pringle on the floor: 86.9 in 259 possessionsArkansas' defensive rating with Pringle on the bench: 109.5 in 179 possessionsEwin's top-of-the-key dimes and slick drives can help this offense, but his defense was notoriously shaky at Florida State last year and he hasn't earned the trust of the staff yet. Also, Calipari's offense is notoriously guard-driven. This group is no different with Meleek Thomas and Darius Acuff Jr. leading the charge.\n\n        \n            \n                John Calipari, Arkansas preparing for physical 'battle' vs. Duke in CBS Thanksgiving Classic\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt this point, Arkansas has prioritized defense over offense at the 5 spot. Pringle's six-point, six-rebound stat line might not pop off the page, but Arkansas has a +40.5 net rating with him on the floor. That's why he's playing. Calipari's rotation decisions can leave much to be desired at times, but not in this instance. The data suggests that Pringle is the right center to have on the floor right now. He needs to play the best game of his young season against Duke's front-line trio of Cameron Boozer, Pat Ngongba and Maliq Brown. Grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    Duke's pivot at point guard has paid off Point guard play is the ultimate ceiling raiser in college basketball and was one of the biggest red flags on Duke's preseason profile. So far, it's not been much of a concern amid a 7-0 start.For all the preseason consternation around Cayden Boozer or Caleb Foster, the answer lately for Jon Scheyer has been: both.\nAfter not playing a second together in the season-opening win over Texas, getting Boozer and Foster on the floor together has slowly become a real part of Duke's favorite lineups, especially in closing time. Duke used Foster-Boozer lineups for over seven straight minutes to close out the Blue Devils' win over Kansas in the Champions Classic. Overall, Duke has a sparkling +44 net rating with Foster and Boozer on the floor together in 44 minutes, per CBB Analytics.\n        \n            \n                Duke vs. Arkansas prediction, pick, odds: Blue Devils, Razorbacks meet in CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe film backs it up. While he's not a traditional set-the-table point guard, Foster has settled in nicely into his role as a 3-and-D weapon. He is shooting over 45% from 3-point range on 22 attempts, and his point-of-attack defense has been outstanding. Boozer has been so steady, totaling a 4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio. \nThey're not driving the Duke bus, but Foster and Boozer have been dependable role players that Scheyer wants to get on the floor together. I have a feeling that duo could see plenty of minutes together on Thursday to help slow down Arkansas' duo of Acuff and Thomas. Grade: B+\n    \n                                        \n    Changing of the guard in Kentucky after slow startIt hasn't taken long for Kentucky to change this up. Freshman Malachi Moreno has jumped junior big man Brandon Garrison for the starting center spot. Kentucky's defense has been significantly better with Moreno (eight points per 100 possessions) in the early-going, and he's proven to be an advanced processor and an effective hub for Kentucky's backdoors-laden offense. Once Jayden Quaintance returns, I wouldn't be surprised if Kentucky tinkers with some Moreno-Quaintance lineups to get extra size and mobility on the floor together. Grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    Kansas State's lineups in flux after back-to-back LsKansas State's prized international addition, Andrej Kostic, has not been a big part of the rotation in back-to-back losses to Nebraska and Indiana. The 6-6 guard is unafraid offensively, but Jerome Tang has ditched trying to play Kostic and Abdi Bashir Jr. at the same time due to serious defensive hot spots. Kansas State's defense has an untenable 128 defensive rating with Kostic and Bashir on the floor together in 30 minutes.Tang benched both of them for 27 of 40 minutes in Tuesday's 86-69 loss to Indiana, but the Hoosiers still managed 1.13 points per possession against a Kansas State defense that has been a sieve in the early going.  Grade: D\n    \n                                        \n    Purdue's supporting cast rising to the occasionIt's pretty clear who Purdue's best option at the 2-spot is right now. CJ Cox was pushed by Gicarri Harris hard in the preseason, and he responded with two massive showings in Purdue's victories over Memphis and Texas Tech in The Bahamas. Cox poured in 18 points and drained four triples against Memphis. He added 10 points and some blanketing defense on Christian Anderson in Purdue's 30-point romp over Texas Tech. \nPurdue has an absurd +40.2 net rating with Cox on the floor against top-100 teams this season. Cox's spot in the starting lineup is safe for the time being. Grade: A\n            ",

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Packers liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -2.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings SportsbookBet Packers vs. Lions and other NFL Week 13 games at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\n        \n            \n                Why the NFL made a Thanksgiving scheduling change that broke 42 years of tradition for the Lions\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey storylinesRevenge game. The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

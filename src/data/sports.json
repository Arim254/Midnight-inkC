    "body": "\n        The 2026 NFL Draft is shaping up to be a referendum on positional value, and it's all thanks to an unexpected star from Columbus. It's hard to come out of nowhere when you play for Ohio State, but Arvell Reese has made a convincing case for just that with his dominant 2025 performance.      A true junior who won't turn 21 until next August, Reese played in six games in 2023 without recording a tackle. In 2024, there were only flashes -- a half-sack and 3.5 tackles for loss --  as he served as a cog in a national championship defense that sent eight players to the NFL last spring. This season, those flashes became a full-blown breakout reaching a level of impact that has separated him not only as one of the best players in Columbus, but arguably the best player in the entire draft class.      When I updated my 2026 NFL Draft 'Big Board' in mid-November, Reese -- who wasn't even in my top 50 in August -- had vaulted to No. 2, trailing only Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.      \nBut this story isn't just about Arvell Reese. It's about whether teams should stop overthinking the No. 1 pick.      Given the current 2026 NFL Draft order heading into Week 16, the Giants currently hold the No. 1 pick, and the Titans are sitting at No. 3. Neither team needs a quarterback. Ideally, if either team lands the top pick, they'd try to trade down and let -- take your pick -- the Raiders, Browns, Jets, Cardinals or Saints move up for Mendoza (and this assumes that Cleveland and New Orleans won't run it back with Shedeur Sanders/Dillon Gabriel or Tyler Shough).\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 5.0: Giants trade No. 1 pick as QBs, edge rushers take over top 10\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n But there are far worse fates than getting \"stuck\" with Reese. In fact, it doesn't take much imagination to argue he's the safest player in the entire class and absolutely worth the No. 1 pick. He has drawn comparisons to Micah Parsons and Abdul Carter for his freakish athleticism, position flexibility and offense-altering playmaking ability, all while being relatively new to his role. \nParsons was the 12th overall pick in 2021, the same draft that saw Trevor Lawrence go No. 1. Parsons lasted that long because he opted out of his final college season because of COVID, he was an off-ball linebacker at Penn State, and some teams had maturity concerns about him ahead of the draft. Turns out, Parsons is a first-overall talent.      Carter, also a Penn State alum, was the No. 3 pick in 2025. And like Parsons, he began his college career as an off-ball linebacker, moved to edge rusher during his final season, and immediately looked like a natural, dominating with speed, power and physicality. If all three players were in the 2026 class, I'd have them rated Parsons, Reese and Carter.       Former Titans GM Ran Carthon, my co-host on the \"With the First Pick\" NFL Draft podcast, spoke about Reese on a recent episode:      \n\"He's going to go very, very early -- probably a little earlier than people realize at this point ... [B]ut I'll be interested to see where someone plays him because to maximize his ability, he's a lot like Abdul Carter and Micah Parsons in terms of his role. \t \t \t \t \t \t\"Because both of those guys were off-ball linebackers at Penn State ...  I remember watching [Reese's] tape and I was actually reading my report on him this past summer in terms of me not loving him as an off-ball linebacker because I didn't think he saw the triangle well enough. But he was so fast, so explosive that he could overcome it.  And then I remember just seeing snaps of him playing with his hand in the dirt and making a note to myself.  \t \t \t \t \t \t\"Probably the best thing he does is rush  [the passer]. ... But then you go and you look at Abdul Carter, two years of playing off-ball. Kind of the same thing. I didn't love him as an off-ball linebacker. I didn't think he made special plays, so to speak, as the way we were talking about him being a top five pick as an off-ball linebacker. And then you move him down on the edge and boom! He becomes a real guy. Now, again, of the three, I think Arvell Reese is a much better off-ball linebacker ... but if I'm ranking all three of them as pass rushers, he would be [No. 3].\" \t \t \t \t \t \tSo what does history tell us about teams that used the top pick on a non-QB?  In the 26 drafts since 2000, it's happened seven times.            The 2000 draft class      Brown was an unfortunate No. 1 pick by the -- yep -- Cleveland Browns.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: Penn State DE Courtney Brown to the Browns      Brown played six seasons, had a career-high six sacks in 2003 and finished his career with 19 sacks and 36 tackles for loss.      When was the first QB selected? Only one quarterback went in Round 1: Chad Pennington, to the Jets, 18th overall. There was another QB in this class who worked out (more on that below), but the Browns had taken Tim Couch the year before and weren't in the market for another face of the franchise.      Was it the right choice? Nope. Not even close.  On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is Myles Garrett ... well, 1 is Courtney Brown. Yes, it's easy to blame the Browns for being the Browns, it's also a reminder that the draft is a crap shoot and this was an example of Cleveland getting it exactly wrong. More confirmation of that reality?       With the hindsight of a quarter-century, let's look at the best players from the 2000 class, based on Pro-Football-Reference's approximate value metric which allows you to \"very approximately\" (in their words) to compare players across years and positions.      Tom Brady (R6)       Brian Urlacher (HOF, R1)       John Abraham (R1)       Keith Bulluck (R1)       Brad Meester (R2)       Chad Clifton (R2)       Plaxico Burress (R1)       Shaun Ellis (R1)       Jamal Lewis (R1)       Julian Peterson (R1)       Shaun Alexander (R1)       Laveranues Coles (R3)       Adalius Thomas (R6)       Chris Samuels (R1)      \n      The 2006 draft class      Reggie Bush was the popular choice to go No. 1 overall in 2006, but NC State's Mario Williams closed on him fast.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: NC State DE Mario Williams to the TexansWilliams, who measured 6-foot-7, 295 lbs. at the combine, played 11 seasons with the Texans, Bills and Dolphins, had double-digit sacks five different times, including 14 sacks in his second season and 12 sacks in his third season. He finished his career with 97.5 sacks.       When was the first QB selected? Vince Young went No. 3 overall, Matt Leinart went 10th and Jay Cutler went 11th.        \nWas it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Williams at a 7.5. The Texans drafted David Carr with the top pick in 2002 and he started 16 games in '06, but the team moved on from him after the season and turned to Matt Schaub. I mention this because the Texans could have targeted Cutler, who ended up being the best QB in this class, with the first pick, but Williams turned out to be a solid -- and often spectacular -- player. The real drama leading up to this draft wasn't if the Texans would take a QB, but whether they would target USC's Reggie Bush. Bush ended up going No. 2 to the Saints, and his NFL career didn't approach that of Williams'.       Here are the best players from the 2006 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      Jahri Evans (R4)      Haloti Ngata (R1)      Andrew Whitworth (R2)      Jay Cutler (R1)      Brandon Marshall (R4)      Mario Williams (R1)      Kyle Williams (R5)      Tamba Hali (R1)      Maurice Jones-Drew (R2)      Nick Mangold (R1)      Marques Colston (R7)      The 2007 draft classInjuries derailed the back half of Long's career, but he made four Pro Bowls in his first four seasons.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: Michigan OT Jake Long to the Dolphins      \nExecutive Vice President of Football Operations Bill Parcells was in his first year on the job and the team reportedly was also interested in Matt Ryan to stem a long run of pedestrian QB play in Miami. Ultimately the Dolphins settled on Long, who played nine seasons, was a four-time Pro Bowler his first four seasons, and was a first-team All Pro in 2010. In fact, he started 61 consecutive games before he was placed on injured reserve during the 2011 season. He later suffered ACL injuries in 2013 and 2014.      When was the first QB selected? Matt Ryan went No. 3 overall to the Falcons. The Ravens took Joe Flacco 10 picks later. Both QBs ended up as two of the top players from the '08 class.      Was it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Long at a 7.0. Parcells wanted to build the team through the trenches and Long fit that description. And while he proved to be a solid choice before the injuries cut short his career, passing on Ryan is a tough pill to swallow for a franchise that is still on the search for its next franchise quarterback.      Here are the best players from the 2008 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      \nMatt Ryan (R1)    Calais Campbell (R2)    Joe Flacco (R1)    Duane Brown (R1)    Matt Forte (R2)    Josh Sitton (R4)    DeSean Jackson (R2)    Jordy Nelson (R2)    Chris Johnson (R1)    Aqib Talib (R1)    Jamaal Charles (R3)    Ryan Clady (R1)    Ray Rice (R2)    Jake Long (R1)           The 2013 draft class      An imperfect player in an imperfect draft, you can understand why the Chiefs drafted Eric Fisher.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: Central Michigan OT Eric Fisher to the Chiefs. At the time, this was considered one of the weakest draft classes in recent memory. The Chiefs reportedly tried to trade down, but because the class lacked a Mario Williams or even a Jake Long -- and certainly no QB worth moving up for -- the team stayed put and had to decide between Fisher and Texas A&M OT Luke Joeckel, who ended up going No. 2 to the Jaguars. Fisher played nine seasons (eight in Kansas City, one in Indy), made two Pro Bowls, including his final year with the Chiefs, served as Patrick Mahomes' blindside protector from 2018-20 and won Super Bowl LIV with the team. The organization thought enough of Fisher to pick up his fifth-year option and give him a second contract. And he was for sure the right call over Joeckel, who busted in Jacksonville. When was the first QB selected? The Bills took EJ Manuel No. 16 overall, and he was the only first-round quarterback in the class. The next three QBs off the board? Geno Smith in Round 2, Mike Glennon in Round 3 and Matt Barkley in Round 4.      \nWas it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Fisher at a 6.0. Andy Reid had just been hired, the team had traded for Alex Smith and they were looking to rebuild the offensive line. Given that, and the lack of interest from other teams wanting to trade up, taking Fisher isn't controversial. Not unless you get your hands on a time machine and peek at the best players from the 2013 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      Travis Kelce (R3)   Lane Johnson (R1)   David Bakhtiari (R4)   DeAndre Hopkins (R1)   Keenan Allen (R3)   Tyrann Mathieu (R3)   Terron Armstead (R3)   Darius Slay (R2)   Eric Fisher (R1)   Sheldon Richardson (R1)   Le'Veon Bell (R2)    For as bad as the 2013 class was in the moment, it looks a lot better 12 years later. Kelce and Johnson are Hall of Famers, and there are five names taken in Round 3 or later that would've been revisionist home-run first-overall choices. The lesson: we've heard similar rumblings about the 2026 class, and I'd recommend just giving it time to play out.      \n      The 2014 draft class      Clowney was a generational recruit and college prospect but had just an 'OK' career in Houston.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: South Carolina DE Jadeveon Clowney to the Texans. Bill O'Brien was the coach at the time, and while Houston desperately needed a QB, this was another weak class. Clowney was considered the best player in the class, and the idea of putting him on the same defensive line as JJ Watt made the decision even easier. Clowney, still just 32 years old, is in his 12th NFL season. He's played for the Texans, Seahawks, Titans, Browns, Ravens, Panthers and now the Cowboys. He had 29 sacks in five seasons with the Texans, and has 62 career sacks through 15 weeks of the 2025 season.When was the first QB selected? Blake Bortles went No. 3 overall to the Jaguars. Two other QBs went in the first round: Johnny Manziel to the Browns (No. 22) and Teddy Bridgewater to the Vikings (No. 32). The best QB in this class didn't hear his name called until Round 2 (more on that momentarily).      Was it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Clowney at a 5.5. He was an easy choice at the time, but never quite lived up to the lofty first-overall expectations. Still, a solid player who's had a long career.      Here are the best players from the 2014 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      Aaron Donald (R1)  Zack Martin (R1)  Khalil Mack (R1)  Derek Carr (R2)  Davante Adams (R1)  C.J. Mosley (R1)  Mike Evans (R1)  Joel Bitonio (R2)  Jake Matthews (R1)  Brandin Cooks (R1)  DeMarcus Lawrence (R2)  Corey Linsley (R5)  Jadeveon Clowney (R1)  Odell Beckham Jr. (R1)  Kyle Van Noy (R2)   Donald lasted until the middle of the first round because he was deemed undersized, and Mack went fifth overall, in part, because he was a small(-ish) school player. The lesson: it's easy to overthink it -- try not to fall into that trap.            The 2017 draft class      Future HOFer Myles Garrett was an easy pick by the Browns, but they could have done better with their other two Round 1 picks.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: Texas A&M EDGE Myles Garrett to the Browns. He was the best player in this class. Nine seasons later, he not only remains the best player in this class, he's the best non-QB in the NFL. The Browns needed a quarterback heading into the 2017 season (Cody Kessler, Robert Griffin III and Josh McCown all started games for Cleveland in '16), but they had three first-round picks and a second-rounder to find one. The team chose not to trade up for Patrick Mahomes (10th overall) or Deshaun Watson (12th overall), and instead took safety Jabrill Peppers at No. 25 and TE David Njoku at No. 29. They ended up getting QB DeShone Kizer with the 52nd pick in Round 2. Kizer started 15 games in 2017 (the team went 0-15 in those games on their way to an 0-16 record for the season). Kizer never started another game in the NFL.When was the first QB selected? Mitch Trubisky, who made just 13 career starts in college, went No. 2 overall to the Bears, ahead of Mahomes and Watson in Round 1.      Was it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Garrett at 10, written in permanent marker with an adjoining plaque that recognizes this pick as one of the greatest decisions in Browns history. Now just imagine if they had drafted T.J. Watt or Dion Dawkins or Cooper Kupp or George Kittle with their two other first-round picks ...      Here are the best players from the 2017 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      Patrick Mahomes (R1)Myles Garrett (R1)T.J. Watt (R1)Alvin Kamara (R3)Christian McCaffrey (R1)Dion Dawkins (R2)Ryan Ramczyk (R1)Aaron Jones (R5)Cooper Kupp (R3)Deshaun Watson (R1)Marlon Humphrey (R1)Budda Baker (R2)George Kittle (R5)Joe Mixon (R2)Trey Hendrickson (R3)Matt Milano (R5)       The 2022 draft class      Walker is improving, but he will likely not replicate the success of the player picked after him -- Aidan Hutchinson.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No. 1 overall pick: Georgia EDGE Trevon Walker to the JaguarsIn 2021, the Jaguars took Trevor Lawrence with the No. 1 pick. A year later, they again were picking first overall. I remember talking with someone in the organization at the 2022 Senior Bowl and they were hoping that Kenny Pickett or Malik Willis or Desmond Ridder or Sam Howell would have an impressive enough week to convince somebody to move up for them. It didn't happen, and Jacksonville stayed put and took a high-upside edge rusher in Walker, one pick ahead of Aidan Hutchinson.      When was the first QB selected? Pickett was the only quarterback to go in the first round, and the next QB -- Desmond Ridder -- didn't come off the board until Round 3.      Was it the right choice? On the Courtney Brown-to-Myles Garrett scale described above, I'd put Walker at a 5.0. At the time, the pick was questioned. In part because former GM Trent Baalke was behind the selection, and he was at the point in his journey where he could do no right in the eyes of Jags fans. But also because Walker, while physically imposing, was more projection than sure thing, even by NFL Draft standards. Those concerns were amplified after a rookie season in which he managed just 3.5 sacks compared to Hutchinson's 9.5-sack rookie campaign for the Lions.      But Walker logged 10 sacks in 2023 and 10.5 sacks in 2024 (he has just 2.5 sacks in '25 after being sidelined by injuries). Meanwhile, Hutchinson had 11.5 in '23 and 7.5 in '24 (before being lost for the year to a leg injury after 6 games); he has 8.5 sacks through 15 weeks of the '25 season. Walker is just in Year 4, and once healthy I'd expect him to continue to get better and his numbers will reflect as much. But given he's missed time this season with an injury, and he's still early into his career, I have him rated as a 5.0 ... for now.      Here are the best players from the 2022 class, according to PFR's AV metric:      Brock Purdy (R7)Sauce Gardner (R1)Trent McDuffie (R1)James Cook (R2)Drake London (R1)Tyler Smith (R1)Tyler Linderbaum (R1)Garrett Wilson (R1)George Pickens (R2)Kerby Joseph (R3)Charles Cross (R1)Kyle Hamilton (R1)Cordell Volson (R4)Travon Walker (R1)Derek Stingley Jr. (R1)Kayvon Thibodeaux (R1)Nik Bonitto (R2)Rachaad White (R3)Aidan Hutchinson (R1)Chris Olave (R1) So what's the overarching takeaway? It might be instructive to also look at the 19 quarterbacks taken No. 1 overall this century and ask if those decisions were worth it or reaches -- both in the moment and now.       QBs who went No. 1 overall this century      YEARNAMEYEARNAME2025 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCam Ward \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2011 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCam Newton \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2024 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCaleb Williams \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2010 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSam Bradford \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2023 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBryce Young \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2009 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMatthew Stafford \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2021 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTrevor Lawrence \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2007 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJaMarcus Russell \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2020 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJoe Burrow \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2005 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAlex Smith \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2019 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tKyler Murray \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2004 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tEli Manning \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2018 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBaker Mayfield \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2003 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCarson Palmer \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2016 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJared Goff \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2002 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tDavid Carr \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2015 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJameis Winston \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2001 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMichael Vick \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2012 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAndrew Luck \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t      The jury is still out on Cam Ward, though I've been encouraged by what he's shown under some pretty dire circumstances in Tennessee as a rookie. Caleb Williams is proof that you can have all the talent in the world, but that talent has to be harnessed, both in his play-to-play decision making, but also by pairing him with a play-caller like Ben Johnson. Bryce Young appears to be \"the guy\" in Year 3, but it was touch and go during his rookie season. Again, the coaching staff did him no favors, and he'll forever -- fair or not -- be living up to the expectations of what it cost the Panthers to move up and select him in 2023. Trevor Lawrence has been inconsistent for much of his career, but he's also played for three coaches. Liam Coen could be the one who unlocks it all. The Jags also signed Lawrence to a huge deal after the 2024 season, so they're clearly all in. The pick was, and is, a no-brainer. Joe Burrow felt like he was on pace to be one of the best QBs in league history, but injuries have plagued him in recent years. That said, for all the reasons to question the Bengals, taking Burrow isn't one of them.I get why the Cardinals were intrigued by Kyler Murray, even 12 months after using a first-round pick on Josh Rosen, but he's likely taken his last snap in Arizona. In retrospect, Nick Bosa and Quinnen Williams, selected No. 2 and No. 3 in that 2019 draft, would have been better choices.  Baker Mayfield flashed No. 1 overall ability in Cleveland, but he didn't hit his stride until he landed in Tampa Bay a few seasons ago. Yes, Josh Allen was also in this class, but no one (presumably even Josh Allen) knew what he would become. Mayfield wasn't a reach at the time, or when looking back at the '18 class.Jared Goff, like Mayfield, flashed early in his career but didn't become one of the league's best passers until he was traded. He's a No. 1 overall talent, even in a draft class with Tyreek Hill and Dak Prescott (two Day 3 picks, because of off-field concerns at the time). Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota went Nos. 1 and 2 in the 2015 draft. Neither worked out as long-term franchise QBs, but both have made a living as good backups. If you're re-drafting that class, Winston (or Mariota) would still have a good chance to still go first overall; the leaders in PFR's AV from 2015 are Stefon Diggs, Danielle Hunter, Tyler Lockett and Amari Cooper.Andrew Luck is the original Joe Burrow; a special talent sidetracked by injuries. Cam Newton turned around the Panthers franchise, earning league MVP honors in 2015, while also getting Carolina to the Super Bowl. Sam Bradford was also a victim of injuries, and for as good as he was, I suppose you could make the case that Ndamukong Suh or Trent Williams would be worthy of the No. 1 pick from the 2010 class.Matthew Stafford is a no-brainer. Jamarcus Russell is a no-brainer for the exact opposite reasons; Calvin Johnson and Joe Thomas -- both Hall of Famers -- were picked Nos. 2 and No. 3. In fact, Patrick Willis and Darrelle Revis, also first-rounders in 2007, have been enshrined into the Hall of Fame.Alex Smith was a solid player, but Aaron Rodgers is the best player in the 2005 class, followed by Hall of Famer DeMarcus Ware. I'm not going to fault the Chargers (er, Giants) for taking Eli Manning in '04 -- the man won two Super Bowls -- or the Bengals taking Carson Palmer the year before. He, like Burrow, turned around the franchise before he suffered a serious knee injury.Finally, the Texans were a brand-new franchise and needed a quarterback. David Carr, Joey Harrington and Patrick Ramsey were the three QBs to go in the first round in 2002. Julius Peppers, Dwight Freeney and Ed Reed would have been better picks (all Hall of Famers), but none played quarterback, so I get it. Michael Vick was Cam Newton or Josh Allen but in a 6-foot-1 package. There were three Hall of Famers in the 2001 class -- LaDanian Tomlinson, Richard Seymour and Steve Hutchinson -- and Drew Brees will join the club soon enough, but Vick was one of one. History shows that quarterbacks at No. 1 can work -- and fail -- for reasons that have little to do with draft slot. Which is why, if Arvell Reese is truly the best player in the 2026 class, the safest pick might also be the simplest one.      \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe last chance to join NFL DFS contests for Week 15 comes on 'Monday Night Football' when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins at 8:15 p.m. ET. While those in the passing game like Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Waddle will garner lots of interest as NFL DFS picks, both teams rank in the bottom 10 in pass offense. Thus, if you still want to utilize pass catchers from the MNF DFS player pool, perhaps, it would be a better daily Fantasy football strategy to target lower cost receivers as they would be less risky options. Miami tight end Greg Dulcich is averaging 30.8 receiving yards over his last five games, while Pittsburgh's Darnell Washington is averaging 36.5 yards over his last four. In terms of the running game, De'Von Achane (ribs) is cleared to play for the Dolphins, while Pittsburgh has more uncertainty with Jaylen Warren (illness) being added to the injury report on Monday as questionable. Before making any Dolphins vs. Steelers DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. SteelersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Waddle. The fifth-year receiver has upped his production since Tyreek Hill was injured as he's averaged over 70 total yards since Week 5. Waddle had 50 receiving yards, 21 rushing yards and a touchdown a week ago and now gets to face a porous secondary in Pittsburgh. The Steelers have allowed the most catches of any team to opposing wideouts while giving up the second-most receiving yards to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Waddle to go Over 63.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell. The former Eagle has become a bigger part of Pittsburgh's offense as of late, averaging 12.3 touches over his last four, after averaging just 5.3 touches over his prior four games. He might see even more work in this one if Warren's illness keeps him out or limits him. Gainwell's made the most of these opportunities as he ranks as the RB9 in Fantasy over the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Miami has the No. 25 run defense, and just four teams are allowing more yards per carry than the Dolphins. Thus, Gainwell has the potential to supply lots of value to your MNF DFS lineups and he won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Gainwell to go Over 28.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Steelers vs. Dolphins DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

The Steelers had lost three of their previous four games and five of their previous seven after starting the season with a 4-1 record, so it was massive for them to get back in the win column ahead of the stretch run.Miami has won four in a row since losing to Baltimore back in Week 9, and is now on the fringes of the playoff race in a season that started off in disastrous fashion. The Dolphins have been running the ball like crazy during their winning streak, while also turning over the opposing team multiple times in each of those games. Will the Steelers make it two in a row, or will the Dolphins pull off the upset to stay alive in the AFC playoff race? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Steelers vs. DolphinsDate: Monday, Dec. 15 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key storylinesAFC North race. Pittsburgh currently holds a half-game lead in the division over the Ravens. The Steelers will maintain their AFC North lead no matter the result of this game by virtue of having defeated Baltimore last week, but it would obviously be beneficial to hold onto the one-game cushion heading into the stretch run. After this game against Miami, the Steelers close out the season with games in Detroit, in Cleveland and then at home against the Ravens. Baltimore closes by hosting New England and then traveling to Green Bay and Pittsburgh.AFC wild card race. The Dolphins are 2.5 games back of the Texans for the No. 7 seed in the AFC and technically still alive in the wild card chase. They're going to need to win out and they'll need to get a whole lot of help from other teams along the way. Following this game against the Steelers, they close the season by hosting the Bengals and Buccaneers and then traveling to New England to take on the Patriots. The Steelers are obviously still alive for a wild card spot as well with their 7-6 record, but they're far more likely to make it by holding off the Ravens in the division race than by sneaking in as a wild card, which by contrast is Miami's only path to the postseason.Revenge games for star DBs. Minkah Fitzpatrick and Jalen Ramsey will each be playing against their former teams in these games after they were involved in a trade for each other this offseason. Fitzpatrick spent five-plus seasons in Pittsburgh after being traded there (by Miami) early in the second year of his NFL career, only to be sent back to the Dolphins this past offseason. Ramsey played two years in Miami before being traded to Pittsburgh. Steelers vs. Dolphins pick, prediction\nDid you know that the Dolphins are 5-1 in their last six games since dropping to 1-6 and looking like their season was done? Mike McDaniel has this team playing really well! They can run on anybody, and we've seen that you can run on the Steelers. (Look at what the Bills did a couple weeks ago.) If they can control the game on the ground, I like their chances to pull off an upset here, considering that the Pittsburgh offense still isn't explosive enough to put an opponent away. \nPick: Miami 21, Pittsburgh 17 | Dolphins +3, Under 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work. The Spurs-Thunder semifinals matchup felt like a playoff game, and we should be in store for another high-intensity matchup between the Knicks and Spurs Tuesday night. Tip off is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET on Prime.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby is set to enter the transfer portal, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer, and his impending departure from the Bearcats figures to capture the attention of college football's top programs. In fact, the No. 1-ranked team in the country may be interested in Sorsby, which sets up a potential return to Indiana, where he spent the first two years of his career.The Hoosiers and Texas Tech are among the potential schools of interest for Sorsby, sources tell Zenitz and Hummer. But it is also possible that Sorsby will explore an entrance into the NFL Draft. On the heels of his best season to date, the fourth-year junior could be an early-round pick.Sorsby's move from Indiana to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 season proved beneficial for his career trajectory. Sorsby thrived in the Big 12 and passed for 2,800 yards in both of his seasons with the Bearcats. He took his game to another level this fall and was among the most efficient quarterbacks in the conference with a Big 12-best 13.5 yards per completion.The dual-threat ability Sorsby displayed over his three years as a starter also make him a potential home-run pickup through the transfer portal. He has become a more prolific runner with each additional year of experience and peaked this season with a career-best 580 yards on 100 carries. He also posted nine rushing touchdowns for the second consecutive campaign.\nWhile the end of the season saw Cincinnati lose four straight games and Sorsby regress as a passer, the first half of the year displayed the quarterback's tantalizing upside. He enjoyed a stretch of seven consecutive games without an interception and threw at least two touchdown passes in each of those contests, all of which were victories.Brendan Sorsby, Indiana could be poised for reunionIndiana will likely be in search of a plug-and-play quarterback to replace Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who could be the first player taken in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Hoosiers could choose to reunite with a familiar option and one who spearheaded their offense for most of the 2023 season.Following his redshirt year in 2022, Sorsby appeared in 10 games and made seven starts for Indiana and split time with Tayven Jackson atop the depth chart. His debut season in the lineup was not without its learning curves, but Sorsby also flashed his potential with a number of explosive plays. He completed a 90-yard touchdown pass against Penn State, for instance, and became the only Indiana quarterback since at least 1996 with multiple 60-yard touchdown passes in a single game.\nSorsby's departure from Indiana came after the Hoosiers fired coach Tom Allen, and with the coaching change and transfer exodus ushered in a golden era for the program. The last two years have been the most successful in school history, and Sorsby, 21, could return to help keep the newfound winning tradition alive.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Winter Meetings are well in the rearview mirror by now and plenty of things still need to happen in the MLB offseason. Let's gather the comings and goings of the day right here. Dodgers told Glasnow he won't be tradedA rumor coming out of the Winter Meetings was that the Dodgers were dangling starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow in trade talks. There are still two years and $65 million left on Glasnow's deal before a $30 million club option in 2028, and while he's been good while healthy, he has never pitched more than 135 innings in a single season (his career high came in 2024 with the Dodgers, his first season after being traded to Los Angeles).Glasnow, though, said on MLB Network Radio that the Dodgers' front office told him he won't be traded. He said he trusts them.Obviously plans can change, but it doesn't seem like the Dodgers front office would go out of their way to tell Glasnow he's not going anywhere if they were planning to trade him. \nMets looking for frontline starting pitching, also a batThe Mets \"still want to add a starter for somewhere in the front half of their rotation,\" according to The Athletic, and are also \"eyeing another bat.\" The report says it would be surprising if the Mets didn't add to their outfield, particularly after Brandon Nimmo was traded away. Further, they are open to trading Ronny Mauricio, Luisangel Acuña and/or Mark Vientos. The rotation right now has Nolan McLean, David Peterson, Kodai Senga, Clay Holmes and Sean Manaea with depth options Jonah Tong and Brandon Sproat. Perhaps McLean grows into an ace while Peterson and Senga have shown the ability to pitch like All-Stars at times, but there isn't a true ace here right now. Hence the Mets interest in grabbing a frontline guy from outside the organization.In terms of adding to the outfield, right field is locked up with Juan Soto and Jeff McNeil is penciled into left, but he can move around. Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said earlier this winter that top prospect Carson Benge will get a chance to win the starting center field job out of spring training, but he has yet to even make his major-league debut. They've been connected in trade rumors with Luis Robert Jr. since at least the 2025 trade deadline.\nPhillies sign GarcíaThe Phillies have agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with outfielder Adolis García, per The Athletic. The 32 year old has had quite a fall in the last two years. In 2023, he was an All-Star and Gold Glover and one of the best players on the World Series champion Rangers, slashing .245/.328/.508 (127 OPS+) with 39 homers, 107 RBI and 4.5 WAR. He was non-tendered by the Rangers this offseason after hitting .227/.271/.394. The Phillies will be hoping that this lottery ticket cashes with García bouncing back and looking like the 2023 version of himself.Also, the Phillies have been rumored to be looking to trade right fielder Nick Castellanos and this move sure seems like it's coverage for such a reality. García hits perfectly in that spot.\nRoyals eyeing DuranThe Royals needed basically an entire outfield as they headed into the offseason. They have traded for Isaac Collins and signed free agent Lane Thomas, but it still certainly isn't a strength. They are reportedly open to trading for another outfielder and have their eyes on Red Sox All-Star outfielder Jarren Duran, per The Athletic. Duran, 29, hit .256/.332/.442 (114 OPS+) with 41 doubles, 13 triples, 16 home runs, 84 RBI, 86 runs, 24 steals and 4.7 WAR last season.Interestingly, the report notes that a Duran move could cost the Royals left-handed starter Cole Ragans. After an All-Star season in 2024, injuries ruined the 2025 season for Ragans, but he still has the upside of an ace. \nFurther, the Royals also have interest in Cardinals utility man Brendan Donovan. Ketel Marte's no-trade listDiamondbacks All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte's name remains in the trade rumor mill. He's still got $102.5 million over the next six years on his contract, but he's good enough to make that a bargain. There have reportedly been clubhouse issues, of course, which makes things a bit more murky.Further complicating matters might be his no-trade clause. There are five teams on it, according to The Athletic: the Athletics, Pirates, Yankees, Giants and Cardinals.\nBell signs with TwinsThe Twins have agreed to a one-year deal with first baseman Josh Bell, reports ESPN. The deal is for a guaranteed $7 million, per the Minnesota Star-Tribune.Bell, a 33-year-old switch-hitter, slashed .237/.325/.417 (110 OPS+) with 22 home runs, 63 RBI and 0.4 WAR in 140 games for the Nationals last season. The Twins appear to be headed toward a bit of a rebuild, but reports have also indicated they are hanging on to outfielder Byron Buxton along with starting pitchers Pablo López and Joe Ryan. Much like with Glasnow and the Dodgers, though, things can change quickly.\nMets sign PacheThe Mets and outfielder Christian Pache have agreed to a deal, according to the New York Post. This is a depth signing. Pache didn't play in the majors in 2025 after posting -0.2 WAR with three different teams in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football, their first game back at home since \"fire Mike Tomlin\" chants erupted in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. Numerous players have come to Tomlin's defense since, the latest remarks coming from former Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who kept his opinion blunt and to the point over the weekend.\"Me, personally, I thought the chants were bullshit,\" Ramsey said Saturday. \"That's comical in my mind. That's all I'll say about that.\"The Steelers (7-6) face what amounts to a pivotal matchup against the Dolphins to stay in the NFL playoff conversation after a 4-1 start since deteriorated. Pittsburgh traded for Ramsey in July from Miami as part of a multi-player deal that included Minkah Fitzpatrick. Ramsey amassed 41 tackles and an interception for the Steelers so far.The Steelers took sole possession of the AFC North lead after their Week 14 win over the Ravens after Baltimore had caught up with its divisional rival despite a 1-5 start this season.\n\"It's tough, it's the NFL ... any type of success you get, you hang onto it,\" Ramsey said, referencing his seven postseason games in his eight-year career.Tomlin, the NFL's longest-tenured coach, said he understands the frustrations felt by the Pittsburgh faithful.\"In general, I agree with them, from this perspective: Football is our game, we're in a sport entertainment business,\" Tomlin said. \"And so if you root for the Steelers, entertaining them is winning. And so when you're not winning, it's not entertaining.\"\n\"If you've been in this business, you understand that, and so I respect it,\" Tomlin said previously. \"I share frustrations, I understand what makes this thing go, and winning is what makes this thing go.\"Pittsburgh lost its last five playoff games under Tomlin with the Steelers' most recent postseason win coming in the divisional round of the 2016 playoffs. Tomlin is 8-11 overall in the playoffs during his 19-year tenure, a career highlighted the  Super Bowl XLIII victory.Tomlin has yet to deliver a losing season in Pittsburgh.\"I'm a firm believer that if you choose the right people to lead, and you have the right process, you don't have to make changes,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \"Because for the most part, it leads to rebuilding or dysfunction that can kind of break some of the foundational characteristics of winning organizations like the Steelers are.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was in MVP form during Sunday's 35-31 win over the New England Patriots, and he shined in the comeback victory even with an upset stomach. Apparently, playing through nausea is a regular occurrence for the superstar.During the fourth quarter, a camera broadcasting the game happened to catch Allen throwing up on the sideline. When asked about the ill-timed close-up, Allen said that the sickness was nothing new but rather something he deals with on a near weekly basis.\"If they don't catch it every game, I don't know,\" Allen said. \"It basically happens every game. If I don't get enough out pregame, it usually happens at halftime. If I don't get enough at halftime, it usually happens in the third or fourth quarter. I don't know why I do it. It just happens. It's due to nothing else other than just a weird feeling. Just gotta get it out.\"Allen did not miss any time after the sideline incident, which occurred ahead of a Patriots kickoff. He trotted back onto the field seconds later and led a go-ahead touchdown drive.\nWhether it be a nervous response or his body's reaction to the physical tolls of an NFL game, Allen's throwing up clearly has no negative impact on his performance.Josh Allen delivers vintage performance in comeback effortWhen Allen is at his best, he is the most unstoppable quarterback in the NFL. He was in that prime form in the Week 15 win over the Patriots, specifically in the second half. The Bills fell behind early as Allen's unit sputtered and New England gouged the Buffalo defense, but not even a 21-0 deficit was too much for them to overcome.Allen caught fire after coming out of the locker room at halftime and orchestrated a 28-point second half. He completed 19 of 28 passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns, and he ran 11 times for 48 yards as the leader of a dramatic comeback effort. Silencing the Gillette Stadium crowd, the Bills defeated the Patriots and thus prevented them from clinching the AFC East.\nThe 21-point comeback matched the largest in Bills history in a road game, and Allen's leadership sent him climbing up the NFL MVP odds board. He has the third-shortest odds to win the award, per DraftKings, at +550. Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is the favorite at -300, while Patriots quarterback Drake Maye also remains in the race at +425.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a flurry of movement Monday morning, five different high-level quarterbacks announced their intention to go in the college football transfer portal. Former five-stars Dylan Raiola and DJ Lagway left Nebraska and Florida, respectively, after two seasons. Aidan Chiles, a former top 60 recruit, opted to depart Michigan State. East Carolina QB Katin Houser decided to make a run back to the Power Four following a breakout season. All the while, the portal has new No. 1 player according to Cooper Petagna's big board at 247Sports: Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who hopped back into the portal ahead of his final season of college football. It was all a bit dizzying. The portal doesn't open for another three weeks, and there are still many high-profile moves expected to occur both within in the quarterback market and apart from it. With that in mind, let's reset the quarterback landscape, highlighting some of the big names, schools to watch and names we still have on the radar ahead of Jan. 2.\nThe names atop the QB market No. 1 Brendan Sorsby, Cincinnati: Sorsby finished the year ranked 10th in ESPN's QBR metric, emerging as one of the truly elite passers in the sport. The two early schools to watch with Sorsby are Indiana and Texas Tech. The Hoosiers are a bit ironic given that's where Sorsby started his career, exiting Bloomington shortly after Curt Cignetti arrived. The Red Raiders are the local school to have on the radar -- if you consider 300 miles of West Texas driving local -- and seem to be a strong on-paper fit for the junior passer. Of note with Sorsby: Sources have indicated he still plans to consider the NFL Draft. But those are two schools to know if he does opt to stay in school. No. 2 Dylan Raiola, Nebraska: It probably is unsurprising to see Raiola's name listed here given the lead up the last few weeks. His brother decommitted from Nebraska. The school fired his uncle Donovan, the offensive line coach. CBS Sports reported the split was likely. But the end of the Raiola and Nebraska partnership is still interesting given how much the two sides had invested in each other, including a $3.5 million rev share/NIL package for Raiola. As for what's next, an early school to keep an eye on is Oregon. The Raiola camp has interest in the Ducks, per sources, and there is a growing industry thought that Oregon QB Dante Moore will end up testing the NFL Draft waters.No. 3 DJ Lagway, Florida: Unlike the above two situations that had been trending toward a breakup for weeks, the divorce between Lagway and Florida came as somewhat of a surprise Monday. Lagway only decided in recent days he'd move on after his initial meetings with the new Florida staff went poorly, per sources. As for what's next for the former No. 1 QB prospect in the 2024 class, schools like Baylor, Florida State and Duke (depending on what happens with Darian Mensah) have been brought up per sources along with those like Clemson, LSU and Miami. Of note, Lagway's dad played at Baylor.\n\n        \n            \n                Where will DJ Lagway transfer? Departing Florida QB's possible destinations include LSU, Miami, Clemson\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOthers we're watchingSam Leavitt, QB, Arizona State: Industry sources have pointed at Leavitt for months as someone who could enter the transfer portal. That seems like a formality at this point after he didn't attend Arizona State's year-end banquet and head coach Kenny Dillingham wished him well \"in whatever his future may hold,\" per 247Sports' Chris Karpman. CJ Bailey, QB, NC State: A star sophomore with the Wolfpack, Bailey is a popular rumor for other teams in terms of potential portal candidates. Dave Doeren coming back aids NC State's chances of keeping Bailey around, but he remains a very hot name in terms of other programs looking at the quarterback market. Byrum Brown, QB, South Florida: It raised some eyebrows in the industry when Brown opted out of the Cure Bowl. Brown is a senior, but he's pursing a waiver that is expected to go through. If it does … several schools in the industry are watching Brown and his status. There would be a natural fit at Auburn, where his former South Florida head coach Alex Golseh resides. \nDrew Mestemaker, QB, North Texas: A breakout star as a redshirt freshman this season, Mestemaker led the FBS with 4,129 passing yards to go along with 31 touchdowns on 70.2% passing. He's been a name other schools have eyed for months. It's natural to assume that he'll follow Eric Morris to Oklahoma State. But Mestemaker is expected to have robust options. There are several other QBs worth watching over the coming month. Some notable backups like Ohio State's Lincoln Kienholz and Oregon's Austin Novasad have decisions to make. There are other very productive Group of Five QBs like Arkansas State's Jaylen Raynor or Parker Navarro from Ohio worth keeping track of. There are also a few more established starters who could shake if things become further unsettled at their current situations. The news keeps coming with three weeks to go. Don't expect it to stop anytime soon. \nNorth Texas' Drew Mestemaker is expected to among the most coveted quarterbacks in the transfer portal. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Teams in needMiami: The Hurricanes are likely to dip into the portal for a third straight offseason in pursuit of a quarterback with Carson Beck's impending graduation. Though, there is some internal optimism about the development of Emory Williams.Texas Tech: The Red Raiders love backup quarterback Will Hammond, but he tore his ACL in late October. Given that there's no guarantee of him being ready for next season, Texas Tech is expected to go after a starter-quality passer in the portal. Money tends to be no object in Lubbock.Indiana: Indiana's made the playoff in back-to-back years with a transfer quarterback, and it will try to do so a third time in 2026. Expect Indiana to go and get a guy to replace Fernando Mendoza.\nLSU: Could it just end up being Trinidad Chambliss? That's certainly possible if he can secure a waiver. Either way, the Tigers are expected to be in the portal market for a high-level starter, and Lane Kiffin makes the Tigers a super attractive option.Florida State: There had been some thought that Tommy Castellanos could qualify for an additional season of college football via a waiver. It could still happen, but there's a good chance of Florida State hopping into the high-end portal quarterback market either way.That top of the market could grow, too, depending on a few big quarterback decisions. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could end up going to the draft which would mean Oregon jumping into the fray. The tenor around his situation has shifted in recent weeks with industry sources now considering the NFL a more likely option for Moore.\nAuburn will have a decision to make about its 2026 signal-caller. Deuce Knight is a potential superstar and seems to be an ideal on-paper fit for Golesh's system. Knight has also started just one game. I would expect the Tigers to pursue an experienced option.Clemson, believe it or not, is also a team to watch in the quarterback market. The Tigers have indicated to agents that quarterback is a potential need this cycle as they replace Cade Klubnik. Whether that's a high-end starter or someone to compete with Christopher Vizzina remains to be seen.There are also a lot of other teams expected to go get a guy. Illinois, Virginia Tech, Louisville and Baylor will all likely need starting arms, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in 2026 after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, ",
    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in 2026 after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, but the top European leagues aren't going on break in the meanwhile. Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to fight for another Premier League title while Bayern Munich are once again dominating the Bundesliga standings. Elsewhere, Real Madrid are struggling and there is increasing pressure on the position of the manager Xabi Alonso, while Hansi Flick's Barcelona look strong. Let's take a look our Power Rankings: 1. Arsenal (--)It was a challenging weekend for the side coached by Mikel Arteta, as Arsenal won 2-1 thanks to two owngoals scored by Wolverhampton, with the winning one in the last minute of stoppage time. Arsenal remain top of the Premier League, holding a two-point lead over Manchester City, and after their 3–0 win against Club Brugge last week, they are the only team to have already secured a top-eight finish and a place in the Champions League knockout stages. 2. Bayern Munich (--)If there is one team still chasing Arsenal, that's Bayern Munich. The German giants won 3-1 against Sporting CP in the last Champions League's matchday and are dominating the league. Also, they've got a new talent who is shining and showing to be among the best around the world: Lennart Karl, one to watch also for the upcoming 2026 World Cup. 3. Barcelona (--)Barcelona drastically improved in the last month and are coming from a strong week with two wins against Eintracht Frankfurt and Osasuna on Saturday, consolidating their LaLiga advantage on Real Madrid. Hansi Flick is also welcoming some of his biggest stars back in the team after their injuries and this is only helping Barcelona to be considered as one of the best teams around Europe and a solid Champions League contender. \n4. Manchester City (+1)We all thought this wasn't a great season for Manchester City after a difficult start. Well, we should have waited a bit more. Pep Guardiola's team are only two points behind Arsenal in the league and well positioned to end up in the top eight of the Champions League standings. Erling Haaland scores in every single match, but that's not news really. 5. PSG (-1)The Champions League title holders look less solid than the past season when they dominated both in France and Europe, but at the end of the day despite some big injuries they are still there competing for a spot in the top eight and one point behind Lens in Ligue 1. The feeling is that their condition will only improve from now on and that they can become a factor in both competitions in the coming weeks. 6. Inter (--)The Nerazzurri have been quite disappointing in their last two Champions League matches, losing to both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool after winning their opening four games in the league phase. This season, they have struggled against top opponents, and that is not an encouraging sign heading into the knockout stages, but they are now back at the top of the Serie A standings after the results of the past weekend. \n7. Atletico Madrid (+1)The Spanish giants are back on track. After losing two matches in a row against Barcelona and Athletic Club, the team coached by Diego Simeone won two matches in a row against PSV away and then at their home stadium against Valencia and are now close to the top four in LaLiga standings and then eyeing the top eight of the Champions League standings. 8. Chelsea (-1)Enzo Maresca's team has only won two of the last five Premier League matches and the Italian manager showed some frustration in the post match press conference of their game against Everton, hinting that there might be some disagreements with the owners. This is worth keeping in mind over the coming weeks, especially as the season is progressing strongly in both domestic and European competitions.\n        \n            \n                EFL Carabao Cup burning questions: Why is Enzo Maresca unhappy at Chelsea and can beating Cardiff fix it?\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n9. Real Madrid (--)What is going on at Real Madrid? Things look a bit better for Xabi Alonso after the Spanish giants won against Alaves over the weekend but it's still a difficult moment for the Blancos and the coach, who is facing a big pressure after some disappointing results, including the 2-1 defeat against Manchester City. \n10. Liverpool (+1)Mo Salah left Liverpool and joined Egypt as the African team will be playing in AFCON later this month. This is going to be a key month for the future of the Liverpool star as he might leave in the January transfer window. On the other hand, the two wins against Inter away and then at Anfield against Brighton cleared the air around the position of Arne Slot, who can count on the trust of both the team and the fanbase again. 11. Atalanta (+7)Atalanta are by far the team that improved the most recently as they look completely different since Raffaele Palladino replaced Ivan Tudor on the bench. The home win against Chelsea last week clearly showed that this team can compete with Europe's elite, and Palladino could realistically guide them into the top eight of the league phase. In Serie A, Atalanta are improving and gradually returning to the level they belong to, even if they will likely need a bit more time to fully settle.12. Newcastle (-2)Things look completely different for Newcastle compared to the past season and the latest 1-0 defeat in the Derby against Sunderland showed that this is not a great season so far for them. They can still, and they should, make it into the next phase but they don't look as strong as before. \n13. Olympique Marseille (--)The side coached by Roberto De Zerbi is doing great this season and the last two Champions League wins put them in a strong place ahead of the next phase. Watch out for them, they are not only exciting to watch but also a team that can put others in trouble in Europe. In the French league they are only five points behind Lens, and four behind PSG. 14. Galatasaray (-2)The last two defeats in the Champions League against Union SG and AS Monaco showed that they are not living their best moment, but with so much talent I can still see them to be a challenging outsider when a team will visit team in the playoffs in February in front of their home fans. 15. Borussia Dortmund (--)The home draw against Bodo/Glimt was a bit disappointing for the 2024 Champions League finalists, but at the same time they are where we could expect them to be: middle of the table with high chances to end up in the top 16. \n16. Tottenham (-1)They look better in Europe than in the Premier League where Thomas Frank's team has only won one of the last five matches and already lost six games in 16 matches so far. It seems that what happened last season wasn't a coincidence and it will take more time to see if Frank will be the coach able to turn things around. 17. Sporting CP (--)The Portuguese team are challenging Porto at the top of the domestic league and hoping to land in the playoffs of the Champions League. We could expect them to lose at Bayern Munich and the next two games against PSG and Athletic Club will tell us more about their European expectations. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (+1)The home draw against Newcastle slowed down their chances to end up in the top 16, which would mean playing at home in the second leg of the Champions League playoffs, but it's not over yet. \n19. Juventus (+1)Looks like Luciano Spalletti found a way to improve his team. They are still struggling despite the positive results against Pafos in Europe and then an away win against Bologna over the weekend, but things look much better compared to some weeks ago. Finally, it seems Juventus are getting back on track20. Napoli (-4)Antonio Conte is in trouble, once again. Injuries are definitely having an impact on the performances, but the Champions League defeat against Benfica could really cost them a lot. They are at risk to not end up in the top 24 and being eliminated in the league phase. Not good. 21. PSV (+1)The Dutch side are dominating the league with 14 wins in 16 matches and are in the race to end up in the league phase's top 24 right now. Their only two wins in Europe this season? A stunning 4-1 win at Liverpool away and a dominant 6-2 rout of Napoli at home. They perform best when facing the big teams\n22. AS Monaco (-1)They are struggling this season in both European and domestic leagues, but with their only one defeat in the Champions League they are still in the race for a playoff spot. 23. Club Brugge (--)They have the talent needed, but it doesn't seem to be enough for this season. After winning their first home game of the league phase, they lost twice, drew 3-3 against Barcelona, then lost 3-0 to both Sporting CP and Arsenal in the last matchday last week. 24. Benfica (+5)Can Jose Mourinho make it? I didn't think so before their exciting 2-0 win against Napoli. They are doing much better right now and they still have a chance. I believe in the Special One! \n25. Copenaghen (--)I didn't think they had a chance to qualify for the next round but the 3-2 away win against Villarreal completely changed their look in the standings. 26. Qarabag (-1)A strong start for them, we all hoped they could be a great story, but maybe we overestimated them. Losing to Ajax at home is quiet surprising this season. 27. Eintracht Frankfurt (-1)Last week I wrote that the Barcelona away match was their last chance for the playoffs and they lost. This is probably the end of their dreams but it's over when is over. \n28. Union Saint-Gilloise (+1)The latest home defeat against Olympique Marseille wasn't what they needed to have some qualification hope.29. Athletic Club (-2)I have to be honest. I was expecting a lot from this team this season in the Champions League and if I'm not wrong I even put them as a surprise in our preview of the tournament. I'm afraid I was wrong! 30. Villarreal (-1)They are probably the biggest surprise in LaLiga, sitting third behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, but a disaster in the Champions League. I can't find an explanation: Can someone help me? 31. Pafos (--)The team from Cyprus are doing more than we could expect and they are in 26th place after their first historic Champions League win against Villarreal, but then lost to Juventus in the last matchday of 2025. 32. Slavia Prague (--)Sadly, they don't seem to be at the level of the other teams in the tournament but we could see that coming. This is not a surprise to be honest.  33. Olympiacos (--)They finally won their first Champions League match of the season away against Kairat. Too late and not enough. 34. Bodo/Glimt (--) One point behind from the leaders in the Norwegian league standings but basically no hopes in Europe despite an exciting away draw in Germany against Borussia Dortmund. One to remember. 35. Ajax (+1)Big news: Ajax are not in the last spot of our power rankings anymore thanks to their first win against Qarabag. How exciting! 36. Kairat (-1)Just competing in the Champions League is already a historic achievement for the club. We still love them. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys didn't spend aggressively in free agency to add a running back like some fans wanted, but owner/general manager Jerry Jones still managed to find the franchise a bargain in former Broncos running back Javonte Williams. Entering a Week 11 matchup with the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday Night Football, Williams has rushed for 716 yards and eight touchdowns in nine games while averaging 5.2 yards per carry. Now, he'll take on a Raiders run defense that has given up the fourth-most rushing touchdowns in the NFL (12), but is still priced as high as -180 in the anytime touchdown scorer odds. The SportsLine Projection Model predicts he scores 0.81 touchdowns on average, which is why he's one of our top Raiders vs. Cowboys anytime touchdown scorer picks.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Monday Night Football in Week 11.

He's been a true workhorse in the Dallas backfield, piling up 164 touches so far this season while the rest of the Cowboys running backs have combined for 60. He's scored in six of the nine games he's played so far this season and has even scored twice on the road three times this year. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.George Pickens, Cowboys (+150, FanDuel)Pickens had a dominant stretch where he scored six times in a five-week span early in the season after CeeDee Lamb went down. He's been held scoreless in his last three games with Lamb healthy again, but he's still been heavily involved in the offense, catching 17 of his 24 targets for 239 yards. The Raiders rank 17th in the NFL in pass defense and could have a hard time dealing with all the weapons in a versatile Dallas offense. The model predicts Pickens scored 0.54 touchdowns on average while these odds imply a 40% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.Raheem Mostert, Raiders (+950, FanDuel)This is a pretty heavy longshot with rookie running back Ashton Jeanty very clearly established as the top running back in Las Vegas. However, Mostert is a veteran back who runs downhill and it's not entirely out of the question that he gets a look in a scoring area. He's only two seasons removed from a 21-touchdown season in Miami and the model predicts that his chances to score nearly triple the implied probability. Get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager wins at FanDuel.  Want more Monday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Raiders vs. Cowboys.

Kosar, who underwent multiple procedures last week to address internal bleeding, said early Monday morning in a social media video that he was moments away from having the transplant surgery.Kosar was initially set to receive the transplant last weekend, but the procedure was delayed as the donor organ was infected. The former Cleveland Browns star previously announced that doctors diagnosed him with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson's disease. He now has reason for optimism in one of his lengthy health battles.\"It may not be Victory Monday on the football field, but here we are at 4:23 in the morning at University Hospital, and it's absolutely Victory Monday for me,\" Kosar said. \"Looking forward to literally heading on down right now to get that liver transplant. As you get ready for something monumental and transformative like this in your life, you can't help but be a little reflective. As I go down here today, I think about all the awesome, awesome support and fans out there and my amazing children and family and stuff.\"\nDespite his health issues, Kosar maintains his sense of humor and unabashed love for the Browns. Last week, he jokingly embraced his \"Steelers black and gold regulation University Hospital attire\" while awaiting one of his procedures.After he led the Miami Hurricanes to the 1983 national championship, Kosar entered the NFL's supplemental draft with the intention of landing with his favorite team, the Browns. Cleveland successfully secured the Ohio native, and he proceeded to build a legendary career with his hometown team over nearly a decade as its starting quarterback.\nKosar earned a Pro Bowl selection in 1987, guided the Browns to four playoff appearances in five years and etched his name into team and NFL history. He set multiple league records, including the most consecutive playoff games with three touchdowns and most consecutive completed passes without an interception. He later signed with the Dallas Cowboys and won a Super Bowl in his first year with the franchise, serving as backup to Troy Aikman.\n            \n    ",

Although the Raiders and Cowboys have both lost three of their last four games, scoring points hasn't been an issue for Dallas, which ranks fourth in the NFL in scoring at 29.2 ppg this season. Defense has been Dallas' problem, as the Cowboys rank 31st in scoring defense at 30.8 ppg allowed and yards allowed (397.4), but the model doesn't project Vegas' offensive woes to be able to capitalize on that. The Raiders rank 20th in scoring offense at 24.4 ppg, and they've been held to 12 ppg over their last three contests. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 56% of simulations.Under 49.5 pointsThe Cowboys are coming off one of their worst offensive performances of the season, being held to 17 points against the Cardinals on Week 9 Monday Night Football. Meanwhile, the Raiders are coming off another offensive blunder, scoring only seven points against the Broncos in a 10-7 loss. Each of these teams went Under this point total in their last contest, and only two of nine Raiders games have reached 50 points this season. Geno Smith hasn't been performing nearly at the level he did in Seattle in his first year with the Raiders, and Las Vegas traded away one of his top weapons, Jakobi Meyers, at the trade deadline. Dallas added to its 31st-ranked defense with multiple moves at the trade deadline, including sending a first-round pick to the Jets for defensive lineman Quinnen Williams, so the Cowboys' defense could perform better on Monday than it has for the majority of the season. With all this, the model projects the Under to hit in 53% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

For voters like us in the CBS Sports 136, a comprehensive ranking of every FBS team, late-season results serve to enforce strong resumes and reveal cracks in the facade. You are what your record says you are, as the saying goes, but the impact of these high-stakes games is felt in the updated college football rankings. The shifting winds of support throughout the rankings can occur in different forms. There was, of course, a rankings response to Georgia's impressive win against Texas and Oklahoma's stunning upset of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. But our voters also saw reasons to make some changes in the top five as Texas Tech drubbed UCF and Ole Miss struggled with Florida. The Red Raiders jumped ahead of the Rebels in the rankings, taking advantage of Alabama's loss to join the top five while Ole Miss found itself one spot down from last week, now at No. 7. The voters also had an interesting response to Alabama's drop, as the Crimson Tide landed at No. 9, one spot ahead of the Oklahoma team it just failed to beat. If this were one person's ballot or rankings, there could be some fair criticism for having one 8-2 team ahead of another 8-2 team when a recent head-to-head result points to a different order. But that's not the case here, as the CBS Sports 136 is made up of ballots from experts across the CBS Sports and 247Sports landscape. So let's go under the hood. Alabama Average Voter Ranking (Nov. 16): 9.2 Oklahoma Average Voter Ranking (Nov. 16): 9.8 Both of these teams carry a top-10 average on our ballots, but those averages suggest a varying view on where they fall in a complicated group of two-loss resumes between No. 8 and No. 12. Voters who favor Alabama clearly still want to give the Tide credit for the win against Georgia and possibly have excused the season-opening loss to Florida State. Voters who favor Oklahoma are looking at the wins against Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan and seeking to reward a Sooners group that's been playing high-level football since the loss to Texas in early October. \nFurther down in the rankings, there is some more dramatic shakeups in terms of the number of spots gained and lost after Week 12 results. For more on those, check out the Mover's Report below the top 25 table. College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Ohio State10-012Indiana11-023Texas A&M10-034Georgia9-155Texas Tech9-176Oregon9-187Ole Miss10-168Notre Dame8-299Alabama8-2410Oklahoma8-21211BYU9-11112Utah8-21413Vanderbilt8-21314USC8-21615Georgia Tech9-11516Miami8-21717Michigan8-21818Texas7-31019Virginia9-22520North Texas9-12321James Madison9-12722Tennessee7-32223Houston8-22824Pittsburgh7-32025Illinois7-329Biggest movers No. 44 East Carolina (+13): The Pirates joined the American title race with a thrilling win against Memphis that included a game-winning touchdown pass in the final minutes. The thrill of the victory certainly got the voters' attention, and they noticed this team has won seven of nine since the season-opening loss to NC State, and those two defeats have come to teams that our voters have ranked inside the top 30 (BYU, Tulane). No. 27 Arizona (+10): The Wildcats were vaulted up into the top 30 after going into Cincinnati as a touchdown underdog and emerging with a 30-24 win. Brent Brennan's crew stumbled out of the gate with a 1-3 start to Big 12 play (the win against Kansas State was a non-conference game), but now after three-straight wins, it looks like Arizona is playing some of its best football at the end of the season. No. 31 Navy (+10): The Midshipmen had a great bounce back from losses at North Texas and Notre Dame, handing South Florida a 41-38 loss that has launched Navy to the top of the standings in the American. The resume was lacking for high-end wins to back up an impressive record, and now at 8-2 with the victory against the Bulls there is motivation and reason for a big rise in the rankings. No. 42 Memphis (-10): The Tigers have now dropped 20 spots across the last two weeks as a result of back-to-back losses to Tulane and ECU. It's an 8-3 team with a power conference win (against Arkansas), so the season-long resume should hold up for a top-50 finish, but right now our voters are following the recent trends when it comes to comparing Memphis against other comparable teams. No. 30 Cincinnati (-11): The Bearcats have dropped back-to-back games, and though the first defeat at Utah did not come with much of a penalty from the voters due to the opponent and location, that's not the case after a home loss to Arizona. Cincinnati battled and lost close, certainly not out-classed, but with a 7-3 record and Iowa State as the best win, it's hard to win those tiebreaker debates inside the top 30. No. 37 South Florida (-13): This is a steep drop for a South Florida team our voters have shown favor to throughout the season, but it's been more than a month since the Bulls have defeated a team who currently has a winning record. Close losses at Memphis and Navy have hurt USF's overall outlook, and here it's led to big slip outside of the top 30.   No. 35 Louisville (-14): Sloppy play in a disappointing home loss to Clemson has moved Louisville down again, marking a 21-spot drop over the last two weeks because of losses to Cal and the Tigers. It was not long ago Louisville had wins over Miami and James Madison and a path to the ACC title, but now two games out of first place with one conference game left -- officially eliminated from conference championship contention. Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Week 11 had a flair for the dramatics. Out of the gate, Sunday kicked off with an overtime bout between the Commanders and Dolphins from Madrid, and was followed up with some wild finishes in the early afternoon window. Carolina outlasted Atlanta in overtime thanks to a record-setting day from Bryce Young, while Chicago netted a game-winning field goal as time expired against Minnesota, as did Houston over Tennessee. As the day went on, the late window was dominated by the Rams outlasting the Seahawks in a pivotal NFC West showdown where L.A. baited Sam Darnold into four interceptions. Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs are back to .500 on the year after falling to the Broncos. Needless to say, storylines are pouring out of Week 11 from every direction, and it should have a direct impact on Week 12. As we look forward to the new week, there are some intriguing matchups, including Colts-Chiefs, Eagles-Cowboys and Bucs-Rams. Below, we'll take our first glimpse of Week 12 from a betting perspective and see the early lines of how the oddsmakers are handicapping this slate.Note: Denver, Miami, Los Angeles (Chargers) and Washington are on the bye. Week 12 early oddsAll lines via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet; all games on Sunday unless noted)\nGameEarly lineEarly totalEarly moneylineBills at Texans (Thursday)Bills -3.543.5Bills -205, Texans +172Colts at ChiefsChiefs -3.549.5Colts +168, Chiefs -200Vikings at PackersPackers -6.542.5Vikings +235, Packers -290Patriots at BengalsPatriots -750.5Patriots -340, Bengals +275Giants at LionsLions -11.549.5Giants +530, Lions -752Steelers at BearsBears -344.5Steelers +132, Bears -156Seahawks at TitansSeahawks -1342.5Seahawks -820, Titans +570Jets at RavensRavens -1444.5Jets +750, Ravens -1205Browns at RaidersRaiders -337.5Browns +136, Raiders -162Jaguars at CardinalsJaguars -2.547.5Jaguars -154, Cardinals +130Falcons at SaintsFalcons -1.540.5Falcons -132, Saints +112Eagles at CowboysEagles -4.550.5Eagles -210, Cowboys +176Buccaneers at RamsRams -6.549.5Buccaneers +265, Rams -330Panthers at 49ers (Monday)49ers -747.5Panthers +275, 49ers -340\n        \n            \n                Cover 32: Bengals not good enough to bring Joe Burrow back, plus game balls, biggest gaffes from Week 11\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNotable movement, trendsBills at Texans (Thursday)Buffalo opened as a 2.5-point favorite in this matchup, but that spread has since crossed key numbers in favor of the Bills, who are now a 3.5-point road favorite. It's unclear if C.J. Stroud, who missed Week 11 as he remains in concussion protocol, will be cleared for this matchup, which could lead to another start for Davis Mills. Houston barely was able to escape its matchup with Tennessee, needing a game-winning field goal at the buzzer. When you pair that with Josh Allen's six-touchdown day against Tampa Bay, that could be what has helped swing this line. The Bills are 2-2 ATS as a road favorite this season, and this will be the first time in 2025 that Houston will be a home underdog. Overall, the Texans are 3-2 ATS at NRG Stadium. Colts at ChiefsFaith may be beginning to fade with the Chiefs. K.C. opened as a 4.5-point favorite, but that number has since started to tick toward Indy. Andy Reid's club is still favored, but the line has dropped a full point to 3.5. This comes after the club dropped back down to .500 on the year with a loss in Denver to the Broncos. However, the Chiefs have fared much better at home this season as opposed to being on the road, owning a 4-1 ATS record at Arrowhead Stadium. Week 12 will be a tough task, as they square off against a Colts team that is coming off its bye. Indianapolis is 6-3-1 ATS this season overall, but is just 2-2 ATS on the road. Vikings at PackersGreen Bay has held as a 6.5-point favorite coming out of Sunday's action. The Packers weren't burned by it this time around, but they once again played down to their competition and narrowly defeated the Giants. They enter Week 12 with a 3-7 ATS record, and that 30% cover rate is tied for the second-lowest in the NFL. They are slightly better at home (2-3 ATS), but they'll need to dial it in a little more to be trusted against the number. That said, Minnesota has been up-and-down with J.J. McCarthy under center and is coming off a loss to the Bears in Week 11. The Vikings are 4-6 ATS on the year and 2-1 ATS on the road.Patriots at BengalsNew England opened as a 6.5-point road favorite over Cincinnati, and that has since moved up a half-point with them surrendering the full touchdown. The Patriots are currently undefeated on the road with a 5-0 ATS record and an average margin of victory sitting at 7.6 points. Meanwhile, Cincinnati is 2-3 ATS at home in 2025. The big storyline surrounding the Bengals will be the status of star wideout Ja'Marr Chase, who could face punishment from the league office for his alleged spitting on Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey on Sunday. If he is suspended for this game, that could drive the line even further toward the Patriots. Giants at LionsDetroit laid an egg on Sunday night as the offense couldn't do anything against Philadelphia's stout defense. Even in the aftermath of that loss, however, the odds are unwavering. The Lions remain a sizable favorite at home over the Giants, laying 10.5 points. While the offense went silent in Week 11, the Lions have typically dominated at Ford Field and are 3-1 ATS with an average margin of victory sitting at 16.8 points. As for the Giants, they are 3-3 ATS on the road this year, and the status of Jaxson Dart (concussion) will be worth monitoring after he missed Sunday's loss to Green Bay. Steelers at BearsMason Rudolph could end up being Pittsburgh's starter for this matchup after Aaron Rodgers left Sunday's win over the Bengals with a left wrist injury. With that uncertainty, Chicago's advantage has only grown, sitting as a 3-point favorite after the line initially opened with them laying just 1.5 points. The Steelers have struggled on the road this season, covering just one of their four matchups. As for the Bears, who currently sit atop the NFC North, they are a pedestrian 2-2 ATS at Soldier Field. Seahawks at TitansSam Darnold turned into a pumpkin against Los Angeles on Sunday, tossing four interceptions in the losing effort. Despite that ugly showing, however, they are still monster road favorites as they gear up for a trip to Nashville. Seattle is a 12.5-point favorite as they look to stay undefeated against the number on the road (5-0 ATS). As for Tennessee, they took the Texans down to the wire, but ultimately were not able to pull off the upset. At Nissan Stadium this season, the Titans are 2-3 ATS and have an average margin of victory sitting at -12.6. Jets at RavensBaltimore was firmly on upset alert against the Browns on Sunday, but found a way to fend off its division rival. Now, they are back to .500 on the year after ripping off four straight wins, and are looking to make it five in a row in Week 12 against New York. The Ravens are the biggest favorite in Week 12 at the moment, as they are laying 14.5 points to the Jets. New York is coming off its bye in Week 11 and looking to maintain its winning ATS road record, coming into this matchup 2-1-1 ATS away from MetLife Stadium this season. Browns at RaidersLas Vegas still has its Week 11 matchup on Monday to deal with, so this line could swing after that matchup. That said, the Raiders have bumped up to a 3-point favorite after initially laying 2.5 at the open. That shift up to a full field goal could be due to Browns starter Dillon Gabriel going down amid Sunday's loss to Baltimore due to a concussion. That thrust fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders in under center, and the Colorado product didn't impress much. Cleveland is a league-worst 0-5 ATS on the road in 2025. Jaguars at CardinalsThis line has been turned on its head. At the open, Arizona was the slight 1.5-point favorite, but coming out of Sunday's action, they are now home underdogs. Jacksonville is laying 2.5 points as the road favorite. The Jaguars failed to cover the only other instance this season they were favored on the road, and are just 1-3 ATS away from Jacksonville overall. While that doesn't exactly instill a ton of confidence, Arizona has struggled mightily at home. They are tied for a league-low 20% cover rate at home (1-4 ATS), which includes a 1-2 ATS record as a home underdog. Falcons at SaintsAtlanta opened as a 2.5-point favorite, and that number has held through Week 11, despite the club falling to the Carolina Panthers. The Falcons are currently on a five-game losing streak, during which they are giving up an average of 27.8 points per game. On top of that, they could be looking to Kirk Cousins for this matchup after Michael Penix Jr. left Sunday due to injury. Still, the Saints are getting points, which makes it hard to blame the books when looking at their production this season. The club is 3-7 ATS, and that 30% cover rate is tied for the second-lowest in the NFL. The Saints are also tied for a league-worst 1-4 ATS record at home. Eagles at CowboysPhiladelphia has opened as a 3.5-point favorite on the road over the Cowboys. Of course, Dallas still has its Monday night matchup to play, so this number could move one way or another depending on how that contest with the Raiders unfolds. Even with that in mind, it's hard not to be impressed by what Philly is doing on the defensive side of the ball, coming off back-to-back outings against the Packers and Lions, where they've completely stalled out their offenses. That's helped them to a 7-3 ATS record on the year. That includes a 4-1 ATS record on the road and a 3-1 ATS mark as a road favorite. Buccaneers at RamsFresh off a key win over the Seahawks, the Rams are 6.5-point home favorites over the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay is looking to rebound following a loss to the Bills on Sunday, where it allowed Josh Allen to pile up six total touchdowns. The Bucs have an equally tough task against Matthew Stafford, who is playing himself into the MVP conversation as one of the favorites for the award. This season, the Rams are 3-2 ATS at SoFi Stadium, while the Buccaneers are 4-2 ATS on the road, so something will need to give in this heavyweight NFC matchup. Panthers at 49ers (Monday)Even after Bryce Young threw for 448 yards and three touchdowns, the oddsmakers still love the Niners. In fact, San Francisco is up to a 7-point favorite after initially laying 6.5 at the open. That's likely due to Brock Purdy looking strong in his return to action and the club posting a season-high 41 points. Even after all the injuries that plagued them, the 49ers are 7-4 on the season straight up. While that's impressive, they need to be better against the number as they are just 1-3 ATS at home this season. Meanwhile, Carolina is 4-2 ATS on the road. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end of \"Sunday Night Football\" was shrouded in controversy, as a penalty allowed the Philadelphia Eagles to walk off with a 16-9 victory over Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions. Down seven points with fewer than two minutes remaining, it appeared the Lions were on the verge of getting the ball back with the opportunity to tie the game. The Eagles faced a third-and-8 from their own 38-yard line, and Jalen Hurts missed A.J. Brown high and to the right. However, a flag was thrown on the play.Officials penalized Lions cornerback Rock Ya-Sin for pass interference. The penalty gave the Eagles an automatic first down, and virtually iced the game for Philadelphia since Detroit had just one more timeout in its pocket. It certainly didn't look like Ya-Sin committed a penalty. Even NBC broadcaster Cris Collinsworth broke character and described the penalty as \"terrible.\" \nNaturally, this play was a major talking point after the final whistle.\nWhat referee Alex Kemp said about the penaltyFollowing the game, referee Alex Kemp commented to pool reporter Zach Berman. He addressed the controversial pass interference penalty.\"The official observed the receiver's arm getting grabbed and restricting him from going up to make the catch. So, the ball was in the air, there was a grab at the arm, restricted him and he called defensive pass interference.\"What Dan Campbell said about the playLions coach Dan Campbell also addressed the penalty, and he took the high road.\"Yeah, well, I thought he played defense like he did the whole game, man. I thought he challenged and played it like he did the very first rep that we played man-to-man. So I wouldn't tell him to do anything different, man, get up there and challenge. Play your style and that's it.\"There were more reasons why the Lions lost in Week 11 than just a controversial fourth-quarter flag. \nThe nine points scored were the fewest for Detroit since Week 7 in 2023, and the Lions went 0 of 5 on fourth downs. There are just two other NFL teams in the last 35 years to go 0 of 5 or worse on fourth downs (1995 New England Patriots and 2022 Lions). Goff completed a career-low 38% of his passes, while Amon-Ra St. Brown caught two of 12 targets -- the lowest catch rate of his career (17%). The Lions offense on Sunday night was disappointing, but everyone is left wondering what would have happened if Goff got the ball back with a chance to lead a game-tying drive. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul (12-1-0) will face Anthony Joshua (28-4-0) on December 19 in the Kaseya Center in Miami, Netflix announced.The fight will be available on Netflix and replaces the canceled bout with Gervonta Davis amid domestic violence accusations against Davis. This is surely the first time a boxer changed opponents and went from facing a lightweight to a heavyweight, but Paul was salvaged the December date in Miami and get another big name in for an actual, sanctioned heavyweight bout rather than an exhibition. The Paul-Joshua fight will be contested over eight, three-minute rounds with the fighters wearing 10 oz. gloves.Paul's fight with Davis was widely panned in the boxing industry given the massive weight difference and the unique rules for the exhibition to try and even things out between fighters with a 50-pound differential. Many called for Paul to prove himself against actual heavyweights for some time, and now he must do just that against the former IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion. At 36 years old, Joshua is no longer in his prime (no matter what Paul says), but is considerably closer to being an active contender than Paul's last two opponents, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and Mike Tyson. It's still been more than a year since Joshua competed in the ring, suffering a knockout loss to Daniel DuBois in which he was put down four times and eventually lost via fifth round TKO. \nJoshua was once the heavyweight division's most dominant force, but his shocking first loss to Andy Ruiz was the beginning of a downturn for his career. He has gone 6-4 in the ring going back to that Ruiz fight, including the DuBois loss and back-to-back losses to Oleksandr Usyk. \"Jake or anyone can get this work. No mercy,\" said Joshua in a press release. \"I took some time out and I'm coming back with a mega show. It's a big opportunity for me. Whether you like it or not, I'm here to do massive numbers, have big fights and break every record whilst keeping cool, calm and collected. Mark my words, you'll see a lot more fighters take these opportunities in the future. I'm about to break the internet over Jake Paul's face.\" While Joshua insists this is a big fight for him, this is genuinely a massive opportunity for Paul to prove his doubters wrong against a legitimate heavyweight who was at the top of the sport not too long ago. Paul hopes a win over Joshua will be a springboard to getting an actual title fight. \n \"This isn't an AI simulation. This is Judgment Day,\" said Paul in a release. \"A professional heavyweight fight against an elite world champion in his prime. When I beat Anthony Joshua, every doubt disappears, and no one can deny me the opportunity to fight for a world title. To all my haters, this is what you wanted. To the people of the United Kingdom, I am sorry. On Friday, December 19, under the lights in Miami, live globally only on Netflix, the torch gets passed and Britain's Goliath gets put to sleep. I KNOWWWW YOU GOT EM PICKED HAHAHHA\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is nearing an important date. Teams have until Nov. 21 to tender contracts for the 2026 season to all of their players not already under guaranteed pacts. Alternatively, teams can sever ties with a player, making them immediate free agents. That's certain to be the fate for a number of arbitration-eligible players who, in the eyes of their current employer, are in line for paydays that are disproportionate to their on-the-field value.Below, CBS Sports has previewed the week to come by highlighting 10 particularly interesting non-tender candidates. In each instance, you'll find analysis of the player's situation and a prediction on whether they'll be tendered, non-tendered, or traded elsewhere. You'll also find that player's projected arbitration prize, according to MLB Trade Rumors.Do keep in mind that plenty of quality players have been non-tendered before. Last year's crop included Gavin Sheets, Kyle Finnegan, Griffin Canning, and Mike Tauchman, among others who landed with another club and had productive seasons. In the past, players like Kyle Schwarber and Cody Bellinger have met this fate. Those are now two of the top free-agent hitters available in this winter's class.Let's get to it.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Nathaniel Lowe, 1B, Boston Red SoxArbitration estimate: $13.5 millionLowe might be the most obvious non-tender candidate in the majors. He was a nifty addition for the Red Sox last summer when they signed him after his failed stint with the Nationals. In 34 games, he batted .280/.370/.420 (121 OPS+) and reminded people that he has a track record of being an above-average offensive contributor. Boston has no need for another non-elite corner player, however, and especially not one slated to clear more than $13 million through arbitration. Lowe ought to land on his feet with another team, his fourth since Opening Day 2024. Prediction: Non-tendered\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Alec Bohm, 3B, Philadelphia PhilliesArbitration estimate: $10.3 millionNext season will mark Bohm's final year of team control, but I think he may have already appeared in his last game with the Phillies -- to the extent that I've taken to polling sources in other front offices on if he'll be part of the organization come Jan. 1. (Most of them say no.) He's now 29 and his track record, save for the 2024 campaign, suggests he is what he is: a league-average hitter who traffics in singles and doubles and a subpar defensive third baseman. There's a spot in a lineup for Bohm, no doubt. I just anticipate the Phillies will aim higher this offseason. Prediction: Tendered and traded\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jonathan India, OF/2B, Kansas City RoyalsArbitration estimate: $7.4 millionThe Royals acquired India last winter hoping he'd provide at least average offense near the top of their lineup. Instead, he suffered through a career-worst season that saw him end the year in a timeshare with Adam Frazier and Michael Massey. India still managed an above-average on-base percentage, but this past Rookie of the Year Award winner doesn't offer much else anymore. Prediction: Non-tendered\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Ryan Mountcastle, 1B, Baltimore OriolesArbitration estimate: $7.8 millionIt feels like the Orioles and Mountcastle have been on the verge of a divorce for most of his career. He's somehow endured to this point, just months away from beginning his walk year. I think the Orioles are, at last, going to bail one way or another. Mountcastle is a redundancy for them, a right-handed hitting first baseman, and he's coming off a career-worst showing. He'll find a home elsewhere, but I'm not convinced another team will be game to trade for him. Prediction: Non-tendered\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Gavin Lux, OF/2B, Cincinnati RedsArbitration estimate: $5 millionLux is a pure platoon bat who: 1) provides average and walks against right-handed pitching and 2) ought to always cross the street when he sees an approaching southpaw. That would make him a fine member of a competitive roster if he offered anything defensively or on the basepaths. He doesn't, and so his flaws are easier to fixate on. It doesn't help Lux's case that he's also taking up more than 5% of the Reds' payroll. That says more about their frugality than it does him. Still, the opportunity cost angle is hard to overlook in a case like this. Prediction: Non-tendered\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jesús Sánchez, OF, Houston AstrosArbitration estimate: $6.5 millionSánchez is one of the most frustrating players in the sport. He has the kind of kinetic gifts that give him middle-of-the-order potential, but he's seldom tapped into them for an extended period of time. Indeed, he's actually been a below-average bat for his big-league career. The Astros rolled the dice on Sánchez last deadline without their efforts paying off. They're in the market for offensive help and I could see them going either way: deciding that he's not worth the investment or that he's one offseason under their tutelage away from finally realizing his promise. Coin flip says the latter. Prediction: Tendered\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Luis García Jr., 2B, Washington NationalsArbitration estimate: $7 millionIt's to be seen if the Nationals' new front office comes in with a hack-and-slash mentality or if they sit back and observe before beginning their overhaul. García is probably safe for now, if I had to guess, because he's only 25 years old and he has some legitimate offensive skills -- mostly as it pertains to making contact. He's a negative defensively and his overall track record isn't impressive (he's sporting a 98 OPS+ and 3.4 Wins Above Replacement in more than 600 big-league games), but it's probably worth giving him one more season (or at least half a season) before making a move. Prediction: Tendered\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Jonah Heim, C, Texas RangersArbitration estimate: $6 millionHeim's inclusion seems silly only if you haven't updated your priors since the Rangers won the World Series. In the two seasons since, he's been a well-below-average hitter offering diminishing defensive returns. The Rangers have publicly asserted they intend to trim payroll. Heim's price tag wouldn't stand out otherwise, but the Rangers can surely find Kyle Higashioka a new dance partner for less than $6 million. Prediction: Traded or non-tendered\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Christopher Morel, OF, Tampa Bay RaysArbitration estimate: $2.6 millionWhen the Rays added Morel at the 2024 deadline in the Isaac Paredes trade with the Cubs, he was viewed as a positionless thumper who would provide power and on-base contributions at the cost of a low average. Nearly 500 plate appearances later, he's hit .208/.277/.355 (78 OPS+) with 14 home runs as a member of Tampa Bay's roster. He's still youngish (26 until late June) and even the Rays can justify $2.6 million. But I'm not sure that they should, based on his uninspiring underlying data and their roster composition, and I'm not sure that they will. Prediction: Non-tendered\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Mark Leiter Jr., RHP, New York YankeesArbitration estimate: $3 millionLeiter is a better pitcher than his bloated 4.84 ERA indicates. Need evidence? He ranked in the 92nd percentile in average exit velocity and he struck out roughly a quarter of the batters he faced. Unfortunately, that lead-in sentiment has applied for most of his career -- and that's not a good sign when you're talking about a right-handed reliever nearing his age-35 campaign. The Yankees are skilled enough at finding cheap relief arms that I think they part ways here. Prediction: Non-tendered\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NWSL Championship matchup is set, and it will be Gotham FC and the Washington Spirit next Saturday night for the title, which will take place at San Jose's PayPal Park. The match kicks off at 8 p.m. and will be broadcast on CBS and Paramount+.The last four NWSL champions -- the Orlando Pride, Gotham FC, Portland Thorns and Washington Spirit -- made it to the penultimate round of the NWSL playoffs to duke it out for the league's top prize, which set up the wild weekend that was. Gotham got a late free kick golazo from Jaedyn Shaw to top the Orlando Pride.In the first of the semifinal battles, it was the Spirit who kept their title dreams alive, winning 2-0 over the Thorns thanks to goals from Gift Monday and Croix Bethune. In an added bonus for the D.C. side, superstar Trinity Rodman returned to the field as a late substitute in the second half, marking her first minutes played since an MCL injury threatened to end her season early. Those minutes, plus however long she manages to play in the final, could mark the last time she suits up for the Spirit, as Rodman's contract winds down at the end of the season.   In the quarters, the victories were just as crazy. The Pride notched a 2-0 over the Seattle Reign in regular time, but the other three quarterfinals all went to extra time in closely contested matches. The Thorns notched a 1-0 win over the San Diego Wave, while the Spirit needed a penalty shootout to beat postseason first-timers Racing Louisville.The most stunning result of the quarterfinals, though, was Gotham's upset win over the Kansas City Current. The Current were arguably the favorites to win the NWSL Championship for the first time in club history after winning the Shield and ending the regular season with a 21-point advantage over second place. A last-gasp winner from Katie Stengel in the 121st minute, though, ensured the Current's playoff run would end as soon as it started.2025 NWSL Playoffs bracket\n2025 NWSL Playoffs scheduleAll times U.S./EasternQuarterfinalsFriday, Nov. 7Orlando Pride 1, Seattle Reign 0Saturday, Nov. 8Washington Spirit 1, Racing Louisville 1 (Spirit win on PKs, 3-1)Sunday, Nov. 9Gotham FC 2, Kansas City Current 1Portland Thorns 1, San Diego Wave 0SemifinalsSaturday, Nov. 15Washington Spirit 2, Portland Thorns 0Sunday, Nov. 16Gotham FC 1, Orlando Pride 0FinalSaturday, Nov. 22Gotham FC vs. Orlando Pride, 8 p.m. (CBS.

    "body": "\n        In the Week 11 edition of \"Monday Night Football,\" the Las Vegas Raiders play host to the Dallas Cowboys. Las Vegas is coming off an embarrassing performance against the division rival Broncos on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 10, and has now lost three in a row. The Raiders' only win since the season opener came against the lowly Titans, and they're playing more for draft positioning than anything else at this point in the season.Dallas is fresh off the bye after losing two consecutive games for the first time this season prior to the break. The Cowboys most massive moves at the trade deadline to try to propel themselves back into the playoff picture, but it's going to take a Herculean effort down the stretch for that to happen. If it's going to become a reality, it has to start on Monday night. Which of these two teams will bounce back from their latest loss? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Raiders vs. Cowboys liveDate: Monday, Nov. 17 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -3.5, O/U 49.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)When the Cowboys have the ballDallas is coming off its Week 10 bye, having put together two of its weakest offensive performances of the season against the Broncos and Cardinals prior to the break. The Cowboys had been rolling with one of the very best offenses in the NFL prior to those two contests, and they're pretty well positioned to get back on track here in Vegas. The Raiders are 24th in opponent success rate against both the run and the pass, according to TruMedia, which should allow the Cowboys to choose their own adventure as they look to attack this defense. The Cowboys also have their offensive line fully healthy now after experiencing a myriad of injury issues earlier in the year. Every lineman with the exception of right tackle Terence Steele (the weakest link in the chain) missed at least one game prior to the bye, with right guard Tyler Booker missing three and center Cooper Beebe missing six before returning for that loss to Arizona. Now at full strength, that group should be able to create similar push and provide similar protection to what it did early in the season before the injuries started piling up. Dallas has some pretty strong passing game advantages, in particular. The Raiders overhauled their secondary this offseason, and not necessarily to their benefit. Vegas checks in 23rd in EPA allowed per dropback, via TruMedia, allowing opponents to consistently create chunk gains through the air. \nThe Cowboys will line CeeDee Lamb up all over the field, but he's at his most effective in the slot, where the Raiders largely count on Jeremy Chinn and Darnay Holmes to do the coverage. They've each allowed passer ratings over 100 on their slot snaps, according to Pro Football Focus, which is obviously a recipe for disaster against Lamb. Things don't get much easier when it comes to covering George Pickens, who operates as a true \"X\" receiver and wins on all kinds of comebacks, out-breakers and especially deep balls down the field. There has arguably been no better deep receiver in the NFL this season, and Eric Stokes, Darien Porter, Kyu Blu Kelly and the safeties over the top will have their hands full when it comes to containing him on those plays. The Raiders' best hope when it comes to shutting down the Dallas passing game is obviously through getting considerable pressure on Dak Prescott, who has absolutely cooked defenses when actually afforded time to throw this season. The Raiders have one of the best pressure players in the world in Maxx Crosby, but they're still below average in pressure rate, per Tru Media, generating a sack, hit or hurry on only 32.9% of opponent dropbacks. If it's not Crosby dominating the game, it's hard to see how they'll get to Prescott on a consistent basis.\nThe Raiders have actually done some pretty good work against the run on occasion this year, and they've been especially good at limiting yards before contact (0.98 per attempt, via TruMedia). They've largely limited explosive runs as well. The Dallas run game is mostly about ripping off consistent clips of five yards or so per carry rather than creating big gains, though, and Javonte Williams will have to make sure fall forward at every opportunity to limit negatives and set up good down-and-distance situations.\n        \n            \n                New Cowboys DT Quinnen Williams 'super excited' to make Dallas debut vs. Raiders with role model Kenny Clark\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen the Raiders have the ballThe Raiders offense totally cratered last week against the Broncos, looking non-viable for almost the entire game as Geno Smith was under constant pressure and Ashton Jeanty had very little room to run. Smith limply completed 16 of 26 passes for 143 yards and an interception while taking six sacks and having to scramble three more times (on which he gained only seven yards), while Jeanty gained just over 3 yards per carry on his 19 rushing attempts. It was a gross, unacceptable performance.Luckily for Las Vegas, this Cowboys defense is very much not that Broncos defense. Dallas has been one of the worst units in the NFL all season, allowing opponents to run and/or pass almost at will. The Cowboys are 31st in success rate against the run and 28th against the pass, per TruMedia, allowing 4.8 yards per carry and an otherworldly 8.2 yards per pass attempt. \nOf course, the Dallas defense that will take the field on Monday night is also much different than the one that has been taking the field for much of the season. The Cowboys added Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson at the trade deadline, and will also get both Demarvion Overshown and rookie Shavon Revel back from injury for this game. That said, though, even Jerry Jones himself admitted that the Cowboys were not one or two players away from fixing their defense. They need every one of those reinforcements just to become a below-average unit, let alone a quality one. And it's likely that even their collective presences will not fix everything that was so wrong so far this year.The Raiders need to make sure they do a much better job than they did a week ago of getting the ball to their best player, Brock Bowers. The star tight end somehow ended the game against Denver with only three targets, mere days after he had gone off for 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns against the Jaguars. Dallas' numbers against tight ends are pretty good so far this season, but some of that is due to having played a relatively weak slate of opposing tight ends -- and Bowers at his best is really operating like more of a receiver anyway. \nThe Raiders absolutely have to line him up everywhere until they get favorable looks, then pepper him with the ball. Especially after trading away Jakobi Meyers at the deadline, they really don't have much else when it comes to weapons in the passing game. Tre Tucker has great speed and can perhaps run by one of the Dallas corners in space, but behind him in the wide receiver room are Tyler Lockett (who was cut by the Titans), Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton.The Raiders are weakened up front after the loss of Jackson Powers-Johnson to injured reserve, which could prove particularly hampering in the run game against the new-look interior of Dallas' front, which now includes Williams, Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa all together. The best path to rushing success is probably to try getting Jeanty on the perimeter, attacking Dallas' smaller edge defenders, who aren't as strong against the run as they are rushing the passer. If they can spring Jeanty to the outside, he can get up to the second level and try to make the Dallas defensive backs tackle in space. Cowboys vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nThe Raiders might be at home, but they just have too many matchup disadvantages defensively for me to think they're going to slow down the Dallas offense in the same way that the Cowboys' last two opponents did. The Dallas defense, meanwhile, may have gotten just enough reinforcements to not completely fall apart against an offense that doesn't have much going for it in the first place. Pick: Cowboys 30, Raiders 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a rollercoaster ride -- from the pre-draft process to the draft slide to the preseason injuries and demotions to waiting behind several different quarterbacks -- Shedeur Sanders finally made his NFL debut. The former Colorado star entered an NFL regular-season game for the first time in Week 11 against the Baltimore Ravens after Cleveland Browns starter Dillon Gabriel was evaluated for a concussion. The team initially deemed Gabriel questionable to return, but he did not emerge from the locker room at halftime and was eventually ruled out.Coach Kevin Stefanski said after the game that Sunday was the first time Sanders took any reps with the first-team offense. That was abundantly clear as Sanders lacked connections with his receivers and completed just four of his 16 pass attempts for 47 yards. He also threw an interception.The Browns held a 16-10 lead when they turned to Sanders but went scoreless with him under center and fell to their division rival in a 23-16 defeat.\"I don't think I played good at all,\" Sanders said after his debut. \"I think it's a lot of things we need to look at during the week and go and just get comfortable even throwing routes with Jerry (Jeudy) and throwing routes with all those guys. I think that was my first ball to him all year. But other than that, I just think overall we just gotta go next week and understand so then we have a week to prepare stuff I like to do.\"Sanders received a hero's welcome in Cleveland and immediately completed his first pass attempt, a 5-yard toss to Cedric Tillman. He also completed his second pass, a 7-yarder to David Njoku, but it was mostly downhill from there. Sanders took a sack and fumbled (though a teammate recovered the loose ball) on third down.\nSanders' interception came on his second drive.\"It was a rough day overall,\" Sanders said. \"But the thing I was excited about is just being able to get out there. It's the first time I got hit since my last game at Colorado. Just having that feeling back was good.\"\nThe Browns opened the season with Joe Flacco as their starter but traded him to the Bengals. Gabriel had started ever since. Cleveland could be onto its third starter of the year in Week 12 as Sanders lines up to take the first-team reps if Gabriel, a fellow rookie, does not clear concussion protocol in time to suit up against the Las Vegas Raiders.\"I know I'm made for it,\" Sanders said. \"I don't think there's a doubt in my mind that final drive was gonna go down there and score. Things happened, and we didn't. But I was just excited because I knew what I was going to be able to do out there.\"\nA record-setting quarterback at Colorado, Sanders slipped all the way to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, where Cleveland selected him 144th overall. He was the sixth quarterback selected and the second selected by his own team; the Browns took Gabriel in the third round (94th overall).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        I'm beginning to question the wisdom of ranking prospects by position.  Granted, I've been doing it for more than a decade now, so I know it can work. And it's certainly more useful for Fantasy purposes than ranking them by team, as is most common. But here we have yet another position that's painfully thin in the prospect arena. Third base may be the worst offender of all, in fact.  It just seems like every hitting prospect right now is either a shortstop or an outfielder. Or a catcher, I guess, but they're kind of their own category.  2026 Prospects: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | P  And sure, some of those shortstops will wind up at third base, same as second base. An organization will typically wait until the latest stage of a prospect's development to move him down the defensive spectrum, often to meet an immediate need on the major league roster. But our track record in predicting which prospects actually make that move isn't particularly strong, so I don't like to jump the gun.  I'm not so much complaining as explaining why I'll be going 20-30 deep at shortstop after having to scratch and claw for 10 names at each of the other infield positions. The imbalance is staggering, so much so that there may be only one or two of these third base prospects in my top 100 overall.  \nNote: These rankings are intended mainly for Dynasty use, emphasizing long-term value over a quick payoff, but to say proximity holds no weight wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Not all of these players will contribute in 2026 — most, in fact, will not — but among prospects, they're the names Fantasy Baseballers most need to know.       1. Jacob Reimer, Mets  Age (on opening day): 22     Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A     Minor league stats: .282 BA (444 AB), 17 HR, 15 SB, .870 OPS, 58 BB, 112 K  Reimer doesn't seem to be getting much attention in traditional prospect circles, but he reminds me a little of Sal Stewart pre-breakout, already producing on the strength of his swing decisions but with reason to believe he's just scratching the surface of his power potential. He'll have a much narrower path if he's forced to slide over to first base, but that's hardly a foregone conclusion. A .282/.379/.491 slash line would play there anyway.  \n  2. Alex Freeland, Dodgers   Age (on opening day): 24     Where he played in 2025: Triple-A majors     Minor league stats: .263 BA (415 AB), 16 HR, 18 SB, .834 OPS, 83 BB, 111 K  Major league stats: .190 BA (84 AB), 2 HR, 1 SB, .601 OPS, 11 BB, 35 K  Freeland is in a precarious spot, having already graduated to the majors but failed to make a strong impression in an organization that leaves no margin for error. While a capable shortstop, his best outcome with the Dodgers may be a utility role, having debuted as a fill-in for Max Muncy at third base. It'll be his plate discipline that carries him, buoyed by a chase rate comparable to Juan Soto, but he could also develop into a 15-homer, 15-steal type if he gets the chance.    3. Andrew Fischer, Brewers  Age (on opening day): 21     Where he played in 2025: High-A     Minor league stats: .311 BA (74 AB), 1 HR, 8 SB, .848 OPS, 11 BB, 22 K  \nThe 20th pick in the 2025 draft had only one home run in his first 19 professional games, but he had 25 in 65 games at the University of Tennessee last year, his slugging prowess representing a departure from the Brewers' usual emphasis on bat-to-ball skills. That power is fueled more by a steep launch angle than pure exit velocities, though, which presents some batting average risk. Prospect361 comps him to Rhys Hoskins, which seems fair, except that Fischer may actually stick at third base.    4. Tommy White, Athletics  Age (on opening day): 23     Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-A     Minor league stats: .275 BA (360 AB), 12 HR, 23 2B, .773 OPS, 29 BB, 54 K  The biggest knock on White is that he's likely destined for first base, where the Athletics are already overloaded and where right-handed hitters in general have a difficult time breaking in. But he can really hit, having achieved legendary status in college with the eighth-most home runs all time and having maintained a strikeout rate around 15 percent even as a professional. His muted production so far is mostly tied to spray angle, which is a common developmental hurdle.  \n  5. Deniel Ortiz, Cardinals  Age (on opening day): 21       Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A       Minor league stats: .300 BA (370 AB), 13 HR, 39 SB, .878 OPS, 67 BB, 117 K  You probably haven't heard much about Ortiz, but I'm having a hard time explaining away his production. His exit velocities are near the top of the scales, and he hits the ball at the correct angles, putting it on the ground less than one-third of the time. He works the count and is a legitimately fast runner, backing up his stolen base output. His 26 percent strikeout rate is a bit elevated for A-ball and could pose a problem as he moves up the ladder, but right now, Ortiz is something of a hidden gem.    6. Gino Groover, Diamondbacks  Age (on opening day): 23     Where he played in 2025: Double-A       Minor league stats: .309 BA (470 AB), 12 HR, .833 OPS, 63 BB, 79 K  \nWith a textbook stance and quiet setup, Gino Groover, also known as LuJames, has the look of a professional hitter whose plate discipline won't cause him any problems, but does his bat provide enough thump for him to hold down an everyday role in the majors? His modest power output in 2025 becomes more alarming when you consider that Amarillo is one of the most hitter-friendly venues at Double-A, and fittingly, he had only a .672 OPS on the road. Is he merely Wilmer Flores, or is he something more?    7. Brock Wilken, Brewers  Age (on opening day): 23       Where he played in 2025: Double-A       Minor league stats: .226 BA (270 AB), 18 HR, .876 OPS, 69 BB, 93 K  Keeping  the faith in Wilken, the 18th pick in the 2023 draft, requires a fair  amount of magical thinking, but third base has so little to offer that  we might as well have some fun with it. He tore the cover off the ball  as a newcomer in 2023, then took a fastball off the face early in 2024  and struggled with depth perception thereafter. Following an offseason  of eye therapy, he seemed be taking flight again with 18 homers and a  .942 OPS through 65 games, but then another serious injury, a dislocated  knee, scuttled him again. There's an OPS hog in waiting here, but he  needs better injury luck.  \n  8. Hao-Yu Lee, Tigers  Age (on opening day): 23     Where he played in 2025: Triple-A     Minor league stats: .243 BA (497 AB), 14 HR, 22 SB, .748 OPS, 65 BB, 121 K  The scouting reports read better than the actual stat line for Lee, but keep in mind that just a year ago, he slashed .298/.363/.488 for Double-A Erie. There are no standout skills here, but he hits the ball pretty hard, controls the strike zone pretty well, and is improving as a base-stealer. If he seizes his opportunity wherever it comes, more likely at second base, he could stick.    9. Parks Harber, Giants  Age (on opening day): 24     Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A     Minor league stats: .323 BA (291 AB), 13 HR, .970 OPS, 44 BB, 79 K  \nFailing to reach Double-A before turning 24 generally isn't a good sign for a player's development, but the Giants thought enough of Harber to make him part of the Camilo Doval haul. It could be his struggles against sliders, his defensive shortcomings, or his right-handedness that brings him down in the end, but late bloomers do exist, and Harber genuinely does hit the snot out of the ball. With the way he's performed at every stop so far (Arizona Fall League included), I'm willing to hear him out.    10. Billy Amick, Twins  Age (on opening day): 23     Where he played in 2025: Rookie, Low-A, High-A     Minor league stats: .307 BA (218 AB), 4 HR, 17 2B, .867 OPS, 33 BB, 70 K  Power was supposed to be the selling point for Amick, who the Twins took in the second round of the 2024 draft, but as you can see from the numbers, he seemed to take more of a line-drive approach in his first full pro season -- which included two lengthy IL stints, by the way. There may be a best-of-both-worlds outcome, but considering he's already 23 and has yet to play a game at Double-A, he'll need to pull it together soon.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 11 finale has the Dallas Cowboys visiting the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday Night Football at 8:15 p.m. ET. Those seeking NFL picks will likely gravitate towards Cowboys when filling out daily Fantasy lineups considering they rank fourth in scoring offense. Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens will be popular selections, but some helpful NFL DFS advice would be to not overlook Raiders players, despite Vegas having the No. 31 scoring offense.The team trading away Jakobi Meyers created a receiving void, as several under-the-radar Vegas pass catchers could bubble up to the surface. While Ashton Jeanty and Brock Bowers were likely already under consideration for your Monday Night Football DFS strategy, others could also provide an immense return on investment. Before making any NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The four-time Pro Bowler is coming off back-to-back seven-catch games and ranks sixth in the NFL with 81.8 receiving yards per game. However, if you take away the game in which he injured his ankle, playing just seven snaps and getting no targets, Lamb's 98.2 yards would rank second in the league. The Raiders have given up the sixth-most Fantasy points to opposing wideouts, so inserting Lamb into MNF DFS lineups is a no-brainer. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Raiders tight end Michael Mayer. Vegas' other tight end shouldn't be overlooked as he has standalone value even with Bowers back in the lineup. After trading away Meyers, Mayer played 37 snaps last week, as Tre Tucker was the only Raiders wideout who played more. Averaging 27 yards with one total touchdown over his last four games, all starts, Mayer is a low-cost, high-upside option for Monday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Cowboys vs. RaidersMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins on Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Cantlay and Aberg are close behind at +1700 with Cantlay at +2000. Defending champion Harris English is +4000, while Brooks Koepka is +5500 as he makes his PGA Tour return after recently leaving LIV Golf. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open 2026 picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Farmers Insurance Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Farmers Insurance Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites at +2500, stumbles and falls well out of the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Cantlay one of the best betting values this week. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend. The model is projecting a more consistent effort for him this year and has him as one of its top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open contenders as McClure says \"Cantlay is a core outright bet target this week.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Farmers Insurance Open picksThe model is targeting several other longshots, including a massive +28000 underdog who is \"the best positive EV longshot on the board.\" You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

The Patriots will square off against the Seattle Seahawks, the team that they defeated 10 years ago in one of the most exciting Super Bowls ever. Super Bowl LX will be the Patriots' 10th trip to the big game since they shocked the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. Overall, this is the Patriots' 12th trip to the Super Bowl, which is also a record. New England has a 6-5 record in Super Bowls and are 6-4 in the big game under owner Robert Kraft, who a former Patriots season ticket holder who purchased the franchise in 1994. Of those six wins, Tom Brady was named MVP a record four times. Brady won his fifth and final Super Bowl MVP after leading the Buccaneers to a win over the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV. \nBrady and the Patriots have dominated the history books this century, but other teams and players have made significant marks on pro football's grandest stage, too.

    "body": "\n        This weekend is a fantastic one if you're a boxing fan. There are several cards around the world on Saturday, culminating in an event headlined by a massive WBO junior welterweight title fight between champion Teofimo Lopez Jr. and WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson.The action will roll into Sunday, with Zuffa Boxing 02, the second edition of TKO's foray into the boxing world, which will stream live on Paramount+.With so many different fights set for the weekend, we had to zoom our focus in on those two events to identify the storylines most worth keeping an eye on.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 02 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. UFC 325 on Saturday -- plus every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night -- is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nLet's get into it.Lopez vs. Stevenson is an incredibly important fightOne doesn't have to go back too far to remember the crop of exciting fighters in the lower weight classes who were set to take over the sport. Stevenson and Lopez were among that group, along with fighters like Ryan Garcia, Gervonta Davis and Devin Haney. Boxing, operating as it so often does, produced very few matchups between those fighters as the years have ticked by. Davis seems as though he may be done with boxing, as the number of domestic violence allegations against the fighter has continued to pile up. Garcia lost to Davis and then defeated Haney, but Garcia didn't bother to make weight against Haney and failed multiple drug tests, resulting in the bout being officially overturned to a no contest as Garcia was seemingly in the deepest throes of a mental health crisis.While Lopez has displayed some of his own issues, including repeatedly claiming to be retired only to reverse course shortly after, he and Stevenson are both 28 years old and at the peak of their powers. Lopez has put in some disappointing performances against mid-tier opponents in his career, but he is a fighter who tends to fight to the level of his opposition and he'll have to be at his best against Stevenson.Likewise, Stevenson has had some terrible moments in his career. Even when handily winning fights, Stevenson has been booed for being extremely risk-averse. His 2023 fight with Edwin De Los Santos was a miserable affair, and the following year Stevenson saw fans leave the arena early despite facing Artem Harutyunyan in Stevenson's native New Jersey. Stevenson proved a major point in his most recent outing, standing toe-to-toe with William Zepeda and punishing the challenger across 12 rounds.\nNow, two elite 28-year-old fighters will face the biggest tests of their careers with the chance to further erase any lingering negative narratives and move themselves closer to the top of the pound-for-pound rankings. It doesn't get much bigger than this.\nAdames and Williams meet to claim power in a wide-open middleweight divisionThroughout boxing history, middleweight has been one of the sport's glamour divisions. That has not been the case in recent years. Janibek Alimkhanuly is the current top man at 160 pounds, holding both the IBF and WBO titles. Adames and Erislandy Lara are right behind, holding the WBA and IBF titles, respectively. Adames didn't further his status in the division in his most recent fight, a February 2025 draw with Hamzah Sheeraz, despite many observers feeling Adames deserved the decision.Williams' lone career loss came in his own fight with Sheeraz, a June 2024 TKO in Round 11. Since that loss, \"Ammo\" has rattled off three consecutive wins, including a solid victory over Patrice Volny.\nIn a division as wide-open as middleweight, this is a pivotal fight that sets the winner up in a power position moving forward, whether it's simply defending the WBA belt or seeking to unify the title with one of the other champions. In boxing, fighters have to take advantage of every opportunity to acquire power.Zuffa Boxing 02 looks to build the brand with an intriguing main eventThe first edition of Zuffa Boxing showed flashes of what things could look like moving forward for the brand. The Meta APEX had expanded seating that put the crowd on top of the action, but outside of the main card opener between Julian Rodriguez and Cain Sandoval, the action didn't really bring that atmosphere into play.On Sunday, Zuffa Boxing 02 features a former world champion in the main event, with former WBA junior welterweight champion Jose Valenzuela taking on Diego Torres. Valenzuela has had a very uneven career once he rose to title contention. Despite being a -750 favorite against Edwin De Los Santos in 2022, Valenzuela was knocked out in the third round of a shootout that saw both men hit the canvas. Valenzuela then lost to Chris Colbert by a very controversial decision before knocking Colbert out in the rematch. That set Valenzuela up for the biggest fight of his career, a split decision win over Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz to capture the WBA title. Despite a brilliant and measured performance against Cruz, Valenzuela looked out of sorts in his first title defense, losing a wide decision -- and the title -- to Gary Antuanne Russell.\nTorres has only fought outside of his native Mexico once in his career, picking up the only loss of his career against Raymond Muratalla in 2023. That loss has aged well, as Muratalla is now IBF lightweight champion. Torres has stopped his opponent in 19 of his 22 career victories.Valenzuela is in a strange place in his career, picking up the best win of his career and turning in a dismal performance one fight later. If he's on his game, Torres is exactly the kind of fighter Valenzuela usually handles comfortably, as shown by his status as a -650 favorite. However, Torres is the kind of tough Mexican power puncher who can upend things if Valenzuela isn't locked in.Serhii Bohachuk vs. Radzhab Butaev could steal the show on SundayDuring the build to Zuffa Boxing 01, I was telling everyone within earshot that Rodriguez vs. Sandoval would steal the show. Those two men did just that with a gusty brawl that showcased both men's toughness and skills. Heading into the second edition of Zuffa Boxing, the fight between Bohachuk and Butaev is poised to fill that role.\nBoth men are solid action fighters, and both have come up short in thrilling fights. In August 2024, Bohachuk dropped rising superstar Vergil Ortiz Jr. twice en route to a narrow majority decision loss. Butaev's lone loss came in a hard-fought battle with Eimantas Stanionis in 2022. In 42 combined victories, Bohachuk and Butaev have 36 stoppage victories.This middleweight bout has the potential to deliver in a big way when Bohachuk and Butaev share the ring on Sunday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama spoke out Tuesday about the recent shootings by federal officers in Minneapolis, and said that he is \"horrified\" by the \"murder of civilians.\" On Saturday, ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also in Minneapolis. Their deaths, and the broader actions of ICE and Border Patrol personnel during Operation Metro Surge, have sparked protests and outrage in Minneapolis and across the country.The 22-year-old Wembanyama spoke to reporters after practice on Tuesday. Wembanyama said the team's staff had tried to caution him about what to say on the matter, but he decided not to give a \"politically correct\" answer. At the same time, however, Wembanyama admitted that he did not want to go any more in depth because of the \"cost\" it would have. Here are the full comments from the French-born Wembanyama:\"PR has tried but I'm not gonna sit here and give some politically correct [answer],\" Wembanyama said. \"Every day I wake up and see the news and I'm horrified. It's crazy that some people make it seem like it's acceptable, like the murder of civilians is acceptable. I read the news and sometimes I'm asking very deep questions about my own life, but I'm concious also that saying everything that's on my mind would have a cost that's too great for me right now, so I'd rather not into too many details.\"\nWembanyama was then asked if the fear of repercussions for speaking their mind was weighing on him and other players. \"For sure. It's terrible,\" said Wembanyama, \"I know I'm a foreigner, I live in this country and I am concerned for sure.\"Finally, Wembanyama was asked if being a foreigner was part of his hesitance to speak more freely. \n\"For sure, for sure,\" Wembanyama said.Webanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, was recently selected to the All-Star Game for the second season in a row. He's averaged 24.2 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game in 32 appearances so far this season.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were supposed to play the Golden State Warriors Saturday, just hours after Pretti was killed, but the NBA decided to postpone the game until Sunday. The NBPA released a statement Sunday which said, in part, that players can \"no longer remain silent.\" Here is the full statement:\n\"Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent.  \"Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice. \"The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all. \"The NBPA and its members extend our deepest condolences to the families of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, just as our thoughts remain focused on the safety and well-being of all members of our community.\"Wembanyama is not the only player who has issued a strong personal statement on the matter. Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton wrote on social media, \"Alex Pretti was murdered.\" Additionally, WNBA star Breanna Stewart held up a sign that read \"Abolish ICE\" prior to an Unrivaled game on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Christmas was just over a month ago, Cincinnati Bengals running back Chase Brown has delivered a late gift to Bengals fans in the form of a message regarding quarterback Joe Burrow and his future with the franchise. Some of Burrow's comments near the end of the regular season has led to speculation about his desire to remain in Cincinnati, who is coming off a third consecutive non-playoff season. Burrow is signed through the 2029 season, but that hasn't stopped unfounded rumblings about whether or not he will seek a trade or even retire before his contract expires. Brown, however, has made it clear that Bengals fans have nothing to worry about. \"Joe's not going anywhere,\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I think that was totally blown out of proportion. It was definitely a good talking point for people. ... It gave the media a lot to talk about and probably made [Burrow's] Twitter notifications go off, but Joe's not going anywhere.\" \n\"You heard it from my wing man right there,\" added Bengals wideout Tee Higgins. Speaking of wing man, Higgins and Brown are part of Bounty's Wingman program in the run up to the Super Bowl, a game that Higgins, Burrow and the rest of the Bengals nearly won four years ago. Against the Rams in Super Bowl LVI, Higgins caught a pair of touchdown passes that included a 75-yard score on a throw from Burrow that gave the Bengals a second half lead. Cincinnati ultimately came up short in the game, however, before losing another close game to the Kansas City Chiefs in the following year's AFC title game.\nInjuries to Burrow have largely contributed to the Bengals' recent struggles. He missed the final seven games of the 2023 season after suffering a wrist injury that required surgery. This past season, Burrow missed nine games after injuring his toe in Week 2. The Bengals, who were 2-0 at the time of Burrow's injury, went just 1-8 during his absence. Burrow returned to the lineup in Week 13 and led Cincinnati to an upset win over Baltimore that kept their flickering playoff hopes alive. That hope was quickly extinguished, however, after the Bengals lost their next two games that included a 24-0 loss to the Ravens in what was arguably the worst game of Burrow's career. While their playoff hopes were dashed, Cincinnati still put together two of their most impressive performances of the season in wins over the Dolphins and Cardinals. And while their season ended with a loss to the Browns, the Bengals were nonetheless a much better team upon Burrow's return, especially on offense. \n\"We picked up some momentum at the end of the season that we can carry into this coming season,\" said Brown, who rushed for a career-high 1,019 yards this season. \"There's a lot that we went through this year. We lost our quarterback. We had multiple different quarterbacks, and that's hard on everybody on offense and definitely hard on receivers. \"When you look at the season as a whole, we went through a lot. So I look forward to having a full season with everybody. Not that that's promised, but that's what I look forward to.\"Adding insult to injury was the fact that the AFC North -- a division that had all four teams finish with a winning record in 2023 -- had an extremely down year. The Steelers (the only team the Bengals defeated during Burrow's absence) were the only team to post a winning record. Had Burrow stayed healthy, it's quite possible that the Bengals would have won the North going away. \n\"I think the main thing is we always want to be in control of our playoff hopes,\" Brown said. \"The position that we were in, we didn't have any control the last part of the season, so there were a lot of things that had to happen to go our way. It is hard to see it play out that way, though, because we know what we would have been capable of if we had made it into the playoffs.\"In addition to having Burrow and one of the NFL's best group of skill players, the Bengals also have the division's longest-tenured head coach in Zac Taylor, who was given a public vote of confidence from team owner Mike Brown this offseason. Will that stability give the Bengals an edge this season?\"I don't know if it can give us one,\" Higgins said, \"but I hope so.\"\n            ",

Michigan, with a non-conference SOS of 14th, is No. 2 in KenPom and boasts an Adjusted Efficiency Margin (+35.87) nearly 8 points higher than Nebraska. Such a gap signals a major mismatch. It’s the equivalent of a Final 4 team against a Sweet 16 squad. Michigan’s top-ranked 2-point offense and defense, while playing the seventh hardest schedule, make them a powerhouse. Nebraska is a poor offensive rebounding team (17th Big Ten, 304th nationally), limiting second-chance points. On the road against Michigan’s physicality and the Crisler Center crowd, Nebraska faces a “market correction” blowout.\n                                    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ahead of the World Cup, transfers take on a much greater importance. If you're already a starter at a club, leaving with six months to go until the tournament takes place has heightened risks and rewards. The possibility a move goes wrong and a player falls out of contention at his new club always looms, but if all goes well, and a player excels, the right move could elevate a squad player on his national team to a starting role. That's the position right back Alex Freeman hopes to find himself in. After breaking onto the United States men's national team scene, Freeman could be set to continue his meteoric rise with a move to Spanish club Villarreal, according to the Athletic. For a player who just made their first start for Orlando City SC in March of 2025 before winning the league's Young Player of the Year award in October, it's wild to consider what a difference a year makes, but Freeman has met every test in his career so far, and a move to Spain could see him compete with Sergino Dest for the starting right back role on the USMNT. With Villarreal needing to replace starting right back Juan Foyth, after the team confirmed he injured in Achilles tendon over the weekend, there's very much a chance that Freeman could end up as a starter with the club. The Yellow Sumbarine are also very familiar with MLS, as Tajon Buchanan and Tami Oluwaseyi are currently contributing to the squad.But it's far from a sure thing. Freeman will have a learning curve making the jump to Spain. While he's used to operating in attacking areas as a modern fullback, Freeman has largely been able to get by on his physical tools. As a multi-sport athlete growing up, he's been able to use that and size to his advantage in MLS, but moving abroad, work on defensive positioning and passing will need to be done. Spain is a good place to do that due to it being quite a technical league, but Freeman's physical skills will also help with that.As you can see in the chart below, which compares Freeman to other wing backs and fullbacks, his attacking production has been elite for Orlando, but his passing and defending still leave a lot of room for growth, to put it gently.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            His first start for the USMNT was facing Turkiye in a friendly in June, where Freeman had the unenviable task of tracking Kenan Yildiz in the match. While he was beaten at the start of the match, it was something that he recovered from to now be on the cusp of making the World Cup\"It was my first U.S. game, my first start, and I look up, and I have to go against the guy who has played for Juventus and has been a key player. So I feel like going into that kind of game, it was a moment where I'm like, dang, I really have to be at my best,\" Freeman said about that experience, speaking to CBS Sports in October. \"That first pass I got beaten behind, and after that I was like, 'Oh my god, it's going to be a long game,' me trying to get comfortable and find confidence in myself in that kind of game.\"For a young player, being able to go into the deep end and come out swimming is an intangible that can't always be accounted for. Some players have the tools, but when they're faced with a challenge, aren't able to rise to the occasion; that hasn't been the case for Freeman so far. Even when it comes to leaving Orlando for a move to Spain, when he left home at 16 to join the Weston FC academy, the 21-year-old is better adjusted for this move than the average young player leaving MLS.\nOf course, a move doesn't come without risk, but given Villarreal's work with MLS exports and Freeman's ability to adapt, it's a match that could work on paper if he's able to improve his game to thrive in Spain. And that's where things could get interesting because with how rapid Freeman's improvement has been, the World Cup on home soil could be a fascinating time. USMNT outlook During 2025, only two players, Diego Luna and Max Arfsten, earned more caps for the UMSNT than Freeman's 13, despite the right back making his debut for the team. He was even able to open his USMNT scoring account in a big way with a brace against Uruguay in one of the team's best performances of the year under Mauricio Pochettino. With the right back position very much unsettled heading into a critical March where the USMNT will face Belgium and Portugal, Freeman will have time to work with the squad in Villarreal and see if he can push for a starting role.With Tim Weah and Dest both playing right back or right wing back at a Champions League level for Marseille and PSV, respectively, there will be a lot for Freeman to do, especially since sitting on the bench in Spain could hurt his chances of making the World Cup squad. It's an ultimate situation of betting on yourself as a player, and for Villarreal, with the move only costing a reported $4 million up front, it's a worthwhile flier for them. With other prominent moves like Fulham chasing Ricardo Pepi, and Toronto FC after Josh Sargent, Freeman may not be the only American on the move, but he could be the one to end up in the best position to hit the ground running in Spain. This is something that could leave Pochettino with tough decisions to make moving forward, but with the USMNT looking to better their round of 16 finish at the 2022 World Cup, that's only a good thing.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama's lightning-rod decision to play Charles Bediako has made it a punching bag, and Nate Oats' crew felt the full brunt of the self-induced wrath after falling to unranked Tennessee 79-73 in front of its hard-hat-wearing, home faithful.The jeers came from everywhere, but no one was pettier than Tennessee basketball's official account, which dropped an A+ diss track.\nThis is what Oats signed up for when he ushered in a pro in Bediako, who is getting a controversial redo after he had the opportunity to stay in college in 2023 and chose to leave.\n        \n            \n                Were Alabama fans cheering Charles Bediako -- or the erosion of the NCAA?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTuesday was the original date for Bediako's preliminary injunction, but weather concerns have pushed it back (it hasn't been rescheduled yet), allowing Bediako to obtain another 10-day temporary restraining order. He will play against Missouri on Tuesday. And again in Friday's road clash against Florida. Oh, and at least one more time next Wednesday against Texas A&M. Alabama has no choice but to take the sneers and digs.\nIt will also get its revenge if Bediako is allowed to play the rest of the year.This Alabama team, if healthy, has a chance to be really, really dangerous. A year after producing two Final Four squads and the national champion, SEC does not have an elite team this season, but Alabama will have the personnel to rise above the morass of good, but flawed, programs that sit in the upper zip code of SEC basketball.It didn't show it against the Vols -- injured starting guard Aden Holloway and emerging freshman wing Amari Allen were sorely missed -- but Oats' vision with Bediako in the fold is clear. Allen and Holloway do not have significant injuries, so Alabama's rotation is not far away from looking deep and deadly.Guards: Labaron Philon, Aden Holloway, Latrell Wrightsell Jr.Wings: Amari Allen, Houston Mallette, Jalil BetheaForwards: Taylor Bol Bowen, London JemisonBigs: Aiden Sherrell, Charles Bediako, Noah WilliamsonWe already knew Alabama had elite guard play. Philon can go band-for-band with anybody in America, period, and Holloway has been better than Mark Sears with half the fanfare. We already knew Alabama had a flock of shooters. But Bediako unlocks a new lever for this club. Tennessee shot just 50% at the rim during the 25 minutes that Bediako was on the floor. It's just one game, but that's not nothing. Bediako instantly gave Alabama's offense more vertical spacing, more speed and a bit more unpredictability. \nIf Bediako gets the nod to play the rest of the year, Oats will have every tool in the holster. Alabama can play a double-big lineup of Sherrell and Bediako to confront Florida's big fellas. It can get extremely fast, extremely quickly with Philon, Holloway, Wrightsell, Allen and Bediako on the floor together to counteract a team like Texas A&M, who will press and press and press and press some more. When Alabama tangles with Arkansas next month, it could trot out Bol Bowen at the 4 next to Bediako to match up with the hyper-athletic Trevon Brazile and the silky-smooth Malique Ewin.Oats likes math, so how does this formula sound? Pro guard in Philon + pro wing in Allen + pro center in Bediako? That's a recipe that Alabama can cook with. The SEC's most dangerous team is hiding in plain sight. The imminent courtroom decision looms large. \nAll-Defense picks!Let's give some love to the best defenders at each position in college basketball. There are so many you could pick from, but I settled on these five brilliant weapons.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    G Killyan Toure, Iowa State: Toure has cooled off a smidge in conference play, but the Iowa State freshman is a pest on the ball who plays with relentless effort and will pick you up for all 94 feet. He's not perfect -- some of the off-ball defense can be an adventure -- but he's truly one of the best freshman on-ball defenders that we've seen in college basketball in recent memory. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    G Jeremy Fears Jr., Michigan State: Fears brings the clamps every night. Michigan State's sophomore point guard understands the scouting report better than almost everybody. He's seemingly always in the right place at the right time. He clearly studies his playbook and knows his opposition's sets and frequencies like the back of his hand. Michigan State's team defense is terrific (they load up the gaps better than anybody), but Fears is the unquestioned head of the snake. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Wing Miles Byrd, San Diego State: Byrd does some freaky things defensively that you just can't teach. His ability to track the ball in the air is so unique. Byrd has posted a 4.9% block rate and a 4.4% steal rate. Only five players in America are currently in that threshold. He appears out of nowhere for timely traps to rip the ball away. \nHe's an excellent secondary rim protector. No one is safe from getting their shot swatted in transition when Byrd is in the vicinity. He absolutely got hosed of a game-winning block in last week's crushing last-second loss to Grand Canyon. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    F JoJo Tugler, Houston: Only one player in college basketball has a steal rate north of 5.0 and a block rate north of 9.0: Tugler. When he defends without fouling, Tugler is a takeaway machine who can single-handedly wreck gameplans. His ability to blow up ball screens 30 feet from the rim and then sprint back and help protect the basket is utterly absurd.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Aday Mara, Michigan: Michigan has the No. 1 defense in the country when Mara is on the floor, holding opponents to just 0.91 points per possession. Opposing guards start to dip into the paint and then swerve back out to the perimeter when they see Mara down there because of his elite rim protection. When he can loom in the paint, Michigan's defense is a total headache. Opponents are shooting just 44% at the rim against Michigan when Mara is on the floor. He ranks sixth nationally in block percentage. Bracket-buster or pretender: Mid-major editionUnfortunately, there is no magic formula to determine which mid-majors will win or lose in March Madness. Matchups are everything, especially as the gap between the haves and have-nots continues to widen in college basketball. 2025's Final Four featured four No. 1 seeds. The 2026 Final Four likely won't have that -- the No. 1 seeds aren't quite as terrifying this year -- but it's shaping up to be similarly top-heavy because teams in the top-10 are putting up historic numbers and separating from the pack. Per Basket Under Review's brilliant Will Warren, the average net rating margin between 2026's best 10 teams and the rest of the sport is the widest it's ever been.Imagine earning a No. 14 seed and getting to play ... Houston in the first round. The Cougars are tracking to be a No. 3 seed per CBS Sports Bracketology. Houston currently has a +30.72 net rating on KenPom, putting it right on par with the 2022-23 UConn team that won the National Championship.\nThat giant is a No. 3 seed? Good luck and best wishes.We're hurtling towards a second straight year where teams in that Nos. 14, 15 and 16 seed range just get obliterated again and it's going to be a tall task for some of mid-majors to break through this iron-clad top shelf of squads and make a real run.So, who is real and who is fake? A fortunate draw is the obvious skeleton key for any mid-major, but understanding personnel is vital. These mid-majors need dudes now more than ever. Plus, some of these teams at the top are uber physical. The \"height, weight, speed\" gap is primed to make-or-break many outlooks for potential bracket-busters.Let's dive into five notable mid-majors who are tracking to make the Big Dance. We'll do an expansive mid-major check-in in February, but consider this an appetizer of sorts.\nThe Outlier: A mid-major with a high-major profile\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Saint Louis (19-1): Saint Louis ranks No. 1 in the country in effective field goal percentage on offense and No. 1 in the country in effective field-goal percentage on defense. That's rare air. The Billikens are a problem. Saint Louis has a legit nine-man rotation with rangy wings, speedy guards and improved interior thump. Saint Louis' combination of size, skill, defensive versatility and a boatload of shooting is terrifying. The Billikens are tracking for a No. 5 seed, so this is clearly not a typical mid-major outfit. The personnel is also different. Robbie Avila is one of the top stretch 5s in the country, and there are four former high-major players in this rotation. Coach Josh Schertz can tap a ton of different buttons to generate advantages, and there won't be a giant athleticism gap when Saint Louis plays anyone. It is different.Real deals: Not a comfy first-round opponent\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Belmont (18-3): A frequent dancer during the 2000s and 2010s, we have not seen Belmont play in an NCAA Tournament game since 2019 (it qualified for the canceled 2020 tourney). It will come down to the conference championship as always, but coach Casey Alexander has some serious pieces at his disposal in Nashville. \nBig man Drew Scharnowski is an absolute load, especially in the open floor when he gets a head of steam. He can jackhammer dunks on anybody. Forward Sam Orme and Eoin Dillon are scary floor-spacers, and trustworthy backup center Brigham Rogers rounds out one of Alexander's best-ever frontcourts. That interior two-way pop gives Belmont real staying power. It has a top-10 two-point defense supercharged with serious rim protection. That has proven to be a perfect complement to Alexander's beautifully engineered offense that generates high-quality looks at a sky-high rate year after year. Belmont needs to get senior point guard Nic McClain healthy, but there's size and shooting everywhere, especially with Tyler Lundblade, who is a born and bred net-shredder. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tulsa (17-3): These Tulsa guards are terrifying. Miles Barnstable needs about a quarter inch of space to fire, and Ade Popoola is a big, off-ball spacer whom defenses have to respect. Point guard Tylen Riley has been an utter revelation as a set-the-table, paint-touch machine who gets to the foul line at will and can hit an open trey. Forward David Green has a brilliant all-around game, and Tulsa can bring ace defender Myles Rigsby off the bench to sic on just about anybody. \nTulsa doesn't have an elite interior fortress. I worry about it against a heavy post-up team that can obliterate you on the glass, like a date with Florida in a No. 5-12 clash would be rough. But these guards are awesome, and it's an old, battle-tested team. If they can make it, look out.Not buying it (yet)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami (Ohio) (20-0): The Redhawks have terrific continuity, excellent ball movement, tons of shooting, ideal spacing and a fantastic pick-and-roll offense. I'm just hesitant about the interior defense. Top-200 opponents are shooting 63% at the rim against the Redhawks, and that's without facing a truly excellent front-line. Former Rutgers big man Antwone Woolfolk has been a revelation for the Redhawks, but if he got into foul trouble in the Big Dance, it could be a layup line. Miami (Ohio) is good, but a draw against an awesome front-line would be less than ideal.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Hawaii (15-4): The last time Hawaii made the NCAA Tournament, it knocked off No. 4 seed Cal (who had Jaylen Brown) to advance to the 2016 second round. This is the best Rainbow Warrior club in a decade, thanks to an elite interior defense. Seven-foot center Isaac Johnson — a former Oregon signee back in the day — is an intimidating shot-blocker and rim deterrent. Hawaii is able to blanket the 3-point stripe, funnel everyone towards a massive frontline and reap the rewards. Hawaii just has so much size with five guys 6-foot-8 or taller in the rotation.I just do not trust the guard play. Hawaii's top guards (Aaron Hunkin-Claytor and Hunter Erickson) both have sky-high turnover rates in pick-and-rolls. This is an old, big team that held up totally fine physically against Oregon and Arizona State, but I don't think it can win a shootout against a good high-major club.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We know the New York Knicks are interested in trading for Giannis Antetokounmpo. We can logically deduce that if the Knicks do indeed trade for Antetokounmpo, Karl-Anthony Towns, by virtue of his similarly sized max contract, would be included in the deal for financial purposes. While making a trade without Towns is technically possible, it would evaporate New York's critical wing depth. This has been the unspoken truth behind New York's season-long pursuit of Milwaukee's two-time MVP. For the Knicks to get Antetokounmpo, they almost certainly need to give up Towns.But on Monday night, Marc Stein dropped a potential bombshell. There is apparently a \"persistent belief\" among rival teams that Towns is available in trades that may not directly include Antetokounmpo. One name Stein offered as a potential Knicks target was Jrue Holiday, not only because his defense would be welcome next to Jalen Brunson, but because his presence would make New York that much more enticing for Antetokounmpo, his former New York teammate.Why would the Knicks consider trading Towns?There's a lot to unpack here. The raw concept of trading Towns, Giannis or not, does make some sense. New York's achilles heel is the poor defense it gets from its two best players. Brunson is entrenched and beloved in New York. The Knicks wouldn't trade him for pretty much anything. Towns doesn't have the same organizational capital. He's been on the team for only a year-and-a-half. Reporting from The Athletic last season indicated that New York's locker room was frustrated with Towns' defensive habits, particularly his habit of playing the wrong coverage with no explanation as to why.Interestingly, the data points to Brunson as a far bigger defensive problem than Towns. This season, lineups featuring Brunson and Towns rank in the 23rd percentile in terms of defensive efficiency, according to Cleaning the Glass. Lineups featuring Brunson and no Towns rank in the 15th, actually getting worse without him. But lineups featuring Towns and no Brunson? They rank in the 89th percentile defensively. A similar story played out last season. Knicks lineups featuring Towns and no Brunson ranked in the 77th percentile defensively, but lineups featuring both ranked in the 41st. In the playoffs, Towns on, Brunson off lineups ranked in the 99th percentile by allowing only 99.3 points per 100 possessions. Lineup data is tricky, especially in small samples. But as flawed as Towns is defensively, it certainly seems as though Brunson is more of a problem on that end of the floor.\nBut Brunson is, again, entrenched. He's also the superior offensive player, one of the best in all of basketball. And that's a key element of what's going on here. The Knicks were well aware of Towns' defensive foibles when they got him in September 2024. The theoretical tradeoff of playing Towns at center when he isn't a rim-protector is getting elite shooting out of a spot in the lineup that typically doesn't provide it. The theory of New York's roster was to be average defensively and great offensively. That just hasn't been the case, and while this isn't the only issue, it's worth noting that Towns, the self-styled \"greatest big man shooter of all time,\" just hasn't made shots at the rate New York expected after acquiring him. Last year, until Jan. 15, Towns made 44.9% of his 3s. Then it was reported that he had a bone chip in his right thumb. He shot 38.6% on 3s the rest of the regular season, 35.1% in the playoffs, and is at 36.4% this season. If Towns isn't an elite shooter, the whole bargain sort of falls apart. Towns is averaging 20.5 points per game, the second-fewest of his career. Lineups featuring Towns and Brunson are scoring in the 78th percentile league-wide. Very good. Not elite, and not enough to overcome the defensive deficiencies of the pairing.So if building a team around an elite offense and a so-so defense isn't working, a Towns trade would effectively invert that dynamic. Brunson is a defensive liability, but if the Knicks surrounded him with defensive role players (like, say, Holiday, with Mitchell Robinson starting at center), the hope is that they'd be able to build a better defense with a minimal drop off offensively. Losing Towns would hurt on that front, but the Knicks still have Brunson and they're still one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the league. The parallel here would be the Knicks in the second half of the 2023-24 season. Julius Randle got hurt in late January, leaving the Knicks with Brunson, offensive rebounding and a ragtag group of role players that ranked sixth in offense for the rest of that season.\nWhat sort of market could the Knicks expect for Towns?Things start to get tricky when you try to construct a trade. If the Knicks had any indication that Milwaukee was interested in Towns, they would hold onto him and reserve him for an Antetokounmpo trade. But common sense would indicate that a Bucks team that probably wants to pivot into some sort of rebuild (even without control of its own draft picks) probably wouldn't want a 30-year-old center on a supermax contract. If the Knicks do wind up trading Towns for something that isn't Giannis, it will probably be for one of two reasons. Either they're trying to liquidate an asset Milwaukee doesn't want to try to set up a Giannis trade later, or Giannis has been traded somewhere else, at which point, they're just looking to reshape the team in the manner described above.Either scenario would require pretty substantial interest in Towns on the market. Maybe that interest exists. But think about the trade market surrounding big-name players on max contracts this season. Trae Young was effectively traded for a cap dump in CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. It's not even clear if there is a team with expiring salaries interested in making that sort of trade for Ja Morant. Anthony Davis had a more robust market when he was healthy, but it wasn't exactly booming. Reporting indicated hesitance on Atlanta's part, for instance, to include struggling No. 1 overall pick Zaccharie Risacher in such a trade. It never seemed at any point this season that Davis was going to net, say, multiple first-round picks or impact players.No two trades are alike. Young and Morant are small point guards, an archetype quickly falling out of fashion in the modern league. Towns, obviously, is not. He's a big man, and he's a younger and more durable one than Davis. But there's a reason Knick fans quietly discussed the idea of swapping Towns for Davis when he was healthier. It's very, very difficult to build a coherent defense with a center who doesn't protect the rim. Davis does. Towns doesn't. Minnesota worked around this problem by playing Towns at power forward next to Rudy Gobert. The tradeoff there, though, is that Towns' shooting goes from a superpower at center to merely pretty valuable at power forward. He's great offensively at either position, but his highest ceiling is at center, and that might not be defensively viable.\nMore pertinent here is Towns' contract. He is currently tied as the ninth-highest paid player in the NBA. He has two years left after this one, including a $61 million team option for the 2027-28 season. The crunch of the aprons has made teams queasier than ever about adding big salaries. That's part of why Minnesota traded him when it did, and it's part of what compelled Atlanta to take so little for Young. What's happening in New York is a pretty sobering look at the limitations Towns at his salary imposes on a roster. If the Knicks don't feel they can win a championship with Towns, despite having one of the best pairs of wing defenders in the NBA in OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges and a stellar defensive center on its bench in Robinson, what hope do less talented teams have?There's never been a worse time to trade an aging, expensive veteran with flaws. That's even reflected in Antetokounmpo's market. He's one of the three or four best players in the world. Why aren't there a bevy of asset-rich teams lining up to outbid the Knicks? Because he's getting older, he's incredibly expensive and he has a playing style that doesn't seem like it would age especially well. He's so good that he's still going to generate a significant trade return. Young, Morant and Davis haven't yet. To proffer a guess, I suspect Towns would fall somewhere in between those two camps, but leaning closer to the Young-Morant-Davis camp. The thing about trade value is that it's not fixed. It doesn't matter if 28 teams aren't interested in a player if one absolutely loves him. Towns is a unique enough talent at a scarce enough position that, even if these trends scare off most of the league, there would inevitably be a few teams tantalized enough by the prospect of trading for a center that's an elite shooter that the Knicks would still be able to generate positive value.\nOK... what are the potential Towns landing spots?We start, of course, with the Trail Blazers, just because Holiday is the only player Stein cited as a possible Knicks target. The concept New York would probably prefer would be something involving Holiday and Jerami Grant, a useful wing, along with picks (Portland has a surplus). Making the money work there would involve giving up another core player, though, so it's more likely Holiday would come with Robert Williams III to replace some of the lost center minutes from Towns and Matisse Thybulle. New York would send out Guerschon Yabusele and a minimum salary as well to match money.There's a theoretical fit here for Towns. In Donovan Clingan, Portland has a rim-protecting big man similar to Gobert to protect him defensively. Portland has the fourth-highest 3-point attempt rate in the NBA... but makes the lowest percentage of its 3s in basketball. Towns introduces more shooting to a team that could use it. His presence would likely be pretty beneficial for Scoot Henderson when he eventually returns. Guards who struggle to shoot 3s tend to thrive next to bigs who can make them. Portland's defense has been up-and-down this year, but last year's success suggests there's enough here to protect Towns on that end of the floor. For now, Portland's ambitions are more modest than New York's. The Blazers are not trying to win the 2026 championship. Getting Towns as a floor-raiser to start consistently making the playoffs makes some sense.Still, this sort of trade would oppose the identity Portland has seemingly been trying to build lately. Wasn't the Holiday trade a declaration of a defensive-minded intent? Would Portland want to bring in another big man right as Clingan is starting to blossom? Especially with No. 16 overall pick Yang Hansen waiting for more minutes? That's less clear. And what sort of pick compensation could New York expect? Milwaukee's incredibly valuable future first-round picks from the Damian Lillard trade are surely off-limits. Maybe Orlando's 2028 pick, gained in the draft night trade that netted Hansen, could be available? When the Knicks traded for Towns, they gave up a first-round pick that became No. 17 overall. It's hard to imagine New York doing much better here, a pick expected to land in the middle of the first round, not a pile of valuable future picks with upside.\nFor now, I'd file Portland away under \"only for the right price.\" Little about the way they've operated under this front office suggests they'd break the bank for Towns. So who else is out there?Keep an eye on the Bulls. There's been a lot of reporting this season about Chicago wanting to emulate Indiana's roster-build from last season, with Josh Giddey as their Tyrese Haliburton. That reporting indicates that they are looking for their version of Pascal Siakam... but the shooting Myles Turner gave them at center was critical as well. Perhaps Chicago could view Towns as its long-term center, Matas Buzelis as its long-term power forward, and then try to fill in the defensive gaps with its two other slots next to Giddey in the starting lineup.The Bulls have all of their own first-round picks, plus a lottery-protected choice from Portland that could convey any time between now and 2028 (or convert into a second-rounder if it stays in the protected range all three years). Critically, Chicago also has oodles of expiring contracts New York could either take for itself or flip elsewhere for players it might want. Coby White has interest around the league. Ayo Dosunmu would fit in well with the Knicks. Nikola Vučević could give the Knicks a lower-leverage offense-first center to fill in for some of Towns' minutes, but not all of them. If Chicago wants Towns, the Bulls are probably the team with the cleanest path to getting him. It might require a third team to get New York more of the veteran help it would presumably want, but it's doable.\nWhat about New Orleans? For now, the Pelicans seem committed to keeping Zion Williamson and their roster core, but the reality around Derik Queen long-term is that he would benefit more from a center that can shoot than a front-court partner like Williamson who needs to handle the ball. The Knicks presumably wouldn't want Williamson, but he could be the outgoing salary for New Orleans in a three-team deal. If the Knicks could get Herb Jones, a defensive star on a team-friendly contract, that would likely be a best-case scenario. Of course, the messaging out of New Orleans has been that he isn't available, so it might have to be pick-centric or involve talent coming from elsewhere.So... are the Knicks going to trade Towns?My guess would be no. Remember, the Knicks move in silence. Nobody knew about the original Towns trade before it happened, or the Bridges trade for that matter. They don't leak. This chatter seems to be driven more from rival teams than New York's end, and it just seems hard to imagine the Knicks reshaping their team this drastically in the middle of the season without Antetokounmpo coming in. Even if they believe trading Towns is in their long-term interest, could a team built in February really be equipped to win in May or June? That's the goal here. After all, if Holiday is a target, he's 35. He's no spring chicken. Neither is this team. The window is now and maybe the next few years. They'd have to get a very significant return to justify the risk of making such a big in-season trade, and for the reasons we discussed, that doesn't seem especially likely.\nSo if you're looking for a prediction, I'd guess the Knicks make a move on the fringes, play out the season, and then pursue Antetokounmpo all out over the summer. If they get him, great, so long, Karl. If not? They consider a wider variety of options with the idea that they'd have a full season ahead of them to make a new roster work. Still, New York's propensity for surprise moves means that almost anything is possible. The Knicks have started to right the ship lately, but they've had Towns in the building for a year and a half at this point. They know better than we do how serious his limitations are. If they don't feel they can win it all with him, they're not going to be afraid of taking a risk in trading him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Big Ten releasing the full 2026 football schedule, teams can finally start circling the dates that will shape the conference race and influence College Football Playoff positioning. While the opponents have been known since October 2023, the order of games and the context of the new season make certain matchups especially critical. The Big Ten has dominated college football recently, winning each of the last three national championships -- including the first two under the current 12-team playoff format.Seven Big Ten teams appear in CBS Sports' way-too-early top 25, including contenders like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio State and Oregon all among the top 10. Penn State, USC, Washington round out the ranked group, with Iowa among those considered. With so many teams competing at the top level, every game between these squads carries playoff implications, making the sequencing of the schedule crucial for CFP positioning and conference supremacy.Honing in on those previously mentioned programs, these are the 10 most important Big Ten games that will impact the CFP race next season.1. Oregon at Ohio StateDate: Nov. 7 (Week 10)A potential top-five matchup that could determine which team gains the upper hand in the race to the 2026 Big Ten Championship Game — and a possible first-round bye in the CFP. Ohio State and Oregon split their two meetings in 2024, with the Ducks winning in Eugene before the Buckeyes responded with a victory in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on their way to a national championship.\nA rematch of the 2025 Big Ten Championship Game, this will mark the third meeting between Curt Cignetti and Ryan Day — and the first in Bloomington, where Indiana is 16-0 since the new era began in 2024. The Hoosiers' perfect home mark will be tested against a potentially top-ranked Ohio State team in a matchup that could again shape the Big Ten's postseason pecking order.2. Michigan at Ohio StateDate: Nov. 28 (Week 13)The last time \"The Game\" lacked significant playoff implications was 2017. In the seven meetings since, at least one side -- and often both -- has been jockeying for a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game or positioning in the CFP.Now, with Kyle Whittingham at the helm in Ann Arbor and Ryan Day having won the only head-to-head meeting between the coaches in the 2021 Rose Bowl, the stakes will again be high on a stage that could produce another top-10 showdown in the Michigan–Ohio State rivalry.\n3. Ohio State at IndianaDate: Oct. 17 (Week 7)The rematch of the 2025 Big Ten Championship Game. Although this is the third meeting between Curt Cignetti and Ryan Day, it will be the first in Bloomington, where Indiana is 16-0 since the new era began in 2024. The Hoosiers' perfect home streak will be put to the test against the potentially top-ranked Buckeyes, in another game that could impact the Big Ten's pecking order for the postseason.\n4. Michigan at OregonDate: Nov. 14 (Week 11)If Michigan wants to prove it still belongs in the top tier of the Big Ten, then surviving the hostile environment of Autzen Stadium could be a pivotal swing game in the conference standings and a defining moment for its playoff résumé. Two years ago, Oregon went into Ann Arbor and dominated the Wolverines, who have not beaten the Ducks since 1973 and have dropped the past three meetings.5. Ohio State at USCDate: Oct. 31 (Nov. 9)Talk about a helmet game. For the first time as Big Ten opponents -- and the time since 2017 -- Ohio State and USC are set to clash in Los Angeles with playoff implications potentially on the line. The Trojans could face one of the toughest schedules in the Big Ten next season, but are at least fortunate enough to get the Buckeyes at home inside the Coliseum. Historically, Ohio State is 1-4 against USC, with its lone win coming in the 2017 Cotton Bowl.\n6. Oregon at USCDate: Sept. 26 (Week 4)An old Pac-12 clash and another top-five caliber opponent awaits the Trojans. Oregon had no issues putting up points against USC in 2025, winning 42-27 in Eugene. It's up to Trojans new defensive coordinator Gary Patterson to find a way to slow Oregon's experienced attack if they hope to avoid a repeat outcome in Los Angeles.\n7. Indiana at MichiganDate: Oct. 24 (Week 8)This is the toughest road game the reigning national champions will face in 2026. Curt Cignetti has time and again broken down walls and overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges over the past two seasons at Indiana, and he'll have his sights set on another in Ann Arbor. The Hoosiers haven't won at Michigan since 1967, dropping each of their past 22 trips, but history won't stop Indiana from testing the Wolverines once again.8. USC at IndianaDate: Nov. 14 (Week 11)This matchup certainly wouldn't have been on anyone's radar when the schedules were released back in October 2023. But now, with Indiana's sudden rise to the top of college football, the first meeting against USC in 44 years puts the Trojans on the hot seat. The Hoosiers are 0-4 all-time against USC.\n9. USC at Penn StateDate: Oct. 10 (Week 6)The schedule sets up favorably for Penn State and new coach Matt Campbell, allowing the Nittany Lions to establish themselves as a CFP contender in 2026. Of the seven Big Ten teams in Brandon Marcello's way-too-early top 25, Penn State faces the fewest ranked opponents (three), and a win against USC in Happy Valley would clear a major hurdle on the path to the postseason.10. Iowa at WashingtonDate: Oct. 10 (Week 6)Both Iowa and Washington enter 2026 as sleeper CFP contenders in the Big Ten despite each facing five conference road games. That makes this head-to-head matchup pivotal in determining which team gains an edge in the postseason race, giving the winner a greater margin for error as they navigate a demanding league schedule.\n            ",

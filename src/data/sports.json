A significant reason why is that Syracuse has the No. 108 scoring defense, allowing 72.2 points per game this season. Meanwhile, Duke is averaging 82.8 ppg this season. Duke vs. Syracuse contests have gone Over this number in six of their last nine meetings, and that's a trend the model expects to continue Monday. Duke freshman Cameron Boozer is fourth in the nation in scoring at 22.2 ppg, and he'll be a problem for the Orange. The model projects the Over to hit in 73% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nDrexel (+3.5) vs. Stony Brook (-102)Drexel and Stony Brook have identical 7-6 records in CAA play this season, and the line favors Stony Brook with this contest being played on its campus on Long Island, New York. However, Drexel has split its last four road games, and it is 7-3 over its last 10 contests. Stony Brook has played in tight battles at home recently, with five of its last six home games either decided by five points or fewer or going into overtime. Drexel defeated Stony Brook, 56-37, at home in their first matchup this season, and Drexel defeated Stony Brook on the road, 67-51, last year. The model projects Drexel to cover in 83% of simulations. Back Drexel to cover at DraftKings here:Houston (+2.5) vs. Iowa State (-115)\"Houston (23-2) rides in on a six-game winning streak,\" SportsLine expert Micah Roberts said. \"The Cougars are visiting Ames, Iowa, where they will be underdogs for the first time this season against Iowa State (22-3). Houston has returned to its traditional format of controlling games with defense, staying Under the total in its last five games. Houston is now No. 2 nationally, allowing 61.3 points a game. Iowa State averages 84.2 points and shoots 50.6 percent from the field, and the Cyclones come off a beatdown of Kansas after losing at TCU. Iowa State has stayed Under the total in its last three games. This total is only 134.5, which is built on both teams' defensive trends. While the Cyclones are 14-0 at home, I bet on the Houston defense.\" Back Houston to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Now that the preliminary round of the men's hockey tournament at the 2026 Winter Olympics is complete, the playoff round is about to begin. And as expected with NHL players participating in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014, Canada and the United States are the cream of the crop in the sport.The two superpowers were the only teams to win all three of their round-robin games and received a bye, along with Slovakia and defending Olympic champions Finland, to the quarterfinals. Their opponents will be determined on Tuesday when the remaining eight nations compete in the qualification round.Top seed Canada will face the winner of the matchup between Czechia and Denmark, while a meeting with No. 2 seed Team USA is on the line when Sweden takes on Latvia. No. 3 Slovakia will battle either Germany or France, and No. 4 Finland awaits the survivor of the showdown between Switzerland and Italy.The qualification winners will have little time to recover as the quarterfinals take place Wednesday. The semifinals are scheduled for Friday, with the losers facing off for the bronze medal the following day and the winners playing for gold on Sunday.Teams will be reseeded after the quarterfinals based on the preliminary round rankings, meaning Canada and the U.S. won't clash until a medal is at stake, if at all. Considering how they breezed through their round-robin contests, it's very likely they'll be squaring off for gold.Canada is the overwhelming favorite to claim its record 10th Olympic gold medal and first since 2014 as it is priced at -140 at most major sportsbooks. Team USA is listed between +195 and +220, while no other team is priced below +1000.Below are my predictions for medals in the 2026 Winter Olympics men's hockey tournament, as well as the teams' current odds to earn a spot on the podium at DraftKings Sportsbook.

Widely regarded as the best player on the planet, Connor McDavid has not disappointed in his first Olympics as he leads the tournament with nine points. The 29-year-old captain of the Edmonton Oilers has more assists (seven) than any other player has points (six). Teammates Sidney Crosby and Macklin Celebrini both have recorded six points, along with Slovakia's Juraj Slafkovsky, while the 19-year-old Celebrini is tied with Germany's Tim Stutzle for first in the Winter Games with four goals. Crosby and defenseman Drew Doughty helped Canada win gold in 2010 and 2014 while goaltender Jordan Binnington backstopped the club to the 4 Nations Face-Off title last year. Binnington, who guided the St. Louis Blues to the Stanley Cup championship as a rookie in 2019, won both of his starts in these Olympics - including a 26-save shutout against Czechia, the Canadians' potential opponent in the quarterfinals. Canada is -140 to win the gold medal at DraftKings, and the team hasn't given me a reason to expect anything less.Get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel Sportsbook for Winter Olympics betting:Silver - United States (-350 to win a medal)Team USA also went undefeated in the preliminary round but didn't do so as convincingly as Canada. The Americans faced a bit of a scare in their 6-3 victory against Denmark as they trailed by a goal after one period and led by just one after 40 minutes. Captain Auston Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk have registered five points apiece for the U.S., with the former leading the club with three goals and all of the latter's points being assists. Three-time Vezina Trophy winner and reigning Hart Trophy recipient Connor Hellebuyck has turned aside 40 of the 42 shots he faced in these Winter Games but will be in for his toughest test yet if Sweden defeats Latvia in the qualification round as expected. Team USA would then have to record one more victory before a potential showdown with Canada for the gold medal and I just don't see it getting past McDavid, Crosby and company for its first Olympic title since 1980.Bronze - Finland (-155 to win a medal)Finland has one of the most balanced rosters in the Winter Games. All but two of Finland's 22 skaters have recorded a point in the tournament, and neither of them appeared in all three games. Eleven players have scored at least one goal and there's a four-way tie for the team lead of four points. Kaapo Kakko and Joel Armia each have netted two tallies and set up two others, while Sebastian Aho, Mikael Granlund and Joel Kiviranta also have scored twice. Juuse Saros has played every minute in goal for the Finns and has allowed a total of one goal over his last two outings. Finland's quarterfinal opponent will likely be Switzerland, which should get past an Italian squad that gave Slovakia a tough time in the preliminary round but was demolished 11-0 by the Finns in its last contest. The Finns were upset 4-1 by the Slovakians in their Olympic opener, which cost them the top seed in their group, but rebounded by defeating Sweden by the same score and trouncing Italy. Sweden and Czechia will meet the two juggernauts should they advance to the quarterfinals and while it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Swedes upset the Americans, I believe Finland and Slovakia join Canada and the U.S. in the semifinals and ultimately battle for the bronze. I'd give Saros the edge over Samuel Hlavaj in goal, meaning the Finns medal for the seventh time in the last nine Winter Olympics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n            \n    \n        Green Bay coach Doug Gottlieb went on a rant in his postgame press conference after his team's 75-72 loss at Milwaukee on Sunday. In the tirade, which lasted several uncomfortable minutes, Gottlieb slammed his fists on a table and demanded an explanation from the Horizon League after he was assessed a critical technical foul late in the second half in an eventual one-possession loss.The technical foul came with just under seven minutes remaining in the game and with his Phoenix leading 59-57. Gottlieb defended his actions from the sequence and said nothing he did was enough to warrant a technical, including refraining from cursing and not leaving his coach's box. \"I need the league to explain to me why I got a technical foul when I did not curse, I was not demonstrative, I did not leave my box,\" Gottlieb said. \"All I said was, 'That's the same play as the other end.' All we ask is that it's a fair game. That's all we ask.\"Gottlieb said his issue was not only with the technical, but also with the sequence within the game that eventually led to the technical. From his view, he saw two similar plays with two different outcomes -- both in favor of the other team -- that were officiated differently.\n\"I need Donnie [Ripley] (the Horizon League's Coordinator of Officials) and the new commissioner to explain to me the disparity in the officiating,\" Gottlieb continued. \"You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game. The exact same f****** play. The exact same play. So I need the new commissioner to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative. There was nothing that should've been called a technical foul.\"\nGreen Bay's loss snapped a three-game winning streak and dropped it to 10-7 in league play, putting a .500 finish in conference play on the table.There have been plenty of highs and lows for Green Bay this season -- including an infamous chair-tossing incident from Gottlieb after blowing a double-digit lead -- but it's hard to argue anything other than it's a marked improvement on his first year at the helm of the program. The team finished 4-28 in 2024-25 and at one point endured a 21-game losing streak from late November through mid-February.\nSunday's loss put Green Bay 2.5 games behind league-leading Wright State with three regular-season games remaining, but it's not impossible to think this team could sneak into the NCAA Tournament this year as the league's automatic berth if it wins the Horizon League tourney. Green Bay played Wright State close two weeks ago and defeated Robert Morris on the road in late January.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The divorce between 2010s NFL All-Decade Team wide receiver Tyreek Hill and the Miami Dolphins finally came to fruition Monday, as the team announced his release.Hill, who will turn 32 on March 1, was set to carry a $51.1 million cap hit in 2026 -- the final year of a three-year, $90 million extension -- which would have given him the highest cap number among non-quarterbacks this coming season. He tore his ACL in Week 4 of the 2025 season against the New York Jets in late September, meaning he likely won't return until roughly a quarter of the way through the 2026 campaign.Those two factors led the Dolphins' new regime -- head coach Jeff Hafley and general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan -- to move on before free agency opens in March. The decision leaves Miami with $28.2 million in dead money, but it also creates $22.9 million in cap savings by jettisoning Hill now.After being acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 2022 season, Hill was arguably the NFL's most dominant receiver in his first two years in South Florida. From 2022 to 2023, he led the league in receiving yards (3,509) and receiving yards per game (106.3) while ranking second in receptions (238) and third in receiving touchdowns (20). His production began to tail off in 2024, and he ended that season by saying he was \"out\" after Miami's Week 18 loss to the Jets.\nTyreek Hill's career with Dolphins2022-232024-25Games played3321Receptions238102Receiving yards per game106.3*58.3Receiving yards per reception14.712.0Receiving yards3,509*1,225Receiving touchdowns207* Led NFL While there's a lot working against Hill, he should still command a free-agent market. His 11,363 career receiving yards rank ninth-most by a player in his first 10 seasons in NFL history, and his 28 touchdowns of 50 yards or longer are the fourth-most all time. Only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice (36), three-time Pro Bowler DeSean Jackson (34) and Hall of Famer Randy Moss (29) have more.So where could Hill land in 2026? Here's a look at six potential landing spots for the five-time first-team All-Pro.\n        \n            \n                What's next for Dolphins after Tyreek Hill, Bradley Chubb releases? Tua Tagovailoa's future, new roster moves\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThis is the obvious one. The Chiefs have salary cap work to do to become compliant before the new league year begins March 11, but a reunion makes sense. Since trading Hill in 2022, Kansas City hasn't had a true No. 1 wide receiver alongside future Hall of Fame tight end Travis Kelce.Hill accounted for just over 25% of Kansas City's receiving yards in his final two seasons there (2020–21). Since his departure, Kelce leads the team at 22.7%, with wide receiver Rashee Rice second at just 10.2%.Hill and quarterback Patrick Mahomes would also be returning from ACL injuries suffered in 2025, potentially putting their timelines in sync. Hill tweeted about his intrigue regarding offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy's return to Kansas City. With Kelce possibly entering his final season in 2026, the Chiefs could reunite their championship trio for one last ride.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills If a Chiefs reunion doesn't materialize, the wide receiver-needy Bills could call their former rival to help quarterback Josh Allen. Khalil Shakir led Buffalo with just 719 receiving yards in 2025, and the team's receiver usage was unstable, with a league-high eight players logging 100-plus snaps.Like Kansas City, Buffalo must navigate cap constraints, but Allen's elite arm talent could entice both sides in a shared push for Super Bowl relevance.Hill also tweeted sympathy for the Bills following their overtime playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, so perhaps he wouldn't need much persuading to join Buffalo.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersHill to the Chargers makes sense on several levels. Financially, Los Angeles can afford it, entering the offseason with $78.6 million in effective cap space. That's second-most in the NFL, per Over the Cap.Quarterback Justin Herbert's arm strength is another draw. His 24,820 passing yards rank second-most through a player's first six seasons, trailing only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning (24,885).There's also scheme familiarity: former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel now serves as the Chargers' offensive coordinator. Hill could step into a system he already knows and produce quickly once healthy. Hill even tweeted that McDaniel's move to Los Angeles caught his attention.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersThe Raiders are primed for an offensive overhaul after hiring Super Bowl LX champion Klint Kubiak as head coach following his title run as Seattle's offensive coordinator.They also hold the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, widely expected to become Indiana national championship-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner.Las Vegas already features 2024 No. 6 pick running back Ashton Jeanty and 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, plus $76.99 million in effective cap space, third-most in the NFL.Hill would also fit Kubiak's system since the new head coach also worked as a San Francisco 49ers assistant coach under Kyle Shanahan -- just like McDaniel did before thriving with Hill in Miami. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots The Patriots won the AFC but ran out of steam in Super Bowl LX, falling behind 19-0 in an eventual 29-13 loss to Seattle. Hill could inject needed explosiveness into a receiver room led by Stefon Diggs, who is currently dealing with legal issues. After Diggs' 1,013 receiving yards and tight end Hunter Henry's 768, Kayshon Boutte ranked next among Patriots wideouts with 551 yards in 2025.Hill has shown interest in New England, tweeting his happiness after their AFC title. The Patriots also have $36.9 million in effective cap space -- 11th-most in the NFL -- and could make another win-now move while Drake Maye remains on his rookie deal.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersThe 49ers ran out of bodies in 2025, a season that ended with a 41-6 divisional-round loss in Seattle. San Francisco lost 270 player games to injury -- the most of any playoff team -- and the attrition showed in the biggest games.\nReceiver uncertainty looms, with Jauan Jennings set for free agency and Brandon Aiyuk missing in action. Brock Purdy still delivered elite efficiency, however, despite missing eight games with a turf toe injury: 58.3% of his third- and fourth-down pass attempts combined produced first downs, the highest rate in the last 35 seasons, per CBS Sports Research.San Francisco enters the offseason with $37.5 million in effective cap space (10th-most). Hill fits the team's win-now window with Christian McCaffrey still producing and Trent Williams still chasing a title. Hill played for a Shanahan acolyte in Mike McDaniel. In San Francisco, he'd play for the architect of the offensive system that helped him soar in Miami.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ilia Malinin came into the 2026 Winter Olympics as the heavy favorite to win gold in the men's figure skating competition, but after a disastrous free skate routine that included two falls and other miscues, the 21-year-old American found himself off the podium entirely. Malinin is far from the first star to struggle living up to expectations at the Olympics, as the weight of the moment can present challenges for even the most talented athletes. While Malinin won't have another chance to capture a medal at this year's games, he will skate one more time at the closing exhibition on February 21 that ends the figure skating competition. On Monday, Malinin posted a video on social media teasing a routine for that exhibition that will explore the mental battle of dealing with that kind of pressure and what he called \"an inevitable crash.\" \n\n\"On the world's biggest stage, those who appear the strongest may still be fighting invisible battles on the inside,\" wrote Malinin. \"Even your happiest memories can end up tainted by the noise. Vile online hatred attacks the mind and fear lures it into the darkness, no matter how hard you try to stay sane through the endless insurmountable pressure. It all builds up as these moments flash before your eyes, resulting in an inevitable crash. This is that version of the story.\"Malinin admitted prior to the short program that he was feeling the nerves of the moment, but went out and put together a tremendous routine that put him on top of the standings by more than five points heading into the free skate. The widespread assumption was that he'd back that up with another strong performance and run away with the gold, but he hints at mental struggles that clouded his ability to perform at the level we've grown accustomed to from the consensus best male figure skater in the world over the last three years. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn speaking with reporters after the competition, Malinin explained that he was overwhelmed with negative thoughts as he stood at center ice waiting to begin his routine. \"The nerves just went, so overwhelming,\" he said, \"and especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head. So many negative thoughts that flooded into there and I could not handle it.\"It was clear watching that Malinin wasn't his normal self from the start, as he bailing on two of his four opening quad attempts, and things spiraled from there with a pair of falls as he never got into his typical rhythm. While Malinin is a three-time world champion, the Olympic pressure was something totally foreign to the 21-year-old, and the knowledge that a four-minute skate will define the next four years of your career can be, understandably, overwhelming. \nNow the challenge for Malinin is to shake that off and continue his dominance on the ice while waiting four more years for his chance at Olympic redemption. His approach appears to be to steer into the skid and tell the story of what went wrong through his skating, which will start with Saturday's closing exhibition. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Home-field advantage can feel like a fortress some weeks and a myth the next. Entering 2026, it's clear just how rare sustained dominance at home has become. Fourteen Power Four programs (and Notre Dame) began 2025 with home win streaks of at least four games, but at season's end, only Indiana still had its streak intact.Georgia's 34-game run snapped the same weekend Washington's 22-game streak came to an end, while Alabama, Arizona State, Missouri and Oregon all reached double-digit streaks before falling. That leaves Indiana and Ole Miss as the only Power Four teams with home win streaks of at least 10 games entering 2026. The rest of the field is full of shorter streaks that developed last season, with nine Power Four teams going unbeaten at home in 2025. There were 10 Power Four teams that finished without a home loss in 2024, showing just how quickly these streaks can form and end.Here's a look at the longest active home win streaks among Power Four teams entering the 2026 season and the notable tests each will face in trying to keep those runs alive.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indiana (15)Indiana hasn't lost at home since Curt Cignetti arrived in Bloomington ahead of the 2024 season, building a 15-game run that enters 2026 as the longest active streak in the FBS. To put that in perspective, the Hoosiers went 14-17 at Memorial Stadium over the previous five years combined. Only one of the 15 wins at \"The Rock\" since has come against a ranked opponent -- and Ohio State and USC both visit this fall as teams ranked in Brandon Marcello's way-too-early top 25 for 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ole Miss (12)Pete Golding has a pretty firm runway at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium ahead of his first full season in charge. He is already 1-0 at The Grove after leading Ole Miss to a CFP first-round win in Oxford last December, pushing the Rebels' home win streak to 12 games. The real juice comes early this fall, when Lane Kiffin returns with LSU. A challenging SEC schedule includes visits from Georgia and Missouri, so the streak won't coast quietly.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas (9)The Longhorns finished unbeaten at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium for the second time in three seasons, with the only home loss in that stretch coming against Georgia in 2024. That current nine-game home win streak will be tested almost immediately in 2026 when Ohio State visits Austin in the return leg of a home-and-home. Most of the toughest games on the Longhorns' schedule are away from Austin, with Ole Miss the only other way-too-early top 25 team coming to town.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio State (8)No team in the FBS has a better home record in the 21st century than Ohio State -- 160-15 (.914). The Buckeyes rarely lose at Ohio Stadium in Columbus. So, it's no surprise they enter 2026 with one of the longest active home win streaks among the Power Four. The only teams to beat Ohio State at home in the past eight years are Michigan (twice) and Oregon, the two teams from Marcello's way-too-early top 25 that Ryan Day and the Buckeyes will host this fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas Tech (8)Texas Tech posted its first undefeated home record in 17 years, finishing flawless at Jones AT&T Stadium in 2025. Can the Red Raiders keep that streak alive in 2026? Of the next six teams just below them in Shehan Jeyarajah's way-too-early Big 12 power rankings, Texas Tech is set to host four: Arizona, Arizona State, Houston and TCU. That promises a much sterner test than 2025, when the Red Raiders faced just one opponent at home that finished with a winning record.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    BYU (7)BYU would be tied for second on this list with Ole Miss if not for a shocking home loss to Kansas at LaVell Edwards Stadium in 2024 -- the Cougars' only defeat at home over the past two seasons. In 2026, BYU faces a daunting slate at home: not only do they host a national championship contender, but they also welcome Arizona and Arizona State, two of the top five teams in the way-too-early Big 12 power rankings.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota (7)The Golden Gophers were quietly one of just nine Power Four teams to go unbeaten at home in 2025 while struggling on the road (0-5). It was the first Minnesota team to finish a season without a home loss since 1967. The 2026 slate has an early nonconference test against Mississippi State in Week 2, then the first two Big Ten home games are rivalry matchups against Iowa and Michigan. Minnesota has lost 18 straight at home to Michigan and five in a row to Iowa.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USC (7)Lincoln Riley has figured out how to win at home in the Big Ten, though road games remain a different story for the Trojans. A silver lining for 2026 is that a majority of the toughest matchups are at the LA Memorial Coliseum, giving USC a potential advantage on their own turf. That list includes Ohio State, Oregon and Washington, three teams already in Marcello's way-too-early top 25 rankings, setting up a challenging stretch that could end this current streak.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Vanderbilt (7)Vanderbilt enjoyed a magical 2025, finishing undefeated at home for the first time since 1982 and only the fourth time since 1945. But keeping that streak alive in 2026 will be a tall order, as Alabama, Ole Miss and Tennessee all come to FirstBank Stadium in Nashville. \n            ",

They have won six in a row behind freshman guard Kingston Flemings and a suffocating defense that ranks second in the country with 61.3 points per game allowed. Meanwhile, the Cyclones (22-3, 9-3) are tied for third in the Big 12. They are coming off an 18-point blowout win over Kansas on Saturday, which was their biggest victory over the Jayhawks since 1973.

The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says there's a 73% chance the teams combine for 143 points or more and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 142.5.No. 2 Houston at No. 6 Iowa StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 134.5 | Expert: Houston +2.5 (Micah Roberts)\nBecause both of these teams are known for their defenses, the offenses have been overshadowed. The Cougars rank 12th in the country in offensive rating (125.0 points per 100 possessions), according to KenPom, while the Cyclones (123.9) are 17th. Both teams feature players who can fill it up. Flemings (16.4 points per game) is on pace to break the program record for single-season scoring average by a freshman. Meanwhile, Iowa State's Milan Momcilovic leads the country in 3-point percentage (51.6). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's an 80.4% chance the teams combine for 135 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 134.5. Looking aheadChampions League: Atalanta at Borussia DortmundTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Dortmund | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 2.5 | Expert: Over 2.5 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo teams on a roll square off in the first leg of a Champions League knockout phase playoff when Borussia Dortmund and Atalanta face off at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund have won their last six matches in the Bundesliga to move into second place in the table. Atalanta, which installed Raffaele Palladino as coach midseason, have six wins and two draws over their last eight matches in Serie A. \"My belief is that with this being a two-legged playoff, Dortmund are going to press heavily at home in this first leg, knowing that playing in Italy is going to be tough,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It projects 3.3 total goals and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 2.5.Paris Saint-Germain at MonacoTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Monaco | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: PSG -188 | Expert: PSG -1 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo French sides will meet in European competition for the first time when Monaco host PSG at Stade Louis II. PSG sit in second place in the Ligue 1 table with 51 points, behind only Lens (52). Monaco are eighth with 31 points. At the end of November, Monaco stunned PSG 1-0 in a Ligue 1 match in Monaco. But the reigning league champions currently lead Ligue 1 in both goals (49) and goal differential (+30). \"PSG will be desperate for the chance to correct that abysmal 1-0 loss,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. Its simulations say the average score for this match is 3.7-0.7 and gives a strong \"A\" grade to the PSG money line (-188). \n            ",

They controlled play in the first period, but an excellent effort from Swedish goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff kept the score close. That was followed by a red, white and blue avalanche in the second period.Thanks to three goals on three shots in under three minutes, the Americans blew the game wide open and took a 5-0 lead into the third period. From there, the U.S. put it in cruise control with the final in sight.\nThis blowout win over Sweden was a team effort for the U.S. as five different players found the back of the net and 13 different players registered a point. The only two players to find the scoresheet multiple times were Hannah Bilka and Abbey Murphy. The former tallied two assists, and the latter notched one goal and one helper.The Americans have simply been a runaway train in these Olympics, and they haven't allowed a goal since the second period of their opening game against Finland. The U.S. has strung together five consecutive shutouts and has outscored its opponents 31-1 in this tournament.Team USA can finish off one of the most dominant runs in Olympic history in the gold medal game against rival Canada on Thursday afternoon.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0Semifinal\nMonday, Feb. 16: USA 5, Sweden 0Gold medal gameUSA vs. Canada | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Two months from now, when Cathy Engelbert walks to the podium to announce the No. 1 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft, she may call Azzi Fudd's name. At the very least, Fudd is set to become the latest UConn star selected in the lottery. Fudd arrived in Storrs in 2021 as the No. 1 overall recruit in her class, but has not had an easy road to this point. She suffered a devastating knee injury during high school that required multiple surgeries to repair a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee, then played just 42 games in her first three seasons at UConn due to an array of injuries, including another torn ACL in her right knee. Over the last two seasons, Fudd has finally gotten healthy, which has allowed her to show why she was so highly regarded as a prospect. She was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player last season after helping the Huskies win their first national championship since 2016, then decided to use her extra year of eligibility to return to school and further develop her game. Through 27 appearances this season, Fudd is averaging 17.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.4 steals on 49.5/46.3/94.9 shooting splits for the 27-0 Huskies, who are ranked No. 1 in the country and have a real chance to pull off another undefeated season. \nAfter 14 consecutive wins by at least 30 points, the Huskies ran into a bit of trouble on Saturday afternoon in front of a sold-out crowd at the Al McGuire Center on Marquette's campus. The Golden Eagles jumped in front early, and the game was tied in the middle of the second quarter. Fudd, who finished with a game-high 25 points and four steals, helped lead a 16-4 run to close the half, however, and the Huskies held on for a 71-56 win -- their third-closest contest this season. I was lucky enough to sit courtside for the Valentine's Day matchup, and spent the afternoon focused solely on Fudd, who didn't come out until 2:30 remaining, when the game was finally in hand. Here are my observations from watching one of the top prospects in this year's draft class from a unique vantage point. DefenseFudd is largely discussed as an offensive prospect, and for good reason, but the biggest thing that stood out from watching her in person was her defense, particularly off the ball. \nUConn was switching just about everything in the halfcourt, and Fudd often made sure she took whoever was in the weakside corner. That allowed her to remain on the backline and act as a roamer to help shut off the middle of the floor. She was excellent in this role. She was constantly scanning the floor and talking to her teammates. Her awareness of what was happening in front of her, and her timing on when to help, was almost always on point. Time and again, Fudd was in the right place to deny a pass, force a more difficult shot or create a turnover. \nBecause of UConn's switching tactic, there were times Fudd found herself matched up against bigger players, such as Halle Vice or Skylar Forbes. She never shrank from the challenge. While the 5-foot-11 Fudd isn't the biggest guard, she's not small either. Most importantly, she's willing to fight in those situations when she has to, and smart enough to know when she should get out of there. \nOne possession in the third quarter stood out, when Fudd got switched onto the 6-foot-3 Forbes, who tried to bury her in the post. Fudd fought to get in front of her and denied an easy entry pass. As Vice hesitated and swung the ball to the opposite wing, Fudd immediately yelled \"Sarah! Sarah!\" and coordinated a switch with Sarah Strong. Fudd scrammed out to the wing with high hands, which forced Kennedi Perkins to throw something of a lob down into Forbes. Strong was able to read the pass and pick it off. \nFundamentals are often an offensive conversation, but Fudd was so sound defensively. She constantly had her head on a swivel and played with active hands. Even something as basic as the way she slid her feet in UConn's full-court press was flawless. Fudd finished with four steals, one short of her season-high, and took two of them coast-to-coast for layups. \n\"She's putting herself in positions to do that, as opposed to previous years, I think she was very cautious. She played the game cautiously on defense,\" Geno Auriemma said after the game. \"If I would say there's one thing that I'm glad we're seeing, is her ability off the ball to be in the right spot at the right time and to have the confidence to go for it and not worry about what happens if I'm not successful. It's been like that all year, and it's great when you have someone that's that kind of offensive player that's willing to play like that on the other end.\"ShootingFudd's shooting prowess is no secret. She's a 42.3% career 3-point shooter and is making a career-high 46.3% of her attempts this season. Fudd's textbook form is a big part of her success. Pre-game warm-ups provided an opportunity to watch her release over and over in a less chaotic environment than a game, and it was incredible to see up close. Here are a few stills from a video I shot. It doesn't get better than this. \nFudd's perfect form It was also interesting to see how repeatable Fudd's shot was. It looks the same every single time, which is a testament to the work that she's put in, and really translates to game action. Of course, Fudd's lightning-quick release is another aspect of her success. It's one thing to watch on TV, it was another to see it in person from courtside. The speed with which she's able to catch, square herself and fire -- again, with the same, perfect form every time -- is really remarkable. The dismay from Marquette on a few of her 3s was palpable. Finally, it was fun to watch Fudd read and react to the defense. She did a great job of using screens and relocating to create space for herself. Her first 3 of the day was a perfect example. She faked a cut toward the basket, which got Jordan Meulemans to take one step the wrong way, then sprinted into a hand-off with Jana El Alfy. Instead of curling around El Alfy, she stopped right behind her and was wide open. \nOn-ball creationIf there's a clear area of improvement for Fudd, it's her on-ball creation. She is one of the best shooting prospects of all time, but remains largely an off-ball threat. Against Marquette, Fudd did not initiate UConn's offense except on occasion in transition. She generally started in the corner and utilized screens and cuts to get open. While she was willing to put the ball on the deck when the Golden Eagles ran her off the line, she was almost exclusively looking for one- or two-dribble pull-ups. Her form remains impeccable on those attempts, but she's clearly not as comfortable shooting off the dribble. Against Marquette, she was 2 of 7 on pull-up 2s and 0 of 2 on pull-up 3s. \n\"Definitely something I could have been better at today,\" Fudd said about her self-created offense after the win. Notably, Fudd finished with zero assists, and on two of the rare times she went to the basket in the halfcourt, she was rejected by Forbes. Though still an excellent lateral athlete despite the knee injuries, Fudd isn't an explosive vertical athlete and often tried to finish with underhand scoop layups. Fan reactionFinally, just a note about the incredible fan support Fudd and UConn received. When I arrived a few hours before tip-off, there were already hundreds of fans lined up waiting to get in, most of them sporting UConn gear. There were plenty of Fudd jerseys and shirts, and multiple \"Fudd Around and Find Out\" signs. Again, the game was in Milwaukee, not Storrs. \nPost-game, when Fudd sat at the announcer's table doing an interview with FS1, dozens of fans immediately flocked to that side of the bleachers just to take pictures and selfies in her presence. When she eventually walked to the locker room, the screams were deafening. UConn and Fudd's popularity is not a surprise at this point, but Saturday's game felt different from even their previous trips to Milwaukee. Whichever team drafts Fudd be acquiring a massive fanbase in addition to a great player. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For a league that has been trying to buy meaning through $300 million checks to Jon Rahm (or what some believe could be $500 million) and Bryson DeChambeau, LIV Golf found the essence of it without a swoop of a pen on Sunday when Anthony Kim was triumphant over the two aforementioned stars in Adelaide, Australia.The win represented the completion of a long-efforted comeback for the 40-year-old, who had become a Bigfoot-like figure in the game over the last decade plus. Any picture of Kim posted online swirled the rumor mill as stories of his whereabouts and lore only enlarged the three-time PGA Tour winner's legend.Admitting to battling alcohol and drug addiction while recovering from multiple injuries and dealing with personal demons during his time away from the professional game, Kim reached the lowest of lows just years after reaching the peak of his powers.Kim was a U.S. Ryder Cup hero, a major champion in waiting and someone who many believed could carry the torch once Tiger Woods stepped aside.\nWhile grand designs of Kim becoming that heir apparent never materialized, a return inside the ropes did in 2024 when the American agreed to play on LIV Golf as an individual wildcard. Gone were the days of his buzzcut and bedazzled belt buckle; now, memories of the past were replaced by the joys of fatherhood.Despite LIV Golf still being labeled a closed shop, Kim managed to walk through that crack. Yes, he was given a golden ticket into the league, and he did not do much with it initially -- Kim was unable to register a single point across two seasons -- but it still achieved a purpose.Kim teeing it up again reignited a competitive fire that was on full display in Australia. You saw it through fist pump after fist pump as he threw birdie after birdie down the throats of Rahm and DeChambeau. In one of the more pressure-packed moments of any golfer's career -- qualifying school, if you want to draw a parallel to LIV Golf's promotions event -- he came through and earned not only his victory but also his spot in the league.\nThat would not have been possible without change, both from Kim himself and the league which he calls home.LIV Golf made two modifications this offseason, the effects of which are now apparent. It added a spot in the promotions event, moving the qualifying cut-off to the top three players. Kim finished LIV Golf promotions at 5 under -- one stroke behind Bjorn Hellgren and six strokes behind Richard Lee, who earned medalist honors -- two strokes clear of those who tied for fourth place. Any year prior, Kim would have been left on the outside looking in.The league also decided to expand its tournaments to 72 holes from 54 holes, the length it had run its first four seasons and named the entire league after (LIV in Roman numerals). Kim sat in third place after 54 holes, five strokes behind Rahm and DeChambeau -- respectable, for sure, but not the winner's circle.\nThis is proof that making changes when a situation necessitates it can have a significant trickle-down effect. You may not notice it the first day, the first month or the first year, but it compounds in the background as life marches on. What matters is that you stick with them, even when the results are not there from the onset.Kim is the personification of change, and it may have taken him 12 years to get back to golf and 16 years to reenter the winner's circle, but the jubilation he and the golf world shared Sunday is impossible to put a price on\n            ",

That doesn't mean Judge is content with his game. Rather, he's looking to add a new dimension this year.\"Baserunning's on my mind this year a lot,\" Judge told reporters on Monday. \"I saw a lot of guys around the league with 40, 30 bases that you don't usually normally expect to be running that much. Especially with how the game's changed with the pickoffs and the pitch clock, I think that's one way we can utilize, or, at least, I can utilize some of my skills a little bit more, getting into scoring position.\"With the lineup we have, this was probably the best offense in all of baseball last year. If I can find a way to get myself in scoring position, if they're going to walk me or do something, then some good things are going to happen.\"\nTo Judge's point, 17 different players swiped at least 30 bases in 2025. That group included the likes of Juan Soto (38) and Josh Naylor (30), neither of whom fits the conventional picture of a high-volume thief. In fact, Soto and Naylor both finished in the 13th percentile or worse in Statcast's sprint speed, suggesting their steals were the products of their smarts -- and their leveraging of the aforementioned pickoff limit and pitch clock rules -- instead of their wheels. Judge, for comparison, ranked in the 42nd percentile in that measure, which helps to explain why he's been a legitimate center-field option for the Yankees in the past despite his size.\nJudge, 33, has never stolen more than 16 bases in a single campaign despite succeeding at around a 75% clip. The key matter for the Yankees is whether or not the additional value he'd provide in running more often would be worth the downside of increasing his injury risk. Given how much Judge produces at the plate (he's hit .312/.445/.674 and averaged 49 home runs over the last three years), the Yankees can be excused if they decide by Opening Day to give him the red light just as often as in the past.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe second year pf the new format of the UEFA Champions League, brought plenty of chaos on the final day of the league phase as 18 matches kicked off at the same time. Storylines can get muddled along the way during a jam-packed period of action but one stood out above the rest, fully embodying the drama of the day.Real Madrid started the day well-positioned to finish in the top eight and book a direct spot in the round of 16, a favorable match against a Benfica team who were poised for elimination awaiting them. The script fully flipped, though -- Benfica came out with an improbable 4-2 win, rounded out by a red card for Real Madrid's Raul Asencio and the final goal of the game coming from shot-stopper Anatoliy Trubin. Benfica, coached by ex-Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, snuck their way into the knockout phase playoffs while Los Blancos were doomed to play another two games in the hopes of booking a spot in the last 16.It makes for an unusual but perfect set-up for a rematch three weeks later, a painful reward for Benfica despite their hard work and a golden opportunity for Real Madrid to fully put that Matchday 8 defeat behind them.How to watch Benfica vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 16 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio da Luz -- Lisbon, PortugalLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Benfica +280; Draw +290; Real Madrid -115Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

We will play the first leg with our heads, with ambition and confidence. We know what we did to the kings of the Champions League … Real Madrid is Real Madrid, with history, knowledge, ambition. The only comparable thing is that we are two giants. Beyond that, there is nothing else. But football has this power and we can win.\"The circumstances could see Mourinho change his approach from the teams' last meeting, too. Benfica were more forward-thinking than usual in their win over Los Blancos, in large part because they simply needed to score to even have a shot at advancing, but the calculus is usually different over a two-legged tie. A team can attempt to grind the opponent down in an attempt to lock their attack out, something Mourinho teams have done time and time again. Benfica's attack-focused approach on Matchday 8 was atypical to their Champions League experiences since Mourinho took over after a Matchday 1 loss to Qarabag – they performed well above their average of 14.1 shots per game and 1.5 expected goals, instead taking 22 shots and generating 3.01 expected goals. Even with the 3-2 defeat to Qarabag factored in, Benfica are a solid defensive side – they have conceded just 10.1 nonpenalty expected goals against in eight games.The question, then, is if this imperfect version of Real Madrid can find a way to break through a tough defense. Even in a season full of ups and downs, it feels hard to bet against the Spanish giants. They rank inside the Champions League's top five for goals with 21 and expected goals with 18.99, their sheer ability to score papering over a handful of cracks. That is especially true since Xabi Alonso's January ouster as the coach, his mission to build a more balanced Real Madrid abandoned despite the progress he made. Since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge, Los Blancos have fully switched to a strategy in which Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior share the field at the same time, kicking the can down the road on the longstanding question about the pair's compatibility.Both in Spain and in Europe, Real Madrid's inherent attacking might is enough to survive their own inconsistencies and notch enough wins to keep them in the conversation for silverware. Mbappe himself is on pace for a career-best season with 39 goals across all competitions so far, while Vinicius has delivered since Arbeloa took charge with four goals and two assists in his last seven matches. Individually, the pair are a cheat code as Los Blancos continue to sort through their issues and will be enough of a challenge for Benfica's defense over the next week and change.The team, though, has received a boost in the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who notched his first start since December in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday. He will provide some attacking balance for a team that is at times overly reliant on Mbappe, already providing a preview of what's to come with an assist over the weekend. The England international is a uniquely creative player as a right back, though his range of passing and positional awareness means he can kickstart an attack from just about every area of the pitch.For all their flaws, Real Madrid have a perfect opportunity to put a sizable loss behind them, even if they are still unwilling to answer the big problems that plague their squad – and their pursuit of trophies, for that matter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        In a roster move that has long been expected, the Miami Dolphins have released wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The move, announced by the team on Monday, comes ahead of contract guarantees that take effect during the 2026 season. Hill suffered a devastating, season-ending knee injury in September and is expected to miss much of the offseason in recovery.Hill's extension signed last offseason was worth $90 million, with a final year cap hit of nearly $52 million. It was mostly served to increase the average annual salary mark that is used as the most common metric for ranking player salaries.\"The 2026 contract year has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary, including $11 million in guaranteed salary if Hill is on the roster on the third day of the 2026 league year,\" CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones wrote earlier this offseason. \"A $5 million roster bonus is due on the same day, meaning that the Dolphins would guarantee Hill $16 million if he's on the roster come March 14. Because the final year was mostly cosmetic, the final year of the contract did not include money that would guarantee in the event of injury.\"Hill's fourth season in Miami ended with 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown, this coming after his production in 2024 was the lowest of his career.\nThe Dolphins hired Jeff Hafley as their new coach in January, moving on from Mike McDaniel. By releasing Hill before June 1, the Dolphins take a $28.2 million dead cap hit in 2026.Hill, 31, recently said in an interview with People that he is walking without a brace. Hill, who in September was accused several domestic violence-related incidents by his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has not hinted at retirement despite the injury and off-the-field items.\n\"My focus right now is just playing ball and spending time with my kids and just doing what I'm best at: providing for my family,\" Hill said at the time. \"So all the noise, I feel like if you allow that kind of stuff to get in the way of what you're trying to do, it can only cloud what you're really trying to get accomplished.\"\n            \n    ",

The U.S. women's national team player delivered a stunning equalizer against Racing Louisville FC, which snatched a critical point in a 2-2 draw and ensured Gotham's place in the 2025 NWSL postseason. Lavelle scored the goal off a dead-ball situation. Gotham earned a free kick in a dangerous spot in the final third, and the veteran midfielder took her place over the mark. She struck the ball with her left for a clinical finish, showing off equal parts technical brilliance and sheer will. \nShe showed her veteran presence in a big moment and only needed a little step to get behind a sensational effort. The goalkeeper was frozen for just a moment, perhaps wondering if Lavelle would go far post, and that little hesitation gave the American star enough time to curl the ball over the wall and into the goal.\nWith the draw, Gotham are on 36 points and are currently the seven seed ahead of the final day of the regular season on Nov. 2. Thanks to conceding that late goal, the dropped points leave Louisville in the eighth spot, ahead of the last game with the North Carolina Courage two points back.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to contract extensions for two of their rising young stars. Portland has locked up fourth-year guard Shaedon Sharpe on a four-year, $90 million extension and agreed to a four-year, $82 million deal for third-year forward Toumani Camara, per ESPN. Without reaching a deal by the Oct. 20 deadline, Sharpe would have been slated to enter restricted free agency next summer. Now he's under contract with Portland through the 2029-30 season. Camara, meanwhile, had a team option for the 2026-27 season, but is also now on a deal with the Blazers that will take him through 2029-30.Both Sharpe and Camara are vital pieces of Portland's rebuild. Sharpe, 22, was the seventh pick in the 2022 draft by the Blazers despite not playing a game at Kentucky. He quickly showed his potential by averaging 9.9 points on 47.2% shooting as a rookie. By his third season, he emerged as a starter and averaged 18.5 points as part of Portland's young, developing core. Sharpe's a hyper athletic guard who is dangerous when he gets downhill, and is improving as a facilitator, though there's still plenty of room to grow in that regard. If Sharpe improves his 3-point efficiency (33% shooter in three seasons), then he'll open up even more aspects of his offensive skillet as someone who can be a threat at all three levels. And being able to learn from guards like Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard will only help Sharpe improve as a scorer and defender.\n\n        \n            \n                The Conversation: Are the Blazers ready to level up after interesting offseason?\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBy reaching a deal, Sharpe avoided a restricted free agency situation next summer, something that went poorly for a number of players this offseason -- primarily Jonathan Kuminga, who played a long game of chicken with the Golden State Warriors before eventually ending his standoff by signing a two-year $45 million deal.Sharpe's new contract with Portland comes on the heels of the Sacramento Kings giving Keegan Murray -- the No. 4 pick in the same draft -- $140 million over five years. Sharpe's been the more productive player in terms of counting stats, but Murray's been an integral piece on a playoff team already, something Sharpe has yet to prove. While Sharpe's deal is not as lucrative as Murray's, it's a solid middle ground for a player who has the potential to outplay his contract in the near future.Camara, 25, is the perfect example of a diamond in the rough, as he was taken with the 52nd pick in the 2023 draft by the Phoenix Suns and then traded to Portland before his rookie season started. In just two seasons, he's developed into an everyday starter and last season earned All-Defensive Second Team honors. He's the ideal 3-and-D piece capable of defending both forward positions, and is a reliable 3-point threat, making 37.5% of his shots from beyond the arc last season. He also ranked ninth in total steals.\nBoth extensions could be steals for Portland as Sharpe and Camara will likely outplay their contracts if they continue to ascend. Sharpe specifically could turn into an All-Star if he continues to develop. And if players like Camara and Deni Avdija stay on an upward trajectory, the Blazers could be a sneaky play-in squad this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 7 has had no shortage of major storylines so far: After Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals outdueled Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers to kick off this week's schedule, a couple of other surprising teams stole the spotlight, including the Cleveland Browns against the sinking Miami Dolphins.Some results were fairly predictable, like Mike Vrabel leading a decisive win over his old team, the Tennessee Titans, thanks to another crisp performance from quarterback Drake Maye. Others were a bit more eye-opening, like the Los Angeles Rams laying waste to the Jacksonville Jaguars overseas, despite the latter entering the international contest with a promising 4-2 record. And then there were the literal no-contest matchups, like the Kansas City Chiefs blanking the rival Las Vegas Raiders in a 31-0 shutout.Which players, coaches and teams were the biggest winners (and losers) of Week 7? Here are our top picks for the most noteworthy standouts of Sunday's matchups, for both better and worse:Winner: Bo NixDown 19 points in the fourth quarter? No worries. Nix has built a reputation as a late-game fighter, and it showed up in a big way on Sunday, when the New York Giants looked poised to run away with a road upset against his Denver Broncos. The second-year quarterback led five straight scoring drives and totaled four of his own touchdowns to fuel the Broncos' massive comeback.\nLoser: Brian DabollThe embattled Giants coach may be best friends with hotshot rookie Jaxson Dart, but his seat may heat up after his squad surrendered 33 points in the fourth quarter of a would-be win over Denver. His handpicked emergency kicker, Jude McAtamney, missed two extra points. And it can be hard to overcome the kind of gut punch the locker room will feel after an \"L\" like this.Winner: Brian SchottenheimerWhy aren't we talking more about what this guy's doing -- or at least enjoying -- at the helm of the Dallas Cowboys? America's Team may still lack a playoff-caliber defense, but Dak Prescott has been slinging it like MVP material for most of the year. That continued against the rival Washington Commanders, with Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens all making splash plays.Loser: The CommandersSunday was a double whammy for Washington. Not only did Dan Quinn's team, which finished 2024 on the doorstep of the Super Bowl, look increasingly old and slow playing catch-up with the Cowboys, but star quarterback Jayden Daniels also left with a hamstring injury. That's Daniels' second significant injury of the year, and we're not even to the midway point of 2025 just yet.\nWinner: Andy ReidReid's Chiefs looked like they might finally be returning to title-caliber form in a prime-time rout of the Detroit Lions in Week 6. Everything finally clicked against the Raiders, though, with Patrick Mahomes greatly benefiting from the 2025 debut of Rashee Rice. The formerly suspended wide receiver showed up with seven catches and two scores to balance out Reid's offensive arsenal.Loser: Tua TagovailoaEach week has basically been a new low for the Miami Dolphins quarterback, both on and off the field. Fresh off a public apology for implying his teammates were slacking off in the building, Tagovailoa tossed three picks in a hapless blowout loss to none other than the Cleveland Browns. Back-breaking turnovers have been his 2025 calling card.Winner: Matthew StaffordNo Puka Nacua? No problem for the Los Angeles Rams quarterback, who gave London a show for the ages despite rainy conditions against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Stafford may be 37, but he slung it like he was 27 on the international stage, tossing five scores, including three to Davante Adams. He also felt zero pressure, getting elite defensive support to the tune of seven sacks.\nLoser: Aaron GlennLook, we're not going to sit here and suggest all rebuilds are effective overnight; Glenn's old team, the Detroit Lions, endured lots of bumps before emerging as a real contender. But after Sunday's ugly 13-6 loss to the Carolina Panthers, in which he finally benched Justin Fields despite repeatedly assuring reporters he would not, Glenn became the first Jets coach to ever start 0-7.Winner: The Eagles' passing gamePhiladelphia produced some scarily erratic passing work in a two-game skid prior to Sunday, especially considering the wealth of talent in their lineup. Up against Brian Flores' exotic Minnesota Vikings defense, however, Jalen Hurts really settled in, distributing one timely dart after another to both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. They enjoyed their most fluid aerial attack in a long time.Loser: The TitansWas Tennessee right to move on from Mike Vrabel after the 2023 season? You can still make that case. But there's no denying Vrabel finds himself in a much better place than his former organization. Making their first appearance under the interim direction of Mike McCoy, the Titans once again lost the ball with rookie Cam Ward under center, gifting an easy win to Vrabel's Patriots.\nWinner: Ben JohnsonThe Chicago Bears aren't necessarily winning pretty. But any Chi-Town resident would've signed up for a 4-2 start in a heartbeat. Even with quarterback Caleb Williams posting a so-so stat line against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, Johnson kept the ground game churning through both D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, while his defensive guru, Dennis Allen, also showed up.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The month of October is starting to near its end and the days are getting shorter. With fall in full swing, the NFL is starting to figure out which teams are going to be buyers and sellers for the trade deadline in a few weeks -- based on the results on the field. The early Sunday slate didn't have much drama, but the late games saved the day. The Miami Dolphins were blown out by the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets lost again. The Los Angeles Rams look like Super Bowl contenders while the Philadelphia Eagles went back to their winning ways. The Kansas City Chiefs also look the part of a title team (again). Plenty of storylines mean plenty of overreactions. Which ones have merit and which are truly overreactions? The early games provided the punch. Brian Daboll should lose his job over Giants collapseOverreaction or reality: RealitySomehow, the Giants lost to the Broncos. Somehow it happened. The Broncos were trailing 19-0 entering the fourth quarter, and scored 33 points in the final 15 minutes! The Giants were up 26-8 with six minutes to go, and still allowed 25 points and lost! \nThis is one of the most incredible comebacks in NFL history, as Bo Nix combined for four touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had 291 yards of offense in the fourth quarter, making this one of the all-time collapses in NFL history -- and the Giants took the lead in the final minute! Daboll is an offensive coach, but he hired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen. He also employs Jude McAtamney, who missed two extra points in this one. The Giants just have a losing culture under Daboll, and that was on full display in this epic meltdown. Jaxson Dart shouldn't save Daboll because he's a good quarterback. If anything, that's another reason to move on. \nCommanders are the worst team in the NFC EastOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThis is a product of having the oldest roster in the NFL and a defense that's ranked 27th in yards per game in 23rd in points allowed per game. The Commanders defense was horrendous against the cowboys, as CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens dominated an overmatched secondary in a Dallas blowout. The Cowboys may have the most explosive offense in football, but that doesn't take away from the narrative. If Jayden Daniels, who left with an injured hamstring, is out an extended period of time, the Commanders may finish last in this division. They don't have a chance at the playoffs without Daniels, especially since Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel just can't stay healthy. This is an old team that won a lot of games at the buzzer last year. That recipe is hard to sustain and the talent level is showing. The Eagles and Cowboys are better than the Commanders, and the Giants may be better, too, with Jaxson Dart as quarterback. \nWashington will probably miss the playoffs and finish with a losing record. Colts are the best team in the AFC Overreaction or reality: RealityRight now, this isn't a debate. The Colts have the best record in the conference at 6-1 and steamrolled the Chargers in a battle of division leaders heading into Week 7. Indianapolis jumped out to a 23-3 lead and never looked back, completely outmatching Los Angeles. Jonathan Taylor rushed for three touchdowns and doesn't even need to carry Daniel Jones, who threw for two scores himself and finished with a 113.4 passer rating. The Colts looked like their season could be heading for disaster going to Jones in August, but instead have emerged as the best team in the conference through seven weeks.Indianapolis has the No. 2 offense in yards per game (380.3), No. 1 in yards per play (6.4), and No. 1 in offensive points per game (32.1). This is arguably the best offense in the NFL, as the Colts appear to be cruising to the AFC South title. \nAre the Colts Super Bowl contenders? That will be determined when the schedule gets tougher, but they are the best team in the AFC through seven weeks. Tua Tagovailoa's time with the Dolphins is over Overreaction or reality: OverreactionThere's little explanation for how poor Tua Tagovailoa was on Sunday against the Browns defense, as the Dolphins QB looked completely overmatched until he was removed from the game for Quinn Ewers. He was 12 of 23 for 100 yards with three interceptions and a 24.1 passer rating, the third Dolphins quarterback since 1970 with three interceptions in back-to-back games -- and the first since Dan Marino in 1986. The Dolphins couldn't get anything going offensively, as Tagovailoa averaged 4.3 yards per attempt. Tagovailoa has 11 touchdowns to 10 interceptions and is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt with an 82.8 rating. He's struggled without Tyreek Hill and a poor offensive line.\nWithout Hill, Tagovailoa has six interceptions and a 69.2 rating in three games. Perhaps the Dolphins are thinking a change is needed, which would mean the end of Tagovailoa in Miami. While that isn't likely the case, the Dolphins moving on may be in the conversation -- but it's too soon to move on (and Tagovailoa has three years left on his $1212.4 million extension).The Dolphins won't bench Tagovailoa and eat that money, giving him an opportunity to rebound with a new coach in place first. \n        \n            \n                Cover 32: Jets officially on 0-17 watch after Justin Fields benching, plus games balls and gaffes from Week 7\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEagles have their offense fixedOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Eagles offense took a significant step in the right direction on Sunday, as Jalen Hurts and the passing offense had their best game in years. Hurts finished 19 of 23 for 326 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, posting a 158.3 passer rating against the NFL's No. 1 pass defense. \nHurts went 4 of 4 for 189 yards on throws of 25-plus air yards, as the Eagles finally got the deep ball going. A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith each had two catches on those throws and combined for 54 yards after the catch. Hurts was 9 of 12 for 284 yards and three touchdowns on passes of 10-plus air yards -- good for a 156.3 rating and 23.7 yards per attempt. On third and fourth down, Hurts went 7 of 8 for 145 yards and a touchdown (158.3 rating). In the second half, he was 10 of 12 for 240 yards and two touchdowns.The offense is back right? The run game still struggled, having just 23 carries for 45 yards (2.0 yards per carry) as Saquon Barkley finished with only 44 yards and 2.4 yards per carry. Barkley has 369 yards rushing through seven games and is averaging 3.3 yards per carry. The communication isn't there up front and Barkley has struggled to have big gains. If the pass offense can get the running game going, the Eagles will be dangerous. The unit wasn't perfect on Sunday, but this was a step in the right direction. \nTrevor Lawrence is a bust Overreaction or reality: OverreactionThere's a lot to criticize about Trevor Lawrence's performance on Sunday, as he finished just 23 of 48 for 296 yards with a touchdown and zero interceptions (74.7 rating) in Jacksonville's blowout loss. Lawrence's numbers should have been worse, as he was 7 of 12 for 111 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter -- when the Jaguars were down four scores. Lawrence struggles to get the ball to his receivers, as Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. were open multiple times throughout the afternoon. When he forces the ball to Thomas, Hunter is open -- and vice versa. Hunter should be significantly better on offense, but Lawrence's inconsistent play at quarterback holds him back.While Lawrence hasn't played like a No. 1 pick in his five years, does that mean he's a bust? Not necessarily, as Lawrence has already been through three play callers, three head coaches, and an unstable organization in his five seasons. He's still learning Grant Udinski's offense, but the early returns haven't been promising. \nLawrence is a starting quarterback in the league and he'll have a long career, but he's not elite. Calling Lawrence good is a reach too, but that doesn't mean he's a bust. Rashee Rice is going to get Patrick Mahomes his third MVPOverreaction or reality: RealityPatrick Mahomes has been on fire in recent weeks, and only got his best wideout back in Rashee Rice after the wide receiver finished serving his six-game suspension. All Rice did in his first game back was have two touchdowns, as Mahomes finished 26 of 35 for 266 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions (126.6 rating) in a shutout of the Raiders. Rice was targeted 10 times by Mahomes in his debut, as Mahomes had a 117.5 passer rating when throwing to him. Mahomes has been hot of late, completing 71.3% of his passes for 1,131 yards with 11 touchdowns to one interception and a 117.2 passer rating over his last four games -- MVP-type numbers.\nThe Chiefs are 4-3 and making their run at the AFC West after an 0-2 start, and Mahomes has been the driving force. If Mahomes keep playing like this, he'll win the MVP as the Chiefs make a run at the Super Bowl again. With Rice back, Mahomes' play will only improve.Drake Maye is having best season for QB in Patriots historyOverreaction or reality: OverreactionDrake Maye had another incredible performance in Sunday's win over the Titans, finishing 21 of 23 for 222 yards with two touchdowns and zero interceptions for a 135.9 passer rating -- setting a Patriots single-game record by completing 91.3% of his passes. This season, Maye has made his own MVP case as the Patriots lead the AFC East at 5-2. He's completed 75.2% of his passes for 1,744 yards with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions for a 116.4 passer rating. He has the third-highest completion percentage through seven games in NFL history (75.2%) and his 116.4 rating is the highest for any Patriots player since Tom Brady in 2007.Is this the best season ever by a Patriots quarterback? No, but it's in the conversation. Brady threw 50 touchdowns and had a 117.2 passer rating in 2007, as the Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season. He led the NFL in completion percentage (68.6%), passing yards (4,806), passing touchdowns (50), and passer rating (117.2) -- one of the greatest seasons by a quarterback ever. For Maye to even be in the conversation is impressive. If the Patriots didn't have Brady for 20 years, this would be the best year for any quarterback in franchise history. Remember, Maye is just in his second year.Matthew Stafford is a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterbackOverreaction or reality: RealityAnother game for Matthew Stafford, another standout performance. Stafford was dominant against the Jaguars defense in London, setting an international-game record with five touchdown passes in the convincing Rams victory. He finished 21 of 33 for 182 yards and five touchdown passes with zero interceptions -- a 117.7 passer rating.Stafford is having one of his best seasons at age 37, having 17 touchdown passes to just two interceptions through seven games. He was leading the NFL in passing yards entering Week 7 and his touchdown-to-interception ratio is 32 touchdown passes to just three interceptions over his last 16 games started (including playoffs).Already with a Super Bowl championship (and the most touchdown passes in a season with 60, including postseason), Stafford is ninth all time in passing yards (61,675) and ninth in passing touchdowns (394). As the numbers keep going up and the wins keep coming with Los Angeles, Stafford has solidified his Hall of Fame case. He may be a first-ballot Hall of Famer as well.\n            ",

The former first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2012 NFL Draft played seven NFL seasons prior to his career ending after a brief stint with the Oakland Raiders.Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012 before playing in only 17 games over his next two years with the Buccaneers. Martin's resurgence was notable in 2015 when he posted an All-Pro and Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for 1,402 yards. \nThat offseason, Tampa Bay signed Martin to a five-year, $35 million contract extension. Martin struggled thereafter for the NFC South franchise, including a suspension for violation of the league's substance abuse policy that caused him to miss multiple games at the end of the year. The suspension came amid Martin being benched while the Buccaneers were making a playoff push during the 2016 season. The Buccaneers released Martin after the 2017 season and he later signed with the Raiders to back up Marshawn Lynch.Known for his bruising style at 5-feet-9 and 225 pounds, Martin starred at Boise State and earned the nickname \"Muscle Hamster\" during his time on the blue turf. \nPrior to Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty's career, Martin was considered one of the top ballcarriers in program history after ranking third all-time at the school with 43 rushing touchdowns and 48 total touchdowns, fifth with 3,431 rushing yards and sixth with 617 rushing attempts.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Drake Maye wasn't going to let Mike Vrabel off the hook. Just as Vrabel was finishing his postgame speech, his quarterback stepped in to make sure he was properly honored after the Patriots recorded a 31-13 win over the Titans, who fired Vrabel after going 6-11 in 2023. \"One sec,\" Maye said while patting Vrabel's chest. \"Coach Vrabel, we love playing for you. Glad you're our head coach. We love you, coach.\"The two then embraced with Maye giving Vrabel the game ball. \nVrabel went 54-45 with three playoff appearances and two AFC South titles during his six years coaching the Titans. After he was let go, Vrabel spent the 2024 season with the Browns as a coaching and personnel consultant before being brought on to coach the Patriots, the team he won three Super Bowls with as a player during the 2000s. \nVrabel, who was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame two years ago, has led the Patriots to a surprising 5-2 start. On Sunday, the Patriots won their fourth straight game by playing complementary football. On offense, New England ran for 175 yards and a score while also receiving a near flawless performance by Maye, who went 21 of 23 for 222 yards with two touchdowns and no picks. Defensively, the Patriots forced two turnovers and did not allow a point during the second half after initially falling behind 10-3.While Sunday was an impressive performance, Vrabel feels that the Patriots' best ball is still ahead of them. \"There's so much better football that we can play,\" he told his team following Sunday's game. \"It's close. But you kept taking care of business.\"\nWhile Vrabel and the Patriots are ascending, the Titans are mired in a lost season. Tennessee is now 1-6 and will play the remainder of the season without coach Brian Callahan, who was fired last Monday. Mike McCoy is serving as Tennessee's interim coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The winless New York Jets made a change at quarterback during halftime of their eventual 13-6 loss to the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, as Aaron Glenn benched Justin Fields in favor of veteran signal-caller Tyrod Taylor. Fields completed 6 of 12 passes for just 46 yards, and rushed for 22 yards before being benched. Taylor didn't fare much better, as the 36-year-old completed 10 of 22 passes for 126 yards, and also threw two interceptions in the loss.\"Listen, we needed a spark,\" Glenn told reporters of the change after the game. \"At that time I felt like it was the right time to do it. Obviously it was a tough situation for both of those guys, but it was my call. It was my call and I felt it was the right time to do it.\"Glenn wouldn't commit to Fields or Taylor as his starting quarterback moving forward. The Jets, who fell to 0-7 with the loss, head on the road to face the Cincinnati Bengals next week.\n\"I'm not ready to sit here and say what's going to happen next week with our quarterbacks, but I will say this: That's something I have to look at,\" Glenn said.This new quarterback controversy comes one week after Fields registered minus-10 net passing yards in the Jets' London loss to the Denver Broncos. In that matchup, New York's offense recorded just 82 total yards.Glenn admitted to reporters earlier this week that Fields took a \"step back\" during the loss to the Broncos, but was not ready to bench him. \n\"I thought about this a lot last night. I thought about the question that was asked. When you look at what Justin did the games that he played,\" Glenn said. \"I didn't think he was bad at all. I actually thought he did some pretty good things in those four games, and this fifth game, he took a step back. And I'm with you guys 100%, and we can't have that. We have to get better than that. And he knows that. He knows that better than anyone. I don't think you just try to bench a player after having one true bad game, because I thought the other games he played fairly well.\"After spending last season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets that included $30 million guaranteed. In the first five games of the season, Fields completed 65% of his passes for 799 yards (159.8 passing yards per game), four touchdowns and zero interceptions. Taylor is in his second season with the Jets. A sixth-round pick out of Virginia Tech in 2011, Taylor has also played for the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and New York Giants. He owns a 28-29-1 record as a starter.\nThe Jets entered Sunday averaging 279.8 total yards per game, which ranked fourth-worst in the NFL, and 144.2 passing yards per game, which ranked dead last in the NFL. Glenn is the first Jets coach to ever begin his tenure 0-7, and he's clearly looking for a stabilizing force under center that can get this offense on the right track. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the Fantasy Football season brought some new players to the forefont with breakout performances that belong on your Fantasy Football radar now. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 7, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 8 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Oronde Gadsden II, TE, ChargersAfter breaking out in Week 6, I was surprised to see Gadsden still available in so many leagues even leading up to Week 7 Sunday kickoffs. I can understand the hesitation considering how many options are available to Justin Herbert in the pass game, but Gadsden is quickly proving to be one of their best. Gadsden provides Herbert a mismatch as he can be matched up against linebackers in man coverage. With defenses focused on stopping the top-three trio of Chargers receivers, Gadsden has found a way to shine with a quarterback who is willing to go through his full progression and get past his first and second reads. Gadsden turned his Week 6 breakout into an even bigger one in Week 7 when he went off for six receptions, 156 receiving yards and a touchdown on eight targets. He will be the top priority waiver addition at any position this week.Xavier Legette, WR, PanthersLegette showed signs of developing as Bryce Young's No. 2 target in Carolina's Week 7 win. He turned 11 targets into nine receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. He is starting to develop as a strong option for Young in the red zone but in Week 7 he showed he can be more than that. Legette played a key role as a chain mover and turned double-digit targets into nine receptions and nearly 100 yards. That's someone worth rostering as attrition continues and bye weeks make those FLEX decisions much harder. Kyle Monangai, RB, BearsThe Bears came out of the bye last week and showed some signs of getting their rookie back more involved. That continued in Week 7. Monangai saw 13 rushing attempts and turned them into 81 yards and a touchdown. He also saw three targets in the pass game, catching two of them for 13 yards. Monangai is worth rostering as a handcuff but is quickly proving to be a capable back-end FLEX option when the Bears have a positive gamescript in the matchup ahead and 2. \nBrashard Smith, RB, ChiefsWhen the Chiefs drafted Smith -- the former collegiate wide out turned running back -- their director of player personnel made it clear that Andy Reid envisioned a role for him early on. The Chiefs are paying up on that promise already not even halfway through the season. Smith's role has grown in each passing week and in Week 7 he saw a career high 14 rushing attempts. Smith's value will come mostly via the pass game where he turned five targets into five receptions for 42 receiving yards. Smith is a priority add in all PPR leagues.Chimere Dike, WR, TitansDike was the first receiver the Titans drafted this past May after drafting Cam Ward, but he fell behind on the depth chart this offseason. However, he offers an over-the-top type speed that fits Ward's arm talent. With Calvin Ridley out, Dike got his opportunity in Week 7 and turned four receptions into 70 yards and a touchdown. Daniel Bellinger, TE, Giants Bellinger helped kickstart the Giants pass game in Week 7 and finished with 88 yards receiving and a touchdown on three receptions. Bellinger came inches away from hauling in his second touchdown pass later that game. With the Giants dealing with so many injuries on the receiver front, Bellinger could emerge as a favorite target for Dart. \nJoe Flacco, QB, BengalsThis Flacco-Bengals thing sure looks it's going to work out. Flacco lit the Steelers up for 342 passing yards and three touchdowns in Week 7. Flacco should be added in all leagues where you need quarterback help. In the right matchup, he can easily find himself as a top-12 option given the receivers he has to work with, the way the Bengals call their offense, and the state of the Bengals defense. \n            ",

The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year got sacked by Shemar James, fumbled and went to the ground holding the back of his right leg. After limping off the field, he went into the blue medical tent, and then he jogged off the field and down the tunnel.He was initially ruled questionable to return, and Marcus Mariota took over on the ensuing drive. Daniels was later ruled out. After the game, coach Dan Quinn said Daniels will undergo an MRI on his hamstring Monday. Quinn also said Daniels wanted to re-enter the game.\nDaniels has already missed two games this season due to the knee sprain he suffered in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, though that injury was to his left leg. He has been wearing a brace on that knee ever since.Mariota started both games Daniels missed earlier this year and played well, throwing for a touchdown and running for another in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders and throwing for two more touchdowns in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons.\nWashington, now 3-4, was already without its three top wide receivers -- Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel and Noah Brown -- entering the game and has been hit hard by injuries on both sides of the ball this season.\n            \n    ",

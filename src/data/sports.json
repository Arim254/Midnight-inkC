    "body": "\n        Three 2025-26 college football bowl games in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP first round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, as Michael Van Buren Jr. will make the start. Those four TDs are the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-3.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

Lemon is the No. 3 wide receiver in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and viewed as a potential first-round pick this spring.\"USC will forever hold a special place in my heart,\" Lemon wrote in his announcement. \"I'm a Los Angeles native, and the opportunity to play this game in the city that raised me was something I envisioned long before it became reality. Competing in front of my family, friends, and community made this experience even more meaningful, and I'll always be proud to have represented this university and this city. \"After careful thought and prayer, l've decided to take the next step in my journey.

He won the Biletnikoff Award, which honors the nation's top wide receiver, over Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith and UConn's Skyler Bell. Lemon caught at least one touchdown pass in eight games this season as USC went 9-3. During his three-year college career, Lemon registered 137 catches for 2,008 yards and 14 touchdowns. \nUSC, No. 16 in the final College Football Playoff rankings, is scheduled to play TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. Lemon is not expected to play. Lemon's NFL Draft stockLemon is the No. 17 overall prospect in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. However, he could go higher in the draft than his ranking. CBS Sports draft analyst Blake Brockermeyer mocked Lemon at No. 13 to the Carolina Panthers earlier this week.\"Lemon plays with a defensive mentality at the catch point and brings a competitive edge,\" Brockermeyer wrote. \"He's a problem in the slot due to his ability to create separation and make plays after the catch.\"\nAnother analyst, Josh Edwards, mocked Lemon at No. 20 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\"D.K. Metcalf is locked in with Pittsburgh long-term, but the team has been searching for a complimentary skillset,\" Edwards wrote. \"Makai Lemon is that predominant slot player, who can make plays in space and create yards after the catch.\"Impact on USCLemon's announcement shouldn't come as a shock to Lincoln Riley's team. Lemon is expected to compete with Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson and Ohio State's Carnell Tate for WR1 in this class after having a standout junior season. Lemon isn't the only star wide receiver from USC declaring for the NFL Draft, as Ja'Kobi Lane already announced his intention to enter the draft.\nWhile USC will have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season (Lemon, Lane and tight end Lake McRee), star quarterback Jayden Maiava is returning to school for the 2026 season. At receiver, Tanook Hines is a name to keep an eye on for an expanded role next season. He enters the bowl 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns. USC, which finished with the No. 1-ranked recruiting class in the 247Sports rankings for the class of 2026, should enter next season -- Year 5 for Riley -- with major expectations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As Michigan conducts an investigation into its own athletic department in the wake of the firing of football coach Sherrone Moore, the school is willing to \"act swiftly\" if new findings warrant more terminations. Interim university president Domenico Grasso shared that sentiment -- and laid out the requirements for the next football coach -- in a video statement on Wednesday.Michigan has enlisted the services of Chicago-based law firm Jenner & Block to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire athletic department. A source described the probe to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello as \"open-ended\" to the point that the university is unsure what it might uncover.If it does produce evidence of misconduct, Grasso said the school won't hesitate to act.\"We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that conduct like this does not happen again,\" Grasso said. \"Make no mistake. We will leave no stone unturned, and any further action we take will be based on credible evidence and findings, developed through a rigorous investigation. If the university learns of information through this investigation or otherwise that warrants a termination of any employee, we will act swiftly, just as we did in the case of Coach Moore.\"Grasso said the scope of the Jenner & Block investigation has been expanded to include \"an independent evaluation of culture, conduct and procedures throughout our athletics department.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan board authorizes expanded probe into athletic department after Sherrone Moore firing\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore was fired for having an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and now faces three charges, including felony home invasion, for allegedly \"unlawfully entering the victim's residence\" after his firing. With the Wolverines now exploring their options on the coaching market, Grasso said the next coach must have high \"moral character\" in addition to being a \"fierce competitor.\"\"As we conduct our search for the next head football coach, we intend to hire an individual who can and will instill that spirit and who will represent the highest values that our university holds dear,\" Grasso said. \"We will hire an individual of the highest moral character and who will serve as a role model and respected leader for the whole football program and who will, with dignity and integrity, be a fierce competitor.\"\nBiff Poggi is currently serving as the interim coach and will be in that role at least through the Citrus Bowl against Texas on Dec. 31. Poggi is considered a potential bridge option for the Wolverines in 2026 if other potential candidates like Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Washington's Jedd Fisch and Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham opt to stick with their current schools. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears have expanded their search for a new stadium site beyond the state of Illinois. In a letter sent to fans Wednesday, Bears president Kevin Warren said Northwest Indiana is among the locations the franchise will explore to build a new domed stadium.The franchise has spent several years searching for a location for a new home after more than 50 years playing at Chicago's Soldier Field. Initially, the Bears had hoped to build the stadium in the northwestern Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. The franchise purchased the site in 2023, but Warren said in his letter that Illinois state leaders have told him the project is not a priority for 2026. The Bears did not ask for taxpayer dollars to build the stadium, but wanted an infrastructure commitment for roads and utilities. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 16 NFL picks: Seahawks top Rams on 'TNF,' Packers edge Bears, Jaguars upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Stable  timelines are critical, as are predictable processes and elected   leaders, who share a sense of urgency and appreciation for public   partnership that projects with this level of impact require,\" Warren wrote. \"We have not   received that sense of urgency or appreciation to date. We have been   told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in   2026, despite the benefits it will bring to Illinois.\"Warren's solution: a potential move to Northwest Indiana. The Indiana border is approximately 15 miles from Soldier Field, but having the team not only play outside the city of Chicago, but outside the state of Illinois altogether would be a controversial move.\n\"Consequently,  in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our  search and  critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider  Chicagoland  region, including Northwest Indiana,\" the letter continued. \"This is not about  leverage. We  spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. We  invested  significant time and resources evaluating multiple sites and  rationally  decided on Arlington Heights. Our fans deserve a world-class  stadium.  Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the  championship  standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our  organization  must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that  future.\"Warren had hoped to finalize the Arlington Heights stadium's construction plans in September, so they could bid for a Super Bowl by 2031. \nThe Bears, whose lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, are in the midst of their best season since going 12-4 in 2018. At 10-4, the Bears are in first place in the NFC North and have a chance to gain some separation in a massive divisional showdown with the Green Bay Packers (9-4-1) at Soldier Field on Saturday night. \n            ",

Napoli vs. AC Milan will open the semifinal action, while Inter vs. Bologna will follow on Friday, as the 16th matchday of the Serie A season will feature only six fixtures this weekend. Here's all you need to know about the 2025 edition of the Supercoppa Italiana: Which teams are involved? There are four teams involved in the final four of the Supercoppa, a format that started off in 2023 when it was introduced for the first time in Italy and hosted by Saudi Arabia:Napoli: 2024-25 Serie A winnersBologna: 2024-25 Coppa Italia winnersInter: 2024-25 Serie A runners-upAC Milan: 2024-25 Coppa Italia runners-upHow to watch Napoli vs. AC Milan, oddsDate: Thursday, Dec. 18 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: King Saud University Stadium -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli +180; Draw +200; AC Milan +170How to watch Bologna vs. Inter, oddsDate: Friday, Dec. 19 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: King Saud University Stadium -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Bologna +480; Draw +280; Inter -170When is the final taking place? The final will take place on Monday, Dec 22, at 2 p.m. ET on Paramount+.Who won last year? \nLast year's edition saw an incredible comeback from AC Milan, who won the Supercoppa Italiana final 3-2 against Inter after an intense second half, where they scored three goals to defeat the side then coached by Simone Inzaghi, which managed to go up 2-0 shortly after halftime. Tammy Abraham's winning goal during stoppage time gave then-Rossoneri manager Sergio Conceicao his first trophy at the club, seven days after he replaced Paulo Fonseca on the bench of the Italian giants ahead of the tournament. Team newsThere is some major news ahead of the Supercoppa Italiana final four as Romelu Lukaku was included in the Napoli squad travelling to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday by manager Antonio Conte. The Belgian striker suffered a muscular injury on Aug.16 that prevented him from playing the first months of the 2025-26 season and Napoli were forced to sign another striker in the last days of the summer transfer window, when they signed Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United on loan with an obligation to buy for $70 million. Lukaku is unlikely to play the semifinal against AC Milan but this is a first sign he's coming back soon. \nElsewhere, Inter right wing-back Denzel Dumfries has undergone surgery on his ankle injury and will be sidelined for at least three months, with a return expected in March. The decision to proceed with surgery was made in agreement with the club, which is now likely to sign another winger during the winter transfer window. This move also comes amid awareness of Dumfries' $25 million release clause, set to become active in the summer of 2026 and potentially attractive to several European clubs. Something similar is about to happen for Mexican striker Santiago Gimenez, who will undergo surgery this week and will miss at least two months of action. AC Milan are also likely to sign a striker in the January transfer window, regardless of what happens with Gimenez.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Micah Parsons' season-ending knee injury is a catastrophic blow for the Green Bay Packers, defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley feels that brighter days are ahead for both Green Bay and its talented pass rusher. In fact, Hafley made a very bold proclamation Wednesday, predicting that the 2026 season will be a historic one for Parsons, who prior to his injury became the first player in NFL history to record at least 12.5 sacks in each of his first five seasons. \"If I were a betting man, I would bet that he comes back even better and probably breaks the sack record next year,\" Hafley told reporters Wednesday. \"So I'm going to put that on Micah and myself. You guys can put it out there, and that's the confidence I have in him.\" The single-season sack record of 22.5 is currently held by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt -- but potentially not for long. Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett is just one sack away from tying the record this season and has three games left to break it. Garrett said his goal is to finish the season with 25 sacks, so Parsons is going to have his hands full to prove his defensive coordinator right.\n\n        \n            \n                Micah Parsons to have ACL surgery: How Green Bay will try to replace star pass rusher\n                \n                    JP Acosta                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRecord aside, it's clear that Parsons has made a quick impression on Hafley after he was traded from the Dallas Cowboys just prior to the start of the season. Parsons has made an impact on the field as well with Green Bay's defense currently ranking eighth in the NFL in points allowed. In 14 games, Parsons put up 12.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, 12 tackles for loss and 26 quarterback hits. During a recent three-game span, Parsons tallied six sacks as Green Bay won each game after an underwhelming 5-3-1 start. \"He's a guy that came in here, literally, like three days before we played a game,\" Hafley said. \"Quickly developed a really good relationship with him. ... I just have so much respect for the guy.\"\nWhile Hafley has high hopes for Parsons in 2026, he is also confident that his defense can continue to have success this season, starting with Sunday's pivotal road game against the Chicago Bears -- a matchup with major playoff implications. \"We've got really good players. We've played good defense and we're going to continue to play good defense,\" Hafley said. \"Our guys understand that and I think it's important for everyone to understand that these guys have a lot of pride and they're going to get even closer because of this. And they're going to play well. \"Our best players are going to step up. And the guys who haven't played a lot, that's been our job all year is to develop those guys so in situations like this, they're going to step up. We're going to play hard and we're going to coach hard and we're going to do everything we can to win. That's my take on all this. This is press on, full speed ahead and we're ready to go.\"\n            ",

Fenway Sports Group (FSG) is selling the franchise to the Chicago-based Hoffmann family investment group, per NHL insider Frank Seravalli.The sale price is $1.7 billion, according to Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet. That comes in exactly where Sportico valued the Penguins at the start of the season, which was a 16% increase from the previous year.FSG, which is led by co-founder John Henry, just purchased the Penguins back in 2021 when it struck a deal with the former ownership group led by franchise legend Mario Lemieux. Back in July, The Athletic reported that Lemieux was \"very interested\" in regaining his controlling stake in the team. However, that bid apparently fell short as FSG accepted the Hoffmann family bid.\n\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Can the Wild's acquisition of Quinn Hughes shake up the West's power balance?\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough it is selling the Penguins, FSG still owns some of the biggest brands in international sports, including the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool and Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing.David Hoffmann is the founder and chairman of the Hoffman Family of Companies, and this is not the group's first foray into hockey. The investment company also owns the Florida Everblades of the ECHL, as well as Hertz Arena, where the Everblades play in Estero, Florida.\nThis sale comes when the Penguins are in a period of transition on the ice. In 2023, the team's streak of 16 straight postseason appearances came to an end, and Pittsburgh hasn't returned to the playoffs since. Franchise legends like Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang are in the twilight of their careers, and the Penguins may soon be forced to usher in an entirely new era as they slip out of the playoff picture this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Following his team's 128-125 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets, Ime Udoka took aim at the officials. The Houston Rockets coach had some strong words for the referees in that contest, and it cost him a pretty penny.The NBA announced Wednesday that it fined Udoka $25,000 for \"public criticism\" of the officiating. That may seem like a lot, but Udoka did get his money's worth after a key loss that had a notable impact on the Western Conference standings. He certainly didn't hesitate to torch the crew of Zach Zarba (crew chief), Natalie Sago and JD Ralls.\"Just in general, I think as poorly officiated a game I've seen in a long time,\" Udoka said. \"Two have no business being out there and the crew chief was acting star struck. So, you're seeing all kinds of inconsistent calls and I'm sure we should've gotten a few more techs.\"The win kept Denver in second in the West, while the loss dropped Houston all the way to the fifth spot in the extremely competitive top of the standings. \nThere were a number of calls during the game that Udoka wasn't pleased with, but the most controversial one came in the closing seconds when Amen Thompson got called for a foul after he and Tim Hardaway Jr. got their legs tangled up. Udoka challenged the call, thinking surely it'd be overturned on review for incidental contact, but Zarba upheld the foul, citing contact between Thompson's shin and Hardaway's leg that caused him to go to the ground. \nThat gave Denver one free throw and the ball in a one-point game, with Jamal Murray sinking the free throw to tie the game and force overtime -- after Nikola Jokić rimmed out a game-winning 3-point attempt. In overtime, the Nuggets darted out to a quick lead and never relinquished it, with some more calls and no-calls down the stretch that frustrated the Rockets. After the way the game ended, Udoka wasn't in much of a mood to hold back on officiating he felt wasn't up to the level of the basketball being played. You don't often hear a coach say two refs flat out shouldn't be out there, and doing that while also calling Zarba \"star struck\" in the way he called the game for Jokić will certainly not sit well with the league. \nA fine is almost assuredly coming for Udoka, but he wanted to deliver a message to his team that they don't need to change the way they play because of how that game was officiated, telling the Rockets, \"Keep being who we are, we're not going to adjust to poor officials.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Rams have their fate in their own hands when it comes to a second straight NFC West title -- and the No. 1 seed in the conference. The same can be said of the Seattle Seahawks in regard to the division crown, but their road is much more difficult.Los Angeles has the same 11-3 record as Seattle but currently occupies first place in the NFC West by virtue of its 21-19 home triumph in the rivals' first meeting of the season in Week 11. The Rams wrap up the 2025 NFL regular season with matchups against the Atlanta Falcons (5-9) and Arizona Cardinals (3-11), while the Seahawks take on the Carolina Panthers (7-7) and San Francisco 49ers (10-4), meaning it is of the utmost importance that they win their showdown with the Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Lumen Field.The Rams are coming off their eighth win in nine games, a 41-34 triumph over the Detroit Lions in Week 15. Matthew Stafford added to his MVP resume by throwing a pair of touchdown passes to increase his NFL-leading total to 37 and posting his third 300-yard performance of the season with 368 yards as he ranks second in the league with 3,722.Kyren Williams also was a big contributor against the Lions, rushing for 78 yards and two touchdowns. The 25-year-old has found the end zone at least once in six of his last seven games, including Los Angeles' first meeting with Seattle on Nov. 16 when he gained 91 yards on only 12 carries.The Seahawks also have won eight of their last nine and extended their streak to four straight victories with last week's 18-16 triumph over the Indianapolis Colts. All of Seattle's offense against Indianapolis came from Jason Myers, who converted all six of his field-goal attempts, including a 56-yarder with 18 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.Wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who leads the NFL with 1,541 receiving yards, finished the win with 113 on seven catches for his ninth 100-yard effort of the year. One of those came against the Rams in Week 11, when he hauled in nine passes for 105 yards in that contest. However, Sam Darnold struggled in the matchup as he matched his career high with four interceptions and failed to throw a touchdown pass.\nThe Rams already have secured a trip to the postseason and would strengthen their chances for both their 16th NFC West title and a first-round bye with a victory on Thursday. In addition to currently owning the tiebreaker against Seattle, Los Angeles is one game ahead of the Chicago Bears in the race for the top spot in the conference, which would mark the fourth time it has accomplished the feat.A victory would seal up a playoff berth for the Seahawks and put them in the driver's seat for what would be their 12th overall division title and 10th NFC West crown. It also would give them the inside track to finish with the No. 1 seed for the fourth time in franchise history.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team currently believes Los Angeles has the better chance at winning the NFC West. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Rams have a 56% chance to capture the division title as they enter Thursday night's showdown, and it would increase to nearly 89% with a victory against the Seahawks but would drop to less than 24% with a loss.The model says the Seahawks' prospects to win the division are at nearly 31.5% right now and jump to just under 60% with a win over the Rams. However, a loss would give them only a 3% chance to finish atop the NFC West.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Rams56.0%88.7%23.4%65.3%Seattle Seahawks31.4%59.8%3.0%56.8%Considering the remaining schedule for both teams, it is imperative for the Seahawks to defeat the Rams for just the second time in their last six meetings both overall and in Seattle. When the clubs met at Lumen Field last season, Smith-Njigba made his second touchdown catch of the game with 51 seconds left in the fourth quarter to help forge a tie before Stafford threw his second TD pass of the contest midway through overtime to give Los Angeles a 26-20 victory.The Rams have the NFL's second-leading receiver in Puka Nacua (1,367 yards), although they may be without wideout Davante Adams, who leads the league with 14 touchdown receptions but is battling a hamstring injury. Seattle is a 1.5-point favorite against Los Angeles in the latest odds at DraftKings, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 23-22 victory for the Seahawks.\n            ",

    "body": "\nNow that the Kansas City Chiefs' three-year reign atop the AFC is over, the royal rumble to take over the throne is on.The Denver Broncos (12-2) have ridden 11 straight wins to the best record in the conference, while the New England Patriots (11-3) feature MVP candidate Drake Maye, who leads the NFL in completion percentage (70.9). The Buffalo Bills (10-4) are never out of a game with the arm and legs of quarterback Josh Allen, and the ascending Houston Texans (9-5), who are allowing just 16.3 points per game, own one of the league's best defenses in years.The Broncos (+300), Bills (+370), Texans (+500) and Patriots (+600) are the top four favorites to win the AFC at DraftKings Sportsbook.But where are the Jacksonville Jaguars? In the free-for-all that is this year's AFC race, the Jaguars are getting no love. Even though they have the third best record (10-4) in the conference and lead the AFC South, they are just +650 to win the conference, behind all four teams above.That could change on Sunday if Jacksonville knocks off Denver at Empower Field in a game with enormous ramifications for the Jaguars. With three games remaining in the regular season, Jacksonville enters Week 16 with a one-game lead over Houston in the division. The SportsLine Inside the Lines team and Projection Model say the Jaguars have a 50% chance to win the AFC South.If they beat the Broncos on Sunday, that percentage jumps to 74.5%. But if Jacksonville loses to Denver, that chance crashes to 37.2%.Entering Week 16With winWith lossChance to win division50.0%74.5%37.2%After facing the Broncos, the Jaguars play the struggling Colts (8-6) and quarterback fossil Philip Rivers in Week 17 in Indianapolis and the Tennessee Titans (2-12) in Week 18. Jacksonville is likely to be favored in both.That's why the Jaguars can apply a hammerlock on the AFC South title with a victory on Sunday. Jacksonville is a 3-point underdog against the Broncos at DraftKings.\nConversely, a loss would be detrimental to the Jaguars' division hopes. The second-place Texans host the Raiders (2-12) on Sunday and are favored by more than two touchdowns. If Jacksonville loses and Houston wins, the Texans would overtake the Jaguars for the lead in the division based on a better division record. Houston also would have the better conference record.The Texans' last two games are at the Chargers (10-4) and against Rivers and the Colts, so Jacksonville would still have some hope if it falls in Denver but wouldn't control its destiny. The Jaguars enter Week 16 playing arguably their best ball of the season. They have won five in a row and are coming off a 48-20 win over the Jets in which quarterback Trevor Lawrence set career highs in passing touchdowns (five), touchdowns accounted for (six) and passer rating (136.7). On Sunday, Lawrence and Jacksonville will face a Broncos defense that is tied for third in the league in points per game allowed (18.6). \"Getting to go play a competitive, meaningful game in December is really what it comes down to,\" Jaguars coach Liam Coen said Wednesday. \"Hostile environment. A very quality opponent. A team that's won the fourth quarter in a lot of football games over the last two years. It's a great opportunity for us to go compete and earn everything we get.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman's system paid off in Week 14, with the New Orleans Saints and Las Vegas Raiders covering the spread, and he hit one of two in Week 15. The Houston Texans blew out the Arizona Cardinals, who were giving 9.5 points, but the Washington Commanders beat the New York Giants as 2.5-point underdogs. Hochman has lined up another system for Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season and identified two spots bettors can target.NFL teams bouncing back after shutout lossesWin Rate: 31-12-4 ATS (72.1%)Sample Size: Since 2011Criteria: Teams scoring zero points in the prior weekEdge: Non-Division games; Week 11 or laterWhy does this work?This system looks at teams that didn't score the previous week and were playing a non-divisional team in Week 11 or later. In this spot, teams have covered the spread 31 times in 47 tries, winning by an average of 1.8 points. After being shut out, teams usually make changes -- like tweaking their offensive strategy, shuffling the lineup or focusing on fundamentals in practice. Players and coaches want to show that last week's zero-point performance was just a bad day, so they come out fired up. Oddsmakers usually ignore this, so the line can be off. With a 72.1% win rate, this is one of the most profitable systems out there for samples of at least 40 games.Week 16 qualifiersCincinnati Bengals -4 at Miami Dolphins | Confidence: 3 out of 5\nCincinnati qualifies after getting manhandled by the Baltimore Ravens 24-0 as 3.5-point home underdogs. The Bengals' defense should be better in this matchup. Week 16 is deep into the season for a rookie arm. With Tua Tagovailoa benched, Quinn Ewers steps in at quarterback. The rookie faces defensive coordinator Al Golden, who knows he doesn't need complicated schemes. Golden just needs to change up the coverage enough to make Ewers hesitate and throw off his timing.We are getting Joe Burrow laying less than a touchdown against a sub-500 team led by a rookie in his first career start. This price reflects Cincinnati's early-season defensive struggles rather than its current offensive potency, excluding last week's shutout. I like Burrow's chances to carve up a Miami secondary that ranks 27th in opponent passer rating. Burrow had a rough outing last week, posting just a 58.2 passer rating, so you can expect him to be fired up for a bounce-back performance. Meanwhile, the Dolphins look like a team that's headed for big changes once the season ends. DraftKings has the Bengals at -4 while most other books are at -4.5. If you like Cincinnati, now's the time to lock in the better number.\nLas Vegas Raiders +14 at Houston Texans | Confidence: 2.5 out of 5\nThe Raiders' 31-0 loss last week was the first time in 19 years they've been shut out twice in one season — both times by the same 31-0 score, including a game against the Chiefs in October. Now, they face a Texans defense ranked first in scoring, allowing just 16.3 points per game. For a Raiders team that looks ready to finish out the season, this is a tough matchup. There's some hope for Raiders fans: Geno Smith, who didn't practice last week, could be back for Week 16. Head coach Pete Carroll said Smith has \"a really good chance to be back\" against the Texans. This matchup features one of the league's best defenses against a struggling offense, but if Smith returns, it's a boost for anyone relying on Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty in fantasy playoffs.The Raiders have one real advantage: Maxx Crosby going up against Houston's weak offensive line (ranked 29th). If Crosby gets loose and picks up a few sacks, he can rattle C.J. Stroud, force bad throws and kill drives. This keeps the Texans' offensive output compressed rather than explosive. When the point spread is big, there's always a chance for a late, meaningless touchdown — especially since defenses often play soft coverage in the fourth quarter.Houston is on a hot streak, winning six in a row (5-1 ATS) and taking eight of its past 10 (7-3 ATS). With all that momentum, most people are likely to bet against the Raiders, so the oddsmakers will want to see Vegas cover the spread. Often, the sharp move is to side with the oddsmakers rather than follow the crowd.\n            ",

Joining them is the debutant team Valerenga. The Norwegian side were in a position to try an advance but needed a win over Bayern Munich and help with an OH Leuven loss. What's next?The draw will take place on Thursday at 7 a.m. ET on CBS Sports Golazo Network as the competition prepares to close out the calendar year. The teams 5-8 are seeded and those 9-12 are unseeded and will be paired via the draw.\nThe knockout phase for the 2025-26 season begins in February (11-12, 18-19), and quarterfinals in March (24-25) and April (1-2).

    "body": "\n        The final three weeks of the 2025 NFL regular season are upon us, so naturally the remaining games come with plenty of weight to them. As many as nine teams can clinch playoff spots in Week 16. The Denver Broncos can actually clinch the AFC's No. 1 overall seed this week with a victory, a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie, a New England Patriots loss and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie. It's been 21 years since a team won the NFC East in consecutive seasons, but the Philadelphia Eagles can end that streak with a victory over the Washington Commanders on Saturday or a Dallas Cowboys loss against the Chargers on Sunday. The focus is certainly football, but it's impossible to fully analyze how teams are playing at this point in the year without factoring in injuries. Every team is banged up to a certain degree, which could play a not insignificant role in how the rest of the season unfolds. With most teams returning to the practice field for the first time this week on Wednesday, we'll take a survey around the league as teams publish their initial injury reports. We'll also analyze the final injury report for Thursday night's critical NFC West showdown between the 11-3 Los Angeles Rams and the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks. \nAll NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-1.5)Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime VideoLos Angeles Rams: WR Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) DOUBTFUL, DE Braden Fiske (ankle) QUESTIONABLESeattle Seahawks: LT Charles Cross (hamstring) OUTLos Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams departed the team's 41-34 Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions with a non-contact hamstring injury, and that injury has him listed as doubtful to suit up in what's seemingly an NFC West division title championship game of sorts. Adams leads the league with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, and if he doesn't play, that will be a tremendous loss for quarterback Matthew Stafford and head coach Sean McVay. Edge rusher Braden Fiske (ankle) is questionable after also not practicing all week like Adams.The Seattle Seahawks will be without starting left tackles Charles Cross (hamstring) on Thursday night, a huge blow for quarterback Sam Darnold, who threw four interceptions in a 21-19 Week 11 road loss at the Rams. Josh Jones, a 2020 third-round pick by the Seahawks, will be making his first start since Week 3 of the 2023 season, a 37-17 road win at the Jacksonville Jaguars, in place of Cross. \nPhiladelphia Eagles at Washington Commanders (+6.5) (Saturday)Four Philadelphia Eagles didn't practice on Wednesday: defensive tackle Jalen Carter (shoulders), left guard Landon Dickerson (calf/vet rest day), offensive tackle Fred Johnson (ankle) and right tackle Lane Johnson (foot).

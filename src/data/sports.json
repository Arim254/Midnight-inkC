The Spurs will host the Thunder at 9:30 p.m. ET, as San Antonio tries to build on its 3-1 lead in the season series. However, Oklahoma City picked up a win in the most recent meeting and is a 1.5-point road favorite in the Wednesday NBA odds at bet365. SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Thunder to cover the spread, and it has also revealed a best bet for Celtics vs. Rockets. The Rockets are favored by 5.5 points at home against the Celtics.

Bet it at bet365 here:Celtics (+5.5) vs. Rockets (-110)\nBoston extended its winning streak to three games with a 110-100 win at Dallas on Tuesday, as Jaylen Brown had 33 points and 11 rebounds. Brown was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month in January, and he is averaging 29.5 points per game this season. The Celtics cruised to blowout wins over the Kings and Bucks in their previous two games, while the Rockets have failed to cover the spread in four of their last five games. Boston has won eight of the last 11 meetings between these teams, and it has covered the spread in 14 of its last 19 road games. SportsLine's model has the Celtics winning outright and covering the spread in 67% of simulations. Back the Celtics at bet365 here:Thunder (-1.5) vs. Spurs (-110)Oklahoma City has the best record in the NBA and can extend its lead over San Antonio atop the Western Conference standings on Wednesday night. The Thunder lost their first three games of the season to the Spurs, but they notched a 119-98 win on Jan. 13. They cruised to a 128-92 win over Orlando on Tuesday, holding the Magic to 38.2% shooting overall. The Spurs have only covered the spread twice in their last seven games against Western Conference opponents, and the model has Oklahoma City covering 60% of the time on Wednesday night. Back the Thunder at bet365 here:Ty Jerome Over 20.5 points + assists (-110)\"The Grizzlies traded Jaren Jackson Jr. to the Jazz on Tuesday. The main haul in the trade was draft picks, so they are going to have a void in the scoring department moving forward,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"The players they did acquire might not be available yet, which would leave the Grizzlies even more shorthanded. Although Ty Jerome has played limited minutes since returning from injury, he combined for at least 26 points and assists in both games. He could get a few extra minutes against a Kings team that has the third-worst defensive rating in the league, so this over is appealing.\" Back Jerome at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Wednesday.

The Thunder have the NBA's best record at 40-11 and lead the league in a bevy of categories, including scoring offense (120.5 ppg) and scoring defense (107.7 ppg). However, the Spurs have given the Thunder three of their 11 losses this season. That storyline was one the Thunder squashed in their last meeting, though, resulting in a 119-98 Thunder win in January. It's hard to debate that the Thunder are the best team in the league, and with the chance to play the reigning NBA champions to simply win by two points to cash a winning bet, the model sees strong value in OKC. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 60% of simulations. Bet the Thunder to cover at DraftKings here:Celtics (+5.5) vs. Rockets (-110)The Celtics are coming off a 110-100 win over the Mavericks on Tuesday as their Texas back-to-back takes them to Houston on Wednesday. Boston has won three straight games and four of their last five contests to improve to 32-18 on the season. They've also won four of their last six on the road, and the Celtics are 6-3 against the spread as a road underdog this season. They are 9-5 ATS as the underdog, and 5-3 ATS in the second half of a back-to-back. Meanwhile, the Rockets are 8-13 ATS at home this season, including 8-12 ATS as the home favorite. Houston is 1-4 ATS over its last four home games. These trends strongly back the Celtics, as do the model's projections, with the Celtics covering in 67% of simulations. Bet the Celtics to cover at DraftKings here:Georgia Southern (-192) to defeat Texas State\"KenPom ranks Georgia Southern eight spots higher for this Sun Belt matchup,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The hosts are 6-5 in the league, and Texas State is 6-6. The Eagles' best player? That would be graduate transfer guard Spudd Webb (16.2 ppg), apparently not related to the former dunk king. At home this season, Georgia Southern is 8-3 while averaging 85.6 ppg and outscoring foes by more than 14. TSU has won back-to-back games, but those were at home. It has a single road win, coming at truly dreadful UL Monroe and even that was close. When playing Georgia Southern on the road, the Bobcats are 1-7 all-time.\" Bet Georgia Southern to win at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open. The first tee times come at 9:20 a.m. ET on Thursday.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +220 favorite (risk $100 to win $220), followed by Schauffele at +1900. Hideki Matsuyama and Cameron Young are both +2200. Other past major winners in the field include J.J. Spaun (+3300), Koepka (+3300), Collin Morikawa (+4000), Matt Fitzpatrick (+4000) and Jordan Spieth (+5000). Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open. This event has been a real struggle for him, however, as he's missed three of thee past five WM Phoenix Open cuts and hasn't finished better than 50th since 2022. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Ben Griffin this week. He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Kuminga reportedly demanded a trade from the franchise on Jan. 15, the first day he was trade eligible.Kuminga, 23, has been one of the most discussed players in the NBA since this past summer when he became a restricted free agent. The No. 7 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft signed a two-year, $48.5 million deal to return to Golden State after a nearly two-month standoff with the franchise. Kuminga had an opportunity instead to sign a qualifying offer (worth $7.9 million), which would've made him an unrestricted free agent this summer. The Warriors reportedly offered Kuminga a three-year, $75.2 million deal with a team option during his contract negotiations, according to ESPN, which was an increase of their original offer of two years, $45 million.Even after signing that deal, Kuminga has been in and out of the Warriors' rotation this season. He has appeared in just 20 games (13 starts) and is averaging 12.1 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists while shooting 45.4% from the floor. Kuminga missed more than a month of action before returning to the floor on Jan. 20. He played 21 minutes and scored 20 points that night and then scored 10 points in nine minutes of action on Jan. 22. He hasn't played in any of the team's five games since. \n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade winners and losers: Good and bad news for Cooper Flagg, Luka Dončić deal ages even worse\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere was optimism after the contract standoff that this could be the year that Kuminga thrived in a clear-cut role with the franchise that drafted him. But that never materialized, and now he's heading to Atlanta for a fresh start alongside Hield, a career 39.5% 3-point shooter who has been a mainstay of the Warriors' rotation over the last two seasons. \nWith Porziņģis, the Warriors are acquiring a player who is in the final year of his deal. Porziņģis, 30, is making $30.7 million this season and is set to be an unrestricted free agent this summer. The Hawks big man missed his team's last 13 games due to Achilles tendinitis. He was set to return against the Miami Heat earlier this week, but it was postponed due to illness.Earlier this season, Porziņģis was sidelined due to a mystery illness -- an issue he also dealt with during his time with the Boston Celtics. In 17 games this season, Porziņģis is averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists.Porziņģis was traded in July from the Celtics to Atlanta in a three-team deal with the Brooklyn Nets. Porziņģis helped the Celtics win the 2024 NBA title over the Dallas Mavericks after being traded from the Washington Wizards in the 2023 offseason. Porziņģis, the No. 4 pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, started his career with the New York Knicks before he was traded to the Mavericks in 2019. \nThe Warriors weren't done with Wednesday night trades after acquiring Porziņģis. Golden State dealt big man Trayce Jackson-Davis to the Toronto Raptors for a 2026 second-round pick via the Lakers, ESPN reported. Jackson-Davis, a second-round pick in 2023, is averaging 4.2 points and 3.1 rebounds in 11.4 minutes across 36 games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gavin McKenna, a star forward for the Penn State hockey team who is widely considered the top prospect for the 2026 NHL Draft, is facing a felony charge following an alleged incident at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night, Onward State reports. According to a court filing, McKenna is awaiting a preliminary hearing after being charged with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor simple assault, as well as summary counts of harassment and disorderly conduct. The Felony I charge is defined as \"attempts to cause serious bodily injury or causes injury with extreme indifference.\"According to Onward State, McKenna and other members of Penn State's hockey team met at Doggie's Pub with friends and family after Saturday's game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium before the alleged assault occurred. McKenna is accused of assaulting an individual, who reportedly suffered a broken jaw in the incident.Penn State, in a statement, said it is aware of the charges.\n\"We are aware that charges have been filed; however, as this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not have any further comment,\" the statement said.McKenna, an 18-year-old freshman from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. An NCAA rule change allowed junior hockey players from the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League to play Division I hockey. In the past, junior hockey players were considered professionals and therefore weren't allowed to play in the NCAA, but the change allowed a prospect of McKenna's caliber to go through the college recruiting process in the U.S.\nAs a 17-year-old, McKenna put together a sensational season for the Medicine Hat Tigers in the Western Hockey League in 2024-25. He posted 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games while also producing 38 points (nine goals, 29 assists) in 16 playoff games as Medicine Hat won the WHL Championship. McKenna, who recorded a 54-game point streak, ranked second in the WHL in points and fifth in goals while leading the league in assists.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Anthony Davis era in Dallas came to an end Wednesday when the Mavericks agreed to trade the 10-time All-Star, along with Jaden Hardy, D'Angelo Russell and Dante Exum, to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Khris Middleton, AJ Johnson, Malaki Branham, Marvin Bagley III, two first-round picks and three second-round picks, according to ESPN. The Mavericks will receive the Oklahoma City Thunder's 2026 first and the Golden State Warriors' 2030 first, which is top-20 protected. We have grades on the deal, which is questionable for both sides, here. But ahead of Thursday's trade deadline, we wanted to take a deeper look at the trade that comes 368 days after the Mavericks stunningly gave up Luka Dončić to acquire Davis. Here are the winners and losers of the Davis-to-the-Wizards deal:Loser: Nico HarrisonHarrison is no longer employed by the Mavericks, but he's still the biggest loser from this trade because it further cements the initial Luka Dončić deal as one of the worst in NBA history. \nLess than a year after Dončić led the Mavericks to the Finals for the first time since 2011, Harrison shipped him out of town for Davis, who ended up playing 29 out of a possible 83 games for the Mavericks -- a tremendous irony given that one of the reasons Harrison gave up Dončić was over concerns about his health and durability. Now, after sending Davis to the Wizards, here's what the Mavericks have to show for Dončić, one of the best players in franchise history, a fan favorite and a perennial All-NBA First Team honoree:Max ChristieKhris Middleton (likely buyout candidate)AJ JohnsonMalaki BranhamMarvin Bagley IIThunder's 2026 first-round pickLakers' 2029 first-round pickWarriors' 2030 first-round pick (top-20 protected)Suns' 2026 second-round pickBulls' 2027 second-round pickRockets' 2029 second-round pickChristie is a really solid young role player, but with respect to him, it's a disaster if he's the best asset you get back for Dončić. \nWinner: WizardsThe Wizards have had a fascinating season. As expected, they've once again been terrible. At 13-36, they have the fourth-worst record in the league, and could very well end up with the worst mark (they're two games ahead of the Sacramento Kings in the crowded race for the bottom). Wherever they wind up in the lottery, they're going to add another top talent to their young core, which already boasts some promising pieces: Alex Sarr, Tre Johnson, Kyshawn George, Bilal Coulibaly and Bub Carrington. In the midst of another losing season, the Wizards have also now made two big moves to acquire Davis and Trae Young. Both players will be out through at least the All-Star break, and it would not be surprising if neither suits up down the stretch so that the Wizards can ensure they keep their top-eight protected pick. There are obviously concerns with Davis and Young -- health and age in Davis' case, defense and shot selection for Young -- but they're both All-Star level talents and the Wizards got them largely for free. Who knows how long both of them will remain in D.C., or how many games they'll play together, but the Wizards haven't had this much talent in a decade. \nThe 2027 and 2028 drafts are not super highly regarded, and you can only tank for so long. Plus, the Wizards are not a free agent destination. At the very least, Davis and Young will allow the Wizards to see their young core in a more competitive environment. And even if they both eventually walk in free agency, the Wizards won't have lost anything. Winner: Whoever is in charge of managing the Mavs' cap sheetThe Mavericks technically got two prospects and five picks back for Davis, but AJ Johnson is now on his third team in two years and Malaki Branham is on his third team in four years. Johnson, in particular, is still young enough that you can't completely write him off, but it's unlikely he's going to turn into more than a rotation player. Meanwhile, the Thunder's first-round pick in this year's draft is likely going to be No. 30, while the Warriors' 2030 first-round pick is top-20 protected. And the second-round picks, though useful, are second-round picks. This deal was largely about not having to give Davis an extension and creating future flexibility. \nPer Bobby Marks, the Mavericks are now below the luxury-tax line this season and are down to $150 million in guaranteed money for next season, which also has them below the tax. And that's before other possible moves to ship out more veterans if the Mavericks want to completely tear things down. Could Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Daniel Gafford or PJ Washington be on the move before Thursday, or in the summer?The Mavericks not only saved significant money with this deal, but gave themselves more freedom to build around No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, who is the new face of the franchise. Winner and Loser: Cooper FlaggEven though Davis largely hadn't played while he was in Dallas, the Mavericks are a significantly worse team without him. And there's a chance that other veterans could follow him out the door, according to Tim Bontemps. The Mavericks are heading toward another lottery appearance this season, and it's hard to say when they'll be a playoff team again, let alone a contender. \nFrom that perspective, Flagg is a loser. He was drafted to a team with Davis and Irving, and a supporting cast that was in the Finals in 2024. It's extremely rare for a No. 1 pick to go to a situation with that much talent and a legitimate chance to make the playoffs. Less than a year later, Flagg is in the same spot that most top picks are in early in their career: being stuck on a bad team. On the other hand, trading Davis signals that the Mavericks are now fully committed to building around Flagg. In case there had been any doubt, this is officially Flagg's franchise, and that makes him a winner. There aren't many players in the league who are held in that regard by their organization, but it's a deserved honor for Flagg, who will likely win Rookie of the Year (he's the -550 ROY favorite on FanDuel as of Wednesday afternoon)After a frustrating start to his debut campaign, Flagg has been historically great as of late. Late last month, he poured in 49 points to set the scoring record by a teenager, and he's currently on a run of three consecutive 30-point games, which no teenager has ever done before. For the season, Flagg is up to 20.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game on 48.4% shooting. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been five long years in Golden State, and the Jonathan Kuminga saga is officially over. The Golden State Warriors are reportedly trading Kuminga and Buddy Hield to the Atlanta Hawks for Kristaps Porziņģis. This deal seemingly puts an end to Golden State's pursuit of Giannis Antetokounmpo, according to Charania. Reports had indicated that the Warriors hoped not to include Jimmy Butler's max contract in a deal, which would have meant using contracts like Kuminga's, Hield's and Draymond Green's to make a deal. With this deal now made and the Bucks having turned down Golden State's picks-based offer, the Warriors moved on to another target.The Hawks, meanwhile, continue their retool by trading away their second former All-Star of the season. With Trae Young gone as well, the Hawks no longer have a single fully guaranteed contract on their books for next season belonging to a player above the age of 27. The youth movement is fully on, so let's grade this deal for both sides.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Golden State Warriors: BAfter five years of inconsistent playing time in a system that he didn't fit within, Kuminga no longer held meaningful trade value. There were reports over the summer that Sacramento was willing to give up a lottery-protected first-round pick for him, but any hope of a deal there seemingly passed when the Kings landed De'Andre Hunter. He had essentially become little more than matching salary, and with the odds of an Antetokounmpo deal seeming low, the Warriors moved on.\nNow, if this were a healthy Porziņģis, Golden State would get an A+. The Warriors have spent years looking for this sort of player. Part of the motivation of signing Al Horford this offseason was the need to pair Draymond Green with a center who can shoot. Golden State has never really had a gigantic, stationary rim-protector before, and his size near the rim gives them a dimension they've largely lacked as well.Of course, this is not a healthy Porziņģis. Even if this was the standard, \"misses games due to injury, but is great when he plays\" Porziņģis the Warriors would come away as clear winners, Instead, he's struggled with POTS, an autoimmune disorder with a number of troubling symptoms including rapid heart rate, dizziness and lethargy. Porziņģis was spectacular in his first 11 games in October and November, averaging over 18 points and posting spectacular on-off splits. He's played six times since, mostly ineffectively. It is not clear when or if he will ever be able to play at 100% again, and that doesn't even factor in the other injuries he's dealt with for most of his career.The version of Porziņģis Golden State is getting, at least for now, is a compromised one. Yet it's still a gamble worth taking for a number of reasons. The risk, for example, was minimal. Porziņģis is on an expiring contract. The Warriors gave up no draft picks to get him. If they have him in the building for three months and decide they don't trust his health, they can wash their hands of this relatively easily. They even got off of the $3 million guaranteed to Hield for next season, so it'd be a minor win.\nBut more likely, they look to re-sign Porziņģis to a team-friendly deal. If he can be had for $10-15 million instead of the $30 million he's making now, the risk-reward calculus shifts quite a bit. The stakes aren't especially high here. Golden State isn't betting a championship core on his health. They know they need to hit a home run if they're going to win anything in the near future, so it made sense to take a high-reward swing. Generally speaking, low-risk, high-reward moves make sense.And then there are the optics here. It's no secret that the Warriors are near the end of a legendary run. Stephen Curry is about to turn 38. The only reason they ever seemingly had a chance at landing Antetokounmpo was that their post-Curry future is so bleak their draft picks held theoretical value. Given how little else they have in the cupboard, one could argue that an all-in push for Giannis represented far greater risk than reward. Yet the Warriors had to try. They owe it to Curry. A player of his stature deserves to end his career at least competing in the playoffs, if not for a championship.The Porziņģis trade isn't nearly as exciting as an Antetokounmpo deal, but it shows Curry and their fans that they're trying. He's a respectable name, someone who has a chance to be very helpful for them, but like Jimmy Butler, doesn't come at an exorbitant cost. Truthfully, those are the sort of players they should be targeting right now. The goal should be to retain as much of their draft capital as possible to ensure they're capable of rebuilding once Curry is gone, but still at least making some attempt to give Curry a competitive roster now. This deal straddles that line. It creates hope without a major cost looming down the line, and it relieves the locker room of all lingering Kuminga-related tension. So it makes sense even if this isn't the best version of Porziņģis.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Hawks: BThe Hawks and Warriors are operating one different timetables. They genuinely hoped Porziņģis could form a center tandem with Onyeka Okongwu that they could build around moving forward. That didn't happen. They simply couldn't justify paying Porziņģis on a long-term deal. They need certainty at the center position, and he couldn't provide it. So moving on made sense.Could they have gotten, say, a meager draft capital return? Sure, but it likely would have been attached to unsavory salary. Atlanta has very valuable first-round picks coming from the Pelicans or Bucks both this summer and next. Maintaining financial flexibility is far more important to them than accumulating draft capital. They need their money to both find a reliable center and look for a shot-creating guard to replace Trae Young.So, like Golden State, the Hawks took a low-risk, high-reward flyer. Hield is only guaranteed $3 million next season, but because he has two years left on his deal, that can even be stretched across five years if he's waived. That's an easy enough contract to dispose of. And Kuminga has a $24.3 million team option for next season. If they need to use him as matching salary in a summer trade, they can. If they want to just get off of the contract for whatever reason, they can do so as well.\nIf we're operating under the assumption that Atlanta did not plan to re-sign Porziņģis, turning him into a different potential expiring contract makes plenty of sense. Why not give Kuminga a two-month audition and see if he looks better away from the Warriors? Atlanta does run a system somewhat similar to Golden State's. The Warriors lead the league in passes every year and in 3s this season. The Hawks are 10th in passes and 11th in 3-point attempt rate. Quin Snyder wants the ball zipping around the court and the 3-pointers flying. But nobody really plays the way Golden State does. The Hawks are closer to a normal NBA ecosystem, and it's worth seeing how Kuminga might fit into one. He does still have stellar athletic traits, after all. We're talking about someone who just faced Minnesota in a playoff series and averaged 24 points on 55-49-72 shooting in the four games in which he played significant minutes last year. There is clearly something here. The Hawks love their big wing ball-handlers. They already run plenty of offense through Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels, though all three have pretty distinct offensive strengths and weaknesses.Snyder is a creative offensive coach. You can never have enough wings. And the Hawks have made no real commitment here. Considering they're only giving up a player they seemingly didn't plan to keep, this is a solid lottery ticket. They were only a Play-In Tournament team anyway, so there's no harm in devoting a few months to seeing if you can unlock a former high draft pick so that next year you might be something more.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Oklahoma City Thunder do not have many flaws, but their offense can sometimes get stagnant and spacing can be a problem. If you're skeptical of the reigning champions repeating, you can point out how close they came to losing to the Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers last season, and that their 3-point percentage was 32.2% and 34.5% in the two respective series. You can also point out that Jalen Williams, their second-best player throughout the title run, is currently out with a hamstring strain, has only played in 24 games this season and, when he was on the floor, was uncomfortable and ineffective shooting from deep following two wrist surgeries. This time around, the burden on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander could be even heavier.As of Wednesday afternoon, though, it's more difficult to pick nits with Oklahoma City. In exchange for a 2026 first-round pick (via Houston), a 2027 second-round pick (the most favorable of OKC, Houston, Indiana and Miami's picks) and two 2028 second-round picks (OKC's own and Milwaukee's), the Thunder are acquiring second-year guard Jared McCain from the Philadelphia 76ers at the 2026 NBA trade deadline. (ESPN's Shams Charania first reported the trade, PHLY's Kyle Neubeck reported the details of the picks.) McCain, in theory at least, gives Oklahoma City exactly what it needed.\nBefore I heap praise on Sam Presti, some caveats: McCain went scoreless in eight minutes in his final game with the Sixers. Coming off a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and a torn UCL in his right thumb, he never consistently found his rhythm in Philadelphia this season. His most encouraging stretch of play as a professional took place under unusual circumstances: on a depleted roster, with the ball in his hands and a neon green light. If you're a McCain skeptic, you could make the case that Daryl Morey's front office has pulled off the biggest NBA heist in about a year, having gotten multiple picks for a guy averaging just 6.6 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 16.8 minutes per game. McCain was in a crowded backcourt, but it's not as if the extremely deep Thunder have tons of minutes to go around. It's possible that, in the playoffs, he'll find himself out of the rotation, just like trade-deadline acquisition Gordon Hayward did two years ago.I admit I liked the Hayward acquisition at the time, too. But this is not a bet on an aging former star playing a complementary, short-term role. It's a bet on a player who, before his knee injury 14 months ago, appeared to be on his way to winning Rookie of the Year. It's a bet on a player who is a couple of weeks away from his 22nd birthday. OKC has a strong track record with player development, and now the rich are getting richer, picking up a high-upside guard whose skill set happens to align with its most glaring weaknesses. Even if he doesn't help the team as soon as I suspect he will, he can help the team.\nThe appeal of McCain is obvious: He's an elite shooter who can also create off the dribble. As inconsistent as he's been this season, he has still made 40.8% of his catch-and-shoot 3s. His gravity alone can help the Thunder, and coach Mark Daigneault will surely weaponize it the way he did with Isaiah Joe, another former Sixer: screening for other guards, slipping out for open 3s, coming off flares. McCain is a clever playmaker, too, adept at attacking angles, changing his pace, absorbing contact and, when he's at his best, finishing below the rim. His off-ball movement and ability to initiate offense should make the league's fourth-best offense more dynamic.This is a rare situation in which getting traded to the league's best team may afford a young player more touches than he had previously. In Philadelphia, McCain was stuck in a logjam that had to be resolved eventually, trying to find his form next to Tyrese Maxey, VJ Edgecombe and Quentin Grimes. Given that Gilgeous-Alexander will be out until after the All-Star break with an abdominal strain, McCain will immediately get to play much more of an on-ball role in OKC. And while there is no shortage of rotation-worthy guards on his new team, there is less skill duplication. McCain should get a chance to show what he can do in this environment, and he's going to love playing off Isaiah Hartenstein, one of the league's best passers and screeners at the 5 spot.\nIt has quieted down after the Thunder won the championship, but, for years before that, people speculated about them spending the draft capital they'd accumulated in a blockbuster trade. By not splurging for a star, they kept their options open, so they could capitalize on opportunities like this one, opportunities that they themselves couldn't have seen coming. When McCain was lighting it up as a rookie, making Philadelphia look brilliant for taking him with the No. 16 pick, it seemed unfathomable that it'd be interested in trading him the following season. The situation changed, though, and that gave Oklahoma City a chance to add precisely the type of firepower it could use. Presti's patience continues to pay off.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- Stefon Diggs was one of the pivotal additions the New England Patriots made last offseason, which has since propelled them to a Super Bowl LX appearance. On the field, he became the first 1,000-yard receiver New England's had since Julian Edelman in 2019. Off the field, he's arguably the most vocal leader they have in the locker room and a linchpin to this tight-knit roster. But this alliance almost didn't come to pass. As Diggs explained on Wednesday, the wideout nearly inked a deal with the Denver Broncos, who his Patriots just took down in the AFC Championship to punch their ticket to the Bay Area. \"I played against Sean Payton a lot,\" Diggs said when expounding on what piqued his interest in Denver. \"I've seen what his offense can do. So, that was the one thing. And then a couple people on the staff that I knew. Davis Webb, I was familiar with. He helped me out a lot in Buffalo as far as learning the plays.\" \n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: How free agent spending spree paid off in helping Patriots and Seahawks reach Super Bowl\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite that kinship with Webb, who Diggs later called a \"good friend\" of his, Diggs ultimately chose New England.\n\"When you weigh all the pros and cons, I felt the Patriots were probably going to be the best fit,\" he said.  Part of New England's appeal was its young quarterback, Drake Maye. During the 2024 season, Diggs got an up-close view of his future quarterback while on the Houston Texans. They visited Foxborough in Week 6, which coincided with the first start of Maye's career. Even in those infancy stages, Diggs saw Maye's potential. \"It was crazy,\" said Diggs. \"He had got like a mini standing ovation when he went out. It was one of his first games going in. He showed a lot of promise. He made some throws. He was running around. I clearly remember a ball he threw Kayshon Boutte in the back corner to the right, a touchdown. I was like, 'He can spin it a little bit.''\nThis was the throw by Maye to Boutte that caught Diggs' attention. \nAfter a full regular season and three playoff games together, the admiration has only grown. \"His maturation process is second to none,\" Diggs continued on Maye. \"One of the best I've ever seen from a quarterback position. He's still super young, which is crazy. He's had a lot of success, but as I have grown closer to him, I'm a huge fan of him. ... He's a good teammate as well. We joke and laugh a lot in that building, in that room. The more time we spend, I see that relationship growing. He's cool with all his teammates. He's like that quarterback – I don't know how to describe it. If you play football, you'd know, but he has that quarterback mindset, that quarterback energy.\"Denver certainly would've been a viable option due to his relationship with the coaching staff and strong roster. However, it's safe to say Diggs is pleased with his choice of uniting with Maye in New England, as they're now on the doorstep of playing in the Super Bowl.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        London Seymour, a freshman defensive lineman for Georgia, was arrested Jan. 29 and charged with 11 second-degree felony counts of property damage, per Athens-Clarke County jail records. Seymour, the son of Bulldogs legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer Richard Seymour, was booked into the Athens-Clarke County jail at 9:44 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 29, and later released on bond at 10:57 p.m. The first charge carried a $1,100 bond, per magistrate court order, and $5,000 bond was due at arrest. No details of what led to Seymour's arrest were available, but records show he was charged with 11 counts of criminal damage to property. According to the Athens Banner-Herald, the arrest occurred \"after incidents at Rooker Hall and Busbee Hall\" on Georgia's campus.Georgia has not commented on Seymour's arrest or the freshman's status with the program. \n\n        \n            \n                Why February's National Signing Day has become an afterthought in modern college football recruiting\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 6-foot-4, 305-pound defensive tackle appeared in one game for the Bulldogs as a freshman, getting snaps in Georgia's 45-7 win over Marshall in Week 1 of the 2025 season. Seymour was a three-star recruit in the class of 2025 who joined Kirby Smart's Bulldogs to follow in the footsteps of his legendary father. He was the 123rd-ranked defensive tackle in the 2025 class. Before arriving at Georgia, he played his high school ball at North Gwinnett High School in Suwanee, Georgia. Seymour previously committed to Boston College, according to 247Sports, but ended up enrolling at Georgia as a walk-on instead. He also had offers from Colorado, Coastal Carolina, Georgia Southern and Marshall. \nEditor's note: A previous version of this story said Seymour was charged with 131 second-degree felony counts of property damage, as jail records showed. Athens-Clarke County records have since been updated to show 11 counts.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- As everyone knows, it's not cheap to attend a Super Bowl. If you want to attend this year's game between the Seahawks and Patriots, it's going to cost you at least $4,600, which is currently the going rate for the cheapest ticket on the secondary market. If you're hoping to get a ticket at face value, you should probably just give up now, because that's not going to happen. Although $4,600 is certainly a large chunk of change, it's just a small drop in the bucket for some people. For some fans, money is no object and for those fans, I decided to go on a mission for you this week: I looked up the most expensive ticket on Stubhub and then I went to sit in the seat so you we could all get an idea of what it's like to sit in the most expensive seat at the Super Bowl. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl sneak peek: Here's the wildest food that Seahawks and Patriots fans will eat at Levi's Stadium\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for Wednesday, the best seat on Stubhub is in Row 1 of section C114 behind Seattle's bench and if you want to sit there, it will cost you $30,751 per ticket. This is the most expensive ticket on Stubhub.  \n                                                                    Stubhub\n                                                            Basically, you could buy a car or you could attend the Super Bowl. You know what? Forget the car, we're going to the Super Bowl. So how close to the field are you if you buy this ticket? Let's check it out. \nHere's what a $30,000 ticket will buy you at the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Now that you know where the seat is, let's check out the view. The seats in section C114 have a view on the 40-yard line, and although I couldn't get get directly to that seat, I found my way to Row 1 of section C116, which is in a similar spot, but on the opposite 40-yard line. And here it is, here's your $30,000 view: \nWhen I posted the tweet, I estimated how much a front row ticket would cost in this section and I was $10,000 off, so please never ask me to appraise your house. It will not work out well for anyone involved. There are currently two tickets on sale on the secondary market for more than $25,000 each and the other one is in Row 2 of Section 114. \nIt's a huge asking price, but for fans who want to be part of history at any cost, it can certainly be worth it. The Seahawks are in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years and when you've waited a decade to get back to the big game, it can be easier to justify this kind of purchase. For the Patriots, yes, they do have six Super Bowl titles, but it's been seven years since their last trip to the big game. And let's not forget, there are a lot of rich people in Silicon Valley, so it's certainly possible that someone ends up forking over $30,000 for these tickets, and if they do, you'll know exactly what view they have at the game. \n            ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough.

Fans stormed the court inside the Chiles Center after the final buzzer sounded to celebrate the program's first victory over the Zags since Jan. 9, 2014.It was Portland's first win over a ranked opponent since that day more than 12 years ago. It also marked the Pilots' first-ever victory over team ranked in the top seven of the AP poll. The Zags (22-2, 10-1 WCC) entered on a 15-game winning streak and favored by 21.5 points.Losing to Portland marks Gonzaga's first loss to a team ranked below 200th at KenPom since it lost in overtime at San Francisco on Jan. 30, 2010. Portland entered at 213th.It marked Gonzaga's first loss since a 101-61 shellacking at the hands of Michigan on Nov. 26. That loss came against a projected No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. This one came against a team that entered with 10-14 record and No. 230 ranking in the NET and will not help the Zags on Selection Sunday. After the loss, Gonzaga is expected to drop from a No. 3 seed to a No. 4 seed when the CBS Sports Bracketology model is updated Thursday.  \nThe win was particularly sweet for Portland because it marked the Pilots' last visit from Gonzaga as a WCC foe before the Zags leave for the rebuilding Pac-12 next season. Gonzaga is now 47-3 against the Pilots under coach Mark Few.Gonzaga had no answer for Joel Foxwell.\nThe freshman guard from Australia led Portland with 27 points. He was aided significantly down the stretch by James O'Donnell, a sophomore forward from Australia who scored all of his 16 points in the second half.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lefty Framber Valdez is finally off the board. The Tigers have landed the top free-agent pitcher on a three-year contract worth $115 million, reports ESPN. Valdez has an opt out after the second season and there are deferrals, reports The Athletic. The team has not yet announcing the signing.There are questions with Valdez that explain why he sat around on the market until just days before pitchers and catchers report to spring training. Still, there's a very good track record of success here.Valdez, 32, has been one of the game's top starters over the last six seasons, pitching to a 3.23 ERA since 2020 and averaging 30 starts and 192 innings per year since 2021. He is the game's preeminent ground ball starter. Since 2021, Valdez has gotten a ground ball on more than 60% of balls in play, easily the highest among starting pitchers. The league average is around 42% grounders.We ranked Valdez as the fourth-best free agent available this offseason, and the top starter available. Here's the write-up:\nValdez isn't for everyone. He's a contact manager from a  swing-and-miss generation who, year in and year out, belongs near the  bottom of the majors in average exit velocity surrendered. Of course,  that statistic doesn't tell the whole story. Valdez utilizes his  three-pitch mix (sinker, curve, change) to coerce the kind of earthbound  contact that removes the sting from the ball. Pair him with some  well-positioned and surehanded defenders and you'll be happy with the  outcome. Otherwise, why bother? Valdez rejected the qualifying offer earlier this offseason. The Tigers will have to surrender a 2026 draft pick to sign him and the Astros, Valdez's longtime team, will receive a 2026 compensation draft pick for losing him to free agency.Remember, Valdez came up in the Astros' system and debuted in 2018, pitching for current Tigers manager A.J. Hinch in the 2018-19 seasons before Hinch was dismissed in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal. In adding Valdez, the Tigers now have a pair of frontline lefties atop the rotation along with two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal. Skubal is, of course, a free agent after the 2026 season. The presence of Valdez in the rotation post-2026 helps mitigate some of the potential loss of Skubal's services, unless the Tigers are able to come to terms on an extension with Skubal. There is also the chance the Tigers decide to trade Skubal and have Valdez take his place in the rotation, too, though that would be a substantial downgrade. As things stand, the Tigers look to have a potentially robust rotation. Skubal and Valdez are an excellent place to start. Casey Mize was an All-Star last season, going 14-6 with a 3.87 ERA in 28 starts. Jack Flaherty has shown himself to be inconsistent for years, but when he's on, he looks like a frontline starter (most recently in 2024). Reese Olson is quite capable for someone who figures to be the fifth starter and Drew Anderson is coming back to the majors after a 2.25 ERA in 30 starts in Korea in 2025. \nThe Tigers have made the playoffs and advanced for two straight seasons, losing in Game 5 of the ALDS both times. They had a 14-game lead last season and blew that, finishing one game behind the Guardians for the AL Central title. Still, they bested Cleveland in the Wild Card Series to advance.The Tigers were already arguably the favorites in the AL Central (+125, per Caesars), so adding Valdez to beef up the rotation puts them in better position to take their first division crown since 2014.\n            ",

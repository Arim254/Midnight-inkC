    "body": "\n        The DP World Tour announced on Saturday that eight players from LIV Golf paid their fines and met certain requirements to be granted their conditional release for the 2026 season and remain eligible to play in DP World Tour events and the Ryder Cup.  However, Jon Rahm -- the biggest European star on LIV Golf -- was not among that group.Tyrrell Hatton, Laurie Canter, Thomas Detry, Tom McKibbin, Adrian Meronk, Victor Perez, David Puig and Elvis Smylie agreed to pay their fines, withdraw appeals against the DP World Tour and participate in certain events, media activities and promotions for the tour. As such, they were granted the opportunity to play LIV Golf events that conflict with DP World Tour tournaments. Rahm was not part of that group, leaving his status with the DP World Tour -- and Europe's Ryder Cup team in 2027 -- still in doubt. The DP World Tour noted that the agreements for conditional release were not precedent-setting; they only applied to the 2026 season.Rahm has refused to pay fines (reportedly topping $3 million) for playing in LIV Golf events that oppose those on the DP World Tour. He and Hatton were eligible to play in the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black after appealing their sanctions in September. A timeline has not been established for when a third-party arbiter will hear that appeal, but with this new agreement, Hatton (and Meronk, who was also part of the appeal) no longer needs to be involved. \nRahm still has another 18 months before he requires a ruling in his favor to be able to participate in the 2027 Ryder Cup at Adare Manor in Ireland; however, after not reaching an agreement with the DP World Tour alongside his eight LIV Golf compatriots, he's passed up a clear opportunity to regain status at least for this year. Given the nature of the agreement, which is only good for the 2026 season, a non-Ryder Cup year, Rahm may have felt it was unnecessary to relent in his legal battle. If Rahm's appeal is successful, he may avoid any financial penalties, and with LIV Golf picking up world ranking points this year, if Rahm maintains his rate of top 10 finishes from previous seasons -- plus strong finishes in the majors -- he can give himself a decent chance at qualification without needing many DP World Tour starts. \nStill, Rahm's European Ryder Cup teammates likely hoped he would have taken the opportunity to pay the fines, as Hatton did, and get back in good standing consdiering the positive vibes for the European squad coming out of their win in New York. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There will be superstars all over the ice on Sunday morning when the United States and Canada face off in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics. Which of these two rivals has more firepower? The answer to that question may be what determines the winner.The Canadians probably have more marquee names than the Americans. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon have four Hart Trophy wins between them, and they're probably the two best hockey players in the world. That's a nice luxury for Canada, but it's not like the U.S. is lacking for star power at the top of its lineup.We've already seen what Quinn Hughes can do in big moments with his overtime goal against Sweden, and reigning Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck is capable of winning a game on his own between the pipes. That's without even mentioning the one-two punch of two-way centers the Americans have in their top six forward group.While Canada holds the edge when it comes to the elite of the elite, the U.S. has the depth to take down a country that has won nine Olympic gold medals in its history. Here are the 10 best players in Sunday's gold medal game (8:10 a.m. ET).\n10. Zach Werenski | D | USAThe U.S. defensive group is deepest and most talented in the tournament, and while Quinn Hughes gets a lot of justified attention, Zach Werenski is right there with him as one of the best defenders in the world. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, Werenski has tallied 144 points, behind only Cale Makar among defensemen.Werenski also boasts a plus-34 five-on-five goal differential in that span, per Natural Stat Trick. At the 2026 Olympics, we've seen the best parts of Werenski's game, from clean zone exits to the frequent creation of dangerous scoring chances.9. Mitch Marner | LW | CanadaMarner is the rare playmaking winger who is capable of driving play on his own, and he can play in all situations. In this tournament, we've already gotten a clear picture of what Marner can do with the puck on his stick. In the Canadians' overtime win over Czechia in the quarterfinals, Marner pulled off an incredible individual effort to score the game-winner.\nA 2023 Selke Trophy finalist, Marner is also a force in the defensive end. His line with Mark Stone on the other wing could create problems for the American offense.8. Macklin Celebrini | LW | CanadaSome may think this ranking is a little high and a little premature, but Celebrini has just been that good, both in these Olympics and his young NHL career. Celebrini has completely revived a rebuilding San Jose Sharks franchise, and he's in the Hart Trophy conversation with 81 points, more than double his next closest teammate.In Milan, Canadian coach Jon Cooper put Celebrini next to McDavid, and that bold move has paid off in spades. Celebrini leads the Olympics with five goals, and he's second to McDavid in points with 10.\n7. Auston Matthews | C | USAMatthews is one of the best goal-scorers in hockey. His 427 goals since his rookie campaign in 2016-17 are the most in the league with the next closest player sitting 20 goals behind him. Matthews has a deceptive and powerful release that helps him beat goalies with ease, but he's not a one-trick pony. Matthews' defensive game has earned him Selke Trophy votes in each of the last six seasons.When Matthews is on the ice, the Americans are capable of scoring from anywhere in the offensive zone.6. Jack Eichel | C | USAOne of the best two-way centers in the NHL, Eichel has been making plays all over the ice for the U.S. through its first five games. Eichel can excel in every situation, and he's currently on pace for a 111-point season with the Vegas Golden Knights. Coach Mike Sullivan has leaned on Eichel a lot at these Olympics, and that won't stop now.\nI'd expect Eichel to be matched up against Connor McDavid whenever possible, and while that is a big challenge for any player, the American center is capable of holding his own.5. Connor Hellebuyck | G | USAHellebuyck has a strong argument to be the best goalie in the league. He's a three-time Vezina Trophy winner and the reigning NHL MVP. When Hellebuyck is on his game, there's little that an opponent can do. Hellebuyck is 6-foot-4 and rarely out of position, making him incredibly tough to beat, and he has been great for the Americans in Milan.Over the last three seasons, Hellebuyck has saved 77.5 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. The next closest goalie is Andrei Vasilevskiy at 52.2. Canada's Jordan Binnington is below water at -6.54.\n4. Quinn Hughes | D | USAWhat Quinn Hughes brings to this U.S. team was evident in that dramatic win over Sweden in the quarterfinals. Despite playing big minutes, Hughes was a workhorse in overtime, right up until he ended the game by firing a laser beam past Jacob Markstrom. Hughes is one of the best skaters in the world, and he's able to pair that with his high hockey IQ.The U.S. can deploy Hughes in any situation, and I have a hunch Canada will see a lot of him on Sunday morning. Hughes is one of a few defensemen who can skate with Canada's biggest stars and not look overmatched.3. Cale Makar | D | CanadaA two-time Norris Trophy winner (who is gunning to make it three in 2026), Makar is a dynamic player who impacts games in a similar fashion as Hughes. Makar is special, especially with the puck on his stick, as he uses his skating, stickhandling and vision to make plays that few players can.\nSince his rookie campaign in 2019-20, Makar leads all defensemen with 485 points, which also ranks 16th among all skaters. Makar is a threat to make a big play from anywhere on the ice -- from a stretch pass springing a teammate to wheeling around the offensive zone.2. Nathan MacKinnon | C | CanadaIt's unfair that, in addition to Connor McDavid, the Canadians also have MacKinnon at their disposal. He would be the best player on any other team in these Olympics, and he is playing at a Hart Trophy level for the Avalanche in 2025-26. MacKinnon leads the NHL with 40 goals, and he has seven points in this tournament.MacKinnon is a versatile player who can win with speed, power or some combination of both. However you want to play, he's more than happy to beat you.\n1. Connor McDavid | C | CanadaMcDavid is the best player in the world, and as if he needed to prove that fact, he leads the tournament in assists (11) and points (13). Since his rookie season in 2015-26, McDavid leads the NHL in assists (783) and points (1,178), and he ranks fifth in goals (395). He's also a three-time Hart Trophy winner, a Conn Smythe Trophy winner, a five-time Art Ross Trophy winner and Maurice Richard Trophy winner.One of the few things missing from McDavid's trophy case is a gold medal, and he seems determined to get one of those in Milan. Slowing him down will be a tall task, even for the Americans' elite defense.\n            ",

Coach Andy Reid confirmed discussions this week with their veteran pass-catcher, who finished his 13th NFL season with 76 catches for 851 yards and five touchdowns.\"There is communication. That's the main thing,\" Reid said. \"That means people want to move forward. I think that's where Trav is. I'm not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here. He's been doing this a long time, and he can sort all that out as he goes forward. We're proceeding with that, and there is communication.\"Kelce, 36, said in January after the Chiefs failed to make the playoffs that he needed to see how his body responded after Kansas City's 6-11 finish. The Chiefs may be without quarterback Patrick Mahomes for the start of the 2026 season following an ACL injury.Kelce recently expressed anxiousness on his New Heights podcast to work again with Eric Bieniemy as the Chiefs' new offensive coordinator, suggesting he could be back. Bieniemy and Kelce spent a decade together.\n\"I can't wait to see him back in the building,\" Kelce said. \"He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.\"Kelce first mentioned retirement in 2023, acknowledged the toll playing for a decade-plus has taken on his body. He is also expecting to marry fiancée Taylor Swift later this year.\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Friday that Kelce is trending toward a return and remains a \"functional\" player at his position.\n            \n",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\n        Pirates legend and Hall of Famer Bill Mazeroski, who hit one of the most iconic home runs in baseball history, died on Friday. He was 89. Although he was one of the greatest defensive second basemen the game has ever seen, Mazeroski is best remembered for his walk-off home run against the Yankees in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. \"Weird, isn't it?\" Mazeroski said during his Hall of Fame speech in 2001. \"Known for the home run and in the Hall of Fame because of your defense.\" \n\"Everyone across the Pirates organization is deeply saddened by the loss of Bill Mazeroski,\" Pirates chairman Bob Nutting said in a statement. \"... His name will always be tied to the biggest home run in baseball history and the 1960 World Series championship, but I will remember him most for the person he was: humble, gracious and proud to be a Pirate.\" Mazeroski's home run gave the Pirates their first World Series championship since 1925 even though the Yankees outscored the Pirates 55-27 in the seven games. Pittsburgh's minus-28 run differential is still the largest overcome by a World Series winner. Mazeroski went 8 for 25 (.320) with two home runs and 5 RBI in the series. \nIn honor of Mazeroski, here are 10 more of the most iconic home runs in baseball history, listed chronologically.  Oct. 3, 1951: \"The Giants win the pennant!\" The Brooklyn Dodgers had a 13-game lead over the crosstown rival New York Giants on Aug. 11, but the Giants' 37-7 finish to the season put the teams in a tie atop the National League. That sent the two rivals into a best-of-three tiebreaker series. The winner would meet the Yankees in the World Series. The Giants won Game 1. The Dodgers won Game 2, forcing a decisive Game 3. Game 3 was the first baseball game televised nationally. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the ninth inning, but the Giants rallied, and Ralph Branca replaced ace Don Newcombe on the mound. Down 4-2 with two runners on base and one out, Bobby Thomson hit Branca's second pitch out to left for a walk-off, pennant-clinching, three-run homer. \n\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\" exclaimed radio broadcaster Russ Hodges.  April 8, 1974: Aaron breaks Ruth's record Babe Ruth was baseball's all-time home run king for more than 50 years, and his 714 career homers seemed like an unbreakable record. Three games into the 1974 season, however, Hammerin' Hank Aaron passed the Babe and became baseball's new home run king with his 715th career blast. He took Dodgers lefty Al Downing deep for the historic homer. \n\"It's gone! It's 715!\" said legendary broadcaster Milo Hamilton. \"There's a new home run champion of all-time, and it's Henry Aaron.\"   \n\"What  a marvelous moment for baseball,\" Vin Scully said on the Dodgers' broadcast. \"What a marvelous moment for Atlanta  and the state of Georgia. What a marvelous moment for the country and  the world.\"  Game 6 of 1975 World Series: Fisk waves it fair The 1975 World Series is one of the greatest ever. Three of the first four games were decided by one run, with the Reds mounting a ninth-inning comeback in Game 2 and the Red Sox doing the same to tie Game 3. With Boston facing elimination and down 6-3 in the eighth inning of Game 6, pinch-hitter Bernie Carbo swatted a three-run game-tying homer. Four innings later, Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk pulled a game-winning walk-off home run down the left field line at Fenway Park to save the Red Sox's season. He waved it fair as he left the batter's box. \nThe broadcast angle of Fisk waving the ball fair was a stroke of luck. The camera operator inside the Green Monster was distracted by a rat, and instead of following the ball's flight, the camera stayed on Fisk.  Game 6 of 1977 World Series: Mr. October Technically, this is three home runs. Yankees' slugger Reggie Jackson, after going deep in his final at-bat of Game 5, hit three home runs in his first three at-bats of Game 6 en route to New York's first World Series championship since 1962. Jackson hit four homers off four different pitchers in four at-bats spanning Games 5 and 6. \nAt the time, it was only the third three-homer game in World Series history. Babe Ruth had done it twice previously: Game 4 of the 1926 World Series and Game 4 of the 1928 World Series. \n Oct. 2, 1978: Bucky bleepin' Dent On July 19, the Yankees were 14 games behind the Red Sox in the AL East. A torrid finish -- 52-21 the rest of the way -- moved New York into a tie atop the AL East with Boston at the end of the regular season. The bitter rivals played a Game 163 tiebreaker to decide the division winner. The winner would meet the Royals in the ALCS; the loser would go home.The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead into the seventh inning with starter Mike Torrez seemingly in control. Back-to-back one-out singles put the tying run on base for New York, then light-hitting shortstop Bucky Dent flipped the game with a three-run go-ahead homer. The Yankees took a 3-2 lead and went on to win the game 5-4.  \nDent hit four home runs that season prior to Game 163, and he retired with 40 career homers in close to 1,400 games spanning 12 seasons. He and the Yankees completed the AL East comeback in Game 163 and went on to win the World Series. \n Game 1 of 1988 World Series: Gibson on one leg Knee and hamstring injuries kept Kirk Gibson, that year's NL MVP, on the sidelines for the 1988 World Series. Or so we expected. With the Dodgers down 4-3 with two outs in the ninth inning against Athletics Hall of Fame closer Dennis Eckersley, the clearly hobbled Gibson pinch-hit for Alejandro Pena, and lifted a two-out, two-strike, two-run walk-off home run to right field. \n\"All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, and all year long, he answered the demands,\" Vin Scully said on the broadcast. \"... High flyball into right field! She is gone! In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has  happened.\" The Dodgers went on to win the World Series in five games. The Game 1 walk-off home run was the only time Gibson saw the field in the series. \n Game 6 of 1991 World Series: \"We will see you tomorrow night!\" The Twins were in real trouble going into Game 6 of the 1991 World Series. Down 3-2 in the series to the Braves and facing Steve Avery, that year's NLCS MVP, in Game 6, Kirby Puckett put Minnesota on his back. He opened the scoring with an RBI triple in the first inning. In the third, he robbed Ron Gant of a game-tying two-run home run. With the score tied 3-3 in the 11th, Puckett saved the Twins' season (again) with a walk-off home run to force Game 7. \n\"And we will see you tomorrow night!\" said broadcaster Jack Buck after Puckett's walk-off blast.\nPuckett's Game 6 heroics made possible the classic Game 7 pitchers' duel between Jack Morris and John Smoltz. Morris threw a 10-inning shutout in a 1-0 win to give the Twins their second World Series title in five years.  Game 6 of 1993 World Series: \"Touch 'em all, Joe!\" Mazeroski's homer in 1960 was the first series-ending walk-off home run in baseball history. It wasn't the last. With the Blue Jays looking to repeat as champions in 1993, Joe Carter stepped to the plate against Phillies closer Mitch Williams with two runners on base and Toronto down 6-5 in the ninth inning of Game 6. Five pitches later, the Blue Jays had their second straight title. \n\"Touch 'em all, Joe! You'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\" exclaimed legendary Blue Jays broadcaster Tom Cheek after Carter's walk-off three-run homer.\n Sept. 7, 1998: Big Mac hits No. 62 After hitting 61 home runs in 1961, Roger Maris was baseball's single-season home run king for nearly 40 years. The record stood until 1998, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were locked in a home run chase that revitalized a sport that was still reeling from the 1994-95 strike. McGwire broke Maris' record with his 62nd home run on Sept. 7. \n\"Down the left field line. Is it enough? Gone! There it is. 62!\" said Hall of Famer Jack Buck on the broadcast. \"Touch first Mark, you are the new single-season home run king!\" McGwire finished the season with a then-single-season record 70 home runs. Sosa also eclipsed Maris that year. He hit 66 homers.  Aug. 7, 2007: Bonds breaks Aaron's record McGwire's 70 home runs were short-lived as the single-season record. Barry Bonds slugged 71 home runs three years later in 2001. Bonds hit 45 homers in 2002, 45 homers in 2003, and 45 homers again in 2004. By 2007, Hank Aaron's then-record 755 career home runs were within reach. On Aug. 7, Bonds took lefty Mike Bacsick deep for his 756th career blast. \nBonds added another six home runs that season and remains baseball's all-time leader with 766 career homers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After exploring options to move home football games to SoFi Stadium, UCLA will remain at the iconic Rose Bowl for the 2026 season. \"UCLA will play the upcoming football season at the Rose Bowl,\" said UCLA vice chancellor for communications Mary Osako in a statement. \"We know how much game day means to Bruins — to our students, alumni and fans who plan their autumn around Saturdays together. Our priority is delivering a strong season experience for our student-athletes and our community, and we have great momentum in our football program. During this unprecedented time in college athletics, UCLA will always be guided by what's best for our student-athletes and the Bruin community.\"The decision to remain at the Rose Bowl comes a little over three months after the Rose Bowl and city of Pasadena filed a lawsuit against UCLA last October after plans for the Bruins to move home games out of the storied stadium became public. UCLA's current lease with the Rose Bowl runs through 2044, and the lawsuit alleged the Bruins moving home games to Inglewood would cause more than a billion dollars in damages to the city of Pasadena and its residents. Moving to the newer SoFi Stadium presented an appealing opportunity for UCLA. Not only is it a newer stadium with more amenities, but it's also 13 miles closer to UCLA's campus -- as attendance can be an issue at times for the Bruins at the Rose Bowl. However, with the pending lawsuit over their lease agreement with the Rose Bowl and their effort to build positive momentum within the program after hiring James Madison coach Bob Chesney, the Bruins opted to play in Pasadena without the dispute hanging over the preparations for the 2026 season.\nThe statement does not note what UCLA's long-term future plans will be, and it certainly seems as though this saga will continue into 2027 as the Bruins look to resolve the dispute over their lease with the Rose Bowl and explore their options for moving home games to the Inglewood home of the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers and Rams. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        On Thursday morning, Cade Cunningham declared himself to be the NBA's best American player by way of a feature story in GQ magazine. Players say stuff like this all the time. At any given time, there are probably 10 or more guys who believe themselves to be the best player on the planet. On any given night, they might all have a case. Still, it's a pretty bright spotlight to shine upon yourself. But if you're Cunningham, why not draw a little attention to yourself? Not nearly enough people are doing it for you. Sure, he's listed in all the MVP rankings (NBA.com has him fourth this week). In ESPN's latest straw poll, which surveys a panel of 100 local, national and international media members, he came out third behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic, who is still in the race for now but can only miss one more game before falling below the minimum 65-game threshold. FanDuel currently has Cunningham at +700, the third-highest number on the board behind, of course, SGA and Jokic. Six weeks ago, I had him at third in my CBS ranking, which didn't even include Jokic because at that point, he was all but certain to miss too many games.But all of these rankings paint Cunningham as an also-ran in a race that, at this point, he should arguably be leading. Let's start with the obvious: He's the best player on the league's best team (entering play on Friday, Detroit is percentage points above OKC at 41-13). \nThe Pistons' latest victory was another walloping of the Knicks on Thursday, a game in which Cunningham, as if to officially stamp his best-American statement and sans the services of fellow All-Star Jalen Duren and Beef Stew Isaiah Stewart, carded 42 points, 13 assists, eight rebounds, two blocks and a steal. The Knicks were supposed to be one of the teams to beat in the East this year. Many wondered if the Pistons would even be able to match what they did last season, when they won their first playoff game in 17 years before falling in the first round to ... this Knicks. This year, they've played three times, and Detroit has won by a total of 84 points, with Cunningham registering a plus-44 across 89 minutes. Cunningham and Jokic are the only two players averaging at least 23 points and nine assists (Cunningham leads the league in the latter category at 9.6). Cunningham's 9.1 per-game plus-minus is more than double Jokic's plus-4.3, but let's be clear: This isn't about looking for cracks in the cases for Jokic or SGA; they're both airtight. This is about putting a proper case together for Cunningham. \nAnd to do that, the full context of not just where the Pistons are, but how they got here, becomes necessary. Three years ago, the Pistons were the worst team in the league with 17 wins. Two years ago, that win total dropped to 14 as they endured an NBA record 28-game losing streak. We're talking bottom of the barrel. People were honestly questioning whether Cunningham could ever be that guy.Suffice it to say, he can. And is. Last year, the Pistons became the first team in history to triple their win total from the previous season. Now they have the best record in the league. And it's not like they added a major piece. They just got better. Cade got better. He's a different, more confident shooter now, particularly from 3 off the dribble. Cunningham is hitting these step-back 3s at a 44% clip this season, per NBA.com.All told, he's up from 31% to 35% on off-the-dribble 3s; it's still not a huge number, but it's just enough to force defenders to press up tighter and go over ball screens, at which point Cunningham, who scores the third-most points per game via drives in the league, becomes truly impossible to keep out of the paint. \nIf you're looking to compare Cunningham's MVP case with, say, Luka Doncic, the conversation, for my money, begins and ends on defense. Cunningham plays both sides. Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic are a different story. Their respective cases are unimpeachable, and this isn't to suggest that Cunningham should or shouldn't win over either one of those guys. It's simply to say he deserves to be in the same sentence. Not the one after. And certainly not the one after Luka. Say what you want, but story matters in MVP voting. And right now, there is no better story than how quickly Cunningham has turned the cellar-dwelling Pistons into, by record, the best team in the league. He has to do everything for the Pistons in terms of shot creation; when he's on the floor, Detroit's offense operates at what would rank fourth in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. When he leaves, they become the fourth worst. Nobody -- not Luka, not Jokic, not SGA, not Jalen Brunson, not Jaylen Brown -- nobody has to carry a heavier offensive load. \nYes, we're all waiting to see what the Pistons will do in the postseason, whether their lack of shooting will derail them. But this is a regular-season award, and relatively speaking, Cunningham, and by extension the Pistons, are not getting the shine they should. It's high time that it starts to change. \n            ",

With Selection Sunday less than a month away, fans can tune in at 12:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+ to get a look at how the top 16 teams in the bracket stack up entering the day's action.NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee Chair Keith Gill will join CBS analysts Clark Kellogg, Wally Szczerbiak and Seth Davis in studio along with host Adam Zucker to break down where things stand as college basketball's regular season hits the home stretch.Last year, three of the No. 1 seeds in the early bracket reveal remained the same on Selection Sunday. The only team that dropped from the No. 1 line was Alabama. Houston replaced the Crimson Tide on the No. 1 seed line. All four No. 1 seeds reached the Final Four last season for the second time in the history of the tournament.\nHistory suggests that if you're one of the 16 teams in the early bracket reveal, you will remain a top-four seed on Selection Sunday. The only two teams that dropped out of the top 16 last season were Michigan (No. 4 to No. 5 seed) and Kansas (No. 4 to No. 7). \nHeading into the weekend, Michigan is the projected No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology model projections. Duke, Arizona and Houston are the other No. 1 seeds in the latest projections. Notably, Duke and Michigan play each other on Saturday, which is sure to have massive implications on the team that ultimately earns the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament.The 30-minute bracket preview comes before a Big 12 showdown between No. 8 Kansas and Cincinnati on CBS at 1 p.m. \nWhere to watch NCAA March Madness Bracket Preview Date: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 12:30 p.m. ETTV: CBS | Streaming on Paramount+ Premium (Try It Free)   Extended TV coverage: CBS Sports Network, 1 p.m. ET\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        After a slow start, No. 8 Kansas controls its own destiny in a Big 12 Conference title race that is shaping up to be an all-timer. The Jayhawks are 10-3 in conference play, just one game behind Arizona and Houston. Kansas gets to play both of the Big 12's top dawgs in the next eight days, but it can't afford to have any other hiccups starting Saturday against a Cincinnati club that has underwhelmed this year (14-12, 6-7 in Big 12 play) but has shown an ability to play up and beat an Iowa State team that is trending to be a No. 2 seed. Of course, Darryn Peterson's status remains the biggest story. He scored 23 brilliant points in just 19 minutes against Oklahoma State before asking out with another cramping episode. \"I didn't anticipate that tonight at all,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told reporters. \"I thought he was good to go, but obviously, we only got 18 minutes. That's disappointing 'cause he could have had a really good night.\" \n        \n            \n                Kansas' Bill Self gets candid on Darryn Peterson 'checking out': What's right, what's 'false', what's next\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe saga continues with no end in sight. Let's dive into the X's and O's of this Big 12 tilt.   Kansas vs. Cincinnati: Need to know Who gets the Baba Miller assignment? Miller is having the best season of his career, even amidst a miserable 3-point shooting slump. The 6-foot-11 Cincinnati forward is firmly a post-hype sleeper who has blossomed into one of the best mismatch forwards in the Big 12. But Kansas has plenty of options. Flory Bidunga has been Kansas' problem-solver defensively this season. Against BYU, he pivoted to guarding dynamic wing AJ Dybantsa. Against Texas Tech, he got the JT Toppin assignment. But Cincinnati is a bit of a tougher matchup. Do you put Bidunga on 7-foot big man Moustapha Thiam and let freshman Bryson Tiller take a turn on Miller? Tiller has been a pleasant surprise for KU this year and has the frame and athleticism to handle Miller. Or do you let Bidunga, the frontrunner for Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, try to slow down Miller and trust Tiller to handle the Thiam assignment?  \nThe transition seesaw: When these two defenses get set, they can both be pretty nasty. That raises the stakes of each transition possession. You just have to take advantage because there won't be a ton of clean looks in the halfcourt.  Role players in the spotlight: Kansas needs to get Tre White humming again. The well-traveled wing has been so good for the Jayhawks, but he's lost a bit of his steam lately. Part of that could be the after-effects from dealing with a painful root canal procedure. This could be a get-right spot for White. On paper, he has a tasty individual matchup with Cincinnati's Jalen Celestine, who is mainly on the floor to make 3-pointers, not strap up defensively. A good day for White could tilt the scales here. On the other hand, Cincinnati guard Sencire Harris is one of the best point-of-attack defenders in the sport. When he's on the floor, he will get right up into Melvin Council Jr. or Darryn Peterson. Kansas can't let Harris change the game with his energy. He is a total dawg who ain't afraid of anybody.  Where to watch Kansas vs. Cincinnati live Date: Saturday, Feb. 21| Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Allen Fieldhouse -- Lawrence, Kansas TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium    Kansas vs. Cincinnati prediction, pick \nKansas has plenty of schematic edges in this one, but Cincinnati could be a touch undervalued here in a game that could be a low-possession affair between two defenses that give each other problems. The double-big lineup of Miller and Thiam is mobile enough to hang with Bidunga and Tiller, and Cincinnati's guards won't give up straight-line drives to Council. Cincinnati will unquestionably flood the paint and force Kansas' low-volume 3-point shooters to bomb away over the top. That's the right strategy against everyone on this Kansas roster, except for Peterson. There's also the lookahead spot to Kansas' enormous Big Monday tilt with No. 4 Houston, and if Peterson misses a good chunk of the second half again — which feels inevitable — the door is open for a backdoor cover. Kansas wins but Cincinnati stays inside this number.

    "body": "\n        When a Knoxville judge denied Joey Aguilar's preliminary injunction on Friday, it left Tennessee with a lot of uncertainty at quarterback. Uncertainty isn't necessarily bad, but it means the range of outcomes for the 2026 Volunteers just got a lot wider.In his lone season with Tennessee, Aguilar exceeded expectations considering the circumstances that led to his arrival in Knoxville. Aguilar completed 67.3% of his passes and threw for 3,565 yards (third in the SEC) and 24 touchdowns, all while leading an offense that scored 39.8 points per game (sixth in the country).Those gaudy numbers were also accompanied by some warts. For starters, Aguilar threw 10 interceptions -- some of them coming at inopportune times in big games. His pick six right before halftime completely changed the complexion of the Alabama game, and his two first-half interceptions -- plus a fumble resulting in a scoop and score -- against Oklahoma were too much for Tennessee to overcome.If Aguilar had been able to return for the 2026 season, the Vols would've had stability at the most important position on the field. The floor would've been relatively high, and with Jim Knowles running a revamped defense, a College Football Playoff berth would have been on the table.\n\n        \n            \n                SEC football power rankings 2026: Texas, Georgia lead the way as Alabama slides down league's pecking order\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAll that said, Aguilar turns 25 years old in June. How much more developing could he do at the college level? At this point in his career, his ceiling is probably capped. That's why, although the uncertainty of the current quarterback situation can be nerve-wracking, it can also be exciting.Tennessee has a few options to lead the offense in 2026. Redshirt freshman George MacIntyre, true freshman Faizon Brandon and Colorado transfer Ryan Staub are all in the mix. There isn't much college experience in that trio, but there is quite a bit of talent, especially when it comes to the first two.Can Josh Heupel find someone who can elevate the ceiling of his football team?George MacIntyreA Tennessee native, MacIntyre was a four-star recruit out of Brentwood Academy in the Class of 2025. As a true freshman last season, MacIntyre appeared in just two games and attempted nine passes, so it's hard to glean anything from the very little we've seen from him in Knoxville.\nWhat we do know about MacIntyre is that he's hard to miss at 6-foot-6 and has a good arm. Listed at 195 pounds on Tennessee's website, MacIntyre will have to fill out his frame, but that's why Heupel spent money to hire new strength coach Derek Owings.The obvious advantage that MacIntyre has over the other two quarterbacks in this position battle is his familiarity with the offense after spending a year learning the system. Between that and an offseason in the weight room with Owings, it's not hard to imagine MacIntyre taking a step forward and winning the starting job in camp. It's also notable that MacIntyre stuck around while fellow backup quarterback Jake Merklinger transferred to UConn.Faizon BrandonThe most tantalizing prospect in Tennessee's quarterback room is Brandon, a five-star recruit and the No. 3 quarterback in the 2026 signing class. While Brandon has yet to step onto the field in college, but his high school resume is very impressive. Brandon went 35-1 as a starter at Grimsley High School in North Carolina, and he led the team to back-to-back state championships in 2024 and 2025.\nBrandon also has all the physical traits you could want in a quarterback. He stands at just over 6-foot-3 and weighs 200 pounds while also posting a time of 4.18 seconds in the shuttle. According to his 247Sports scouting report, Brandon possesses a strong arm and the mobility to extend plays. 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins sees him as a future first-round pick with a comparison to Geno Smith.Brandon may be the quarterback of the future in Knoxville, but how soon will the future arrive? Brandon is an extremely young prospect who won't turn 18 until June, and he missed a large portion of his senior season due to injury.His upside is enormous, but Brandon have to learn the offense and get acclimated to the college game in a matter of months.\nRyan StaubStaub was a three-star recruit coming out of California in the 2023 signing class, and he was the No. 110  quarterback player in the latest transfer cycle. In his three-year career at Colorado, Staub played in 12 games while completing 53.5% of his passes for 681 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions.This past season, Staub started one game for the Buffaloes, and it was a rough outing. On the road against Houston, Staub threw for 204 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in a 36-20 loss.From the outside looking in, Staub seems more like an insurance policy rather than a leading candidate to win the starting job. If neither of the younger quarterbacks pan, or injuries strike during the season, Heupel can turn to a player with some degree of Power Four experience.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Although Ryan Garcia has tried his best throughout the build to their WBC welterweight title clash to frame his former trainer's hiring by opponent Mario Barrios as an act of treason, Joe Goossen's presence is likely to play a key role in the result of Saturday's pay-per-view headliner. Goossen, the 72-year-old broadcaster and Hall-of-Fame trainer, has had a relationship with Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs) dating back to his amateur days and worked his corner as head trainer for three consecutive fights, culminating in a 2023 PPV knockout loss to Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis.Despite the fact that Garcia and Goossen parted ways on good terms (amid industry rumors that questioned Garcia's work ethic and suggested he never truly bought in to Goossen's teachings), Garcia used the storyline to create a circus of their introductory press conference in January to announce this weekend's fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Not only did the 27-year-old Garcia, a native of Victorville, California, join his father/trainer Henry in attempting to create a soap opera by feigning heartbreak over Goossen's decision, the younger Garcia also presented a t-shirt with Goossen's name on the front and the word \"traitor\" on the back and threw it at his former coach. \nWhen asked by CBS Sports on Tuesday whether he was truly emotional over the situation or whether this was yet another attempt by the enigmatic Garcia to stir the pot and play mental games with his opponent, \"King Ryan\" shared a sly smile.\"I don't know how I actually feel about it, I just know my first instinct was a little laughter within myself,\" Garcia said. \"[I thought to myself,] 'That's pretty, pretty funny.' I say that with sarcasm. I wonder if [Barrios] even thought about it. Did he think about it? I guess nobody gives a f--- in this game. Cool, let's f---ing go. Now, I'm really going to rip this dude's head off and I'm going to beat his ass in front of [Goossen] bad.\"It's always a little bit of motivation within myself. It's almost as if you want to whip his ass more just to show them that I don't care who is training him, I'll whip his ass bad.\"\nFrom the perspective of Barrios, a 30-year-old from San Antonio, there isn't a single part of the Garcia-led sideshow that matters to him ahead of the fight. In fact, he claims his decision to part ways with trainer Bob Santos in favor of Goossen had nothing to do with Garcia at all. \"The move to go be with Joe was going to happen whether this fight with Ryan was made or not,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I was looking at what steps I wanted to make moving forward to continue to grow as a fighter and work on myself. I wanted to get back to some of the things that got me this far in the first place. I think it's just a lot of noise and drama. I feel like the press conference didn't have anything to do with me. It just had everything to do with Joe Goossen, Ryan and their past.\"The reason why Goossen's role is so integral to this fight is because he knows so much about what makes the inconsistent Garcia tick. For as spectacular as Garcia can look in one fight, he has so routinely battled with mental health challenges and outside-the-ring controversies that he has yet to fulfill the huge potential that comes along with his lightning fast hands, snapping power and gigantic social media following as a boxing superstar who organically built his image and following. \nGarcia looked sensational in dropping Devin Haney three times in their 2024 title clash but had his decision win overturned after he tested positive for the banned substance ostarine and engaged in one public meltdown after another during his one-year suspension. Garcia returned last May against WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero as a heavy favorite but was dropped in Round 2 en route to losing a bizarre and lifeless decision. \"You know, there are many reasons [for the Romero loss in New York's Times Square,]\" Garcia said.\" It's very interesting looking back at how the energy actually was and why it was that way. I have my speculations but I don't even want to look back because I know right here is in front of me. I'm just looking forward to this moment and that's it because this has better vibes and you know that.\"Barrios doesn't just have inside knowledge on Garcia with Goossen, however, he also has the perfect coach (known for his offensive approach and ability to resurrect struggling boxers) to potentially bring back the fire in him that has been lacking in recent fights. \nIn 2023, Barrios looked as if his career had turned a major corner when he widely outpointed and retired former champion Yordenis Ugas to capture the WBC interim title. But a string of inconsistent performances followed as Barrios was forced to settle for back-to-back draws in title defenses against Abel Ramos in 2024 and 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July while being criticized for not doing enough offensively when it mattered. \"I definitely feel like people are always going to talk and write your name off,\" Barrios said. \"You can go in there and perform sensationally and there will always be somebody that will find something. I am definitely proud of [my performance against] Pacquiao but there are things I would've done differently. I definitely should have pressed the gas early on and I think it would have been a different fight. That's why I think there wasn't much interest in a rematch. I feel like they knew that it's the best that he can look right now.\"\nGarcia remains the betting favorite against Barrios largely because of his brighter ceiling of potential and the fact that Barrios, who has previously headlined PPVs against Keith Thurman and Davis, has yet to win a major fight in which his face has been on the poster. But Garcia also needs to prove entering his fourth division that he can finally win a recognized world title and that his best performance to date against Haney wasn't a result of banned substance use.\n\"I do see it favoring me but it's because I'm the better fighter, that's it,\" Garcia said. \"That's what I have been putting into this camp. I see [Barrios] as a warrior that has been through a little bit of wars that is starting to wear him down. I don't think the new trainer switch into a fight like this is a good move and he's about to find out that it ain't a good move, at all. I think it's all going to backfire.\"Barrios, who questioned Garcia's ability to deal with setbacks inside the ring and adjust, is hoping that his new union with Goossen allows him to showcase all of his talents at the same time. \"We have a dangerous Ryan in front of us and a very unpredictable Ryan but I am a champion. I have to just act accordingly and perform as a champion,\" Barrios said. \"Earlier in my career, I was a lot more aggressive and had a much higher punch output. My team and I sat down and decided why not a change of scenery? Why not choose a coach who has been there countless number of times and has had great success with so many people? We have to imagine we are facing the best version of Ryan and if it's any less, that's going to be for him to answer.\"\nThe undercard on Saturday features plenty of intriguing players in the 140-pound division. IBF junior welterweight champion Richardson Hitchins is back in action when he takes Oscar Duarte in the co-main event. Plus, WBA junior welterweight king Gary Antuanne Russell gets a tough test from Andy Hiraoka in a featured bout. And former title challenger Frank Martin is in action when he faces Nahir Albright with both men looking to get back to the title level.\"As far as Oscar [Duarte] saying I'm a basic fighter, if you look at my resume, every guy that I fought nobody has done to them what I've done to them,\" Hitchins said at the final press conference. \"This guy has been spoon fed his whole career. When he gets in front of me, I'll show him there's levels to this and that I'm far from a basic fighter.\"Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds from getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nBarrios vs. Garcia fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookRyan Garcia -250 vs. Mario Barrios (c) +195, WBC welterweight titleRichardson Hitchins (c) -380 vs. Oscar Duarte +280, IBF junior welterweight titleGary Antuanne Russell (c) -350 vs. Andy Hiraoka +260, WBA junior welterweight titleFrank Martin -390 vs. Nahir Albright +290, junior welterweightsPredictionThe flaws and inconsistencies of both fighters have the potential to play as big a role in the outcome of the fight as do their respective strengths. Garcia completely fell apart mentally in losses to both Davis and Romero as soon as he felt their heavy power flush in the early going. The problem for Barrios, however, is that he isn't a puncher at 147 pounds on the level of either of those names. When Barrios is at his best, he's an aggressive boxer who goes to the body and leads the dance. But like Garcia, at his worst, he can lose focus in a hurry and begin to follow his opponent around. \nThe X-factor in this fight is undoubtedly going to be the hand speed and power of Garcia, who by far owns the biggest weapons in the matchup. Even if Barrios, who is the more consistent boxer of the two in recent years, can build an early lead, the potential for Garcia to package knockdowns in an effort to build a formidable lead on the scorecards is there, even if he doesn't score a finish against the durable Barrios. Pick: Garcia via UD12Who wins Mario Barrios vs. Ryan Garcia on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday welterweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour did not wait long to offer its second signature event of the season, as the circuit will bring the best players in the world down the California coast to Los Angeles, where they will compete in Tiger Woods' tournament, which returns to Riviera Country Club after a one-year absence.In 2025, the Genesis Invitational had to move to Torrey Pines due to the devastating fires in L.A., so Riviera will certainly be a welcome sight for all involved. There are four past champions of this event in the field this week -- Ludvig Åberg (reigning champion), Hideki Matsuyama, Max Homa and Adam Scott -- but the biggest names in the field will all be vying for their first wins at Riviera. That list includes Scottie Scheffler, who has made furious comebacks the last two weeks to finish in the top 3 after slow starts, and Rory McIlroy, who began his 2026 PGA Tour season with an up-and-down T14 finish in Pebble Beach.Scheffler was tasked with making another significant comeback just to fall inside the cut this week, while McIlroy opened the second and third rounds just one shot back of the lead, putting himself in position to win the second signature event of the 2025 season. Follow the action live with 2025 Genesis Invitational leaderboard updates throughout Round 3 on Saturday.\nCollin Morikawa is back in action after winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am for his first victory on the PGA Tour since 2023, showing the form that once made him the No. 2 player in the world. Tommy Fleetwood, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley and Patrick Cantlay rounded out the group of favorites this week in L.A., as they all hope to receive a trophy from Woods and a big winner's check at the end of the week. Here's how you can watch Scheffler, McIlroy and everyone else competing at Tiger's event this week. 2026 Genesis Invitational TV scheduleAll times Eastern Round 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 10:15 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 10:15 a.m. - 7 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports App\nLive TV coverage: 3-7 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-7 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppRadio: 1-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 9:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 9:45 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A middleweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston. Former UFC champion Sean Strickland looks to bounce back against red-hot contender Anthony Hernandez.Strickland (29-7) has a new path to the middleweight title after Khamzat Chiamev became champion. Strickland was unlikely to get a third crack at Dricus du Plessis after two failed attempts. But Chimaev vs. Strickland is a fresh matchup. Between Strickland's No. 3 middleweight ranking and name value, it's feasible he could sneak ahead of the more deserving title challenger Nassourdine Imavov. Strickland has to beat Hernandez before those conversations can start. Oddsmakers think that's a tall task; Strickland disagrees.\"He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\"  Strickland told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell before the fight. \"So, no, he's not [on my level].\"Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nHernandez (15-2, 1 NC) is ready for his breakout moment after taking the long road through the division. \"Fluffy\" was won eight consecutive fights with six finishes. He's days away from potentially having the third longest middleweight win streak in UFC history. Beating Strickland would be the biggest accomplishment of his career, and puts him on par with Imavov as the most deserving middleweight title challenger. In fact, \"Fluffy\" would arguably have a better case than Imavov, boasting a longer win streak and just as many wins over former UFC champs.\"I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement  because everybody is really good here,\" Hernandez said. \"Someone who has already done that  shit, you go out there and take him out? You are sitting in a really  good place.\"  Bet UFC Fight Night at DraftKings and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. \"I didn't have the energy for anything. I didn't prepare right. The weight cuts were terrible,\" Neal told CBS sports this week. \"There was a point before all that shit happen, I'd run for an hour at a seven mile pace. I'm knocking out eight point six miles in an hour. I'm trying to get back to the old me.\"\"I had trauma to my eyes,\" Ige said. \"My mindset going into that fight was, 'I don't know if I'll ever fight again.' I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn't want a way out of the fight. I knew if I went to a doctor, they would tell me not to fight. That's my ego and my pride. I've battled with that for a long time. I probably should've addressed it, but I didn't... It's something I've always battled, but I'm getting better with it. I have a better relationship with myself and my thoughts. Things are night and day different.\" \nElsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off. Delija is looking to bounce back from a surprising knockout loss to rising contender Waldo Cortes Acosta in November. Prior to that, Delija scored two first-round knockouts in his first two UFC appearances. And an interesting UFC debut is set at welterweight when Josiah Harrell takes on Jacobe Smith. Harrell was scheduled to make his promotional debut at UFC 290 against Jack Della Maddalena, but during his fight week medical screening, doctors discovered he had Moyamoya, a rare brain disease that causes the arteries supplying blood to the brain to become narrowed or blocked. Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassAnthony Hernandez -278Sean Strickland +225MiddleweightGeoff Neal -218Uros Medic +180WelterweightMelquizael Costa -218Dan Ige +180FeatherweightAnte Delija -142Sergehi Spivac +120HeavyweightJacobe Smith -310Josiah Harrell +250WelterweightMichel Pereira -155Zach Reese +130MiddleweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Feb. 21 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Toyota Center -- HoustonStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionSean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez: I'm surprised with how far apart the odds are. Hernandez is taking a meaningful step up in competition against arguably the division's most frustrating defensive fighter. Strickland has elite experience and is uniquely equipped to limit his opponent's offense. Hernandez also has serious gaps in his defensive striking that Strickland can exploit. That being said, I'll side with the rising tide. Hernandez is a menace when he has grappling control and half guard on the ground. Strickland did a fantastic job stuffing du Plessis' takedowns and getting off the mat quickly. \"Fluffy\" lacks DDP's physicality, but makes up for it with tenacious chain wrestling and far better top control. Hernandez will have a tough time taking Strickland down. When he does, he'll make the most of it. Enough to win a close decision against a former champ who can certainly play spoiler. Pick: Hernandez via Split DecisionWho wins Strickland vs. Hernandez, and which UFC best bet of over +500 should you be all over? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the advanced model which showed a 6.1% ROI from over 500 fights from 2023-25, and find out.\n            ",

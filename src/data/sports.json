This is the fifth SEC Title Game meeting between the programs, with Bama winning the previous four. Georgia (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is coming off a Friday win over Georgia Tech, 16-9, while Alabama (10-2, 7-1 SEC) enters off a Saturday victory over Auburn, 27-20. The Tide have won a record 11 SEC Championship Games, while Georgia has won five times previously.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Tide have won three straight meetings with Georgia, including a 24-21 win on Sep. 27.

Georgia ran all over Bama in their September matchup to the tune of 227 yards on 6.9 yards per carry. That's the most yards Bama allowed to an SEC team all year, and the Tide run defense is still shaky after giving up 152 yards on the ground to Auburn last week. Georgia boasts RB Nate Frazier, who ranks sixth in the SEC with 5.6 yards per carry, as well as WR Zachariah Branch, who tops the SEC with 68 catches. Also, one can't dismiss that Georgia last played on Friday, with Bama on Saturday, and the Tide have covered just once over their last six games when having a rest disadvantage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Alabama can coverBama has two streaks in its favor over Georgia, starting with the fact that the Tide are 4-0 all-time versus the Bulldogs in the SEC Title Game. Additionally, Alabama has won each of its last three meetings with UGA, with two of those coming since Kalen DeBoer replaced Nick Saban. This season, the Crimson Tide are 8-4 ATS, whereas the Bulldogs are just 5-7 versus the line, including failing to cover in each of their last two games. Bama QB, Ty Simpson, owns a 25:4 TD:INT, and he's complemented by a defense which has been its typical dominant self as of late. The Tide haven't allowed more than two touchdowns in each of their last five games, and they'll see a team on Saturday that has a negative turnover differential on the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Alabama vs. Georgia picksSportsLine's model has simulated Georgia vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan appeared in court Friday to testify against NASCAR in an antitrust trial. The Basketball Hall of Famer, who co-owns the NASCAR Cup Series team 23XI Racing with driver Denny Hamlin, was called to the witness stand at a North Carolina federal courthouse and spoke out against the racing company's business model.23XI joined Front Row Motorsports to allege that NASCAR committed antitrust violations, and both teams refused to sign the company's new charter agreement which began in the 2025 season. The teams claim that NASCAR's charters are monopolistic and seek changes to the business model.\"Someone had to step forward and challenge the entity,\" Jordan said to the jury. \"I sat in those meetings with longtime owners who were brow-beaten for so many years trying to make change. I was a new person, I wasn't afraid. I felt I could challenge NASCAR as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.\"The charter system is similar to the franchise model used by other American sports leagues, and it guarantees participation in races and revenue from those races. 23XI and Front Row argue that the revenue model is not viable, though, and they claim that the terms of the charters create a monopolistic environment wherein NASCAR holds exclusivity clauses and tight control over many aspects of the series.While teams asked during negotiations for the renewable charters to become permanent, NASCAR refused. Teams were given just six hours in September 2024 to sign extensions. 23XI and Front Row were the only two to refuse.\n\"One, I didn't think it was economically viable,\" Jordan said, explaining why his team refused to sign. \"Two, it said you could not sue NASCAR. That was an antitrust violation, I felt. Three, they gave us an ultimatum I didn't think was fair to 23XI.\"Jordan and Hamlin formed 23XI in 2020 with Bubba Wallace as their first driver. They secured three full-time entries over the ensuing years, but rather than renewing for the seven-year period, they entered a legal battle with NASCAR.\"I wanted a partnership and permanent charters wasn't even a consideration,\" Jordan said. \"The pillars that the teams wanted, no one on the NASCAR side even negotiated or compromised. They were not even open-minded to welcome those conversations, so this is where we ended up.\"\nIf 23XI and Front Row win the trial, the ramifications for NASCAR could be severe. Not only would it likely owe damages, but it could be forced to significantly change its business model. If the court rules in favor of NASCAR, however, it could seek buyers for the charters that 23XI and Front Row declined to renew without making drastic changes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The wait is finally over. After a supersized 2026 FIFA World Cup draw that pushed broadcast windows to the limits, we now know the official teams and groups for next summer's tournament. The global event will be hosted in North America by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and begins on June 11. All draw predictions are now a thing of the past, and all the hypotheticals are faded into dust now that the draw is complete. The three hosts have some level of pressure on them, especially the U.S. men's national team, as the instant reaction is that they lucked into a favorable draw. What does the path look like for Mexico moving forward? Let's break down Group A:Mexico's World Cup opponents Group AMexicoSouth KoreaSouth AfricaThe winner of FIFA playoffs: Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, IrelandSo El Tri went ahead and found themselves in a puzzler of a group. Maybe they could be considered favorites in this one, but perhaps not.Mexico, having the honor of being one of the hosts, means that they were already honored with a bit of luck, being placed at the top of Group A. As a host nation, they were spared facing many of football's giants in Brazil and Argentina, or European titans in France and Spain, as a reward. However, it also means that it leaves more question marks about their form and how it could look against teams that could be considered underdogs. It's definitely not the group of death, but it's also not quite a group of life. \nEl Tri themselves in the group against South Korea, South Africa, and the eventual winner of the FIFA playoff winner D. The future winner means either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, or Ireland will join Group A for the 2026 World Cup. There are plenty of teams that will hold Mexico's hand down the tournament memory lane.The order of the draw means Mexico will host South Africa on June 11 as the first game of the 2026 World Cup. It's a throwback to the 2010 World Cup opener, where the two sides ended in a 1-1 draw, but these are different teams from back then. South Africa will arrive confident, fresh off AFCON, with an impressive goalkeeper in Ronwen Williams. It could be a bit of a trap game for Mexico as the first match of a group stage is often the most nervy and often difficult for even the group favorites (just ask Argentina). Whoever ends up winning the European playoff, this group will be difficult for El Tri. They have often struggled to get wins against European teams, despite the historic 2018 win against Germany, and they lost 4-2 to Switzerland earlier this year. \nDenmark, Ireland, and Czechia will be steadfast in their approaches as they'll be the final matchday competition, and that's where things always get spicy. Each are three programs that are no strangers to World Cups, with Denmark in more recent tournaments, while North Macedonia would be World Cup debutants, and it's always the newcomers who have the most to prove. So who could be the team to rival Mexico for a spot out of Group A?South Korea once againIf the home opener tests Mexico's tournament stomach, South Korea will be a battle of overall tactical quality. Not only did the two teams face each other to a 2-2 stalemate in September, but Mexico defeated South Korea 2-1 in the 2018 World Cup. The Taegeuk Warriors returned some of the favor in 2022 when they advanced to the knockouts from their respective group, while Mexico was eliminated in theirs. They are led by the iconic captain Son Heung-min, who now plays in the United States in MLS, and other European-based stars, including Kim Min-jae and Lee Kang-in.\nThey do not have to carry the burdens of home soil, and they might even have some home crowd favor, as Mexico is known for having a significant Korean population with several cultural hubs across Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Anything can happen, but this matchday two head-to-head could very well determine the first-place winner of the group. What's nextMexico will open the World Cup against South Africa on June 11, and five days later, face South Korea, before closing out the group stage against either Denmark, Ireland, Czechia, or North Macedonia. Ultimately, the draw was about as kind to Mexico as they could've hoped. Now they have to face the reality of their form. With six months in front of the World Cup, there is a path back toward the knockout rounds, a level they failed to reach in 2022.However, the pressures of playing at home and a nation begging for the team to rekindle belief in the squad, combined with the threat of three other ambitious opponents, mean El Tri can only go as far as they will take themselves. They now know the streets of the group stage; next will be to take the first steps of the journey. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, an increase in squads also means more restrictions on which teams could be drawn together. On the heels of a winter World Cup in 2022 in Qatar, followed by the Euros and both UEFA and Concacaf Nations Leagues taking place, the start of World Cup qualifying was pushed back, leading to the play-in games taking place during March of 2026 after the World Cup draw has already been completed.During the draw on Friday, when Uzbekistan were drawn, groups had to be skipped, causing some confusion. Putting the Asian side into Group K alongside Portugal, Colombia, and the winner of the Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia) was necessary. That's because putting them anywhere else would've potentially complicated things, resulting in a situation where there were two teams from the same confederation, which is not permitted, outside of UEFA. Because the playoff winners are not known, avoiding the possibility of having two teams from the same confederation had to be prevented.\nThe standard restrictions were in play that impact any World Cup. However, UEFA is required to have two groups of two of its teams due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament from Europe. But looking at the draw mechanics, the playoffs containing teams from multiple different confederations meant that restrictions had to be applied more than once.For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions were applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams. That already created limited chances, but with DR Congo, Jamaica, and New Caledonia representing CAF, Concacaf, and OFC, there was almost no other group that they could go into to further limit options.\nIf playoffs took place before the World Cup draw, that wouldn't be an issue, but in an expanded World Cup, new quirks are created. It's something that may be able to be smoothed out ahead of the 2030 World Cup, but it made for a moment where people didn't know where a team was going. It will take until the March international break for the full World Cup field to be known, but the picture is becoming clearer by the day.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final game of the 2025 college football regular season is the college football game of the year: the No. 1 Ohio State Buckeyes vs. the No. 2 Indiana Hoosiers (12-0) in the Big Ten Championship Game on Saturday.The conference title, the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff and possibly the Heisman Trophy will be on the line when these teams collide at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. One year after winning the CFP national championship, the Buckeyes (12-0) have cruised through the regular season, playing only one game that was decided by fewer than 18 points. Freshman quarterback Julian Sayin leads the country in completion percentage (78.9) and passing efficiency (184.9). Bet college football's championship week, including Ohio State vs. Indiana, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets. Click here to sign up:Meanwhile, the Hoosiers (12-0) have played just two games decided by one score. Transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza tops the nation in passing touchdowns (32) and is second in passing efficiency (183.7).Top sportsbooks have made Ohio State a 4-point favorite over Indiana. The line has dropped from -6.5.So what should you make of all that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Buckeyes-Hoosiers point spread, as well as the line movement of four other conference championship games. All times Eastern.No. 4 Texas Tech vs. No. 11 BYU (noon)Open: Texas Tech -11.5Current: Texas Tech -12.5The Big 12 Championship Game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, is a rematch of a game played earlier this season in Lubbock, which the Red Raiders won 29-7. That final score doesn't truly indicate how dominant Texas Tech was; the Red Raiders settled for five field goals in the game but still led 26-0 midway through the fourth quarter. That certainly is one reason this line has moved in favor of Tech. Also, the Red Raiders (11-1) are undefeated this season when quarterback Behren Morton starts. Meanwhile, BYU (11-1) seems to have gotten a lot of mileage in the rankings out of a three-point win over Utah. If Texas Tech doesn't come in overconfident, the favorite seems to be the right side.Bet championship week college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Miami (Ohio) vs. Western Michigan (noon)Open: Western Michigan -2.5Current: Western Michigan -1.5The MAC Championship Game also is a rematch. On Oct. 25, Miami rallied for a 26-17 victory over Western Michigan in Oxford, Ohio, after scoring 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. The RedHawks were a 2-point favorite in that game at home, so the Broncos' being a slight favorite at a neutral site (Ford Field in Detroit) seems to make sense. Western Michigan backers shouldn't be scared off by the slight line movement, but Miami supporters may want to consider the money line (+105) instead of the point spread.No. 3 Georgia vs. No. 9 Alabama (4 p.m.)Open: Pick 'em Current: Georgia -2.5Even though the Crimson Tide (10-2) have owned the Bulldogs (11-1) recently, including a 24-21 victory in Athens earlier this season, I was surprised when the SEC Championship Game opened as a pick 'em. Georgia seems to be playing its best football of the year, while Alabama has been inconsistent down the stretch. In addition, Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart is a master at getting his team to play with an edge in these types of showdowns. I expect a highly motivated Georgia team to play one of its best games of the year. Bulldogs backers should hop on this line soon, as current prices suggest this may move to -3.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 17 Virginia vs. Duke (8 p.m.)Open: Virginia -2.5Current: Virginia -4The ACC Championship Game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is another rematch of a game played earlier this season. Just three weeks ago the Cavaliers blew out the Blue Devils, 34-17, in Durham, N.C., in a game Virginia led 31-3 entering the fourth quarter. That result has helped this line shift even more in favor of the Cavaliers. In addition, since Duke qualified for the ACC title game despite being 7-5, there has been a lot of talk about the Blue Devils' worthiness -- or lack thereof -- which almost certainly has influenced the early betting. Over the last five games, Duke's defense has allowed 34.6 points per game. This movement seems more like a market correction.No. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 2 Indiana (8 p.m.)Open: Ohio State -6.5Current: Ohio State -4Though the Buckeyes opened as 6.5-point favorites at Circa, the lookahead line for this game was Ohio State -3.5 two weeks ago, so -4 seems to be the right number for the Big Ten Championship Game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Very little seems to separate these teams. The Buckeyes lead the country in scoring defense (7.8 points per game), while the Hoosiers are second (10.9). Indiana is second in the nation in scoring offense (44.3), while Ohio State is 13th (37.0). The big question with the Buckeyes is whether they will experience a letdown one week after finally beating hated rival Michigan. If you have a strong opinion on this game, I wouldn't be afraid to jump on a number you like as I don't see the line moving significantly prior to kickoff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- When Zac Taylor was finalizing his coaching staff following the 2020 NFL season, he reached out to Ben Johnson and offered him a job, but here's the twist: Taylor wanted the offensive-minded Johnson to coach on the defensive side of the ball.That might sound a little bizarre, but there's an explanation behind it. Taylor and Johnson entered the NFL together in 2012 when both of them were hired to serve on Joe Philbin's staff with the Miami Dolphins. It was the first NFL coaching job for both guys and they ended up working together for four seasons. Although they went their separate ways following the 2015 season, they almost reunited a few years later in Cincinnati. Taylor had just finished his second season coaching the Bengals, and at the time, he was hoping to add Johnson to his staff. Johnson had just finished his second season in Detroit, but his future was up in the air, because the head coach who had hired him (Matt Patricia) had just been fired. From 2012 thru 2020, Johnson always coached on the offensive side of the ball, but the Bengals didn't have any openings on that side of the ball, so Taylor offered to bring in Johnson as a quality control coach on the defensive side of the ball. \n\"He was out [in Detroit] and we didn't have any openings on offense,\" Taylor said of Johnson. \"After the 2020 season, we hadn't yet hired [quality control] coaches on defense. We did not have an offensive opening so I just wanted to get him on the staff. So we both knew he could come in on defense and help the defense. That was the only opening we had.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 14 picks: Our experts face off on Joe Burrow vs. Josh Allen, other crucial matchups\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJohnson was an offensive quality control coach for the Lions in 2019 before being promoted to tight ends coach in 2020 with Detroit. In the NFL, asking an offensive minded coach to go to the defensive side of the ball doesn't always work out, but Taylor was confident that Johnson would have been able to easily pull it off. \"He was just really smart that way where that translates -- in a [quality control] coach sense -- to any side of the ball,\" Taylor said. \"You don't always want to have guys to do that, but Ben could have done it.\"\nIf Johnson had been hired, Taylor said that he wouldn't have been a defensive coach for very long. \"We would have eventually got him over to offense when it made sense,\" Taylor said. In the end, Johnson ended up staying in Detroit and that's because the Lions ended up hiring someone he was familiar with: Dan Campbell. Johnson coached with Cambell from 2012 thru 2015 on the same Dolphins' coaching staff that also included Taylor.\nAfter serving as the tight ends coach in 2020 under Patricia, Johnson stayed on in the same role in 2021 with Campbell. After that, he was promoted to passing game coordinator in 2022, and then he was moved up to offensive coordinator in 2023, and the rest, as they say, is history. There's a bizarro world where Johnson takes the Bengals' job and eventually gets moved over to the offensive side of the ball where he helps Taylor design plays for Joe Burrow, but that didn't happen. Instead, we're in a world that's equally bizarre where Johnson has the Bears as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC heading into Week 14. Johnson has the Bears at 9-3, which includes a 47-42 win over Taylor's Bengals in Week 9 that was one of the wildest games of the season in the NFL. Although Taylor and Johnson didn't end up coaching together, Johnson does have a Taylor on his coaching staff: Zac Taylor's brother, Press Taylor, is the passing game coordinator for the Bears. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NBA champion Elden Campbell has died at 57 years old. The 15-year NBA veteran spent nine years with the Los Angeles Lakers, four years with the former Charlotte Hornets, as well as stops with the Detroit Pistons, the former New Orleans Hornets, Seattle SuperSonics and former New Jersey Nets.Campbell's Dec. 1 death was the result of a drowning, Broward County chief of investigative services Thomas Steinkamp said to People. The Broward County Sheriff's Office said the death was accidental.A first-round draft pick, Campbell was selected 27th overall by the Lakers in 1990. He blossomed into a 15 points per game scorer on a team with Shaquille O'Neal and a rookie Kobe Bryant during the 1996-97 season. He was an integral two-way player on those early-to-mid '90s Lakers teams, and was the second-leading scorer for the team during the 1994-95 playoffs.Though Campbell is most well known for his time with the Lakers, he won a championship with the Pistons in 2004, where he beat his former team during the NBA Finals. \nPrior to starting his NBA career, Campbell was a standout college player at Clemson, where he was a two-time All ACC player, and led the Tigers to what is still their only regular season conference title during the 1990 season. Campbell averaged 16.4 points during that season and led the ACC in blocks per game in three out of his four years. During his senior year, Campbell helped lead Clemson to a Sweet 16 finish.Campbell is still Clemson's all-time leading scorer with 1,880 career points, and is second in total blocks. Cliff Ellis, who was Campbell's coach at Clemson, expressed how important the big man was to the Tigers' success.\"I am deeply saddened to learn of Elden Campbell's passing,\"  Ellis said in a statement via the Los Angeles Times. \"Elden was a great player for four years, especially in 1989-90 when he was a major reason we won Clemson's only ACC regular season championship. ... But most of all, Elden was an outstanding, giving person. This is a sad day for the Clemson family.\"\nNBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, who played two seasons with Campbell, shared his thoughts about his former teammate's death on social media. \"I just received devastating news that my former Lakers teammate and friend Elden Campbell has passed away. He was such a gentle soul. As a basketball player, he was extremely athletic. I loved throwing lobs to Elden because he could jump out the gym and had so much talent! Cookie and I are praying for his family and Lakers Nation as they mourn during this difficult time. Rest in peace Big E!\"The Lakers also shared their condolences with a social media post.\nSeveral of Campbell's former teammates took to social media to express their sadness over the news, including Cedric Ceballos. \"This one hurt to the bone,\" Ceballos wrote on an Instagram post with a picture of Campbell. \"Grew up as kids together.\"\nCampbell was a member of the 2025 Southern California Basketball Hall of Fame, and was named to Clemson's Hall of Fame in 2000.\n            ",

Here's the full list of the groups: \nGroup A: Mexico, Korea Republic, South Africa, UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/North Macedonia)Group B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar, UEFA Playoff A (Italy/Northern Ireland/Wales/Bosnia and Herzegovina)Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, HaitiGroup D: USA, Australia, Paraguay, UEFA Playoff D (Turkiye/Romania/Slovakia/Kosovo)Group E: Germany, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, CuracaoGroup F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania)Group G: Belgium, Iran, Egypt, New ZealandGroup H: Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Cabo VerdeGroup I: France, Senegal, Norway, Intercontinental Playoff 2 (Iraq/Bolivia/Suriname)Group J: Argentina, Austria, Algeria, JordanGroup K: Portugal, Colombia, Uzbekistan, Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia)Group L: England, Croatia, Panama, GhanaSo with the draw out of the way, let's take a look at our latest World Cup Power Rankings, with reactions to every team's draw: RankTeamAnalysis1. \t\t\t\tSpain  \t\t\t\tThey've got Lamine Yamal, so there are still the most likely to win the tournament especially after landing Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Cabo Verde. Ah, the last time Saudi Arabia won a match in the group stage it was against Argentina that later won the 2022 World Cup. Might be a good sign. 2. \t\t\t\tArgentina \t\t\t\tTalking about the 2022 World Cup winners, they still have a chance but the group stage isn't as easy as it might look like. Austria and Algeria are strong teams and it won't be easy to win both matches in the group. Lionel Messi is expected to play his last World Cup in his career, and he wants to leave the stage in a good way.       3. \t\t\t\tFrance \t\t\t\tThe group stage will see an incredible matchup between Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland, but also the one against Senegal won't be easy at all for the team coached by Didier Deschamps, who will leave after the tournament before the likely appointment of Zinedine Zidane. 4. \t\t\t\tBrazil  \t\t\t\tThe five-team world champions hired Carlo Ancelotti to cope with the disappointments of the past editions and they were extremely unlucky in the draw as they will face Morocco, Haiti and Scotland in the opening three games that will definitely define the ambitions of this team. 5. \t\t\t\tEngland \t\t\t\tEngland will face Croatia in the group stage in one of the most interesting matches, and they will also meet Panama and Ghana. The Three Lions hired an international manager like Thomas Tuchel to overcome the disappointments of two European finals lost in three years and this is their chance. 6. \t\t\t\tPortugal  \t\t\t\tWe almost had a potential meeting between Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo but we will save it for later in the tournament. Ronaldo's final World Cup will be a historic moment, but this Portugal side are strong enough to dream big. 7. \t\t\t\tNorway   \t\t\t\tHaaland scored 55 goals with Norway in 48 games. If that's not enough to consider them as a big threat to the other teams, what is? They will immediately face Mbappe and France in the group stage for one of the most intriguing games. 8. \t\t\t\tGermany \t\t\t\tThey are always a team to watch at the World Cup, and after their group stage eliminations in 2018 and 2022, they want revenge. First, they will need to get past of Ecuador, Ivory Coast and Curacao.9. \t\t\t\tNetherlands \t\t\t\tThey are strong but they will face Japan and Tunisia in the group stage, and also one between Poland, Sweden, Ukraine and Albania from the UEFA playoff. That could become a factor. 10. \t\t\t\tMorocco  \t\t\t\tThe biggest surprise of the 2022 World Cup when Morocco only lost to France in the semifinals after winning against Spain and then Portugal. They can make it again but they will face Brazil and Scotland in the group stage. That's something that will make things way more difficult for Achraf Hakimi and his teammates. 11. \t\t\t\tUnited States      Let's be honest: Mauricio Pochettino was really lucky. The USMNT will face Australia, Paraguay and the winner of the UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania). It couldn't have gone better. 12. \t\t\t\tBelgium  \t\t\t\tA lot will depend on the form of players like Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku as they might play their last World Cup if they fully recover from their injuries. 13. \t\t\t\tUruguay \t\t\t\tIt will be fun to see Marcelo Bielsa back at the World Cup after he managed Argentina in 2002 and Chile in 2010. Facing Spain in the group stage is not what he was hoping for.      14. \t\t\t\tJapanWatch out for Japan because they are solid and full of talent. Also the younger national teams look competitive and they can achieve big things in the near future. Only Netherlands are a stronger team in their group.  15. \t\t\t\tSouth Korea  \t\t\t\tSon Heung-min is set to play what will be his last World Cup but there is much more to know about this side that surprised the world when they eliminated Germany at the 2018 World Cup. They will meet Mexico, South Africa and the winner of the UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/Republic of Ireland).16. \t\t\t\tCroatia  \t\t\t\tAnother historic national team preparing for an emotional farewell is Croatia, as Luka Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup finalist, is set to play his final tournament. They will face England, Ghana and Panama. They should end up at least in second place in the table. 17. \t\t\t\tMexico  \t\t\t\tThey have the potential to at least qualify for the round of 32 but watch out for their opponents. They will play the opening match against South Africa in what will be one of the most awaited games of the year. 18. \t\t\t\tSwitzerland \t\t\t\tThe team coached by Murat Yakin qualified for the 2026 World Cup with strong ambitions. If Italy qualify for the World Cup, their group with Qatar and Canada will be much more difficult than what it looks like now. 19. \t\t\t\tEcuador \t\t\t\tLa Tri only conceded five goals in the 17 matches played in the World Cup qualifiers, something that really stands out ahead of the tournament. They will need that defensive strength when they will face Germany, Ivory Coast and Curacao.20. \t\t\t\tIran  \t\t\t\tIran dominated their group stage of qualification, losing only one of the 10 games played, we shouldn't underestimate them as they will face Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand. They have real chances to go through. 21. \t\t\t\tCanada \t\t\t\tJesse Marsch will lead Canada at the 2026 World Cup that will be played on their home soil. A lot will depend on who will qualify in the last spot of the group. If Italy do, things will be much more difficult for Canada. 22. \t\t\t\tAustria \t\t\t\tWhen Ralf Rangnick chose to take over as head coach of the Austrian national team, many people questioned his decision. Now, we understand exactly why he made that choice but he will need to show it against 2022 World Cup winner Argentina. 23. \t\t\t\tEgypt \t\t\t\tThe African team failed to win a single match in their World Cup history with an overall record of five defeats and two draws. They now have the chance to make history with Mohamed Salah leading the team in what will likely be his last World Cup. 24. \t\t\t\tSenegal \t\t\t\tThey dominated the group stage of qualifying as they were undefeated, scoring 22 goals and only conceding only three goals but they will face France and Norway in the group phase. It will be difficult. 25. \t\t\t\tScotland \t\t\t\tThey went to the the worst group possible with Brazil and Morocco. They desperately need the best version of Scott McTominay, the 2024–25 Serie A MVP of the season from Napoli.26. \t\t\t\tSaudi Arabia \t\t\t\tAfter a disappointing spell under Roberto Mancini who left the team in 2024, the Saudi Arabian side called back Herve Renard and will face Spain, Uruguay and Cabo Verde in the group stage. 27. \t\t\t\tColombia \t\t\t\tColombia's seventh World Cup appearance comes from a strong qualification group when they ended up tied on points with teams such as Brazil and Uruguay. They will face Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo in the group stage.        28. \t\t\t\tTunisia \t\t\t\tWith 22 goals scored, none conceded, nine wins and one draw, Tunisia have been one of the most impressive teams in the qualifiers. They have chances with Japan and Netherlands, but a lot will depend on who will qualify for the last spot between Sweden, Poland, Albania and Ukraine. 29. \t\t\t\tIvory Coast \t\t\t\tThey did not concede a single goal in the group stage of qualifying, scoring 25 times across 10 matches and finishing with eight wins and two draws but they will need to perform against Curacao, Ecuador and most notably against Germany. 30. \t\t\t\tQatar \t\t\t\tThe 2022 World Cup hosts managed to qualify for their second time ever at the World Cup and are coached by former Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui, who will finally lead a team at the tournament after what happened with Spain in 2018.       31. \t\t\t\tParaguay  \t\t\t\tIt will be the first time Paraguay will play at the World Cup since 2010 and they will face the USMNT and Australia, while they will wait some months to know who is going to be their final opponent between Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.32. \t\t\t\tGhana \t\t\t\tThe African side delivered a strong qualifying campaign, winning eight of their 10 matches but they were really unlucky to get both England and Croatia. 33. \t\t\t\tAustralia \t\t\t\tIn 2022, they only lost to Argentina in the round of 16. As mentioned with the United States, things will be much more difficult if Turkiye join the group. 34. \t\t\t\tAlgeriaManaged at the World Cup by former Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic, Algeria can compete with Jordan and Austria for a spot in the round of 32. No doubt.35. \t\t\t\tJordanJordan made history by qualifying for the World Cup for the first time. They can't miss this chance and not leave their mark in 2026 and they have a chance with Austria and Algeria, but not with Argentina. 36. \t\t\t\tSouth Africa \t\t\t\tBafana Bafana are back at the World Cup for the first time since they hosted the tournament in 2010 and for the first time in the history, the opening match of the World Cup will be a second timer, with South Africa facing Mexico. 37. \t\t\t\tHaiti \t\t\t\tThe 2026 World Cup will mark Haiti's second appearance at the tournament, their first since 1974. They don't have chances to do better this time as they will face Brazil, Morocco and Scotland in the group. Horrible draw. 38. \t\t\t\tPanama \t\t\t\tAfter qualifying for the 2018 World Cup when they lost all three games against England, Belgium and Tunisia, they will face the Three Lions again, hoping to do better.       39. \t\t\t\tCape Verde \t\t\t\tThey qualified for the first time ever at the World Cup and they are ready to shock the world as they have already done in the qualification stages.  \t\t\t\t40. \t\t\t\tUzbekistan  \t\t\t\tAnother team that will feature at the World Cup for the first time in their history and they will be led by 2006 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro, their coach. 41. \t\t\t\tNew Zealand \t\t\t\tSame group with Belgium, Iran and Egypt. Hard to think they can get points here. 42. \t\t\t\tCuracao \t\t\t\tThe smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup will face giants like Germany, Ivory Coast and Ecuador. What a story, but difficult to imagine they can qualify for the round of 32. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top nonconference games of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place Friday night in Nashville, Tennessee, when No. 11 Gonzaga take on No. 18 Kentucky at Bridgestone Arena. This will mark the fourth consecutive season that the programs have faced off, with Gonzaga owning a 2-1 advantage in the series. Last year's game was won by Kentucky (90-89) in overtime.Gonzaga is coming off a 40-point loss in the Players' Era Festival title game against No. 3 Michigan. Before that, the Bulldogs got off to a 7-0 start with wins over Creighton, Arizona State, Alabama and Maryland on their résumé. Entering this weekend, Kentucky is the final-ranked opponent (currently) remaining on Gonzaga's schedule.Year 2 of the Mark Pope era at Kentucky has gotten off to a bumpy start. The Wildcats are 5-3 with losses to Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina. Those losses are nothing to sweat about in the long term, but the Wildcats haven't beaten an opponent ranked inside the top 200 of the NET.Here is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup between Kentucky and Gonzaga.\n Where to watch Kentucky vs. Gonzaga live  Date: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Bridgestone Arena -- Nashville, TennesseeTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Kentucky vs. Gonzaga: Need to knowMark Pope's honeymoon has ended: My colleague David Cobb wrote an outstanding story about Pope and Kentucky after the Wildcats suffered a 67-64 loss to North Carolina in the ACC/SEC Challenge. As he wrote, that loss signaled the end of Pope's honeymoon phase with his alma mater, and that statement couldn't be more true. The Wildcats entered this season with one of the most expensive rosters in the sport, and so far, the results have been underwhelming. Of course, there is plenty of time to change the narrative, and what better way to start than defeating Gonzaga?Gonzaga has looked like one of the best team's in the country: Gonzaga suffered a shocking loss to Michigan last week, which marked its first of the season. Before that game, Gonzaga looked like one of the best five teams in the country. The Bulldogs opened the Players Era Festival with a statement win over Alabama and followed it up with a 39-point win over Maryland. All seven of Gonzaga's wins this season have come by double digits. This game could be one of Gonzaga's last chances to add another signature win to the résumé.\nKentucky's shooting regression is one to monitor: Part of what made Year 1 of the Pope era at Kentucky so successful was the 3-point team shooting. The Wildcats shot 37.5% from the 3-point line last year, which ranked No. 24 among all Division I teams. Through the first month of this season, the Wildcats rank No. 120 in that category (35.3%). In Kentucky's last game against North Carolina, it shot 1 of 13 from beyond the arc. That marked the fewest 3-point makes Kentucky had in a single game since the 2020-21 season. The key in this game is how well Kentucky shoots from outside the arc.Kentucky vs. Gonzaga prediction, picks\nKentucky has been a question mark this season. The Wildcats don't have a marquee win on their résumé yet, and a win over Gonzaga would certainly fit that bill. However, this matchup will be a tough one for Pope's squad. Gonzaga's blowout loss to Michigan doesn't do justice to how well it was playing during the first few weeks of the season. Unless Kentucky starts making shots from the 3-point line at a high clip like last year, I expect Gonzaga to come away with a win. Pick: Gonzaga -4.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ZAGS -4.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest college basketball games of the weekend will take place in East Lansing, Michigan, when No. 7 Michigan State hosts No. 4 Duke in a matchup of top 10 teams. The Blue Devils have won 10 of the last 12 meetings against the Spartans.The Blue Devils are coming off a massive win over reigning national champion Florida during the ACC/SEC Challenge. Duke is in the midst of a tough stretch of games, with a matchup looming against Texas Tech later this month. Duke is off to its best start since the 2017-18 campaign.Michigan State has been tested throughout the first month of the season, with wins over Kentucky and North Carolina already on its résumé. The Spartans opened Big Ten play earlier this week with a 70-52 win over Iowa. Duke and Michigan State both enter the weekend unbeaten.Here is everything you need to know ahead of Michigan State's matchup against Duke.\n Where to watch Duke vs. Michigan State live  Date: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: Noon ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: Fox | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Duke vs. Michigan State: Need to knowCam Boozer vs. Michigan State's frontcourt is the key matchup: Boozer has been playing like not only the best freshman in the country, but also the best player. The projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft has played well against stout competition this season. This game against Michigan State will be one of his toughest of the year. The Spartans already have experience facing a future top pick in this summer's draft. MSU faced off against Caleb Wilson and forced the North Carolina star to shoot 6 of 13 from the floor.Winner will likely move up in the polls: Duke and Michigan State both already have multiple ranked wins on their respective résumés entering the weekend, and whoever wins this game will likely move up in the polls on Monday. Obviously, if MSU wins this game, it will jump Duke. If the Blue Devils win this game, it wouldn't be surprising to see Jon Scheyer's team get some first-place votes.\nDuke's gauntlet is almost complete: The Blue Devils are in the midst of their toughest stretch of the season. Duke already has wins over Arkansas and Florida, with a matchup against Texas Tech coming later this month. If the Blue Devils can pick up a road win over MSU this weekend, it would give Duke a boost heading into ACC play. Duke vs. Michigan State prediction, picks\nBoozer has been playing like the best player in the country. This is going to be a massive test for Boozer and Duke because of the environment they will play in. Michigan State already has key wins over UNC and Kentucky, but look for Duke to hand the Spartans their first loss of the year. Duke pulls off the upset on the road behind another big performance from Boozer. Pick: Duke +1.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -1.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – No matter the nation, no matter its potential and no matter its baggage, national teams gather six months before a World Cup hoping for a favorable draw. As a selection of the USA's most prominent athletes randomly picked one country after another out of a bowl, though, it was hard not to feel like the U.S. men's national team received some version of a best-case scenario. There were no quote-unquote hard teams to face in the group stage, the natural result of earning a Pot 1 berth as a host nation. They also happened to draw teams they have very valuable – and very recent – experience facing.First came Australia, the team they beat 2-1 in October. Then came Paraguay, the team they beat 2-1 in November. At the end came a twist – a little slip of paper with four teams' names on it, the quartet set to face off in a playoff in March for one of the few remaining tickets to the World Cup. Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo make up three-fourths of that group while the fourth is Turikye, a team the USMNT played in a 2-1 loss in June.\"I think we can go into it with a good feeling,\" Christian Pulisic said hours after the draw. \"Obviously, we've played against these teams recently, which is not always the case, so we know, more or less, what they're going to look like and we know they're tough opponents as well. We're not going to take anyone lightly. They're all going to be tough games but I think it's great that we have that experience. Obviously, they played against us, too, so they're in the same boat but it's cool. It's cool that those friendlies and some of the other ones were able to prepare us for some of the teams we're actually going to play.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 World Cup draw winners and losers: USMNT's Mauricio Pochettino a clear winner; Netherlands get tough draw\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShould they face a familiar trio next summer, the group stage opponents perfectly serve as pinpoints for the team's progress in recent months as head coach Mauricio Pochettino finally morphs the team into his vision. One can almost pick out the 2-1 defeat in Connecticut against Turkiye as the exact point where things started to turn around for Pochettino's team – he had many fresh faces in the mix just before of the Concacaf Gold Cup, a month-long camp in which the head coach began to establish his principles. As games against Australia and Paraguay came along, Pochettino broke out varying versions of a back three that allowed the team to really shine and finish 2025 on a five-game unbeaten run.\n\"I think if you look at the friendly against Turkiye before Gold Cup, I think you saw a lot of fresh faces, also a lot of experience but also a lot of hunger,\" Chris Richards said. \"I think we still went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in Europe and got unlucky with two goals but definitely goals that we could avoid. I think it gave us a lot of confidence going into the Gold Cup and I think after that, playing teams like Australia, who are one of the top teams in their division, again went toe-to-toe and beat them and then Paraguay, you saw the same thing so I think it just shows that form the summer, from friendlies, that you can still improve but also with new faces being added in, with new systems, with new play styles, things like that. It shows that we are very versatile and that we're also a very tough team to play, regardless of who steps on the pitch.\"The fact that there's a lot of roster turnover and several different playing styles for Pochettino to realistically choose from makes the USMNT a tricky opponent, even for those who feel they have a sense of familiarity.\"I think it's good to have some different options, obviously depending on opponents, depending on how we want to play, who's available and I think we've done a good job of that,\" Pulisic said. \"I think we've shown we can play a few different ways so for me, I see that as a positive and makes it tougher for them. They're not going to know what to expect.\"\nThere is one difference that sticks out above the rest, though – the fact that the World Cup is a series of now-or-never opportunities that friendlies simply cannot replicate.\"I think we are going to play in different contexts, different circumstances and of course, the timeline is different,\" Pochettino said. \"We are going to arrive with the same confidence or form. That is why. The good thing that we compete[d] against Paraguay and Australia in a very good way, again, very good teams and of course, [there is] Turkiye, [could] be, but there's another three that are going to challenge Turkiye, too … but I think it's good, the reference, because we are going to feel that we can beat them but at the same time, when you beat someone or when you hurt someone, they are waiting for you. They could say, 'but now we will see.' When it's going to be serious, it's going to be the World Cup. That is why. Caution. We need to be [cautious].\"In the aim of being cautious, the USMNT will naturally begin scouting their opposition as soon as possible but the quirk of a lengthy qualification campaign means there is plenty of work for Pochettino and company to do.\n\"The problem is rather [than] to have three teams to scout, we have two plus four because we need to scout the four,\" Pochettino said. \"From here to March, we are going to amplify the numbers of teams that we need to observe because now we have, of course, Australia and Paraguay but we need to add another four teams, be prepared, all the analysts and to start to work now because we cannot wait until March and then start to work, no? We need to be ready from now.\"Pochettino was also surprisingly emotional about the fact that do-or-die moments do not exist solely for teams as a whole at World Cups, but for every individual that takes part in one.\"My dream always was to play in the World Cup, to play for my national team, Argentina, and be involved in a World Cup,\" he said. \"In some moments in my career, I was thinking it's not going to happen but [then] it happened and [at] 31 years old, I had the possibility to play at the World Cup and it disappeared so quick. I don't think that I [didn't] do everything and I didn't do enough with the possibility to do better but it's true that through my experience, because after that, I suffer a massive depression because it's like your biggest dream disappeared and then you feel that [there's] not going to be another possibility to be involved in this and that, for me, is the most powerful energy that I want to translate to the people, to the players. Please, do everything that you [can]. Be humble enough and try to build, with your teammates, a good energy, a good dynamic.\"\nCaution or not, the draw has provided the perfect foundation for the USMNT to pull off the groundbreaking performance they have always targeted next summer in the hopes of further accelerating the growth of soccer in a country that has been slow to embrace the world's most popular sport. There are officially no excuses they can pull from, especially as things trend in the right direction for them with a year-ending unbeaten streak. The onus is well and truly on the World Cup hosts to well and truly live up to the potential many had spotted in them years earlier.\"Potentially, we've played all three of these teams in the last six months but that can be a little bit of a false kind of sense of security,\" Tim Ream said. \"We need to make sure that we're preventing that kind of security and safety feeling from setting in and we have enough guys with enough experience who know how to keep pushing, keep pushing each other and keep pushing the team in the right direction knowing what we could possibly do but again, it's down to us and our work and our intensity and our focus.\"\n            ",

And in Week 14, there are a whole bunch of games that could potentially affect what the playoff field looks like come January.We've already seen the Detroit Lions defeat the Dallas Cowboys to improve their own standing and damage that of the Cowboys, but on Sunday and Monday there are a number of games featuring two teams fighting for playoff spots. The Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. The Jacksonville Jaguars host the Indianapolis Colts. The Chicago Bears take on the Green Bay Packers. The Kansas City Chiefs play the Houston Texans. And the Philadelphia Eagles do battle with the Los Angeles Chargers. \nEach of those matchups features two teams that are either currently in the playoff picture or sitting just outside of it. Amazingly, none of those teams -- even the teams sitting in first or second place in their respective conferences -- can clinch a spot in the playoffs this weekend. There's still more football to be played before that can happen. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: What Texans-Chiefs means for AFC seeding, wild-card chaos and teams on the bubble\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut there is also the other end of the spectrum to consider.

    "body": "\n        Not only is the conference championship up for grabs on Friday night, but so, too, is a potential College Football Playoff berth as No. 20 Tulane hosts No. 24 North Texas in the American Championship Game. Both temas are led by departing coaches (Tulane's Jon Sumrall and North Texas' Eric Morris) who will continue to lead their respective programs through the end of the season, and neither wants this to be the final game for their headman before he exits for his new job.Considering where the American stands in the context of other Group of Five leagues, the longstanding assumption is that the league winner will be the fifth-highest ranked conference champion in the nation. With that designation comes an automatic bid in the CFP, likely as the No. 12 seed. And depending on what happens in the ACC, the victor could be held in even higher regard. Neither the Green Wave nor the Mean Green have ever played in the CFP, so history is on the table regardless of the result.The conference championship game is an on-campus affair in the American. Both teams went 7-1 in league play, but Tulane will host the title bout by virtue of being the highest-ranked American team in the Week 14 CFP Top 25. The Green Wave is unbeaten at home and posted the first 6-0 record in Yulman Stadium history.Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as Tulane battles North Texas in the 2025 American Championship Game on Friday. \nWhere to watch Tulane vs. North Texas liveDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Yulman Stadium -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Tulane vs. North Texas: Need to knowLame-duck coaches: Sumrall and Morris have had their hands full of late, balancing tasks at two different schools. Both were announced as incoming coaches at Power Four universities with Sumrall bound for Florida and Morris set to take over at Oklahoma State. But unlike some coaches on the 2025 carousel (looking at you, Lane Kiffin), their schools permitted them to remain with their respective teams through the end of the season. It is a unique wrinkle in this matchup that brings into question how focused the coaches will be on the task at hand and how motivated their players will be to suit up for coaches who are on their way out.Class of the American: Although it came away victorious just once (2022), Tulane reached the conference championship game each of the last three years and on Friday will become the first program in American history to play in four consecutive title games. The Green Wave is also 29-3 in regular-season conference games dating back to 2022, good for the best winning percentage (.906) of any team in the FBS. It is a stretch of dominance for the Green Wave that spans multiple coaching staffs, which indicates an immense amount of program strength and suggests it will be able to reload once Sumrall departs for Florida.\nMean Green offensive machine: If North Texas defeats the perennial conference title contender and wins its first American crown, it will almost certainly be because of its offense. Redshirt freshman quarterback Drew Mestemaker leads the nation in passing with 3,835 yards, true freshman running back Caleb Hawkins paces the sport in rushing touchdowns (23) and total touchdowns (26), sophomore wide receiver Wyatt Young ranks third nationally with 1,203 receiving yards and the team as a whole is the highest-scoring operation in the country at 46.8 points per game. The Mean Green put up at least 52 points in each of their final three regular-season games.Tulane vs. North Texas prediction, picks\nTulane is the more proven team against high-end competition. The Green Wave defeated a pair of Power Four opponents in Northwestern and Duke and did not lose to a team below .500. Meanwhile, let it not be forgotten that the last time (and only time) North Texas played a ranked team, it lost by 27 points to a conference foe in South Florida. While Mestemaker and his supporting cast could post a number that Tulane simply cannot match, the Green Wave is more battle-tested, familiar with the big stage and boasts home-field advantage. This might be a \"wrong team favored\" situation with Morris' unit laying a field goal on the road.

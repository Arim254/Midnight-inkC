He also has 17 big plays of 20 yards or more, including a long of 56, with 400 yards after the catch and 45 first-down conversions.

In 15 games, he has completed 65.6% of his passes for 3,028 yards and 23 touchdowns with seven interceptions and a 95.3 rating.

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati transfer quarterback Brendan Sorsby has committed to Texas Tech, CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz report, choosing the Red Raiders after a quick visit schedule that also included LSU.Sorsby is rated as the No. 2 quarterback and the No. 2 overall transfer prospect in this cycle in the 247Sports transfer rankings.Sorsby's decision keeps him in the Big 12 and gives Texas Tech an experienced option at quarterback after a season that ended with lingering questions at the position. The Red Raiders won the Big 12 Championship for their first out-right conference title since 1955 but struggled offensively in their College Football Playoff quarterfinal loss to Oregon at the Orange Bowl, where Behren Morton was unable to generate much production in a 23-0 shutout.\n        \n            \n                Drew Mestemaker commits to Oklahoma State: Former North Texas QB joins coach Eric Morris in Stillwater\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech has already demonstrated a willingness to be aggressive in the transfer portal, using resources and NIL opportunities to target impact players at positions of need. Sorsby's addition signals that the Red Raiders are prepared to continue that approach, blending proven experience with a roster built to compete at the highest level of the conference.How Sorsby fits with Texas Tech Sorsby joins a room that includes rising sophomore Will Hammond, who suffered a torn ACL this season. While he could be ready for the start of 2026, Sorsby provides immediate experience and the option for Hammond to gain more experience in a backup role before taking over the reins in 2027.\nWhen Sorsby initially made his decision to enter the transfer portal, there was speculation he could also explore the NFL Draft after a breakout season that put him on the radar as a potential early-round pick. Instead, he appears ready to return to college for a final year, giving him an opportunity to further refine his game and improve his draft stock.Sorsby will arrive at Texas Tech with three years of starting experience and a track record of production at the Power Four level, though team success has varied. He is 13-17 (.433) as a starter in his career, including a 1-6 mark at Indiana as a redshirt freshman in 2023. After that season, he transferred to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 campaign and went on to establish himself as one of the Big 12's more efficient passers across two seasons with the Bearcats.Sorsby does it with arm, legsDuring his time at Cincinnati, Sorsby passed for 5,613 yards and 45 touchdowns, completing 62.9% of his passes. He led the Big 12 in yards per completion (13.5) this season. He showed consistent command of the offense early in the season, including a seven-game stretch without an interception. Sorsby matched a career-low with only five picks in 12 games this season. He earned second-team All-Big 12 honors.\nSorsby also adds value as a runner, becoming more involved in the ground game as his career progressed. He finished this year at Cincinnati with a career-high 580 rushing yards on 100 carries and nine rushing touchdowns, matching his total from the previous season. While Cincinnati closed the year with four straight losses and his passing efficiency dipped late, his overall body of work made him one of the most sought-after quarterbacks in the portal.\n            ",

This year's postseason won't have Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, but there will still be plenty of familiar faces. The Eagles are in the playoffs for the fifth straight season and they'll be looking to become the first NFC team in 31 years to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in. The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order: Raiders land No. 1 pick as Giants, Browns hurt draft position by winning in Week 18\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n        In the process of handing No. 10 Iowa State its first loss of the season Sunday afternoon, No. 22 Baylor and Bears coach Nicki Collen may have given the rest of the country a blueprint on how to slow down Naismith Player of the Year candidate Audi Crooks. The game log will show that Baylor's Taliah Scott, who scored all of her 21 points in the second half, sank a last-second jumper to power the Bears' 72-70 upset win over the Cyclones (14-1) in Ames, Iowa, but the plan and execution regarding how to handle Crooks is what set the table for the stunning upset.Prior to the game, Collen joked that Baylor (13-3) would need supernatural help to defend Crooks, who entered Sunday as the leading scorer in the nation at 29.4 points per game on a historic 72.5% shooting. In NCAA Division I women's basketball history (which officially dates back to 1981-82), there have been 24 previous instances of a player averaging at least 29 points per game, per Stathead. None of them have shot above 60.1%. Crooks has largely been unstoppable this season thanks to her rolodex of post moves, deft footwork and unique frame. She already has three 40-point outings, including a career-high 47 points against Indiana, and hasn't shot worse than 57.1% in any game. \nEarly against Baylor, it was more of the same. Crooks, allowed to play one-on-one, scored Iowa State's first nine points with ease, and had 14 points on a perfect 6-6 from the field in the first quarter. By the end of the first half, she was up to 22 points on 9 of 11, and one of those misses was a rare 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer. \nCrooks' productive second quarter overshadowed the fact that Baylor had started to change their defensive gameplan. In the middle of the frame, there were multiple possessions where Jada Williams' defender sank into the paint to front Crooks and prevent the Cyclones from getting her the ball. \nThat foreshadowed the Bears' even more drastic approach in the fourth quarter, when they refused to let Crooks impact the game. Once again, the Bears ignored Williams (Reese Beaty briefly got the same treatment when she was in the game for Williams) so they could have two defenders sandwich Crooks in the post. While Williams is a strong playmaker -- team-high 7.2 assists per game -- she entered Sunday shooting just 39.7% from the field, including 26.7% from 3-point range. \n\"One of the guards was just sitting in front of me the whole time, and the other girl that was actually guarding me was behind me,\" Crooks said. \"It made it really, really hard for the guards to make post-entry passes because they were also both I think at least 6-foot with ups, so that makes it difficult to get it inside. It was a good defensive plan by Baylor.\"Even late in the fourth, the Bears were content to let Williams walk into 15-footers rather than let Crooks get involved. \nCrooks went scoreless in the fourth quarter, and her two shot attempts were a rushed fadeaway the one time she got a post touch and a putback from an offensive rebound that got blocked. As a team, the Cyclones managed just 14 points on 6 of 17 from the field, as the Bears completed the comeback victory. \n\"Obviously made it hard to get Audi the ball,\" Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly said after the game. \"At the end of the day, it's hard to beat a really good team playing two against five, and that's basically what it came down to today,\"Crooks finished with 26 points on 11 of 20 from the field, but just four of them came in the second half. Williams, meanwhile, had 28 points on 11 of 28 shooting, including 6 of 17 from 3-point range -- all of those marks were career-highs for the junior guard. Everyone other Iowa State player combined for 16 points on 5 of 23. Throughout Crooks' dominant start to the season, there has been plenty of chatter about why opponents have not sent more double teams her way. The obvious answer has been Iowa State's elite 3-point shooting. The Cyclones entered Sunday shooting 38.2% from behind the arc as a team, which ranked 14th in the country, and three of their starters -- Mackenzie Hare, Arianna Jackson and Addy Brown -- were shooting 43.2% or better.\nThe Cyclones' spacing in their four-out offense makes it difficult to properly execute a double without giving up an open shot, but it has still been surprising that opposing coaches have not attempted to take the ball out of Crooks' hands more often. Collen and the Bears took that idea one step further. You don't have to worry about how to get the ball out of her hands if she never has it in the first place. Plus, by ignoring Williams and face-guarding the Cyclones' elite 3-point threats, the Bears exerted more control over who had the ball and was forced to shoot instead of Crooks. \"We had to find a way to take Crooks away, and so we obviously made the decision to let Jada Williams shoot,\" Collen said after the game. \"Sometimes it looks crazy, because she obviously made some, but at the end of the day, when you look at the analytics, and Crooks shoots 70%, and Jackson and Hare shoot 50% from 3, we had to pick our poison. I thought we executed that at a high level.\"\nCollen's bold and daring strategy helped her team pick up its biggest win of the season, and showed that it's possible to slow down Crooks -- even without supernatural help. Was this a one-off success that caught Iowa State off-guard, or will their upcoming opponents take a page out of Baylor's book. And if they do, how will the Cyclones respond?Connelly doesn't expect to wait long to find out. \"We'll probably see it Wednesday,\" he said, when his team travels to Ohio to take on Cincinnati. \n            ",

They finished among the worst in the league in sacks, passing touchdowns allowed and rushing touchdowns and yards allowed.\nSunday's 35-8 loss gave the 3-14 Jets the No. 2 overall pick, putting them behind the 3-14 Las Vegas Raiders, who will have the first overall selection in the 2026 NFL Draft in April. This also marks the Jets' 15th straight season failing to make the playoffs, the longest active postseason drought in the league.\n            \n    ",

Cross' extension is the largest contract in Seahawks history for a non-quarterback. Seattle picked up Cross' fifth-year option this past offseason. But after a strong 2025 season, the Seahawks decided to lock Cross up now instead of waiting until this offseason. Cross, 25, has missed Seattle's last three games with a hamstring injury. The hope is that he will be back on the field when the Seahawks resume play during the divisional round of the 2025 playoffs. Seattle (14-3) has secured the NFC's top playoff seed. \n\"We're optimistic for next week or the week after for Charles,\" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald recently said of Cross. \"These guys have done a great job of getting back and working, but obviously Charles isn't going to make it this week.\"The ninth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Cross has started in each of his 62 regular season games with Seattle. He started in each of Seattle's 17 games as a rookie and did so again during the 2023 season. Cross started in each of the Seahawks' first 14 games this season before sustaining his injury. \nCross has been part of a Seahawks' offense that scored a whopping 483 points this season. He helped provide sterling protection for Sam Darnold, who earned his second consecutive Pro Bowl berth. Cross' blocking also helped wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards. He also contributed to Kenneth Walker III rushing for over 1,000 yards and Zach Charbonnet run for 12 touchdowns, the most by a Seahawks player since Marshawn Lynch in 2024. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot on Sunday, following the team's victory over the Saints, the team announced. The ousting marks an unceremonious end to Morris' two-year run in his second tenure leading the franchise. Fontenot completed his fifth season in Atlanta after joining the Falcons in 2021. The Falcons went 37-48, with no playoff appearances, during his tenure.\"I have great personal affinity for both Raheem and Terry and appreciate their hard work and dedication to the Falcons, but I believe we need new leadership in these roles moving forward,\" Falcons owner Arthur Blank said. \"The decision to move away from people who represent the organization so well and have a shared commitment to the values that are important to the organization is not an easy one, but the results on the field have not met our expectations or those of our fans and leadership. I wish Raheem and Terry the absolute best in their future pursuits.\"Morris, who also served as Atlanta's interim coach in 2020, posted consecutive 8-9 records in his latest stint with the Falcons. He owns a 37-56 record as a head coach, including his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn 2024, the Falcons signed Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract, only to draft quarterback Michael Penix Jr. eighth overall, a stunning development that even blindsided Cousins. But Cousins, coming off a torn Achilles, struggled and the team turned to Penix with three games to go.Penix entered the 2025 season as the team's starter, though Cousins was still on the roster. Penix was up-and-down before tearing his ACL in Week 11 -- his third major knee injury since his college career began -- and Cousins finished out the season with four straight wins.Ultimately, though, it wasn't enough to save Morris' job or lift Atlanta from its recent run of mediocrity. The Falcons have not made the playoffs since 2017, and they won either seven or eight games in seven of the eight seasons since.\nIn the 2025 draft, the team selected Jalon Walker 15th overall and traded up with the Los Angeles Rams to select James Pearce Jr. 26th overall, hoping that adding two first-round edge rushers would improve a lackluster pass rush and would help the team get over the hump. Though the pass rush indeed improved significantly, the defense as a whole remained middling, and the offense was too inconsistent under Penix.That leaves Atlanta in a strange spot. There are some clear franchise cornerstones, led by superstar running back Bijan Robinson and wide receiver Drake London, as well as talented defensive youngsters in Walker, Pearce and safety Xavier Watts. There is a respectable supporting group, including a solid offensive line and several other pieces on defense. But there remain major questions at quarterback as Penix remains largely unproven and the team can get out of the Cousins contract relatively easily if it wishes.Perhaps most importantly, the Falcons do not have a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of the trade to draft Pearce. Atlanta also faces significant free agent decisions, headlined by tight end Kyle Pitts, who is set to hit the market after his best seasons since 2021 and, at just 25 years old, could be a player Atlanta wishes to retain.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons are hitting the reset button once again after firing coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot.Atlanta has been stuck in a long stretch of mediocrity: Morris went 8-9 in both of his two seasons as head coach, and the team won seven games each of the three seasons before that. Those five seasons make up all of Fontenot's tenure: not bad enough to bottom out, not good enough to be taken seriously. The Falcons haven't made the postseason since 2017. They have had a different leading passer each of the top five seasons. They have been perfectly mediocre, over and over, in every sense of the word.The Falcons' four-game winning streak to finish the season -- though not enough to save Morris' or Fontenot's jobs -- showed some encouraging signs. Bijan Robinson is an absolute star. The defense has some nice young pieces, with first-round edge defenders Jalon Walker and James Pearce Jr. as well as third-round safety Xavier Watts standing out. The Falcons were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention nearly one month ago, yet they technically finished in a three-way tie for first in the NFC South at 8-9.On one hand, they're not that far away. On the other hand, they're not that close, and without a first-round pick this season, they'll have to find hits in free agency and later in the draft and count on internal improvements.\nCoach must be the most important improvement, though. Here are five who could fit the bill.1. Kevin Stefanski (Cleveland Browns head coach)The Browns are expected to move on from Stefanski, according to CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones.Stefanski is a two-time Coach of the Year. He has made the playoffs twice in six years in Cleveland, a team that hadn't made the playoffs since 2002 prior to his arrival. He has made a wide variety of quarterbacks work amid trying circumstances: Baker Mayfield, Jacoby Brissett, Joe Flacco, Jameis Winston.\nCould he add Michael Penix Jr. to the mix next? Penix has been inconsistent and injury-prone. He really remains a big question mark, something that wouldn't be the worst thing ever for a third-year quarterback if that quarterback wasn't going to be 26 and coming off a torn ACL, as Penix is.Stefanski is only 43. He has crafted strong running games and solid, well-structured passing games. His Browns defenses have consistently been very good. He will be well sought-after elsewhere, but perhaps the Falcons and their strong building blocks will be appealing.2. Chris Shula (Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator)Would Arthur Blank double-dip in the \"most recently the Rams defensive coordinator\" pool? Shula replaced Morris in Los Angeles last year and, despite the Rams being one of the NFL's lightest spenders on that side of the ball, has produced units that outperform their price tag. This year's Rams defense is fifth in success rate and has been excellent in the red zone.\nShula is 39 and has risen the ranks rapidly, helping develop several draft picks -- the type of personnel the Falcons' defense is full of -- along the way. The Sean McVay coaching tree has many strong branches, and if Blank were to try it again, it could work.3. Klint Kubiak (Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator)If Blank opts for a first-time coach with a background on the offensive side of the ball, Kubiak could fit the bill, and the Falcons are familiar with him given his time as the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator last year.The son of longtime NFL coach Gary Kubiak, Klint has a strong resume with a variety of strong offensive minds, including his own father, Stefanski, Kevin O'Connell and Kyle Shanahan. He has devised an effective, play action-heavy scheme in Seattle that has helped take Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba to another level. As an added bonus in Seattle, he has rubbed shoulders with one of the NFL's best defenses, and perhaps he could poach some assistants from that side of the ball.\n4. Mike LaFleur (Rams offensive coordinator)Yes, both the Rams' offensive and defensive coordinators should be on the radar here. Mike LaFleur -- younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur -- has worked under McVay and Shanahan and alongside Mike McDaniel. He has also worked in Atlanta before: He was an offensive assistant in 2015 and 2016 under Shanahan, when the Falcons rose to NFC champions. The connection there is a strong one.LaFleur hasn't been a play caller, but his experience under McVay is second to none, and the Rams' offense has been absolutely outstanding this season.5. Kliff Kingsbury (Washington Commanders offensive coordinator)Kingsbury declined to take interviews last year, when he would have been a hot name. The 2025 Commanders offense wasn't as effective, but it's hard to blame Kingsbury too much: Jayden Daniels played in just seven games and shared the field with Terry McLaurin for just three. The Commanders found ways to produce effective offense with Marcus Mariota, and Kingsbury's product wasn't all that bad in light of the bevy of injuries Washington suffered.\nKingsbury is a fascinating candidate. He is just 46 but has had head coaching stops in college and the NFL. He has called plays for multiple top-10 scoring offenses in the NFL, something few other candidates could say. He's undoubtedly learned plenty of lessons since his stint with the Arizona Cardinals. Would it be enough?\n            ",

Sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz that NFL teams have identified Weis as a possible offensive coordinator candidate heading into the offseason job cycle.Weis has spent the last four seasons as the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator at Ole Miss, and he's only raised his stock in the eyes of decision-makers. Weis helped develop New York Giants first-round pick Jaxson Dart, and he turned Trinidad Chambliss into a household name while overseeing the Rebels' top-ranked offense in 2025.Although Weis is expected to join Lane Kiffin's staff at LSU, he's stayed behind in Oxford to run the Ole Miss offense in the College Football Playoff. Through the first two rounds, which includes a thrilling quarterfinal win over Georgia, the Rebels are averaging 40 points per game.\nAs our own Brandon Marcello reported, many LSU-bound assistant coaches are expected to leave Ole Miss ahead of its Fiesta Bowl semifinal matchup against Miami on Thursday night in Glendale, Arizona. However, Weis will remain with the Rebels as they pursue a national championship.Weis, 32, has spent most of his coaching career at the collegiate level. The one exception came in 2017, when he was an offensive assistant for the Atlanta Falcons under offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian.\nFrom 2018-19, Weis worked under Kiffin as an offensive coordinator at FAU. He also spent two seasons as a coordinator at USF before rejoining Kiffin at Ole Miss in 2022.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Not everyone was in a celebratory mood after Myles Garrett broke the NFL's single-season sack record. Specifically, Bengals coach Zac Taylor did not appreciate the official's decision to briefly pause the game after Garrett made history with just over five minutes remaining and the Bengals trying to score the go-ahead touchdown. Taylor was visibly upset after the game was temporarily paused after Garrett took down Joe Burrow to record his record 23rd sack of the season. Cincinnati, down 17-12 at the time, ended up punting after not gaining a yard on the next two plays. Taylor made it clear afterward that he didn't appreciate how the situation was handled. \"There's five minutes left in our season,\" Taylor said. \"We're playing for our lives here. I was never told that we're going to stop the game. In a critical moment like that, the refs just said that they made a decision that they were going to stop the game. They said they tried to do it as quickly as possible. I didn't feel that.\"\nWhile Garrett's record was being acknowledged, the Bengals tried to quickly run another play but to no avail. \"We didn't sub,\" Taylor said. \"We're trying to be on the ball and go and play with tempo. The umpire just held the ball so that we couldn't do anything. And I'm yelling at Joe, 'Get on the ball.' ... And so again, trying to get an answer was not easy. They just said that they made a decision as a crew to stop the game when that happened. I guess it didn't matter when it happened.\"\nTaylor reiterated that he was not informed prior to kickoff that the officials would temporarilly pause the game if Garrett got the record. \n\"They didn't say one word,\" Taylor said. \"We meet with [the officials] in the 90-minute meeting before the game. They didn't they never said one word about that.\"While Cincinnati (6-11) had already been eliminated from the postseason, Taylor's frustration is a reflection of his and his team's desire to win every game regardless of the situation. The Bengals, like the Browns, were trying to end their season with a win over a division rival while having one final positive moment to carry into the offseason. The Bengals were able to take the lead on their final offensive possession of the season on a Burrow touchdown pass to Ja'Marr Chase. The Browns, however, pulled off the win after Andre Szmyt drilled a 49-yard field goal as time expired. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Myles Garrett made NFL history, and in the process may have solidified his case as the greatest pass rusher of his era. The Cleveland Browns' perennial All-Pro broke the single-season sack record previously shared by Pittsburgh Steelers' veteran T.J. Watt and Hall of Famer Michael Strahan. History was made with 5:14 left during Cleveland's Week 18 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Garrett's record-breaking sack came against Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. \n\"I can't lie, I was nervous as hell,\" Garrett said about the pressure he felt entering the game in terms of getting the sack record. \"I had a dream last night that I didn't get it and all the feelings that come with that. I woke up, I think I was sweating. I was like, 'There's no way I'm going to let that be my destiny.' Just fighting like hell to not only rewrite history, but I feel like my own destiny.\" \nGarrett made history despite a somewhat slow start to the season. After registering four sacks in the season's first six games, Garrett tallied 18 sacks over a nine-game stretch that included five sacks of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye back in Week 8. \nAfter that tear, it appeared like a foregone conclusion that the record would belong to Garrett before the 2025 season ended. That changed, however, after the Steelers held Garrett without a sack during Week 17. The Bengals then held Garrett without a sack during the first three quarters of Sunday's game.Garrett's moment finally arrived on Cleveland's second-to-last defensive possession of the season. On the play, be beat multiple Pro Bowl offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. before pulling Burrow to the turf. Play then temporality halted before teammates put Garrett on their shoulders after the drive had concluded. \"I didn't know it was gonna be like that,\" Garrett said of his teammates' response to him breaking the record. \"I'm so happy to be with these guys. They made it a joy to show up every day at work. I've loved every second of this year, being able to work with guys and coaches like this. It's honestly been a real pleasure.\" \nThe 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, Garrett broke a record that had initially been set by Strahan in 2001 and tied by Watt in 2021. Strahan broke former New York Jets standout Mark Gastineau's 17-year-old record in 2001, and Watt tied his mark of 21.5 sacks in 2021. Single-season sack leadersPlayer, TeamSacksYearDPOY?1.Myles Garrett, Browns 232025???T-2.T.J.

Pro Football Reference has an unofficial list of the all-time single-season sack leaders that includes players who played prior to '82. On their unofficial list, Al Baker's 23 sacks during the 1978 season served as the single-season record. Baker, the 1978 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, went onto enjoy a highly-successful 13-year career that included an unofficial tally of 131 sacks. Pro Football Reference's list also includes three seasons where former Rams Hall of Famer Deacon Jones had at least 21.5 sacks. Jones, who famously coined the term \"sack,\" was credited with 173.5 sacks during his legendary career. Garrett's name now tops the list of the greatest individual season in NFL history as far as sacks are concerned. In the process, he has all but ended the argument in terms of being the best pass rusher of his era. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time this season, Cam Little has made NFL history. The Jaguars kicker hit a 67-yard field goal against the Titans on Sunday, which set the NFL record for longest outdoor field goal. The kick comes just two months after Little set the overall NFL record with a 68-yard field goal back in Week 9 against the Raiders. With just three seconds left in the first half, the Jaguars were sitting at Tennessee's 49-yard line. At that point, Jaguars coach Liam Coen basically had two options: He could have Trevor Lawerence throw a Hail Mary or he could have Little attempt a 67-yard field goal. Considering how strong Little's leg is, Coen didn't even think twice: The Jaguars coach sent out his kicker, who calmly made NFL history with the kick below. \nThe field goal gave the Jaguars a 31-7 lead at the half. The Jags will clinch the AFC South title with a win over the Titans. \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture after Week 18: Who clinched, final standings and every wild card matchup\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe kick means that Little has now hit the two longest field goals in NFL history. Going into the 2025 season, the record for longest field goal was 66 yards (held by Justin Tucker) and the record for longest outdoor field goal was 64 yards (held by Matt Prater), but both of those marks now belong to Little. \nGoing into the season, there had only been three field goals of 64 yards or longer in NFL history, but that number has now been more than doubled in 2025. Little's kick marked the fourth time this year that someone has made a field goal from 64 yards or longer. WEEK 2: Brandon Aubrey hits from 64 yards for the CowboysWEEK 4: Chase McLaughlin hits from 65 yards for the Buccaneers (And breaks the record for longest outdoor field goal)WEEK 9: Little hits from 68 yards for JaguarsWEEK 18: Little hits from 67 yards for JaguarsWith Little on the team, the Jaguars have a huge advantage over almost every other team in the NFL because they're now in field goal range before they even get to midfield. Not only does Little have the two longest field goals in NFL history, but he also hit a 70-yarder during the preseason, but he didn't get the record for longest field goal, because preseason stats don't count in the NFL record book. \nThe Jaguars selected Little in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL Draft and it's turned out to be one of the best sixth-round picks made by any team. Little has hit 29 of 33 field goals this season, including his two bombs from 67 and 68. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Penn State has its quarterback for the 2026 college football season. Rocco Becht signed with the Nittany Lions through the transfer portal, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz, and projects as their starter for his final year of eligibility. The longtime Iowa State standout will follow coach Matt Campbell to the Big Ten after Campbell took the Penn State job last month.Becht's arrival should help Penn State hit the ground running offensively in Year 1 of the Campbell era. He is a veteran, high-end passer who garnered four-star status in the transfer portal and is 247Sports' No. 8-ranked transfer quarterback for the 2026 cycle. Becht is the No. 25 player overall in the portal, which opened on Jan. 2.Over a four-year period at Iowa State, Becht re-wrote the Cyclones' record books as the most prolific freshman quarterback in school history, led the team in 2024 to its first double-digit-win season and concluded his career as a program legend. He was among the Big 12's most outstanding signal-callers throughout his time in Ames and will immediately become one of the Big Ten's most highly regarded quarterbacks upon arrival at Penn State.Aiding in Becht's transition to Penn State is the staff continuity he will enjoy with Campbell as head coach and Taylor Mouser as offensive coordinator. Mouser oversaw the Iowa State offense for the last two years and was on staff for the entirety of Becht's Cyclones career.\nBecht regressed statistically during his redshirt junior season but still passed for 2,584 yards and 16 touchdowns with nine interceptions in an 8-4 campaign. He kept the Cyclones in the Big 12 title race despite losing a pair of 1,000-yard receivers to the NFL.Among the questions facing Penn State as it undergoes a change in leadership is whether its new staff can unlock the downfield passing game and take the offense as a whole to another level. Becht should help in that process, and with the Nittany Lions facing one of the most manageable schedules in the Big Ten next season, he could also set his new program up for immediate improvement in the win column.\nBecht is already the fifth former Iowa State player to commit to Penn State. In fact, the entirety of the Nittany Lions' transfer portal recruiting class thus far consists of former Cyclones. Four-star prospects Benjamin Brahmer and Marcus Neal Jr. are at the top of the haul at the tight end and safety positions, respectively, while three-star tight end Gabe Burkle and offensive tackle Will Tompkins round out the newcomers.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Indianapolis Colts have made some bizarre fake punt calls over the years, and they added to that lore with an interesting decision Sunday against the Texans.During the first quarter, the Colts called for a fake punt on back-to-back plays, including one that came on first down. On the surface, it sounds like an absolutely crazy decision, but it actually made some sense.The first fake punt came on a fourth-and-5 from Indy's own 25-yard line. Rigoberto Sanchez took the snap and, instead of punting, lofted a perfect pass to Mo Alie-Cox for a 16-yard gain. After picking up the first down, the Colts hustled to the line and ran ANOTHER fake punt. The Texans were in the process of subbing their regular defense back onto the field and weren't ready for the second fake, resulting in a penalty for having too many players on the field.\nThe drive ended with the Colts kicking a field goal, so the 21 yards gained on the two fake punt plays ended up working out well for Indianapolis. The fact that the Colts ran a fake punt on first down was almost fitting, because if there's one team that knows a thing or two about bizarre fake punts, it's definitely them. Back in 2015, the Colts ran what was arguably the most ill-conceived fake punt in the history of the NFL.\nThat one didn't work 10 years ago, but their fake punt did work on Sunday in Houston. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Genei Sato, a talented right-handed pitcher, is transferring from Sendai University in Shibata, Japan, to Penn State University, the program announced on Monday. Sato is expected to join the Nittany Lions for the fall 2026 semester. He'll then be eligible for Major League Baseball's amateur draft in 2027.It's an unusual move for Sato, who was projected to be a first-round selection in the upcoming Nippon Professional Baseball draft. Yet it speaks to his desire to forge a career in MLB without having to navigate the posting system -- the transfer agreement between MLB and NPB that necessitates players spend a certain amount of time in NPB if they don't want their earning potential suppressed. \"When Genei's camp reached out to explore a move to college baseball, our staff used their connections to gather reports and video and it became clear to us that this is a premium arm,\" Penn State head coach Mike Gambino said in a statement. \"He's in the conversation among best arms in Japan and was considered a top draft prospect in the Nippon league and has the potential to be a top round pick here.\"\nSato, listed at 5-foot-11, is indeed an intriguing talent. During his time at Sendai University, he compiled a 2.22 ERA and nearly 11 strikeouts for every nine innings. He's touched into triple digits before and his arsenal also includes a standout splitter. He had a strong showing over the summer against the USA Collegiate National Team, punching out six batters in 4 ⅓ innings.\"He's real,\" UCLA shortstop and potential No. 1 pick Roch Cholowsky told Baseball America of Sato. \"(He) was like 97-99 throwing a splitter at like 92. A lot of ride on the fastball. Throws his splitter hard but has depth on it, too.\"\nSato is not the first Japanese amateur to forgo NPB in favor of their MLB dreams. Stanford first baseman Rintaro Sasaki made a similar decision in October 2023. Others in recent years, like White Sox infield prospect Rikuu Nishida and Georgia two-way player Kenny Ishikawa, have done the same.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        North Carolina coach Bill Belichick is expected to bring Bobby Petrino to the Tar Heels as his new offensive coordinator, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reports. Petrino handled play-calling duties at Arkansas the past two seasons under Sam Pittman and assumed interim coach status near midseason when Pittman was fired.Petrino and Chip Kelly were reported as finalists for Belichick, with Belichick ultimately going with the option with more recent success at the college level as he enters his second season leading the Tar Heels. Belichick fired offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens earlier this month as part of sweeping changes made to his coaching staff after the Tar Heels' disappointing 4-8 finish. Kitchens was one of the only on-field assistants that Belichick retained upon his arrival in Chapel Hill, but North Carolina's offense struggled this fall, finishing at the bottom of the ACC in several statistical categories.Petrino, 64, brings a tempo-driven spread system to the Tar Heels with a penchant for explosive plays and development of quarterbacks. A previous head coach at Arkansas, Petrino returned to the Razorbacks ahead of the 2024 season to transform the offense after spending the 2023 campaign at Texas A&M under Jimbo Fisher.Petrino, who went 0-7 as the Arkansas interim this season, holds a career record of 137–78 as a head coach, but will focus strictly on the offensive side of the football under Belichick.\n\n        \n            \n                Re-seeding the College Football Playoff bracket: Miami over Alabama leads to shift in New Year's Day bowls\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPetrino served as coach of the Atlanta Falcons in 2007 before leaving for the Arkansas vacancy. His successful tenure there ended after an 11-win season in 2011 following his infamous motorcycle accident. He resurfaced as coach at Western Kentucky and Louisville and later had a three-year stint leading the Missouri State program before returning to Arkansas as offensive coordinator.Belichick, 73, is on a five-year, $50 million deal with the Tar Heels and has a $1 million buyout under an NFL clause in his contract if he's pursued by a pro franchise. His first season at North Carolina didn't go as planned after several transfer portal additions failed to live up to the hype in a new setting. Former South Alabama quarterback Gio Lopez finished with 1,747 yards, 10 touchdowns and five interceptions over 12 starts, while the Tar Heels' rushing attack offered little assistance.\nThe Tar Heels entered the final three weeks of the season with a chance to get to bowl eligibility at 4-5 overall, but lost in-state rivalry games to Wake Forest, Duke and NC State, sparking coaching staff changes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's time the Jacksonville Jaguars are mentioned among legitimate Super Bowl contenders following Sunday's momentum-building 34-20 win over the Denver Broncos. After improving to 11-4 overall and moving into the No. 3 seed position in the AFC's playoff picture, the Jaguars sounded off on being one of the NFL's perceived have-nots and snapped the Broncos' NFL-best 11-game winning streak for good measure.\"Just thankful a small-market team like us can come into a place like Mile High and get it done,\" Jaguars coach Liam Coen said, circling back to Sean Payton's comment about his team.Payton previously said despite being from \"a smaller market,\" the Jaguars looked the part. Two weeks ago, Jacksonville beat the Indianapolis Colts 36-19 to take full control of the AFC South.\n\"Everybody in this locker room on the Jaguars team, even upstairs, we know everybody's probably going to try to hop on this bandwagon now, but we don't want anybody,\" defensive end Travon Walker said on the Jaguars' postgame show, via ESPN. \"They can stay where they're at. It's us. It's all about the Jags.\"F*** everybody but us. Excuse my language, dad, grandmamma, but f*** everybody but us.\"With the Broncos, New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills garnering much of the AFC attention, the Jaguars look like a serious threat with Trevor Lawrence being nearly perfect over his last four starts.\nThe former No. 1 overall pick threw for 279 yards, three touchdowns and ran for another against the Broncos, giving him 12 touchdown passes and no interceptions since overcoming three turnovers during a Nov. 23 overtime win over the Arizona Cardinals.Jacksonville's last postseason win came in January 2023 when Lawrence led a wild 31-30 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round prior to his team falling to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.Jacksonville clinches a playoff spot tonight if the San Francisco 49ers beat the Indianapolis Colts.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff muscled his way into the end zone as time expired after a lateral from Amon-Ra St. Brown. Detroit thought it won Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Ford Field.Instead, referees whistled St. Brown for offensive pass interference in the Lions' 29-24 loss, a setback that puts playoff hopes in dire straits. With 22 seconds left earlier in the possession, officials also hit Detroit's Isaac TeSlaa for pass interference after he set a pick for St. Brown, taking Goff's 1-yard scoring toss off the board.The Lions (8-7) got four more cracks at the end zone from inside the 16-yard line after the first flag, but could not score. Coach Dan Campbell, despite his quarterback labeling the pick penalty as a \"bad call,\"  refused to blame officiating.\"We weren't able to close it out. And at the end of the day, that's on us,\" Campbell said. \"We did that. We're the ones who put ourselves in that position to where we had to try to score on the last play.\"\nThe Lions had put themselves in position to win the game with 2:05 left following a missed field goal. Sitting eighth in the NFC standings behind the Green Bay Packers for the final playoff spot, Detroit's shot at winning the division for the third straight year is over.Postseason hopes are faint.\"You can't feel sorry for yourself. It doesn't mean it doesn't sting, it doesn't feel bad,\" Campbell said. \"But we have nobody to blame but ourselves. It's on us. And it's also on us to finish. We've got two to go.\"Referee Carl Cheffers called the second penalty assessed to St. Brown a \"pretty complex play\" to a pool reporter after the game because his group of officials had to first determine if Goff had scored upon further review. It was then decided St. Brown pushed off on Jalen Ramsey to make the initial catch.\n\"We ruled that it was a backward pass, so the recovering player was able to advance it and that recovering player advanced it for a touchdown,\" Chaffers said. \"We had to rule on that and then because of the offensive pass interference, it negates the touchdown. Because it is an offensive foul, we do not extend the half. Therefore, there is no score and there is no replay of the down. That's the way the rule is written.\"According to NFL Rule 4, Section 8, Article 2 (b), if a foul occurs on the last play of the half, a score by the offense is not counted.\"It is what it is, those are the rules, you can't change them,\" St. Brown said. \"But it never comes down to one play, just because of that play,\" he said. \"We had calls go our way, too, throughout that last drive, so it goes both ways.\"\nIn order to reach the playoffs, the Lions must beat the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears while needing a pair of losses from the Packers. Green Bay plays the Vikings and the Baltimore Ravens.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        BALTIMORE -- In the waning moments, the \"MVP\" chants rained down.No, they weren't for two-time MVP Lamar Jackson. In fact, they weren't even from the home crowd. They were from the New England Patriots faithful, who were rightfully showering their young quarterback with praise as he iced the game. He even stayed on the grass for a moment after sliding, celebrating taking it in before his teammates helped him up.For the first time since 2021, the Patriots are back in the playoffs, and they're going there on the back of Drake Maye's MVP-level play. The second-year quarterback added several \"firsts\" to his rapidly growing superstar resume -- first career fourth-quarter comeback, first career 300-yard passing game (he blew by that with 380), first career playoff berth -- in New England's 28-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens on \"Sunday Night Football.\"\"This winning feeling, there's nothing like it,\" Maye said. \"Coach reminded us of that pregame. He says 'You can't buy that back.' ... At his age, he always says, 'I wish I could suit up again, and you just can't buy that.' He said, 'You can buy anything else in life, but you can't buy this time were in right now,' and what a time it is.\"What a time it is, indeed.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: 49ers, Bears and Patriots punch their tickets; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Patriots trailed 24-13 with under 10 minutes left, making this the franchise's largest fourth-quarter comeback since its Super Bowl LI victory over the Atlanta Falcons: the legendary 28-3 comeback. Over New England's final three drives -- two touchdowns and one to run out the clock -- Maye went 12 for 14 for 139 yards and a touchdown and added a 16-yard run to clinch the game for good measure.\n\"Drake's ridiculous,\" rookie left guard Jared Wilson said with a laugh and a shake of his head. \"Drake's ridiculous.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            With just over two minutes left in the third quarter, Ar'Darius Washington flew in on a blitz and swung Maye to the ground, forcing an incompletion on third-and-10. Maye spent more than a few moments on the ground recuperating before jogging to the sideline ... only to see the situation get worse. Mike Vrabel puzzlingly called for a fake punt that the Ravens stymied. Seven plays later, Derrick Henry plowed into the end zone for his second touchdown of the night, and New England trailed by 11.Including their collapse last week, the Patriots had been outscored 52-20 over roughly their last five quarters at that point. The defense was struggling. Players on both sides were dropping like flies -- Maye said New England \"probably had like 100 combinations\" in the offensive huddle -- and judging by his post-game press conference, the number of scratches, scrapes, bruises and bumps on Maye's arms likely matched that.\n\"I just thought [he was] gritty,\" Vrabel said. \"And he got hit. He got hit. They pressured, or they got home and they hit him. He just kept getting up and battling. He didn't flinch. I think it was important for all of us to have that game -- entire team.\"Maye certainly wasn't alone. Rhamondre Stevenson, who had 78 yards on just 10 touches, scored the go-ahead touchdown. On the ensuing possession, K'Lavon Chaisson made a tremendous play to track down Zay Flowers and punch the ball out. Marcus Jones recovered, allowing Maye to seal the deal. Stefon Diggs continued his remarkable season with nine catches for 138 yards. The offensive line had some stellar stretches.Still, it all comes back to Maye. On the penultimate touchdown drive, he accounted for all 73 of New England's yards and was 6 for 6 for 71 yards through the air, the final pass a beauty to Kyle Williams for a 37-yard touchdown. Maye found Stevenson for the two-point conversion to boot.\n\"He's a dog, he's a leader,\" Williams said. \"He's always coming in the huddle with some encouraging words, letting us know, reminding us of what we need to focus on, make sure we do our job. He's a conductor at the end of the day. Whatever he says, we follow, and he's been doing a great job. I'm so proud of him, but we got a lot more way to go.\"They still had a ways to go Sunday night, even. The defense got a stop, and Maye had the ball, down three with 5:02 to go. It wasn't all that different from a week prior: He got two late possessions down four to Buffalo but couldn't capitalize on either.\"I think it was kind of a wake-up call last week,\" Maye said. \"We got a chance to win the game with the game-winning drive, and this week it was like, 'Man let's not have this same feeling two weeks in a row.' I felt like that. It was kind of elephant in the room, going out there once the defense got the ball back.\"\nThe elephant quickly exited. Maye started the game-winning drive with a 20-yard rip to Mack Hollins. Two plays later, he found Diggs for a first down a split second before getting plastered by a blitzing Roquan Smith. Four plays after that, he found Diggs again for 21 yards on an inch-perfect pass just beyond the outstretched arm of Washington to convert a fourth-and-2.\"I like our chances when we're in those scenarios,\" Maye said. \"I like our chances.\"He certainly should given Diggs' prowess in clutch moments.\"You have no idea what he means to this team,\" Maye said of Diggs. \"He's a leader. He's been great in the locker room. He wants the football in his hand, and he delivers. ... He just keeps showing up and making plays and doing it at a really high level. ... He's awesome to play with.\"\nThe Patriots very well may fly as high as Maye takes them this postseason. The rushing attack can be explosive but has been mostly inconsistent -- New England is 25th in rushing success rate by running backs this season. The rushing defense allows the NFL's second-highest rushing success rate.Sunday night, though, Maye showed the biggest sign of a superstar quarterback: that a rising tide can lift all boats. He had nine completions for 20 or more yards, tied for the second-most by any player in a game this season. He did it despite taking a beating -- he was contacted a season-high 17 times -- and often having to elevate his team from substandard circumstances.On one sequence, he recovered from a botched handoff with a 12-yard gain to set up third-and-5. He evaded pressure and found Kayshon Boutte for a first down, but offensive pass interference wiped it out. No matter: On third-and-15, Maye climbed the pocket and rifled a 24-yard completion to Diggs.\n\"He got him touched up a little bit too much tonight,\" Wilson said. \"We didn't want that, but Drake's a tough guy, and some of those throws, man, it's just like ...\"He paused. He smiled.\"I remember, I messed up on one, I was like 'Oh no!' and you see him make a throw and you're just like 'Oh yeah!'\"The Patriots are headed back to the postseason. They went 4-13 last year. They are now 12-3 with bigger goals ahead. One quarter after lying on the ground in pain, Maye was lying on the ground basking in a comeback win.\nWhat a difference a year can make. What a difference a week can make. What a difference a quarter can make.What a difference Drake Maye can make.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Things can change fast in and around the transfer portal. Early in November, CBS Sports sat down with staff members at TCU and North Texas to get a sense of how Power Four and Group of Five teams prepare for the portal. At the time, the Mean Green and the Horned Frogs were in the middle of conference championship game push. But the Horned Frogs were deep into portal prep while the Mean Green were still in the thick of finishing up their high school class. In the time since, North Texas head coach Eric Morris took the Oklahoma State job and TCU, within the last few days, saw its starting quarterback Josh Hoover enter the transfer portal. Said TCU director of player personnel Tyler Olker in early November: \"It really is a week-to-week evaluation.\" Given that the North Texas personnel staff is no longer in Denton and is preparing for the portal in a different context, we're narrowing the focus of this piece to how TCU preps for the portal. \nIt's a process that started months ago and involves dozens of people in an effort to be prepared as possible when something like the Hoover situation pops up -- and yes, the Horned Frog already had portal targets in mind when Hoover decided to leave, per sources. With two weeks before the transfer portal officially opens on Jan. 2, below is a Q&A with Olker about TCU's process. Sonny Dykes and his staff, dating back to his time at SMU, have been as successful as anyone at landing quality portal classes. This is how the Horned Frogs approach that process in 2025, an era where teams are balancing a new calendar -- a single window versus two -- the realities of revenue sharing and a space that's more than ever controlled by agents. Note: This Q&A has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity How transfer portal prep beginsCBS: When does portal preparation begin and what does it look like? Olker: \"Within the last couple of weeks. It's self-scout. You're not going to just jump in the portal and say, 'We need to go get X, Y and Z or we're just going to take best available.' You have to know what your needs are. For us, we do a lot of a lot of self-scout through fall camp and weekly, so we have a good grasp of what our needs are going to be. \n\"We're always doing advanced scouting throughout the season. So, we're already kind of doing some portal scouting week by week of our own roster and of our opponent. But we've really started to kind of hone in on advanced portal scouting guys from our region, guys from smaller schools, guys that we're playing. But that's over the last couple weeks.\" CBS: What does that self-scouting process look like? Olker: \"You have to have really good synergy with your coaching staff, with your support staff. Everybody has to kind of be on the same page in terms of communication that's going on within the building. Who's doing well, who's progressing, who's developing, obviously, who they think might leave. You're getting bits and pieces from everywhere around the building, and then you kind of have to bring it back together and say, 'Okay, based on X, Y and Z we need to be prepared for so and so to leave.' I don't think it's any one place, but I think it's kind of a day-to-day evaluation.\"Guys can progress from the bye week until the end of the season. What we think right now might change in a couple of weeks. It really is a week-to-week evaluation.\" \nCBS: Do you have an example of a player going in the portal in the past you weren't expecting and how they impacted your board? Olker: \"(All-conference safety) Jamel Johnson gets in the portal (last year), or had talked about it, and came right back. Jonathan Bax same thing. Didn't really think he'd go in, he went in, saw what his opportunities were and came back. It made him realize the best situation is here.\"Jamel we had just had a coordinator change. There was some uniqueness to that as well. He wanted to go somewhere and play. His opportunities came up, he didn't like them, and he was a good enough human being that we wanted to bring him back.\n\"You go from looking for one, then he comes back and you're done. There's some nuance.\" CBS: How does the lack of a spring portal window impact how you prepare?Olker: \"You have to make decisions quicker. We've been talking about that. Developmental guys where you like to go through the spring, see how they progress and develop before maybe taking a transfer, you have to make that decision now. So, that might now be your bowl prep or your last few weeks of the season. You need to see X, Y and Z things out of (your young players). But decisions are going to have to be made earlier than they have been in the past. You don't have that safety net to continue to evaluate.\"CBS: How do you balance retention and development with portal acquisitions? Olker: \"We're always going to be in the portal, but we don't want to be in the portal near as much as we probably have been. We've taken some really good high school classes the last few years, and we need to let those guys develop. I think anytime you just take a transfer, you're putting kind of a development or a progress stopper in front of some high school kids. We're kind of at the point now where we're going to let these high school kids grow into a role and let them develop. So, we're always going to look to retain our guys before we just jump in the portal to take to take.\" \nRevenue share and assigning valueCBS: How do you look at rev share payments? Do y'all slot players? Olker: \"Just like most people would, I'd assume, we do have slot values for each position -- starter, backup, you know, third string, all that stuff. We try to shoot for that. It's kind of a fluid number. I mean, obviously there are guidelines and things you want to work through and work towards, but it can be manipulated, both having to go over or saving and going under.\" CBS: In this era when you can pay players, how often (if at all) do you lose players you actually want to keep? Olker: \"We've had guys that have been, we'll call it like attempted poached from bigger schools, so to speak. We've lost some and we've retained some. I think everybody has a value, and so you have to, kind of know what your stopping point is. I will say this: The guys that we've wanted to keep and retain, we've been able to do so, and the guys that we didn't, so to speak, aren't here.\"\nCBS: When thinking about your portal needs in an era with no spring window, how do you consider high school signees into your two-deep and roster projections? Olker: \"We're never going to project a high school player is going to come in and start. We try to keep them at baseline, and know they'll be developmental and hope they come in and surprise us. There are guys we know can contribute as freshmen. But we never try to project that. We'd rather them come in and shock us that they do better.\" CBS: When do rev share negotiations begin and when do those take place? Olker: \"We're gonna utilize December. There'll be some stuff obviously earlier. We've sat down and had initial meetings as a support staff. We'll call it to put some projections on where we think these negotiations will go. We know that the numbers that we have set versus what they may ask for are probably going to differ. So there's going to be some back and forth that we'll have to clarify on. But that stuff will kind of hopefully hash out and be done with before the portal opens. But then we'll also kind of know too, if things aren't going well from a negotiation standpoint, we'll know we need to either replace or, you know, find somebody to move on from.\"\n\n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPutting together a transfer portal big boardCBS: When do you start building out your portal board? Olker: \"We're shooting for Week 6, Week 7. It's kind of just like high school kids, right? You got to let these guys play and build up film, snaps, all that stuff, experience throughout the season. If you're watching after Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 it's probably not enough to make a decision on. The deeper into the season you go, the more data and information you're going to have.\" CBS: Your high school is very heavily Texas-based. Do you think about portal acquisition the same way?  Olker: \"We've got some guys that fall outside of our boundaries like (Idaho wide receiver transfer) Jordan Dwyers. There's always guys like that. But the majority of the time, we're going to start just like we do in high school here at TCU, looking at guys that are from Texas, from Louisiana and Oklahoma, the same footprint we kind of recruit our high school guys from. Then we'll kind of just grow outwardly. (We're) always looking for connections to TCU to Texas.\"\nCBS: Do you evaluate everyone ahead of time or are there ways you narrow the field? Olker: \"You're starting with guys that have experience. Obviously, if you're going into the portal, for the most part, you're looking for guys that have experience. … We're starting with that on our board. Then you kind of take guys … like, OK, this coach got fired. You go through their roster. (Do) they have anybody on roster that has connection? Connections to us, or that are big time players, so to speak. Then you kind of add them to the board, and that's just kind of another layer of people that you evaluate. I don't think you can project who's leaving unless there's some news out there. You have to cast a wide net and know you have a bunch of evaluations done when guys hit the portal.\" CBS: How early do agents reach out with their potential portal player lists? Olker: \"Drastically early. Have had agents reach out and kind of just (say), 'Hey, here's a list of people that we represent. Here's guys that we think are going to get in the portal.' (You) kind of (get) hit with a little bit of everything. It's like when guys are telling you they may hit the portal -- they may not. (The agents) don't really know (at that point) either, I don't think. They're kind of projecting and just kind of putting out their list.\" \nCBS: Ahead of a portal cycle how do you think about balancing your salary cap and determining if the numbers players and agents are asking for are real? Olker: \"There's really not a great way to do it. A lot of what we do is hearsay, because there's not a lot of public information and data. We have some data that we've attained just through talking with people, and some ballpark ranges, some percentiles and stuff. But there's really not a great way to say (that) so and so is worth X. So, we have to kind of work within our confines and number ranges that we've set. If they're outside of those parameters based on whatever their experience may be, you know, you either up it or move on.\"CBS: How do you go about vetting potential portal players? Olker; \"You're just trying to reach out to anybody you may know on staff of their previous school, or previous schools, plural. Because we are so regionally based, a good chunk of these guys we know their high school coaches or we recruited them in the past, so there's already a baseline knowledge of the player. That's not everybody, by any means, but you're just trying to talk to whomever you can that has touched this kid within the last year and a half, two years.\" The evaluation processCBS: What do people not understand about what goes into getting ready for a portal cycle? Olker: \"How much prep goes into it. … You don't always know what your needs are, so just how many guys you have to watch. Like, you may need a starter. That's kind of like its own criteria of player. You may need a depth guy. There's thousands of depth guys out there. You could be looking for certain nuanced things. This is just an example: A high school kid gets injured here, right? He might medical redshirt. Now you may be looking for a tweener, somebody that's like a sophomore or a junior. So, you might be looking for somebody that went off to a Power (Four) school and hasn't necessarily played or wants to come back home. There's just all these little, like, pockets and windows and little nuanced things that could pop up.\" CBS: How big is your personnel staff in terms of portal prep? Olker: \"We have four assistant DPPs, myself and (assistant AD for player personnel) Jeff Jordan, that are all evaluating, so six. Jeff is over the top. Once the board is solidified. he'll come in and oversee and bridge the gap between us and coach.\" CBS: How many players have y'all evaluated so far? Olker: \"Between 500 and 1,000. I've watched everyone from Power Four players to NAIA players.\" CBS: How long does an evaluation take? Olker: \"It can take anywhere from five minutes to 30 minutes.\"If you're evaluating kids as they hit the portal, you're probably going to be a little less in depth. And it's really like: 'Yes, this kid can do it or no, he can't.' I think on the front end, if you're pre-portal scouting, you're probably spending a little more time looking through those guys, because you have the time.\"CBS: Do the majority of your portal takes come from the players you pre-scouted? Olker: \"Of the guys we pre-scouted, we hit somewhere in like the 80% range in terms of we put an eval on a kid, he went into the portal and we took him.\" CBS: How much faster does that pre-scouting allow you to move in the portal? Olker: \"Now it's going to be even quicker, because the portal window is shorter. Every year the portal window has gotten smaller and smaller. … You want to try and get ahead as much as possible.\" CBS: What would it be like if you waited until the portal to open to actually scout guys?Olker: \"Chaos. I don't know if you could legitimately sustain doing that. There are too many guys. It happens to quickly. It's not just realistic. Elimination is just as good as finding. We say that with high school kids, too. We know we're not looking for this, or this guy doesn't meet our snap criteria, taking these guys off our plate and eliminating as much as possible leaves us with a condensed view of guys we're evaluating.\"CBS: How often do y'all hear players will enter the portal ahead of time and they don't actually jump? Olker: \"Not often. If someone is telling you, it means the kid is thinking about it.\" Power Four vs. Group of FiveCBS: How does your process compare to a Group of Five school?Olker: \"I think that we'd have more resources and we're able to do it probably earlier. When I say resources, I really just mean eyes. We have five of us, obviously, that are helping with this portal scouting process, but we also have students, and we have interns and volunteers and people that are kind of putting first-level layers of evaluations in. I would imagine we're able to designate things earlier than probably a G5 would. On the flip side of that that: A (6-5) probably knows you're not going to get some of the top guys. So, from that regard, some of those guys you're eliminating off the top, and if you're going to eliminate from the bottom of guys who haven't played, your group to evaluate is probably even smaller.\"You're also projecting. You might have to go back and look at high school film if you're taking a P4 dropping down to a G5. We're not watching high school film at all.\"So, there's probably some similarities. I think we're able to just get to our process quicker than they are throughout the season, because I'm sure too they're probably trying to finish out their high school classes. Whereas we're working on one or two guys, but we're not in the thick of it.\" CBS: How would you describe the resource gap in college football in terms of the P4 versus the G5?Olker: \"I don't think it really makes sense, right? Like, the resources that we have, the resources the G5 has and the resources that maybe, like a major Power (Four) have are all drastically different, But we're all working towards a national championship that we all compete for. And so, wouldn't you make the excuse they have a competitive advantage over us, like a major Power (Four) and we have a resource advantage over a G5? So how is that competitive equity? I don't think it makes a whole bunch of sense.\"Do we have resources? Do we max rev share? Yes. It's just all the above the cap stuff.\" \n            ",

Around this time of year that could mean snow underfoot, munching on delicious holiday treats or last-second gift buying. But for our purposes over the next few minutes it means focusing on those dramatic finishes over the weekend in the NFL or College Football Playoff.  Today's newsletter was compiled from contributions by Brad Crawford, Bryan DeArdo, Shanna McCarriston, Zach Pereles and Jasmyn Wimbish. Thanks to them all, and let's get to it.    🏈 Five things to know Monday  Steelers top Lions in controversial fashion; Bears, 49ers clinch playoff berth. The NFL somehow keeps finding new dramatic endings, as the Steelers' 29-24 win over the Lions came in a manner that even screenwriters couldn't fathom. After Chris Boswell missed a chip-shot field goal that would have given the Steelers an eight-point lead, Detroit drove down to the Pittsburgh 1-yard line. Then calamity for the Lions. A penalty wiped out an Amon-Ra St. Brown touchdown. On fourth-and-goal, St. Brown caught the ball at the 1 and lateraled to Jared Goff, who scored as time expired. But the officials ruled St. Brown committed pass interference. Because time expired, the game was over, but our Garrett Podell walks you through how it happened. As a result, the Bears and the 49ers clinched playoff berths, and the Lions' path just got a lot more narrow.Patriots clinch playoff berth with win over Ravens; Lamar Jackson injured. The Patriots rallied from 11 points down in the fourth quarter -- their largest fourth-quarter rally since that famous Super Bowl win over the Falcons back in 2017 -- and clinched a playoff berth with a 28-24 win over the Ravens. Drake Maye threw for 380 yards and two touchdowns. Lamar Jackson exited with a back injury, and Baltimore's playoff hopes are dwindling.Alabama rallies, Miami holds on in College Football Playoff. Alabama, Miami, Ole Miss and Oregon are heading to the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. After falling down by 17 points, Alabama outscored Oklahoma by 27 the rest of the way, with Zabien Brown's 50-yard pick six providing a huge swing late in the first half. Miami got an end-zone interception by Bryce Fitzgerald. his second pick of the day, to hold off Texas A&M, 10-3. Elsewhere, Ole Miss -- with Pete Golding making his coaching debut -- crushed Tulane, and Oregon crushed James Madison. Don't blame the CFP for the imbalance; blame college football as a whole, Tom Fornelli writes.Ex-Michigan assistant coach caught on tape, feds say. Eight months after federal investigators seized thousands of photos and videos as part of an investigation into former co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss, an FBI search warrant affidavit filed in federal court details security footage that captured the ex-assistant coach before he allegedly hacked into students' personal accounts to obtain explicit photos.Anthony Joshua knocks out Jake Paul with jaw-breaking punch. After a slow start, Anthony Joshua knocked out Jake Paul in the sixth round Friday night with a pulverizing right hand that broke Paul's jaw. There's no doubting Paul's bravery, but this should mark the end of him as a serious boxing attraction, Brian Campbell writes.  🏀 Tar Heels, Wildcats dazzle in Atlanta: Winners & losers from robust college basketball weekend  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The CBS Sports Classic lived up to its big-game billing with a memorable doubleheader after North Carolina hung on to beat Ohio State and Kentucky upended St. John's for the Wildcats' first ranked win of the season under second-year coach Mark Pope. The return of Kentucky center Jayden Quaintance was momentous after the big man contributed 10 points -- including several dunks -- and eight rebounds in 17 minutes as a front court weapon.  \nIsaac Trotter, Cameron Salerno and David Cobb went in-depth on the weekend's biggest winners and losers, but here's a snippet from a few of those dozen takeaways:  Winner: Houston makes statement against Arkansas in ranked battleWinner: Texas Tech stuns Duke after 17-point rallyLoser: Penny Hardaway's noticeable slide continues at MemphisLoser: Rick Pitino discouraged after St. John's sleepwalks defensivelyWinner: Purdue gets hot from long-range against AuburnThe third-ranked Blue Devils could slip when the AP Top 25 rankings come out later today. There's also expected changes outside of the top 10 following No. 23 Virginia's win over Maryland and 13th-ranked Vanderbilt's 31-point drubbing of Wake Forest.    🏈 Jaguars surge at the right time  \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            A ton of things happened during this football-filled Sunday. Fortunately, Tyler Sullivan managed to break everything down in his latest overreactions piece. One of the things he addresses is the Bills' less than impressive win over the Browns and whether or not a major flaw was exposed during their 23-20 win in Cleveland. As for a quick recap, here's everything you need to know about Week 16:  \nWinners: The Jaguars have a glide path to the postseason. At 11-4, they are only a game behind the Broncos after the Jags went to Denver and walked away with a 34-20 win. With their 29-24 win over the Lions, the Steelers secured their 22nd consecutive non-losing season, an NFL record. And Mike Tomlin also increased his record of consecutive non-losing seasons to begin a coaching career to 19. Elsewhere, the Panthers hold the division lead in the NFC South.Losers: Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones had to face the music following Sunday's loss to the Chargers which meant Dallas will not compete for a Super Bowl title for a 30th straight season. Where does the Lions' tough loss leave them in their quest to get back to the playoffs? And there's little doubt that DK Metcalf's wallet will be a little lighter after he tried to lay hands on a fan during Sunday's game. And some of our NFL Today panel suggested he might even have next Sunday off.Injuries: The Ravens lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury Sunday night. Testing will determine whether how serious the setback is. Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins was carted off the field with a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle. Chiefs backup QB Gardner Minshew is feared to have torn his ACL in their loss to the Titans, forcing the team to move to third-stringer Chris Oladokun. Clinchers: In the AFC, the Patriots joined the Broncos by nabbing a berth and the Jaguars do the same tonight if the 49ers beat the Colts, so as of this moment there are still five open slots in the conference. And it's the complete opposite in the NFC where there are only two spots remain and the Packers and Panthers have the inside track on those. The Seahawks, Bears, Eagles, Rams and 49ers have all punched their tickets. Here is the entire playoff picture through Week 16.Plus it's never too soon to think about the 2026 NFL Draft order. Fortunately, draft guru Josh Edwards provided us with an updated look at the first round while informing us of a possible upcoming game that may determine who will have the No. 1 overall pick this spring. We also have an updated mock draft ready for you this morning.    🏆 College Football Playoff down to eight title hopefuls  \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The stage is set for next week's College Football Playoff quarterfinals, including 10-seed Miami's triumph at Texas A&M and Alabama's roaring comeback at Oklahoma to avenge a previous loss.

    "body": "\n        The holiday season is here and baseball's offseason has been, well, it's been a little sluggish. Only a handful of the top free agents have signed and even fewer of the top trade candidates have been dealt. That's OK. That just means there will be lots of moves between now and Opening Day. The best is yet to come.   Spring training is a little less than two months away. While we wait, here is one holiday gift idea for fans of every MLB team. Come with me, won't you?    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tArizona Diamondbacks: A brand new bullpen   Arizona's bullpen ranked 27th in ERA, 28th in WAR, and 29th in win probability added in 2025. The bullpen alone didn't sink their season, but it certainly didn't help matters. Unless you count minor-league contracts, the D-backs have yet to add to their relief crew this winter. It'll happen at some point. The rotation is improved with Merrill Kelly's return and the offense has been one of the highest scoring in baseball the last two years. Get this team a proper bullpen and they'll be back in the postseason in 2026.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       (Sacramento) Athletics: New ownership   An exciting position player core like by Nick Kurtz, Brent Rooker, and Jacob Wilson doesn't take owner John Fisher off the hook. He gutted the roster, ripped the A's out of Oakland, and put them in a Triple-A stadium for (at least) three years. An owner who actually cares about the franchise and doesn't see it exclusively as an investment vehicle is what this fan base deserves.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tAtlanta Braves: Strider returning to form   Spencer Strider's first year back from UCL surgery was bumpy, to say the least. His performance was up and down and so too was the quality of his stuff, particularly a previously electric fastball that allowed him to lead baseball in strikeouts in 2023. It is not uncommon for a pitcher to need time (we're talking months here, sometimes even a full year) to get back to where he was prior to elbow reconstruction. Strider just turned 27 and he still has the talent to pitch at the front of a rotation. Getting that guy back in 2026 after shaking off the rust in 2025 would be a great gift for the Braves and their fans.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tBaltimore Orioles: Rutschman being a franchise catcher again   On May 17, 2024, Adley Rutschman went 2 for 4 with a double and raised his season OPS to .868. He was one of the most productive catchers in the sport. Since that date, Rutschman has a .655 OPS, which ranks 238th among the 281 players with at least 500 plate appearances. He's gone from being a franchise cornerstone to just a guy. The Orioles have been very active this offseason, most notably signing Pete Alonso and trading for Shane Baz and Taylor Ward. Getting Rutschman back to All-Star form would be about as good as an hot stove move the O's could make.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tBoston Red Sox: A Rafaela breakoutThe case can be made Ceddanne Rafaela broke out in 2025, when he set new career highs in doubles, homers, batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. He still had a .295 on-base percentage though, and his 95 OPS+ means he was 5% below league average offensively. There's another level in there for the 25 year old. Rafaela is a brilliant center fielder, maybe the best in baseball. If he can find a way to boost his on-base percentage to, say, .330, while adding a few more extra-base hits, he'll be an MVP candidate.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tChicago Cubs: More of first-half PCA   Thanks to his Gold Glove and 30-30 season, Pete Crow-Armstrong finished ninth in the National League MVP voting in 2025. It was a very first half-heavy year for him though. PCA had an .847 OPS with 25 homers and 27 steals before the All-Star break. After the break, it was a .634 OPS with six homers and eight steals. First-half PCA is a star. Second-half PCA has to fight for his roster spot. Reining in the plate discipline a tad would go a long way.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tChicago White Sox: Nail the No. 1 pick   The ChiSox already received one great holiday gift (Munetaka Murakami on a high-upside two-year contract), so they can wait for the delayed payoff here. The White Sox won the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft via the lottery, giving them a chance to add to a young talent base that, while improving, still lacks a foundational star. Perhaps that will be UCLA shortstop Roch Cholowsky? He's the early favorite to go No. 1 overall. Whoever the White Sox take next July, may that player become an impact big leaguer in short order.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tCincinnati Reds: Healthy Elly   I can't say I was surprised when the Reds announced Elly De La Cruz played through a torn quad in the second half. He had an .854 OPS before the All-Star break and a devilish .666 OPS after the break, and he hit only four (!) home runs in his final 83 games. When healthy, De La Cruz is one of the most electrifying players in the game. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on the field. Reds fans didn't see enough of healthy Elly down the stretch this past season. A left fielder who can hit the ball out of the park would be a nice holiday gift. De La Cruz at 100% would be even better.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tCleveland Guardians: An MVP for Ramírez   Another year, another top-three finish in the American League MVP voting for José Ramírez. He now has four career top-three finishes plus three other top-six finishes. Ramírez's six top-five finishes in the MVP voting are tied with Hall of Famer Eddie Murray for the most ever without winning the award. That's what happens when you've been stuck in the same league as Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, who have combined to win the last five AL MVPs. Make no mistake though, Ramírez is an MVP-caliber player. Finally winning it would be a swell holiday gift.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tColorado Rockies: An Arraez signingWith every hire they've made this offseason, the Rockies have taken one step closer to competence. Yeah, POBO Paul DePodesta was an outside-the-box hire, but Josh Byrnes (GM), Ian Levin (assistant GM), Tommy Tabous (assistant GM), and Alon Leichman (pitching coach) are all qualified individuals with a chance to make this team respectable. I like Luis Arraez as a holiday gift and on-field fit here. Plop him at first base/DH and let him spray the ball all around baseball's biggest outfield in Coors Field. Colorado almost certainly won't contend in 2026, but Arraez is an entertaining player when he's hitting, and the Rockies faithful deserve entertaining players.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tDetroit Tigers: A Skubal extension   Perhaps the most obvious baseball gift of the holiday season. Skubal, the reigning two-time AL Cy Young winner, is a year away from free agency, and while Scott Boras clients usually don't sign extensions, why not put one on the list? Sometimes Santa blows you away with something you don't expect. Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander, and Zack Wheeler have already crossed the $40-million-per-year line as starting pitchers, albeit on short-term deals. Make Skubal the first $40 million a year pitcher on a long-term contract (nine years?) and call it a holiday season.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tHouston Astros: Better injury management   After Kyle Tucker's shin fracture in 2024 and Yordan Alvarez's hand issue in 2025, plus some pitcher stuff, Houston's injury management has come into question. The team has acknowledged it. The head trainer was let go after the season and general manager Dana Brown said they will take a \"deep dive\" into their return-to-play procedures. It's really hard to win in this game, even when you have really good players, which the Astros do. Getting injury management right is essential and the Astros have lagged badly in that area the last few years. Improving there could be as significant as any roster addition.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tKansas City Royals: More Jac jams   It was a rough introduction to the big leagues for top prospect Jac Caglianone this past season. He authored a .532 OPS and hit only seven home runs in 232 plate appearances, and his right field defense was predictably rough given his inexperience. Caglianone is not the first touted youngster to struggle in his earliest taste of the show, nor will he be the last. The kid has mammoth, jaw-dropping power though. It may come with a low on-base percentage and shaky defense, but he's a threat to change a game with one swing every at-bat. A fine gift would be that powering showing up more often in 2026 and beyond.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tLos Angeles Angels: A vintage Trout season   Now 34, Mike Trout is in the \"productive player with injury issues\" phase of his career after being the best player of the 2010s. He did play 130 games in 2025, his most since 2019, though he also set a new career low with a .797 OPS. You can quibble with their methods, but the Angels are trying to contend in 2026. Getting a vintage Trout season -- I'm talking something like a .310/.400/.600 line with 35 bombs -- would make contention much more realistic. Plus, Trout proving to the world he's still that dude would be awfully fun.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tLos Angeles Dodgers: A lump of coal   Sorry, Dodgers fans. You can live with a lump of coal this holiday season. You've got two straight World Series titles, you get to watch Shohei Ohtani every night, and you have the No. 1 ranked farm system. You have everything you could already want. Leave some for the rest of us.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tMiami Marlins: A great haul for Alcantara   I don't know if it'll happen this offseason or at the trade deadline, or maybe not even next offseason, but at some point the Marlins will trade away Sandy Alcantara. Whenever it happens, they need to knock it out of the park with their return. Using up one of your holiday gifts on that outcome is worth it. The price of pitching is always sky high and the Marlins, while improved in 2025, still need help up and down the roster. May the Alcantara trade, whenever it happens, be transformative.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tMilwaukee Brewers: A full season of Woodruff   It's been a while since Brandon Woodruff, one of the very best pitchers in franchise history, has made it through a full season healthy. Such is life with pitchers. He made 11 starts around injury in 2023, missed the entire 2024 season with shoulder surgery, and made 12 starts around injury in 2025. When on the mound, Woodruff was great. I'm sure the Brewers will manage him carefully in 2026 -- they're planning for a deep October run, not necessarily banking every last regular-season win -- but Woodruff avoiding the injury bug and giving the team a full season of starts would be a wonderful feel-good gift.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tMinnesota Twins: Good health, for once   I swear, it seems like the Twins are hit with a devastating injury or three every season. Byron Buxton's and Royce Lewis' injury histories are well known. Alex Kirilloff retired at age 27 due to persistent wrist trouble. Top prospect Walker Jenkins has yet to play even 90 games in a season. On and on we could go. The Twins are long overdue for a season in which the injury luck goes their way and their best players (in MLB and the minors) all stay on the field.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tNew York Mets: A Bregman signingWe could go any number of ways with the Mets. A true ace. A clubhouse that is more harmonious. Francisco Alvarez staying healthy. Fewer LOLMETS moments. We'll go with signing Alex Bregman as our Mets' holiday idea. He would improve the infield defense considerably, something that is said to be a priority, and he'd also give the Mets a middle-of-the-order righty bat. That's exactly what they lost when Pete Alonso left as a free agent. Bregman would also bring championship pedigree. I would not sign him specifically for that. It's just part of the package, and something that's nice to have.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tNew York Yankees: An owner with better PR skillsEvery time chairman Hal Steinbrenner opens his mouth, he leaves Yankees fans feeling worse about the team. He complains about payroll constantly, frequently saying he wants to lower it. Who is the audience for that? The other 29 owners? You own the Yankees. Just say you want to win the World Series and will do whatever it takes! How hard is that? You don't even have to mean it! It just has to sound good. Steinbrenner spends a lot of money on his team, but good gravy, his press conferences are the ultimate vibes killer.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tPhiladelphia Phillies: Painter being the next big thing   It feels like Phillies fans have been waiting on top prospect Andrew Painter for an eternity, but he's still only 22. Tommy John surgery cost him all of 2023 and most of 2024, though he stayed healthy in 2025, even if the results weren't great. Painter is in line to compete for a rotation spot in spring training. Even if he doesn't get one, he should make his MLB debut at some point in 2026. The Phillies have gotten very good at developing pitchers, especially at the big-league level. Painter reaching the show and delivering on the hype would be a swell holiday gift.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tPittsburgh Pirates: Griffin becomes an instant star   Konnor Griffin, the No. 9 pick in the 2024 Draft, is arguably the best prospect in baseball, and reports indicate the Pirates will give the 19-year-old a chance to win a job in spring training. He would solve their shortstop problem and energize the fan base the same way Paul Skenes did upon his arrival. The Pirates really aren't that far away from contention. The Brandon Lowe trade was a nice start. If they bring in another bat and Griffin hits the ground running, they could stay relevant deep into September next season.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tSt. Louis Cardinals: Walker making the leap   Since winning a job in spring training three years ago, Jordan Walker has left the Cardinals and their fans wanting more. The former top prospect has a career .680 OPS and he's not providing much defensive value in right field. The Cardinals have made it no secret they intend to take a step back in the short term with the goal of building a better roster long term. Walker, who is still only 23, figuring things out next year and becoming a middle-of-the-order bat would accelerate the team's timeline significantly.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tSan Diego Padres: An owner who carries on Seidler's legacy   Last month, the family of late Padres owner Peter Seidler announced they will \"initiate a formal process to explore strategic options\" with the franchise, which means they want to sell the team. Peter Seidler made it known winning was his No. 1 priority and he sunk a lot of money -- A LOT of money -- into the roster to build a contender. Since his death in November 2023, a restrictor plate has been put on payroll and now the team is for sale. A great holiday gift for Padres fans would be the next owner carrying on Seidler's legacy and doing all he or she can to bring San Diego its first ever World Series championship.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tSan Francisco Giants: A Bichette signing   Now that he's reportedly willing to play second base, Bo Bichette makes a world of sense for a Giants team that has Willy Adames entrenched at short and a little too much swing and miss in the lineup. Robbie Ray's contract comes off the books after next season and the Adames/Matt Chapman/Rafael Devers/Logan Webb core is ready to win right now. Juicing payroll for one year (until Ray leaves) to add Bichette is a great gift idea and could be the difference between playing baseball or golf next October.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tSeattle Mariners: The franchise's first pennant   The Mariners came agonizingly close to their first ever World Series berth this past season. They had a one-run lead with eight outs to go in Game 7 of the ALCS, but couldn't seal the deal. The Mariners are the only team in baseball to never play in the World Series. They have the roster to get there with Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez anchoring the lineup and a standout rotation fronted by Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, and Bryan Woo. There could be no better gift for this fan base.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tTampa Bay Rays: McClanahan comes back strong   Injuries, including Tommy John surgery, have kept Shane McClanahan off a big-league mound since Aug. 2, 2023. He is expected to be ready for the start of spring training and a return to form would give the Rays such a big lift. Remember, McClanahan was in the AL Cy Young conversation before his injury. Getting a two-time All-Star with a career 3.03 ERA back could be enough to vault Tampa back into the postseason race.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tTexas Rangers: Carter stays healthy   Two years ago, Evan Carter rose to stardom in the postseason, regularly hitting third for the Rangers as they won their first ever World Series title. Injuries, including back and wrist issues, have limited him to only 108 games over the last two seasons though. We saw in October 2023 how impactful Carter can be. He transformed the lineup. The Rangers really struggled offensively in 2025. Getting Carter, who is still only 23, back and healthy in 2026 would give the lineup much more juice.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tToronto Blue Jays: A Tucker signing   I can understand the fan base preferring Bo Bichette, a homegrown star, but I think Kyle Tucker fits the roster better as a good defensive outfielder with the contact/power offensive profile the Blue Jays crave. George Springer and Daulton Varsho are both a year away from free agency, so long-term outfield help is needed, and Toronto would still be pretty well set on the infield: Addison Barger at third, Andrés Giménez at short, Ernie Clement at second, and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. at first. Tucker would make Toronto the clear AL favorites, if they're not already.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       \tWashington Nationals: Crews taking the next step   It has been tough sledding for Dylan Crews, the No. 2 pick in the 2023 Draft, in his admittedly brief big-league career. He has a .634 OPS in 116 career games, 85 of which came around a significant oblique strain in 2025. The Nationals have a new front office, a new manager, and a new coaching staff. Crews is only 23. The new leadership group getting his career on track would be a very nice holiday gift and a great way to kick off this new era of Nationals baseball.   \n            ",

    "description": "\n        After a 38-14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in which the devastation of another blowout loss paled in comparison to the devastation of Jayden ",
    "body": "\n        After a 38-14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in which the devastation of another blowout loss paled in comparison to the devastation of Jayden Daniels' dislocated elbow in the waning moments, coach Dan Quinn altered between frustration, disbelief, anger and sadness.What else was there to feel? The Washington Commanders' season had already gone off the rails, and Daniels had suffered yet another injury, his third on this disastrous season but his first that came in true garbage time. A day later, Quinn admitted he made a mistake having Daniels in the game. But on this dreary Sunday night in the bowels of Northwest Stadium, he had to confront the biggest question: Could the Commanders protect Daniels?\"I think the answer to that is we will give him the support to do that,\" Quinn said. \"And I'm certain of that, to make sure we do that in every single way. And that's ... offense, defense, the whole way through, man. I absolutely feel that way on the hamstring injury and tonight with an elbow. It's really important we get that part right, and we will.\"Daniels returned five weeks after the elbow dislocation, landed on the afflicted elbow, aggravated the injury, and left the game. Luckily, the fall didn't cause any further structural damage to the elbow. The Commanders initially only ruled him out for the next game. Then they finally shut him down for the season.\nThe final tally was dispiriting. Daniels played in seven games. He exited three of them early due to injury. He suffered three different injuries -- a knee sprain in Week 2, a hamstring strain in Week 7 and an elbow dislocation in Week 9 -- and an aggravation of that third injury. He went from Offensive Rookie of the Year sensation to sidelined sophomore. His team went from Cinderella story to dregs of the league, a spot the franchise knows all too well.In fact, one could argue they know this quarterback timeline all too well, too.Back in 2012, Washington had another dual-threat Offensive Rookie of the Year quarterback who led the team to a surprising playoff berth behind a fancy new offense, suffered an injury and had a disappointing second season. He was never the same.The comparisons between Daniels and Robert Griffin III should end there, though.First and foremost, the injuries are completely different. Daniels played his entire rookie year before suffering three separate injuries his second season, none of which were season-ending. Griffin tore his ACL and suffered other knee damage at the end of his 2012 rookie season. He had suffered a sprained LCL in the same knee just weeks earlier and had already been playing with a brace on the knee. He also had torn the same ACL in college.\nThen, he rushed back in 2013. Adidas produced an \"All In For Week 1\" ad campaign centered around Griffin. Griffin has admitted playing at all in 2013 -- much less in Week 1 -- is the biggest regret of his career. He recently told \"The Dan Patrick Show\" that he'd tell Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons -- both of whom tore their ACLs in Week 15 -- they shouldn't play at all in 2026.Not only has Daniels not suffered any injuries of that degree, but he's been held out from returning to multiple games he wanted to reenter. The team has been in lockstep ensuring Daniels misses the time he needs to miss.\"We will just kind of go through the whole process with him, and we're not going to miss it either,\" Quinn said after Week 2. \"With Jayden, we know how important he is, and so we're just going to kind of take it. That's why I truly say it's day by day to make sure that he can absolutely be himself.\"\nThat's a departure from the Griffin years marked by internal turmoil that has been well-documented.Then-coach Mike Shanahan cleared out his office during the 2012 season because of the way then-owner Daniel Snyder treated him and empowered Griffin, placing Griffin on a pedestal above other players.Griffin brushed off coaches' advice -- including remarks regarding his footwork. He also emphasized returning for 2013 Week 1 over actually improving as a quarterback during his first professional offseason, Shanahan said.Griffin's father was a constant presence both in the locker room and in Snyder's and Shanahan's ears. Shanahan and Griffin clashed during the 2013 season. There have been no signs of any of that in current-day Washington. Daniels has been widely praised for his diligent work ethic, and he and Quinn have a strong relationship. Current owner Josh Harris has been a revelation compared to Snyder.Finally, there's a significant difference between Daniels and Griffin as quarterbacks. Griffin was a byproduct of Kyle Shanahan's zone read-heavy scheme that changed the NFL. As teams figured that out -- and with Griffin unable to return to his level of athleticism prior to his torn ACL -- he became less and less effective.\nAfter a 1.3% interception rate in 2012, Griffin's interception rates ballooned to 2.6%, 2.8% and 2.0% in his next three seasons. He was never a starter again. Daniels had a 1.9% interception rate as a rookie, and it actually fell to 1.3% in his second season. Furthermore, Griffin's sack rates increased every season, including 13.4% in 2014, his final season in Washington and his first outside the Shanahan system. Daniels' sack rate went down from 8.9% last season to 8.7% this season.This isn't a slight to Griffin, whose career fell off quickly for several reasons, not all of which were his fault. But just because it's easy to compare Griffin and Daniels -- faces of the Washington franchise, former Heisman Trophy winners, No. 2 overall picks, Offensive Rookie of the Year winners, mobile quarterbacks, disappointing second seasons -- doesn't mean it's apt. Given the nature of the injuries, the trajectory of Griffin's career after his injury and the surrounding situations, the idea that Daniels is becoming Griffin is a lazy assertion.That doesn't mean, however, that the Commanders can stand idly by and dismiss a disastrous 2025 season due to injury misfortune and a plethora of other issues.\nWashington must be diligent to help restore Daniels' path to stardom -- one that seemed certain just months ago -- and Daniels must follow in kind.In short, Quinn's words can't be empty promises. Here are five ways Washington and its quarterback can ensure they won't be.\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            1. Daniels must learn to protect himselfEven though he only completed three of his seven games, Daniels was contacted on 11.7 plays per game this season. That's the third-highest rate among quarterbacks, only behind Justin Fields (benched) and Justin Herbert, who is 6-foot-6 and 236 pounds, much larger than the slender Daniels (6-foot-4, 210 pounds).\nSimply put, Daniels takes too many hits. He was contacted on a league-high 12.4 plays per game last year, the fourth-highest rate in the league. Mobile quarterbacks tend to take more hits, but Daniels can do a better job avoiding them.One area Daniels can improve upon is sliding, an issue that goes back to Daniels' very first preseason game. Quinn jokingly put Daniels on \"double secret probation\" after he didn't slide on a run in his unofficial NFL debut. Daniels also ran through a pair of defenders in the 2025 preseason instead of sliding. Both times, he mentioned his competitiveness as reasons he didn't slide.Competitiveness is fine. It's very good, in fact -- a requisite for a professional athlete. But so, too, are smarts, availability and longevity. Daniels isn't the first young quarterback to learn this in the pros, and he won't be the last.\n\"I think the number one [are for growth] is that competitive spot for him and also those decisions to protect the team, to know when to get down, when to slide, when to throw it out of bounds,\" Quinn said. \"And so, most of those come on a dropback pass where you're outside the pocket and it's typical for a lot of quarterbacks who are outside the pocket, what do you do? It's scrambles, it's part of what we track every week defensively. Scramble to run, to throw, where the sack's coming from.\"2. Retain Laremy TunsilThe Commanders made several win-now moves over the past season and a half, a development that led to the team having the oldest team in the NFL by a significant margin. The biggest win-now move was sending a 2025 third-round pick, a 2025 seventh-round pick, a 2026 second-round pick and a 2026 fourth-round pick to the Houston Texans for left tackle Laremy Tunsil and a 2025 fourth-round pick.Amid a down season for the franchise and inconsistent returns from many of the players added in win-now moves, Tunsil shone. He is the seventh highest-graded offensive tackle in Pro Football Focus' grades and third in pass blocking. His 84.7 grade this season is on track to be the best of his career.\nTunsil, 31, is well worth investing in again. Top-tier left tackles are rare; that's why Washington went after Tunsil with such aggression. It's unlikely that Washington would give away so much draft capital for just one season of Tunsil.Ever since the Commanders settled on a starting five -- from left to right: Tunsil, Chris Paul, Tyler Biadasz, Sam Cosmi and Josh Conerly Jr. -- they've had one of the best pass-protecting units in the NFL. Conerly only turned 22 last month and has made immense strides this season. Biadasz and Cosmi, who has rounded into form after returning from a torn ACL, are both under contract next year. Washington would do well to ensure the same for Tunsil.3. Add speed at wide receiver, pass catcherEven with the addition of Deebo Samuel Sr., Washington came into the season paper thin at wide receiver, a weakness that was exposed throughout training camp without Terry McLaurin. After finally getting a contract extension, McLaurin started slow and then suffered a quad injury. He played in just four of Washington's first 12 games. The team has also been without its top deep threat, Noah Brown, for almost the entire season.\nWashington needs to add speed and explosiveness all over its roster, pass catcher especially. The Commanders are 26th in yards after catch per reception and 25th in percentage of touches that go 20+ yards. They need a more reliable downfield threat opposite McLaurin. Impending free agent Alec Pierce has evolved from almost exclusively a deep threat to a well-rounded receiver and could be a fit.It's not just at wide receiver, though. Dependable tight end Zach Ertz tore his ACL and might not be back next season. John Bates is primarily a blocking tight end, and 2024 second-round rookie Ben Sinnott is unproven.Then, at running back, Austin Ekeler tore his Achiles and missed almost all of the season. His absence showed up across the board, with responsibilities falling to seventh-round rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt and veterans Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jeremy McNichols. Washington's rushing effectiveness plummeted this season: Washington's running backs are 12th in rushing success rate in 2025 after being fourth in 2024. Croskey-Merritt shows flashes, Rodriguez is a bruiser, and McNichols is dependable on passing downs. Still, upgrades could be in store.4. Consider adding more under-center elements to the offenseThis would be a considerable philosophical departure for offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, who has always run one of the NFL's most shotgun-heavy offenses. Washington has been under center on 10% of its plays this season, by far the lowest rate in the NFL; Cincinnati is second-lowest at 17%, and the league average is 35%. Washington was also last in 2024.\"I think with Jayden starting off, comfort level more than anything, we want to tailor offense to what he is used to, comfortable with and does the best,\" Kingsbury said in November. \"But you've seen certain teams have a lot of success under center, a lot of teams have had success in shotgun, so I don't think there's a right or wrong. I think it's playing to your personnel and maximizing what you want to do offensively.\"Under center is back en vogue in the NFL.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There's a correlation between under center rates and success rate + explosive play rates. That the Commanders have still performed decently is a testament to Kingsbury, Marcus Mariota and an improving offensive line.Not only would being under center more make Washington a better offense -- it has shown, league-wide, to be a more effective way to run the ball -- but it could also help take some heat off Daniels. Fewer reads and RPOs means fewer hits. Under center play action helps freeze pass rushers and linebackers for a moment or two better than shotgun play action does. It also can provide more quick, easy answers.Kingsbury doesn't have to become Sean McVay. But even incorporating under-center formations just a little bit more could go a long way.5. Overhaul the defenseThe lone non-offensive adjustment might be the most important -- for Daniels, for the offense, for everyone.The Commanders' defense has been awful. The Commanders rank 31st in points per drive allowed, takeaways per drive and three-and-out rate forced.Washington cannot defend the pass. The Commanders' 8.0 net yards per pass attempt is tracking to be the worst by any team since 2020. Out of 1,669 individual seasons since the 1970 AFL-NFL meerger, Washington's net yards per pass attempt allowed ranks 1,655th. Put another way, there are only 14 worse seasons over the last 56 years.Washington needs upgrades everywhere, with pass rusher at the top of the list. But Washington could move on from 35-year-old linebacker Bobby Wagner as well. Wagner is a future Hall of Famer and still a tremendous tackler, but he has struggled in coverage. He also calls the plays defensively, so that is a crucial spot.Promising rookie cornerback Trey Amos had his season cut short, but even with him and Mike Sainristil back, Washington must improve its cornerbacks and safeties. The Commanders will also be counting on significant internal improvement, too. There are some young pieces, many of whom had down seasons.A better defense means less stress on Daniels to make so many plays. All of his injuries came in games the Commanders were chasing as the defense struggled.\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Big offseason aheadThe Commanders are projected to have over $60 million in effective cap space this offseason, sixth-most in the NFL, and their first draft pick -- which will be in the top 10 -- is of paramount importance. While they are without some later draft picks, they can focus on a significant free-agent haul, a group that can help now and in the future.Think of the New England Patriots' 2025 offseason. New England drafted Will Campbell fourth overall to solidify Drake Maye's offensive line but also hit it big in free agency with Stefon Diggs, Milton Williams, Carlton Davis III, Robert Spillane, Harold Landry III, K'Lavon Chaisson, Khyiris Tonga and Mack Hollins, among others. Washington GM Adam Peters has a big offseason ahead, one full of both great power and great responsibility.Washington and Daniels may have been two of the league's biggest disappointments this year. That doesn't preclude either from bouncing back in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make a Week 16 NFL SGP comes on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both teams are on streaks, as San Fran has won four straight, while Indy has lost four straight. That would make NFL picks on the money line in favor of the Niners attractive for a 'Monday Night Football' SGP, but the recent history of this matchup may suggest otherwise. The Colts have won five straight games versus the Niners, so your MNF same-game parlay may want to consider NFL props, spread picks and the over/under.While this game features the likes of Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor and George Kittle, many will target 44-year-old Philip Rivers with prop bets for their MNF SGP. After 120 passing yards last week, Rivers' O/U for passing yards is 158.5 for Monday. San Fran's defense isn't the same caliber as the one in Seattle that Rivers saw last Sunday, so the Over could be appealing for your NFL same-game parlay. Before locking in any Colts vs. 49ers picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the 49ers vs. Colts prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Jonathan Taylor as an anytime touchdown scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Colts vs. 49ers on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP.

With the postseason in their sights, the Niners are giving backup, Brian Robinson Jr., more touches in order to keep McCaffrey fresh for the playoffs. The former Commander has at least seven carries in each of his last five games, after reaching that number just twice over his first nine contests. Additionally, Indy's defensive strengths and weaknesses may have San Francisco lean on McCaffrey more thru the air than on the ground.The Colts have the No. 6 run defense and have allowed the second-fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025. On the other hand, the Colts have the second-worst pass defense, and San Fran will need more out of McCaffrey through the air with Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) out. McCaffrey is projected to have 14.4 carries on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here.Bet McCaffrey to go Under 17.5 carries at DraftKings:\nHow to make Colts vs. 49ers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has six other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your 49ers vs. Colts SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Colts vs. 49ers predictions?

    "body": "\nThe 'Monday Night Football' matchup between the Colts and 49ers at 8:15 p.m. ET features the top two Fantasy running backs in the NFL DFS player pool. Jonathan Taylor and Christian McCaffrey rank first and second, respectively, in positional Fantasy points as they'll be the first names that come to mind when making NFL DFS picks. Both teams have stud tight ends as well in Tyler Warren and George Kittle, but the differing abilities of their respective quarterbacks shouldn't be overlooked when crafting a MNF DFS strategy.Brock Purdy boosts the value of wideouts like Jauan Jennings, while one can't necessarily say that of Philip Rivers with Colts receivers. The limitations of the 44-year-old should make you give a little extra thought to if the likes of Alec Pierce or Michael Pittman Jr. should find their way into your NFL DFS lineups. Before making any 49ers vs. Colts NFL DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for 49ers vs. ColtsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Niners running back Christian McCaffrey. The three-time Pro Bowler is as consistent a Fantasy player there is, and he's coming off a game with 87 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. He has at least 96 total yards or a touchdown in all but one game this season as both his running and receiving ability give him an extremely high Fantasy floor. McCaffrey is averaging a touchdown per game this year and is on pace for 2,115 scrimmage yards, which would be the sixth-most by any player over the last decade. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet McCaffrey to go Over 62.5 rushing yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Colts tight end Tyler Warren, who ranks fourth amongst tight ends in receiving yards (718) and is sixth in positional Fantasy points as a rookie. He's been targeted six times in each of the last two weeks, so he's remained a big part of Indy's offensive game plan even after Daniel Jones' injury. That should especially be the case on Monday as San Francisco has had no answer for tight ends in the red zone recently. The Niners have allowed six touchdowns to tight ends over their last six games as one can expect Indy to target that defensive weakness. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Warren to go Over 34.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set 49ers vs. Colts NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

That's when the All-Pro wide receiver frantically whipped the football backward with the hopes a teammate would recover the football and run in for the game-winning touchdown. Funny enough, Goff did just that despite the Steelers defense appearing to stop playing because it seemed like St. Brown was held up long enough for the play to be blown dead because of forward progress. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: 49ers, Bears and Patriots punch their tickets; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, Goff's scoop and score off St. Brown's lateral was wiped away because St. Brown pushed off of Steelers All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey to make the initial catch at the start of the play. \nHead referee Carl Cheffers explained that because the penalty was on the offense that Goff's touchdown was nullified. By NFL rules, an offensive penalty when time has expired does not trigger a replay of the previous play, so the Steelers walked away with a crucial, late-season victory.\nThe Lions' playoff hopes are now slim to none as a result of their last-second loss. Detroit needs the Green Bay Packers, the current owner of the NFC's seventh and final playoff spot, to lose their last two games against the Baltimore Ravens (7-8) and the Minnesota Vikings (7-8), and the Lions also need to win their last two games at the Vikings and at the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (11-4). \n            \n    ",

He went back to the locker room with Baltimore training staffers, and after the team initially ruled him questionable to return, he was ruled out for the game late in the third quarter.Jackson, 28, took a knee to the back while going down on a run and left the field. Tyler Huntley took over for one play, and the Ravens kicked a field goal on the next snap after that to tie the game, 10-10. Huntley played the Ravens' final drive of the half as well.\nJackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries all season. He suffered a hamstring strain in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and missed three games, returning in Week 9 against the Miami Dolphins. However, he has only had one full week of practice since then due to knee, ankle and toe ailments. He also dealt with an illness this week.Jackson's rushing production has fallen off steadily this season, especially in the wake of the hamstring injury and the injuries that followed. Entering Week 16, he is averaging 30.3 rushing yards per game this season, by far a career low. His 5.5 rushes per game are also on pace to be a career low.\nAs of Jackson's back injury, Ravens (7-7) are 1.5 games back of the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) in the AFC North. Baltimore has a 20% chance to make the playoffs, per SportsLine.\n            \n    ",

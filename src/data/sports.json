Baltimore is coming off a 41-24 thumping of the Green Bay Packers in Week 17, while Pittsburgh dropped a 13-6 decision to the Cleveland Browns. The Ravens (8-8), who have won the past two division championships, would hold the tiebreaker with Pittsburgh if they finish with the same record. The Steelers (9-7), who are looking for their first AFC North crown since 2020, are 5-3 on their home field. Lamar Jackson (back) will start at quarterback for the Ravens, while receiver Rashod Bateman is inactive. Pittsburgh will again be without receiver DK Metcalf (suspension), but T.J. Watt (lung) is expected to return after having surgery.Kickoff from Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh is set for 8:20 p.m. ET.

Henry rushed 36 times for 216 yards and four touchdowns at Green Bay. For the season, he has carried 287 times for 1,469 yards and 16 touchdowns. He has 15 explosive plays of 20 yards or more, including a long of 59, with 74 first-down conversions. He has also caught 20 passes for 150 yards and has over 100 scrimmage yards earlier this year versus Pittsburgh.Wide receiver Zay Flowers has been solid in the passing game. In 16 games, Flowers has 82 receptions for 1,073 yards and three touchdowns. He also has 17 big plays of 20 yards or more, including a long of 56, with 400 yards after the catch and 45 first-down conversions. Against the Packers, he caught four passes for 30 yards and a score. Facing Pittsburgh's No. 29 passing defense, Flowers should find holes in the secondary. See which team to back at SportsLine. Bet Lamar Jackson to go Over 214.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\nWhy the Steelers can winVeteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who is in his 21st season in the league, powers the Pittsburgh offense. In 15 games, he has completed 65.6% of his passes for 3,028 yards and 23 touchdowns with seven interceptions and a 95.3 rating. Rodgers has also rushed for one score and should be able to take advantage of Baltimore's 29th-ranked pass defense. In the win over the Ravens in December, he completed 23 of 34 passes for 284 yards and one touchdown. He also rushed for one score.Four-year veteran running back Jaylen Warren helps lead the Steelers' ground attack. In 15 games, he has carried 197 times for 892 yards (4.5 average) and six touchdowns. He has six explosive plays of 20 or more yards, including a long of 45. He has converted 48 first downs, and he scored a touchdown versus Baltimore earlier this season. In a 29-24 win at Detroit on Dec. 21, he carried 14 times for 143 yards and two touchdowns. See which team to back at SportsLine.Bet Jonnu Smith to go Over 16.5 total receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Ravens vs. Steelers  picksTierney has analyzed Ravens vs. Steelers from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

The Ravens also had 217 yards on the ground in Week 14 versus Pittsburgh, so it has shown it can exploit the Steelers in that regard, and the latter already struggles in defending through the air as Pittsburgh ranks 29th in pass defense. Additionally, Baltimore held Pittsburgh to a season-low of 34 rushing yards in that earlier contest, while the Steelers failed to find the endzone without Metcalf on Sunday. Thus, there are multiple areas where Baltimore should excel over Pittsburgh, and one can't overlook that the Ravens are 4-1 ATS over their last five road games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Steelers can coverPittsburgh has confidence in that it just beat the Ravens, in Baltimore, a month ago, and Aaron Rodgers has experienced nothing but success versus the Ravens. He's 4-0 versus the team over his career, making it one of two opponents he's undefeated against. Pittsburgh's success versus its rival extends beyond when Rodgers joined the team as the Steelers are 7-3 ATS versus Baltimore over their last 10 meetings. The Steelers' defense is also playing its best, allowing just 17.3 points over its last three games, and it is poised to get its best player back with T.J. Watt (lung) off the injury report and expected to return on Sunday night. Finally, Pittsburgh boasts the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-11), while Baltimore has the fifth-most giveaways (22). See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Steelers vs. Ravens  picksSportsLine's model has simulated Ravens vs. Steelers  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 47 combined points.

It was a somewhat evenly contested match and leaves United in fifth place on the Premier League table, still well within touching distance of a UEFA Champions League spot, though the Red Devils now have just one win in their last five matches.That run of form has added another hurdle in a bumpy tenure at United for Amorim, who took the helm in November 2024, though his comments on Sunday suggested the disconnect between him and the club's higher-ups may be down to more than just results.\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United, and that is clear,\" Amorim said. \"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United, and it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change, so that was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until [an]other guy is coming here to replace me.\"\nAmorim also suggested that all parties involved might be willing to end things when his contract expires, even as criticism mounts amidst a poor run of form.\"I just want to say I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach, and I was really clear on that, and that is going to finish in 18 months, and then, everyone is going to move on,\" Amorim continued. \"That was the deal. That is my job – not to be a coach. If people handle the [Sky Sports broadcaster] Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club … I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach and every department – the scouting department, the [sporting] director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.\"Amorim has made his dissatisfaction with United's power players clear over the last several weeks, including through comments on Christmas Eve that the club needs to put in \"time and money\" to make his preferred 3-4-3 system work. He admitted, though, on Friday in a pre-match press conference that there are \"no conversations\" about bringing in players during the January transfer window and that questions on that front should be directed towards United's director of football Jason Wilcox.\nThe manager's contract expires at the end of the 2026-27 season and includes an option to extend the deal by another year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Nebraska Cornhuskers have found their replacement for Dylan Raiola in the NCAA transfer portal. Former Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey has committed to Nebraska, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz.A four-star recruit and the No. 12 quarterback in the 2023 signing class, Minchey pushed C.J. Carr for the starting job at Notre Dame ahead of the 2024 season. The redshirt sophomore ultimately lost the battle, and Carr never looked back as he led the Fighting Irish to a 10-2 record.Although Minchey came up short against Carr, he made the competition much closer than most expected. After Carr was announced as the starter, one source told CBS Sports that it could have gone either way.\"I think it was 50-50 where guys think it could have gone either way where some guys expected one guy and some the other,\" the source said.\nSources also told CBS Sports that Minchey started to win over the coaching staff with his consistency, which ran counter to Carr, who flashed the ability to make big plays but was careless with the football at times.That Minchey was able to outshine Carr in some areas probably gives Nebraska hope that it just landed a budding star in the transfer portal. Minchey wasn't able to put much on film at Notre Dame as he really only saw action in a mop-up role. This past season, Minchey completed 20 of his 26 passes for 196 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions.Minchey was able to find the end zone on the ground as he finished the year with 84 rushing yards and one score.\nWhen he arrives in Lincoln, Minchey will be tasked with getting Nebraska over the hump. The Huskers have now turned in back-to-back 7-6 seasons under coach Matt Rhule, and the program wants to take another step toward competing for a Big Ten title.Minchey will be replacing Raiola, a former five-star recruit who failed to truly deliver on that pedigree in Lincoln. Raiola entered the transfer portal after two seasons with the Huskers.Speculation about Raiola's eventual exit really picked up when his brother Dayton decommitted from Nebraska in November. Rhule also fired Donovan Raiola, Dylan's uncle and the offensive line coach, after the season ended.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati transfer quarterback Brendan Sorsby has committed to Texas Tech, CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz report, choosing the Red Raiders after a quick visit schedule that also included LSU.Sorsby is rated as the No. 2 quarterback and the No. 2 overall transfer prospect in this cycle in the 247Sports transfer rankings,Sorsby's decision keeps him in the Big 12 and gives Texas Tech an experienced option at quarterback after a season that ended with lingering questions at the position. The Red Raiders won the Big 12 Championship for their first out-right conference title since 1955 but struggled offensively in their College Football Playoff quarterfinal loss to Oregon at the Orange Bowl, where Behrens Morton was unable to generate much production in a 23-0 shutout.\n        \n            \n                Drew Mestemaker commits to Oklahoma State: Former North Texas QB joins coach Eric Morris in Stillwater\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech has already demonstrated a willingness to be aggressive in the transfer portal, using resources and NIL opportunities to target impact players at positions of need. Sorsby's addition signals that the Red Raiders are prepared to continue that approach, blending proven experience with a roster built to compete at the highest level of the conference.How Sorsby fits with Texas Tech Sorsby joins a room that includes rising sophomore Will Hammond, who suffered a torn ACL this season. While he could be ready for the start of 2026, Sorsby provides immediate experience and the option for Hammond to gain more experience in a backup role before taking over the reins in 2027.\nWhen Sorsby initially made his decision to enter the transfer portal, there was speculation he could also explore the NFL Draft after a breakout season that put him on the radar as a potential early-round pick. Instead, he appears ready to return to college for a final year, giving him an opportunity to further refine his game and improve his draft stock.Sorsby will arrive at Texas Tech with three years of starting experience and a track record of production at the Power Four level, though team success has varied. He is 13-17 (.433) as a starter in his career, including a 1-6 mark at Indiana as a redshirt freshman in 2023. After that season, he transferred to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 campaign and went on to establish himself as one of the Big 12's more efficient passers across two seasons with the Bearcats.Sorsby does it with arm, legsDuring his time at Cincinnati, Sorsby passed for 5,613 yards and 45 touchdowns, completing 62.9% of his passes. He led the Big 12 in yards per completion (13.5) this season. He showed consistent command of the offense early in the season, including a seven-game stretch without an interception. Sorsby matched a career-low with only five picks in 12 games this season. He earned second-team All-Big 12 honors.\nSorsby also adds value as a runner, becoming more involved in the ground game as his career progressed. He finished this year at Cincinnati with a career-high 580 rushing yards on 100 carries and nine rushing touchdowns, matching his total from the previous season. While Cincinnati closed the year with four straight losses and his passing efficiency dipped late, his overall body of work made him one of the most sought-after quarterbacks in the portal.\n            ",

The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order: Raiders land No. 1 pick as Giants, Browns hurt draft position by winning in Week 18\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Penn State has its quarterback for the 2026 college football season. Rocco Becht signed with the Nittany Lions through the transfer portal, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz, and projects as their starter for his final year of eligibility. The longtime Iowa State standout will follow coach Matt Campbell to the Big Ten after Campbell took the Penn State job last month.Becht's arrival should help Penn State hit the ground running offensively in Year 1 of the Campbell era. He is a veteran, high-end passer who garnered four-star status in the transfer portal and is 247Sports' No. 8-ranked transfer quarterback for the 2026 cycle. Becht is the No. 25 player overall in the portal, which opened on Jan. 2.Over a four-year period at Iowa State, Becht re-wrote the Cyclones' record books as the most prolific freshman quarterback in school history, led the team in 2024 to its first double-digit-win season and concluded his career as a program legend. He was among the Big 12's most outstanding signal-callers throughout his time in Ames and will immediately become one of the Big Ten's most highly regarded quarterbacks upon arrival at Penn State.Aiding in Becht's transition to Penn State is the staff continuity he will enjoy with Campbell as head coach and Taylor Mouser as offensive coordinator. Mouser oversaw the Iowa State offense for the last two years and was on staff for the entirety of Becht's Cyclones career.\nBecht regressed statistically during his redshirt junior season but still passed for 2,584 yards and 16 touchdowns with nine interceptions in an 8-4 campaign. He kept the Cyclones in the Big 12 title race despite losing a pair of 1,000-yard receivers to the NFL.Among the questions facing Penn State as it undergoes a change in leadership is whether its new staff can unlock the downfield passing game and take the offense as a whole to another level. Becht should help in that process, and with the Nittany Lions facing one of the most manageable schedules in the Big Ten next season, he could also set his new program up for immediate improvement in the win column.\nBecht is already the fifth former Iowa State player to commit to Penn State. In fact, the entirety of the Nittany Lions' transfer portal recruiting class thus far consists of former Cyclones. Four-star prospects Benjamin Brahmer and Marcus Neal Jr. are at the top of the haul at the tight end and safety positions, respectively, while three-star tight end Gabe Burkle and offensive tackle Will Tompkins round out the newcomers.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Myles Garrett made NFL history, and in the process may have solidified his case as the greatest pass rusher of his era. The Cleveland Browns' perennial All-Pro broke the single-season sack record previously shared by Pittsburgh Steelers' veteran T.J. Watt and Hall of Famer Michael Strahan. History was made with 5:14 left during Cleveland's Week 18 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Garrett's record-breaking sack came against Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. \n\"I can't lie, I was nervous as hell,\" Garrett said about the pressure he felt entering the game in terms of getting the sack record. \"I had a dream last night that I didn't get it and all the feelings that come with that. I woke up, I think I was sweating. I was like, 'There's no way I'm going to let that be my destiny.' Just fighting like hell to not only rewrite history, but I feel like my own destiny.\" \nGarrett made history despite a somewhat slow start to the season. After registering four sacks in the season's first six games, Garrett tallied 18 sacks over a nine-game stretch that included five sacks of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye back in Week 8. \nAfter that tear, it appeared like a foregone conclusion that the record would belong to Garrett before the 2025 season ended. That changed, however, after the Steelers held Garrett without a sack during Week 17. The Bengals then held Garrett without a sack during the first three quarters of Sunday's game.Garrett's moment finally arrived on Cleveland's second-to-last defensive possession of the season. On the play, be beat multiple Pro Bowl offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. before pulling Burrow to the turf. Play then temporality halted before teammates put Garrett on their shoulders after the drive had concluded. \"I didn't know it was gonna be like that,\" Garrett said of his teammates' response to him breaking the record. \"I'm so happy to be with these guys. They made it a joy to show up every day at work. I've loved every second of this year, being able to work with guys and coaches like this. It's honestly been a real pleasure.\" \nThe 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, Garrett broke a record that had initially been set by Strahan in 2001 and tied by Watt in 2021. Strahan broke former New York Jets standout Mark Gastineau's 17-year-old record in 2001, and Watt tied his mark of 21.5 sacks in 2021. Single-season sack leadersPlayer, TeamSacksYearDPOY?1.Myles Garrett, Browns 232025???T-2.T.J.

Pro Football Reference has an unofficial list of the all-time single-season sack leaders that includes players who played prior to '82. On their unofficial list, Al Baker's 23 sacks during the 1978 season served as the single-season record. Baker, the 1978 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, went onto enjoy a highly-successful 13-year career that included an unofficial tally of 131 sacks. Pro Football Reference's list also includes three seasons where former Rams Hall of Famer Deacon Jones had at least 21.5 sacks. Jones, who famously coined the term \"sack,\" was credited with 173.5 sacks during his legendary career. Garrett's name now tops the list of the greatest individual season in NFL history as far as sacks are concerned. In the process, he has all but ended the argument in terms of being the best pass rusher of his era. \n            ",

Entering the weekend, four division titles were still up for grabs, along with the No. 1 seeds in the AFC and NFC. In the NFC, the No. 1 seed was decided Saturday night when the Seattle Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers in San Francisco. With the win, Seattle clinched the NFC West and a first-round bye as the conference's top seed. On Sunday, the Panthers (8-9) backed into an NFC South title thanks to the Falcons beating the Saints.In the AFC, the Broncos wrapped up the AFC's top seed and the first-round bye that comes with it. The red-hot Jaguars clinched the AFC South and the third seed.Beyond the top seeds, the AFC North will be determined on \"Sunday Night Football\" between the Ravens and Steelers. The winner of that game will claim the division and be the No. 4 seed in the conference, while the other will be eliminated from playoff contention. \nAs we close the book on the 2025 regular season and put the postseason into clearer focus, let's take a look at the current playoff picture. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff picture, bracket: Full Wild Card Weekend schedule for NFC and AFC\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAFC standingsz-Denver Broncos (14-3)z-New England Patriots (14-3)z-Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)x-Houston Texans (12-5)x-Buffalo Bills (12-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1.

    "body": "\n        The two points dropped threaten to be critical but can the immediate damage to the title race be offset by the return of one man? What about if that player's peak is Ballon d'Or level? Enzo Fernandez's late equalizer to earn Chelsea a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium feels like a major speed bump in the title race, the sort that is going to require all hands on the Manchester City deck.Thank goodness then that Pep Guardiola at least got an approximation of the best midfielder in the world, Rodri completing a full 90 minutes for the first time since September, one where at his peak he imposed his style on the contest. City find themselves with six points to make up on the Premier League leaders, needing the sort of winning run that might only come if they can boss games like they used to. For a time, they managed to do exactly that. This was a glimpse of prime Rodri, 469 days in the making since the ACL injury that so derailed City last season, another serious step forward after a promising cameo in the second half against Sunderland. There have been false dawns before, enough to mean that every late Reece James tackle should have brought palpitations across City. This felt different, though, to the player we saw in the early days of autumn.Take the driving run into midfield with eight minutes to go in the first half. Josh Acheampong didn't have the muscle to get away from Rodri, who went on and on into the penalty area, Chelsea's 10-man block just about managing to deal with the danger. They didn't soon after as the Spaniard cruised away from pressure, a sweeping pass out to the right, hitting Erling Haaland in stride, his shot crashing back off the inside of the far post.It is worth noting early on that Chelsea rather facilitated Rodri's excellence. No one seemed to pick him up when he drifted into the space around their midfield and the pressure was far from sufficient on the City center backs to stop them fizzing the ball between the lines. From there, Rodri usually had the time to turn and assess his options. If not, he was probably being fouled. Chelsea began like what they were, a team without Moises Caicedo whose head coach, Calum McFarlane, had never managed a senior match before.\nRodri instinctively knew where the gaps were in this first timers system. No one else seemed to understand how best to deal with his movement. His contribution to Tijani Reijnders' goal might have been minimal, little more than a wall for Bernardo Silva to bounce possession off before a probing through ball. It spoke  Only with the second half introduction of Andrey Santos did Chelsea really get a handle on midfield and turn this into a game where they could get a few counters going.Before then, you saw an approximation of the City of old, one who can simply hold court in the attacking third, throttling any breakout attempts by the opposition. Rodri's winning of all bar one of his duels, the same for his tackles, was critical. The one shot allowed and five penalty box touches allowed in the first 45 minutes were the sort of numbers this team had only really allowed against bottom-half opposition before today. Maybe Chelsea were just performing at that level. And maybe Rodri was making them.As for the second half, the triumph, as far as City should be concerned, was how much of it Rodri was able to play. That was all the more critical when Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias limped out with injury. For the most part, Guardiola has swerved injuries to his backline this season, Gvardiol missing three early this season. What the current quartet might lack in comparison to the best City defenses of the last decade can at least be mitigated by minutes together on the pitch. When it was Abdukodir Khusanov and Nathan Ake being flanked by Nico O'Reilly and Matheus Nunes, City suddenly looked vulnerable.\nThat they were, Malo Gusto blowing down the right, his cross evading five trailing City shirts on its way to Enzo Fernandez, who eventually stabbed home an equalizer that their hosts should never have left on the cards. Off finishing by Haaland, Phil Foden and others cost Guardiola dearly, the manager a picture of frustration at the end. City have left themselves an almighty task for the months ahead. It will take Rodri at his best to drag them forward in the race.\n            ",

Though the contact seemed minimal -- really just Pierce's left arm nudging the official as he went to argue his case for a flag -- it was indeed contact, and CBS Sports rules analyst Gene Steratore said he agreed with the decision.\nPierce caught four passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns; the 132 yards were 2 short of matching his career high, and the two touchdowns tied a career high. It was his first career game with 100 receiving yards and two touchdowns.\nWith the performance, Pierce crossed the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. He finishes the season with 47 receptions for 1,003 yards and six touchdowns, the first two marks representing career highs. He also led the NFL in yards per reception for the second straight season.\nWhether the ejection is the final act of Pierce's Colts career remains to be determined. His rookie deal expires at the end of this season, and he's set to be a free agent with several potential suitors. Still just 25, Pierce could command significant interest as a big-play threat who showed great improvement in 2025.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons are hitting the reset button once again after firing coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot.Atlanta has been stuck in a long stretch of mediocrity: Morris went 8-9 in both of his two seasons as head coach, and the team won seven games each of the three seasons before that. Those five seasons make up all of Fontenot's tenure: not bad enough to bottom out, not good enough to be taken seriously. The Falcons haven't made the postseason since 2017. They have had a different leading passer each of the top five seasons. They have been perfectly mediocre, over and over, in every sense of the word.The Falcons' four-game winning streak to finish the season -- though not enough to save Morris' or Fontenot's jobs -- showed some encouraging signs. Bijan Robinson is an absolute star. The defense has some nice young pieces, with first-round edge defenders Jalon Walker and James Pearce Jr. as well as third-round safety Xavier Watts standing out. The Falcons were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention nearly one month ago, yet they technically finished in a three-way tie for first in the NFC South at 8-9.On one hand, they're not that far away. On the other hand, they're not that close, and without a first-round pick this season, they'll have to find hits in free agency and later in the draft and count on internal improvements.\nCoach must be the most important improvement, though. Here are five who could fit the bill.1. Kevin Stefanski (Cleveland Browns head coach)The Browns are expected to move on from Stefanski, according to CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones.Stefanski is a two-time Coach of the Year. He has made the playoffs twice in six years in Cleveland, a team that hadn't made the playoffs since 2002 prior to his arrival. He has made a wide variety of quarterbacks work amid trying circumstances: Baker Mayfield, Jacoby Brissett, Joe Flacco, Jameis Winston.\nCould he add Michael Penix Jr. to the mix next? Penix has been inconsistent and injury-prone. He really remains a big question mark, something that wouldn't be the worst thing ever for a third-year quarterback if that quarterback wasn't going to be 26 and coming off a torn ACL, as Penix is.Stefanski is only 43. He has crafted strong running games and solid, well-structured passing games. His Browns defenses have consistently been very good. He will be well sought-after elsewhere, but perhaps the Falcons and their strong building blocks will be appealing.2. Chris Shula (Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator)Would Arthur Blank double-dip in the \"most recently the Rams defensive coordinator\" pool? Shula replaced Morris in Los Angeles last year and, despite the Rams being one of the NFL's lightest spenders on that side of the ball, has produced units that outperform their price tag. This year's Rams defense is fifth in success rate and has been excellent in the red zone.\nShula is 39 and has risen the ranks rapidly, helping develop several draft picks -- the type of personnel the Falcons' defense is full of -- along the way. The Sean McVay coaching tree has many strong branches, and if Blank were to try it again, it could work.3. Klint Kubiak (Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator)If Blank opts for a first-time coach with a background on the offensive side of the ball, Kubiak could fit the bill, and the Falcons are familiar with him given his time as the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator last year.The son of longtime NFL coach Gary Kubiak, Klint has a strong resume with a variety of strong offensive minds, including his own father, Stefanski, Kevin O'Connell and Kyle Shanahan. He has devised an effective, play action-heavy scheme in Seattle that has helped take Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba to another level. As an added bonus in Seattle, he has rubbed shoulders with one of the NFL's best defenses, and perhaps he could poach some assistants from that side of the ball.\n4. Mike LaFleur (Rams offensive coordinator)Yes, both the Rams' offensive and defensive coordinators should be on the radar here. Mike LaFleur -- younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur -- has worked under McVay and Shanahan and alongside Mike McDaniel. He has also worked in Atlanta before: He was an offensive assistant in 2015 and 2016 under Shanahan, when the Falcons rose to NFC champions. The connection there is a strong one.LaFleur hasn't been a play caller, but his experience under McVay is second to none, and the Rams' offense has been absolutely outstanding this season.5. Kliff Kingsbury (Washington Commanders offensive coordinator)Kingsbury declined to take interviews last year, when he would have been a hot name. The 2025 Commanders offense wasn't as effective, but it's hard to blame Kingsbury too much: Jayden Daniels played in just seven games and shared the field with Terry McLaurin for just three. The Commanders found ways to produce effective offense with Marcus Mariota, and Kingsbury's product wasn't all that bad in light of the bevy of injuries Washington suffered.\nKingsbury is a fascinating candidate. He is just 46 but has had head coaching stops in college and the NFL. He has called plays for multiple top-10 scoring offenses in the NFL, something few other candidates could say. He's undoubtedly learned plenty of lessons since his stint with the Arizona Cardinals. Would it be enough?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of name free agents and trade candidates still on the board, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Sunday's roundup just below. Yankees eyeing trade for starting pitcherThe Yankees have been quiet thus far in the offseason of 2025-26, but they have work to do and needs to address. Speaking of which, the club is looking to fortify the rotation, and at present they're looking to the trade market to do so. On that front, they've talked to the Marlins about right-hander Edward Cabrera and to the Brewers about right-hander Freddy Peralta, according to The Athletic. \nCabrera turns 28 in April and is under team control through the 2028 season. He owns a career ERA+ of 108 and is coming off his best and healthiest season to date. Peralta, 29, is entering his walk year and has rather quietly established himself as one of the top starters in baseball. He's reached or topped 200 strikeouts in each of the last three seasons, and for his career he's pitched to a 117 ERA+ and a 3.66 FIP. Last season, Peralta earned an All-Star selection and placed fifth in the NL Cy Young vote. On the Cabrera front, the Yankees may have company, as the Mets, Cubs, Astros, and Orioles also all have some level of interest, according to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. When healthy, the Yankees' rotation is a strong one, but Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt are all expected to open the 2026 season in the injured list as they recover from various elbow surgeries. \nPhillies among big-name teams in on Bichette\nShortstop Bo Bichette, who might also make sense at third or second for some teams, is among the most coveted free agents on the market. Not surprisingly, a number of high-profile teams have interest in the 27-year-old Bichette, who boasts a career OPS+ of 121 and is coming off an impressive bounce-back campaign in 2025. The Phillies, Yankees, Cubs, Dodgers, and incumbent Blue Jays are among the teams with varying levels of interest in Bichette, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bichette as the No. 3 available free agent in the current class. Red Sox favorites to retain Bregman\nVeteran infielder Alex Bregman is back on the market after an \"excellent when healthy\" 2025 season with the Red Sox. He also happens to be our second-ranked free agent of the winter. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up of Bregman from earlier in the offseason: \"Bregman, one of the last notable free agents to sign last winter, showed no ill effects of being left in the cold. He kept alive his streak of having never finished worse than 15% above the league-average hitter, and for the first time in his career, he joined the 90-90 club -- that is, a 90% in-zone contact rate and a 90 mph average exit velocity. Bregman can still pick it at third base, too. It's fair to wonder how his pull-happy slugging would play in a less favorable home offensive environment than the ones he's haunted to date, but he's a good player who ought to land a better contract than three years and $120 million this go around.\"His market, like that of many other premium free agents, has been a bit slow to develop, but things may be starting to crystallize. Speaking of which, the Red Sox have made an \"aggressive\" offer to bring Bregman back, and there's a strong chance he returns to Boston, ESPN's Buster Olney reports. The Red Sox, coming off a return to postseason play last year, have been one of the most aggressive teams of the winter and re-upping with Bregman could be the capstone on their offseason. \nWhat's next for Blue JaysSpeaking of AL East teams that have been aggressive this offseason, the Blue Jays are fresh off adding slugger Kazuma Okamaoto out of Japan on a four-year free-agent contract. Okamoto is expected to log plenty of time at third base for Toronto in the season to come, and that means they're probably out on the aforementioned Alex Bregman, the Athletic reports. However, that does not necessarily rule out the Jays when it comes to bringing back shortstop Bo Bichette, as noted above. Likewise, they may still have some level of interest in outfielder Kyle Tucker, the top free agent of this winter's class. \n            ",

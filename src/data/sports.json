Both squads are 9-3, with Michigan coming off a 27-9 loss to Ohio State, while Texas entering in off a 27-17 victory over Texas A&M. The Longhorns are 2-0 all-time versus the Wolverines, including a 31-12 road victory last season. With the firing of Sherrone Moore, interim Biff Poggi will serve as head coach for Michigan in this game before Kyle Whittingham takes over on a full-time basis.Kickoff is at 3 p.m. ET at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. The Longhorns are 5.5-point favorites in the latest Texas vs. Michigan odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 48.5, up two points from the opening line. Before making any Michigan vs. Texas picks, check out the college football predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model.

UT has lost its top three running backs to the portal, leaving the Longhorns with just one running back who found the end zone this year, and that RB scored just once.Meanwhile, the Wolverines have also trended under when playing outside the Big Ten, as the Under is 8-4 over their last dozen non-conference matchups. The last three bowls that Michigan has played in have all seen under 48.5 total points, with the three averaging 40 combined points. Given the loss of offensive firepower and the trends, the model projects 44 total points, with the Under hitting in well over 60% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Michigan vs. Texas, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Texas vs. Michigan spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Nebraska Cornhuskers and Utah Utes will meet for the first time since 1992 when they face off in the SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl 2025 on New Year's Eve. No. 15 Utah (10-2) is riding a five-game win streak and most recently knocked off Kansas, 31-21. Nebraska (7-5) is coming off back-to-back defeats and enters the 2025 Las Vegas Bowl 27-27 all-time in bowl matchups. With Kyle Whittingham off to Michigan, Morgan Scalley, who was already set to succeed the former in 2026, will serve as Utah's head coach. Quarterback Dylan Raiola (injury/portal) and running back Emmett Johnson (opt out) are among the most notable absences for Nebraska. Star offensive lineman Spencer Fano, a likely top-10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, is among the opt outs for Utah. Kickoff is at 3:30 p.m. ET at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The Utes are 14.5-point favorites in the latest Utah vs. Nebraska odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 50.5.

Nebraska was putting up 33 ppg with Raiola under center as the team is struggling to generate offense.Utah could also have difficulty moving the ball and putting points on the scoreboard with it facing college football's No. 2 passing defense. Nebraska has given up only 7 passing touchdowns across 12 games, and Utah has historically had issues with scoring in this specific bowl.

Tampa has dropped a staggering eight straight games ATS, as its 5-11 record versus the line this year is the worst in the NFL. The Bucs are just 1-6 ATS at home, while Carolina brings a 9-5 spread record as an underdog in 2025. On the field, the Panthers can take advantage of the Bucs' No. 30 redzone defense and a team that hasn't won the turnover battle in each of its last four games, which were all straight-up defeats. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Buccaneers can coverTampa has owned the recent matchups in this series, going 9-2 over their last 11 meetings. The Buccaneers also have the edge in one of the most important stats in any level of football, and that's the turnover margin. The Bucs have the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-five) in the NFL, while the Panthers are just tied for 14th with as many takeaways as giveaways. Tampa Bay also has a clear strength of running the ball as it has the No. 7 rush offense, despite missing Bucky Irving for nearly half of the season. Thus, the Buccaneers can exploit Carolina's run defense, which ranks 24th in terms of yards per rush allowed, and just three teams have given up more rushing touchdowns (24) than the Panthers. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Buccaneers vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Buccaneers 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bucs vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        A trip to the College Football Playoff semifinals will be on the line Thursday when No. 1 Indiana faces No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl. The winner will advance to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 to face either No. 5 Oregon or No. 4 Texas Tech for a spot in the national championship game.Alabama is coming off a dramatic first-round CFP win against Oklahoma. The Crimson Tide trailed by 17 points in the first half before rallying for a 34-24 victory, becoming the first team to win a road game in the 12-team CFP format.Indiana is making its second consecutive CFP appearance and will play in the quarterfinals for the first time in program history. The Hoosiers lost to Notre Dame in the first round last season but went 13-0 this year and defeated Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game to earn the Rose Bowl berth.Here is everything you need to know ahead of the Rose Bowl.Where to watch Alabama vs. Indiana liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\nAlabama vs. Indiana: Players to watch in Rose BowlTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Simpson is coming off one of his strongest performances in weeks after leading Alabama to a dramatic win over Oklahoma. He completed 19 of 29 passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide erased a 17-point first-half deficit. Simpson enters the Rose Bowl having thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns against five interceptions. For Alabama to pull the upset, the offense will need him at his best.Ryan Williams, WR, Alabama: Williams has been one of the more puzzling players in college football this season. After a standout freshman campaign, his production has been inconsistent. He has recorded two receptions or fewer in each of his past four games, including a one-catch, five-yard outing against Oklahoma. The Rose Bowl would be an ideal stage for Williams to rediscover his big-play form.Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has been one of Alabama's most reliable defenders this season. He finished with five tackles against Oklahoma in the CFP first round. On the year, Hubbard has totaled 66 tackles (40 solo), three forced fumbles and four interceptions. Alabama's defense will be under the spotlight against Indiana's potent offense.\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: Mendoza transferred from Cal this offseason and immediately elevated Indiana's offense. In 13 games, he completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Known for his accuracy, Mendoza threw for 222 yards and a touchdown against Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, a performance that effectively sealed the Heisman Trophy.Omar Cooper Jr., WR, Indiana: Indiana features multiple receivers capable of stretching the field, and Cooper has been the most productive. He leads the team with 58 receptions and 804 receiving yards and finished second with 11 touchdown catches, trailing only Elijah Sarratt.Rolijah Hardy, LB, Indiana: Indiana ranked second nationally in total yards allowed and points per game, and Hardy has been a central figure in that success. He leads the Hoosiers with 87 tackles and eight sacks and has added four pass breakups this season.\nAlabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nLast year, the Rose Bowl produced one of the biggest shockers of the entire football season. No. 1 seed Oregon was stunned by Ohio State after finishing the regular season with a perfect record. Not saying that will happen, but I expect this game to be competitive. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has proven he can lead his respective teams to wins over ranked opponents. Indiana wins, but this will be a one-score game throughout. Pick: Alabama +6.5 (-102) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final day of 2025 has arrived. We'll be into 2026 in short order and then, before you know it, spring training camps will open and baseball will be back. There are still a lot of free agents to sign and trades to be made between now and then. Here are Wednesday's hot stove rumors. Giants nearing deal with Mahle\nThe Giants and free-agent right-hander Tyler Mahle are nearing a one-year contract, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Financial terms are unknown. We did not rank Mahle, 31, among our top 50 free agents, though he has long been a stathead favorite thanks to the deep arsenal and swing-and-miss rates. Injuries have sabotaged his last few years, however.Mahle will join Logan Webb, Robbie Ray, and Adrian Houser in San Francisco's rotation. Landen Roupp, Kai-Wei Teng, Blade Tidwell, and Carson Whisenhunt are among the depth options, though the Giants could pursue another veteran starter. A reunion with Justin Verlander would make sense given his strong finish to the 2025 season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     A's interested in more extensions After locking up Tyler Soderstrom long-term, the Athletics have interest in signing more of their core players to contract extensions, reports The Athletic. First baseman Nick Kurtz and shortstop Jacob Wilson finished 1-2 in the AL Rookie of the Year voting this past season and are obvious extension candidates. Catcher Shea Langeliers as well. \nKurtz and Wilson are both five years away from free agency. Here are the largest extensions given to position players at their service time level: Jackson Merrill, Padres: 9 years, $135 millionKe'Bryan Hayes, Pirates: 8 years, $70 millionLawrence Butler, Athletics: 7 years, $65.5 millionEzequiel Tovar, Rockies: 7 years, $63.5 millionAndrelton Simmons, Braves: 7 years, $58 millionKurtz certainly has a case to beat Merrill's deal given his monstrous rookie season. Langeliers is three years away from free agency and could be the Athletics' top extension priority just because he's closer to hitting the market than Kurtz and Wilson. With or without the extensions, the A's have a very strong position player core. Improving the pitching is the next order of business.  \tAngels sign Yates \nThe Angels are signing veteran righty Kirby Yates to a one-year contract worth $5 million, according to the New York Post. Yates, 38, struggled with the Dodgers this past season and was left off their postseason roster because of back and hamstring trouble. He is a year removed from a dynamite 2024 season with the Rangers, however. Yates went 33 for 34 in save chances with a 1.17 ERA that year and finished eighth in the AL Cy Young voting. For an Angels team with a less than imposing bullpen, gambling $5 million on Yates isn't the worst idea. He joins Drew Pomeranz and Jordan Romano as the team's offseason relief additions. \n \tWhite Sox sign Kelenic \nThe White Sox are bringing outfielder Jarred Kelenic to spring training on a minor league contract, reports ESPN. Once one of the top prospects in the game, Kelenic has failed to launch at the MLB level. The 26 year old is a career .211/.282/.376 hitter in parts of five big-league seasons with the Mariners and Braves. Kelenic slashed .213/.286/.309 with Atlanta's Triple-A affiliate in 2025. The ChiSox are not blessed with much outfield depth and Luis Robert Jr. is likely to get traded at some point. Kelenic isn't a terrible roll of the dice for a team still in the fairly early stages of a rebuild. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Lakers suffered their fourth loss in five games, as the Detroit Pistons spoiled LeBron James' 41st birthday with a 128-106 win in L.A. Detroit blew the game open in the fourth quarter, running away in the final 12 minutes to improve to 25-8 on the season. They did so by hounding the Lakers on defense, forcing 20 turnovers that turned into 30 Pistons points, and dominated at the rim, outscoring L.A. 74-44 in the paint. Vibes for the Lakers are reaching a low point amid this recent swoon, and those frustrations only built late in the loss to Detroit. Coach JJ Redick pointed to the Lakers allowing the officiating to get to them, noting the team knew coming in the Pistons would commit a lot of fouls that would go uncalled but still let that bother them.\"I think there's probably a level of frustration when you're turning the ball over and you're feeling like you're getting fouled,\" Redick said, via ESPN. . \"There's frustration there, for sure. But I mean, again, I said it even here, we said it this morning: They're going to foul every possession. It's just, you got to play through it.\"Luka Dončić committed eight of the Lakers' turnovers and was visibly frustrated by the officiating during the game -- although, it should be noted that's seemingly the case every night. Afterwards, he said the Lakers need to learn how to match physicality when it becomes clear the officials will let more go in a given game. \n\"We've got to definitely match their physicality,\" Doncic said. \"That's the whole point. We got to match how they play. You saw the refs let it go, so we should play [with] physicality, for sure.\"The best defensive teams in the league tend to get away with more physicality. However, it's not because of officiating bias for that team -- you'd have a hard time arguing the NBA would rather a team from Detroit or OKC beat the Lakers --  but because being more physical with opponents doesn't look like a foul when you're constantly in the proper position. Fouls are far more likely to be obvious (and thus seen more often by refs) when you're reaching and out of position. Young, athletic teams that can consistently be in a legal guarding position get away with more contact because it's less obvious at game speed. That's the formula for the Pistons, Thunder, Spurs and others, and part of the problem for a team like the Lakers is that they can't match the physicality of those teams as Dončić wants and get away with it because they don't have the personnel to execute at that level defensively. \nThus, you get a frustrated Redick, who noted pregame that the Pistons will foul \"three or four times\" per possession, but insisted he wasn't saying it in a negative way. That's because he probably wishes he could have the Lakers deploy that kind of game plan, but the roster won't allow it. As such, he's left to complain about the officiating and the lack of calls, but every time the Lakers face one of those young, athletic, defensive-minded teams, they're likely going to run into the same problems. \n            ",

The marquee matchup marks the first time the two blue blood brands have faced off since the 2003 BCS National Championship. New Year's Day begins with (5) Oregon facing (4) Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. Later in the day, (1) Indiana will face (9) Alabama with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Crimson Tide became the first team in the expanded playoff format to win a game on the road when they knocked off (8) Oklahoma.The final quarterfinal matchup will feature (6) Ole Miss take on (3) Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs defeated the Rebels 43-35 earlier this season in Athens, which marked Ole Miss' first loss of the 2025 campaignAs the College Football Playoff continues, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate all the quarterfinal games through New Year's Day.All times Eastern\nCollege Football Playoff quarterfinal TV scheduleCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami vs. (2) Ohio State -- Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Miami won its first CFP game in program history in a low-scoring battle against Texas A&M on the road. The Hurricanes' reward? A date with reigning national champion Ohio State on New Year's Eve. The Buckeyes are fresh off their first loss of the season to Indiana in the Big Ten title game. Ohio State star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who happens to be from South Florida, will face a team and place he is familiar with. Smith has already talked about the 2003 Fiesta Bowl between Miami and Ohio State in the days leading up to the game.Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (4) Texas Tech -- Thursday at noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Oregon has a chance at CFP quarterfinal redemption after getting blown out against Ohio State last season in the Rose Bowl as the No. 1 overall seed. The Ducks are coming off a win over James Madison in the first round and will face a stout Texas Tech defense with a spot in the semifinals on the line. The Red Raiders are making their first appearance in the CFP after winning the Big 12 title.Rose Bowl -- (9) Alabama vs. (1) Indiana -- Wednesday at 4 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Out of all the quarterfinal games on deck, this game has the chance to be the best one. Alabama is coming off a dramatic comeback win over Oklahoma in the first round, while Indiana is riding high on its best season in program history after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. Indiana is led by Heisman Trophy winner and potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, Fernando Mendoza. One of the questions to ponder: Will Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams be involved? He finished with just one catch for five yards against OU.\nSugar Bowl -- (6) OIe Miss vs. (3) Georgia -- Thursday at 8 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The last time Ole Miss played Georgia, Lane Kiffin was still on the sidelines. That obviously is no longer the case, as Kiffin accepted the job at LSU before the Rebels played in the CFP. Ole Miss defeated Tulane in the first round -- which also happened to be another rematch from the regular season -- for its first CFP win in program history. As for Georgia, quarterback Gunner Stockton made his first career start in last season's Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the marquee clashes of the College Football Playoff quarterfinal round takes center stage as No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Miami will square off on Wednesday. Miami arrives to the Cotton Bowl on the heels of a 10-3 victory over Texas A&M in the first round of the CFP, while Ohio State enjoyed a first-round bye. Ohio State makes its way to the Cotton Bowl for the second straight season. The Buckeyes bested Texas in this game last season thanks to a historic scoop-and-score by Jack Sawyer en route to a national title game appearance. However, Ohio State is also coming off its first loss of the season in the Big Ten Championship Game. These two teams have played five times in history with the Buckeyes holding a 3-2 advantage all time. In the most historic iteration of this game, Ohio State stunned Miami in the 2003 BCS National Championship Game following a controversial officiating decision.   Ohio State vs. Miami: Need to know for Cotton BowlBattle in the trenches: Miami and Ohio State both boast some of the best trench play in college football, especially on the defensive side. Miami's Rueben Bain Jr. was a unanimous All-American, while Ohio State defensive tackle Kayden McDonald earned it for the Buckeyes. However, Miami's offensive line is slightly more well regarded than Ohio State's, led by tackle Francis Mauigoa. The winner of this matchup will take pole position for winning the game. Past vs. Future: Miami quarterback Carson Beck was once viewed as a future first-round pick in the NFL Draft. After an inconsistent end to his career, Ohio State freshman Julian Sayin has stolen the spotlight. Sayin threw for 3,323 yards and 31 touchdowns for the Buckeyes while posting the second-best QBR in America. Beck cleared 300 yards only twice in 2025, but his experience will be on full display in Arlington. \nSecondary play: Miami defensive back Keionte Scott's return was much needed in the Hurricanes' upset victory against Texas A&M as Scott had multiple tackles for loss and a strip-sack in the win. However, Ohio State safety Caleb Downs has a case as the best player in the sport thanks to his otherworldly playmaking ability. Both defenses are capable of forcing mistakes, but the secondary that makes more plays will win the day. Where to watch Ohio State vs. Miami liveDate: Wednesday, Dec. 31 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ohio State vs. Miami prediction, picks\nThe Hurricanes have talent all over the field and may even hold a slight advantage in the trenches, but Ohio State is simply stacked. The firepower of the Buckeyes offense has barely been put on full display yet as Ohio State cruised through most of its 2025 schedule. While Miami could cause some complications with its pass rush, the Buckeyes will make enough plays to put this game away. Pick: Ohio State -9.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        Arguably the most intriguing and evenly matched quarterfinal in this year's College Football Playoff takes place at the Orange Bowl, where No. 5 Oregon (12-1) faces No. 4 Texas Tech (12-1) in a showdown that promises to be physical, fast and explosive. Both teams enter with momentum and elite credentials, combining for a 24-2 record at this point in the season.The Ducks had an opportunity to assert themselves as national contenders with their dominant 51-34 win over James Madison in the CFP's opening round, showing off a high-octane offense led by quarterback Dante Moore. Texas Tech, meanwhile, has not played in nearly four weeks but comes in riding the confidence of a program-record 12-win season capped by the Red Raiders' first Big 12 Championship and outright conference title since 1955.On paper, the matchup is a battle of elite offenses and stout defenses. All four units rank in the top 10 nationally in scoring, with Oregon (16.0%) and Texas Tech (13.9%) leading the CFP field in explosive-play rates, while both defenses have stifled opponents in limiting big gains -- Oregon (7.6%) and Texas Tech (7.5%).For Texas Tech, it's the biggest stage in program history; for Oregon, a chance to return to the national semifinal for the first time since the inaugural four-team CFP in 2014.\nWhere to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oregon vs. Texas Tech: Players to watchDante Moore, QB, Oregon: Moore has blossomed into one of the nation's premier quarterbacks and could be a top-five pick in the 2026 NFL Draft if he opts to forgo his final year of eligibility. The Ducks' signal-caller ranks third nationally in completion percentage (72.4%), fifth in passer rating (170.08), eighth in passing touchdowns (28), and 10th in yards per attempt (9.0), showcasing both precision and explosiveness.Jordon Davison, RB, Oregon: While the Ducks feature a three-headed backfield attack led by Noah Whittington, Davison has been a scoring machine. The true freshman has rushed for 625 yards on 98 carries and shares touches with Whittington and Dierre Hill Jr., yet his 13 rushing touchdowns tie him for 15th nationally.\nBryce Boettcher, LB, Oregon: The heartbeat of Oregon's defense, Boettcher leads the team with 113 tackles, including 43 solo stops. His sideline-to-sideline range and playmaking instincts anchor a defense that has been critical to getting the Ducks to this point.Cameron Dickey, RB, Texas Tech: Texas Tech's balanced, explosive offense has multiple weapons, but Dickey has emerged as the backbone of the rushing attack. The sophomore leads the Big 12 with 14 rushing touchdowns and is one of only three backs in the conference to eclipse 1,000 yards on the ground this season.Jacob Rodriguez, LB, Texas Tech: Widely regarded as one of the best defensive players in the country, Rodriguez has earned multiple individual awards. Quarterbacks must account for him on every play; he's totaled 117 tackles, four interceptions, and seven forced fumbles this season.\nDavid Bailey, LB, Texas Tech: Complementing Rodriguez's disruption, Bailey has terrorized opposing offenses with 13.5 sacks -- second-most in FBS -- making him a constant backfield threat.Oregon vs. Texas Tech prediction, pick\nThis Orange Bowl matchup represents the biggest test of the season for Texas Tech. Despite a dominant run to the Big 12 Championship and a first-round bye, the Red Raiders still haven't earned the national respect their record demands. But Oregon isn't a team to underestimate -- Dan Lanning has a proven track record of keeping his Ducks ready regardless of the stage. Texas Tech thrives on creating chaos, leading the nation with 31 forced turnovers this season. While turnovers can swing a game in unexpected ways, the Red Raiders' ability to make big plays consistently keeps them in striking distance. Meanwhile, Oregon faces the challenge of adjusting to an early kickoff on the East Coast, which leaves the Ducks operating on what amounts to a 9 a.m. body clock. Prediction: Texas Tech +2.5\n            ",

No. 1 Indiana, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Texas Tech all received an additional week of preparation time by way of their first-round byes and will hope to quickly shake off any rust that may have accumulated during that downtime.No. 2 Miami, fresh off a defensive masterclass in which it held No. 7 Texas A&M to three points, kicks off the quarterfinals on Dec. 31 when it meets Ohio State in a rematch of the 2003 BCS National Championship Game. As the playoff shifts from on-campus games to bowl sites for the next two rounds, the Hurricanes and Buckeyes will square off in the Cotton Bowl.Action continues on Jan. 1 when No. 5 Oregon meets the Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl.

    "body": "\n        With just over one month until the start of the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, Hockey Canada announced the roster it will bring to Italy in pursuit of a gold medal. The Canadians faced some tough decisions, but they settled on a team that is set to the be the gold medal favorite.Canada had already announced six players -- Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Sidney Crosby, Brayden Point, Sam Reinhart and Cale Makar -- which left 19 spots up for grabs. Budding stars Macklin Celebrini and Connor Bedard made an impressive push for the right Olympic roster spots, although the latter is dealing with a shoulder injury. Celebrini got the nod and Bedard will be staying at home.Another youngster who built an impressive case in his first 39 NHL games was New York Islanders rookie defenseman Matthew Schaefer. The 18-year-old has been stupendous in his young NHL career, but he just missed out on joining Team Canada.The real question for Canada was what it would do in goal. Jordan Binnington, who started and won the 4 Nations Face-Off final less than a year ago, is off to a miserable start in 2025-26. Meanwhile, players like Logan Thompson and Darcy Kuemper played their way into Olympic consideration.\nHere is the full roster Team Canada will take to the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics:*denotes player was previously announcedForwardsMacklin Celebrini, SharksAnthony Cirelli, LightningSidney Crosby, Penguins*Bo Horvat, IslandersNathan MacKinnon, Avalanche*Brad Marchand, PanthersMitch Marner, Golden KnightsConnor McDavid, Oilers*Brayden Point, Lightning*Sam Reinhart, Panthers*Mark Stone, Golden KnightsNick Suzuki, CanadiensTom Wilson, CapitalsDefensemenDrew Doughty, KingsThomas Harley, StarsCale Makar, Avalanche*Josh Morrissey, JetsColton Parayko, BluesTravis Sanheim, FlyersShea Theodore, Golden KnightsDevon Toews, AvalancheGoaliesJordan Binnington, BluesDarcy Kuemper, KingsLogan Thompson, CapitalsBedard, Schaefer among snubsConnor Bedard and Matthew Schaefer are among the best young players in the league right now, and they're both in the midst of exceptional seasons. Bedard's shoulder injury may have had some impact on this decision by Canada, but by leaving him in North America, the Canadians will leave behind a ton of offensive upside. Bedard is on an 82-game pace for 50 goals and 116 points. His game has hit another level in 2025-26, but it wasn't enough for him to punch his ticket to Italy.When it comes to Schaefer, Hockey Canada was probably always going to be hesitant about throwing an 18-year-old into the Olympic fire. Having said that, Schaefer hasn't really been playing his age. The Calder Trophy favorite, Schaefer has more than held his own against the best in the world at five-on-five, and I think he may have been a better choice over Harley or Sanheim.\nBinnington makes the cutWhile Binnington did lead Canada to gold in the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year, he's done everything he can to play his way off the Olympic roster in 2025-26. His 15.5 goals allowed above average are last among 85 goaltenders, per Natural Stat Trick. His .747 high-danger save percentage is also among the worst in the league. Canada must have a lot of faith he can turn it around by the time the team plane lands in Italy.That's especially the case because there were more intriguing options, like either of the Colorado Avalanche goalies. Scott Wedgewood has been a revelation this season, and Mackenzie Blackwood has quietly put together an impressive resume over the last two or three years. If the decision was based strictly off NHL performance, either one of those goalies would have gone over Binnington, but the 4 Nations Face-Off clearly made a big impact.Canada running it back on defenseThe Canadians are rolling with the same defensive group that helped them win the 4 Nations. On the one hand, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Then again, there may have been some possible upgrades out there for Team Canada.\nSanheim brings stability and reliability, but he provides little in the way of offensive upside. Harley, despite a breakout 2024-25 season, has been woefully ineffective this season. That's why I'm a little surprised that the Canadians didn't take one of Evan Bouchard or Jakob Chychrun. The former may have some defensive lapses, but he is an offensive wizard. The latter is currently building a Norris Trophy candidacy with 30 points and spectacular underlying numbers. Even the rookie Schaefer could have provided a stronger two-way game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It'll be two of college football's most prominent blue bloods squaring off Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl as No. 13 Texas and No. 18 Michigan tangle in search of their 10th victories. It will be just the third all-time meeting between the storied programs, and the Wolverines will be seeking their first-ever win over the Longhorns.The meeting will bring an end to a bizarre December for the Wolverines, who are in the midst of a coaching transition that has rocked the program. Sherrone Moore was fired with cause on Dec. 10 as a result of an alleged inappropriate relationship with a staff member. His subsequent arrest shocked the college football world and left Michigan with a strangely timed coaching search.Former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham has been hired to clean up the mess, but it will be interim coach Biff Poggi leading the Wolverines in the bowl game. Poggi will have his hands full against a Texas team that will look to carry the momentum of a season-ending rivalry win over Texas A&M into bowl season.While there are plenty of opt-outs on both sides that will alter the flavor of this game, both starting quarterbacks are expected to play. A matchup of Texas' Arch Manning and Michigan's Bryce Underwood will make for one of the most captivating QB battles of bowl season.\nFollow along with live updates and analysis as Texas vs. Michigan headlines the 2025 Citrus Bowl.Where to watch Texas vs. Michigan liveDate: Wednesday, Dec. 31 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Camping World Stadium -- Orlando, FloridaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Texas vs. Michigan: Need to know for Citrus BowlNotable opt-outs: Michigan will be a bit lean on the edge defensively with its top sacks leaders Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham opting out. Moore and Barham were each honorable mention All-Big Ten selections. Likewise, Texas will be without several of its top defenders, including star linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. and safety Michael Taaffe. New Longhorns defensive coordinator Will Muschamp will get a long look at some of Texas' defensive depth as he begins charting the course for next year's unit.\nQuarterback showdown: Arch Manning and Bryce Underwood weren't just the top-ranked quarterbacks in their respective recruiting classes; they were the No. 1 overall players, regardless of position. Manning topped the charts from the Class of 2023 and is wrapping up his redshirt sophomore season on a performance upswing following a rocky beginning to his first year as the starter. Unlike Manning, Underwood started from Day 1 at Michigan. The celebrated prospect has completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,229 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions and another five rushing scores. It's been a solid if not spectacular true freshman campaign for the Michigan native.Whittingham's role: Don't expect to see new Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham involving himself in the Wolverines' Citrus Bowl operation. Asked what his role will be on game day, Whittingham said: \"I'm going to try to stay out of the way. I'm excited to be around, observe, but I'm going to stay in the background.\"  Texas vs. Michigan prediction, picks  \nTexas is grappling with a significant number of defensive opt-outs, but Michigan's subdued offensive attack is not well-equipped to capitalize. On the flip side, the Wolverines are without their best pass rushers, which should free up Arch Manning to cook as he seeks to build on the momentum of a strong close to his redshirt sophomore season. It would also be smart to consider the potential psychological impact of Michigan's unceremonious coaching change, which has rocked the Michigan program this month. Texas is more of a steady operation at the moment, and that should be evident on the field. Pick: Texas -7.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n

    "body": "\n        Zack Baun signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal worth a maximum of $4.5 million through incentives with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024 free agency after spending the first four years of his NFL career as a reserve edge-rushing outside linebacker and special-teams standout on the New Orleans Saints. He was one of the NFL's biggest surprises last season, making a smooth transition to inside linebacker.In addition to tying for sixth in the NFL with 151 tackles, Baun excelled in coverage. His five forced fumbles were the NFL's second-most. He is the only player to ever have at least 150 tackles and five or more forced fumbles in an NFL season.Baun was named to the Pro Bowl and earned first-team All-Pro honors, both for the first time in his career. He was also a finalist for the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award.Baun was a signing priority after the Eagles won Super Bowl LIX. The Eagles, who have historically let off-ball linebackers walk in free agency, retained Baun by giving him a three-year, $51 million deal with $34 million fully guaranteed. At $17 million per year, Baun became the NFL's fourth-highest-paid off-ball linebacker.\nAs Baun can attest, fortunes can be made because of a player's performance in a contract year. With one more game left in the NFL regular season, here are seven players who have made good use of their contract year. A key contract benchmark from 2025 and the probability of hitting this financial target -- ranging from one dollar sign to four dollar signs -- are listed for each player.\nFinancial benchmark: DK Metcalf -- four years, $32,999,882 per year, $80 million guaranteedProbability: $$$George Pickens had worn out his welcome with the Pittsburgh Steelers because of his attitude and immaturity despite his immense talent. The Steelers trading the equivalent of a second-round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for wide receiver DK Metcalf in March -- and giving him a four-year contract extension averaging nearly $33 million per year in the process -- spoke volumes about Pittsburgh's frustrations with Pickens.The calculated risk the Dallas Cowboys took by trading a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick to the Steelers for Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick in May has paid big dividends.\nPickens has performed at an All-Pro level this season. He has 92 receptions, 1,420 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns, all career highs, while averaging 15.4 yards per catch. The 2022 second-round pick is the only player who ranks in the NFL's top 10 in each of these categories this season. CeeDee Lamb and Pickens arguably have become the NFL's best receiving tandem.The criticism Pickens received for his lack of effort in a Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions and his reaction to Richard Sherman's comments were a prime example of why the Steelers were reluctant to give him a new deal. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones doesn't have the same reservations. Having two high-priced wide receivers isn't an issue for Jones.Absent a new deal before early March, Pickens will be designated as a franchise player. The deadline for teams to use a franchise or transition tag is March 3 at 4 p.m. ET.\nThe 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for wide receivers projects to 9.016% of the 2026 salary cap. (It was 8.581% in 2025.) If the 2026 salary cap is set at $300 million, a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million salary cap, the wide receiver figure should be $27.047 million.Being patient could work in Pickens' favor. His best deal could come from letting Nico Collins and Puka Nacua, who will be in contract years in 2026, further define the wide receiver market, provided their respective deals with the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Rams are done before the July 15 deadline for franchise players to sign long-term.\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: George Pickens' breakout season with Cowboys puts Jerry Jones on the clock for another mega deal\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFinancial benchmark: Sam Darnold -- three years, $33.5 million per year, $55 million guaranteed, worth up to $115.5 million with incentivesProbability: $$Daniel Jones, who signed a one-year, $14 million deal worth up to $17.7 million in free agency, was having a surprising career resurgence before tearing his right Achilles during a Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was an early-season MVP candidate when the Colts were averaging a league-leading 33.8 points per game and had the league's best record at 7-1.\nThe Colts went all in on the 2025 season by acquiring All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell at the Nov. 4 midseason trade deadline. The trade was viewed as an endorsement of Jones as the solution to the quarterback instability that has plagued the Colts since Andrew Luck abruptly retired shortly before the start of the 2019 regular season.Jones' play began tailing off after the trade, partially because a fracture in his left fibula robbed him of his mobility, which is important to his success. It became a catalyst for a stunning collapse in which the Colts are going to miss the playoffs, most likely with an 8-9 record.The lack of first-round picks makes it harder for the Colts to go in another direction at quarterback in the NFL Draft. A non-exclusive franchise tag, which should be in the $43 million to $44 million range with the 2026 salary cap set in the $300 million range, would have been a realistic possibility without the Achilles tear.\nThere may not have been much appetite for going the draft route again after using a top-five pick on Anthony Richardson in 2023, especially since the 2026 quarterback draft class is mediocre at best. Despite the injury, Jones is the best quarterback available in a lackluster group of free agents. General manager Chris Ballard and/or head coach Shane Steichen losing their jobs could change the calculus.The average salary for 2025 starting quarterbacks, which includes those on rookie contracts strictly determined by draft position under the rookie wage scale, is $30,153,958 per year, according to NFLPA data. The figure rises to $44,067,508 per year when starting quarterbacks on rookie contracts are removed from the equation.It remains to be seen when Jones will recover. Jones being ready for the start of the 2026 regular season isn't out of the question.\n\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: What's next for the Colts and Daniel Jones after his Achilles injury?\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFinancial benchmark: Trey McBride -- four years, $19 million per year, $43 million guaranteedProbability: $Kyle Pitts was thought to be the future of the tight end position after a Pro Bowl rookie season in 2021 with 68 receptions and 1,026 receiving yards. He hadn't come close to that type of production again until this season. Pitts has a career-high 82 receptions for 870 yards and five touchdowns. He ranks second among NFL tight ends this season in receptions and receiving yards.The most recent potentially relevant data point in the tight end marketplace is the three-year, $39.267 million contract extension averaging $13.089 million per year that 30-year-old Mark Andrews received from the Baltimore Ravens at the beginning of December. There's a five-year age gap between the two. The 25-year-old Pitts has been far more productive than Andrews, who has 46 catches for 408 yards and five touchdowns in 16 games this season.There has been some speculation that Pitts may have played his way into a franchise tag. That seemed unimaginable during the offseason, when the Falcons were reportedly open to trading Pitts but weren't aggressively shopping him.\nThe 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for tight ends is expected to be 5.01% of the 2026 salary cap. (It was 4.952% this year.) With a $300 million 2026 salary cap, the tight end number should be $15.031 million.\nFinancial benchmark: Zack Baun -- three years, $17 million per year, $34 million guaranteedProbability: $$Devin Lloyd seemed intent on proving the Jaguars made a mistake by declining his $14.751 million fifth-year option for 2026. He was named AFC Defensive Player of the Month for September. Lloyd's momentum was briefly slowed by a Week 6 calf injury, but he hasn't missed a beat since returning to action after a two-game absence. His five interceptions are tied for the second-most in the NFL this season.The biggest payday ever for an off-ball linebacker in free agency belongs to Tremaine Edmunds. He received a four-year, $72 million contract averaging $18 million per year, with $50 million in guarantees, including $41.8 million fully guaranteed at signing, from the Bears in 2023. Baun couldn't eclipse Edmunds' $18 million per year despite being an NFL Defensive Player of the Year finalist last season.\nFinancial benchmark: Kyren Williams -- three years, $11 million per year, $23 million guaranteedProbability: $$$Breece Hall wasn't a contract extension candidate during the offseason because of first-year Jets head coach Aaron Glenn's plan to go with a running back-by-committee approach, which was derailed by Braelon Allen's season-ending knee injury. The 2022 second-round pick has a career-best 1,065 rushing yards this season. It's the first time a Jets running back has hit the 1,000-yard mark since Chris Ivory in 2015.Hall will likely be looking to get into the same salary stratosphere as James Cook and Kyren Williams, fellow running backs from the 2022 draft, with a new contract. Williams signed a three-year, $33 million extension with the Rams during the preseason. Cook's four-year, $46 million extension, worth up to $48 million with salary escalators, from the Buffalo Bills came several days after Williams' deal.The Jets are reportedly interested in retaining Hall. Preventing Hall from hitting the open market with a franchise tag won't be an issue financially. The Jets are expected to have more than $100 million in 2026 salary cap space.\nThe 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for running backs projects to 4.723% of the 2026 salary cap. It's 4.886% in 2025. If the 2026 salary cap is set at $300 million, the running back figure should be $14.171 million. Only three running backs — Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey and Derrick Henry — have contracts averaging more than the projected tag amount.\nFinancial benchmark: Josh Sweat -- four years, $19.1 million per year, $41 million guaranteedProbability: $$$Jaelan Phillips has bounced back from two straight injury-plagued seasons. He played eight games in 2023 before a right Achilles tear ended his season. The 2021 first-round pick tore his right ACL four games into the 2024 season.The Eagles acquired Phillips from the Miami Dolphins for a 2026 third-round pick ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to help fill a void created by losing edge rusher Josh Sweat to the Arizona Cardinals in free agency. The trade reunited Phillips with Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who served as Phillips' defensive coordinator with the Dolphins in 2023.Phillips has thrived under Fangio. His 41 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hurries and quarterback hits) are tied for the league's fourth-most with Myles Garrett, who is expected to win the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award, since Week 10, according to Pro Football Focus.The Eagles becoming one of the NFL's best defenses has coincided with Phillips' arrival in Week 10, as they have allowed a league-low 14.5 points per game with him in the lineup. Philadelphia had 17 sacks in eight games prior to trading for Phillips. In eight games with Phillips, the Eagles have 25 sacks.Phillips is going to accomplish a rare feat this season that should mitigate any concerns about his durability. Because of the timing of the bye weeks, Phillips is going to play 18 regular-season games.Sweat landed the top contract in 2025 free agency for an edge rusher. He signed a four-year, $76.4 million deal with $41 million in guarantees, including $38 million fully guaranteed at signing. It will be interesting to see whether this year's edge rusher market explosion positively impacts the pass rushers available in 2026.\nFinancial benchmark: Kristian Fulton -- two years, $10 million per year, $15 million guaranteedProbability: $$The Bears had no idea Nahshon Wright would play such a prominent role on their defense when he was quickly signed to a one-year contract at his $1.1 million league-minimum salary after the Minnesota Vikings released him in April from the same contract. He spent the 2024 season on Minnesota's practice squad after being acquired during that preseason from the Cowboys for cornerback Andrew Booth Jr.Wright has taken advantage of multiple injuries at cornerback to have a breakout season. Wright, who was named NFC Defensive Player of the Month for November, is tied for second in the NFL with five interceptions. He also has two forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. Wright's eight takeaways are the most in the NFL.Wright would like to remain in Chicago. The Bears already have significant financial commitments at cornerback, though. Jaylon Johnson is in the second year of the four-year, $76 million deal averaging $19 million per year he signed in 2024. Kyler Gordon signed a three-year, $40 million extension averaging $13,333,333 per year in April.On the open market, Wright will need other teams to view this season as a sign of things to come rather than an outlier. Prior to this season, the 2021 third-round pick had primarily been a special teams player who had been on the field for only 269 defensive snaps throughout his NFL career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end-of-year clock is already ticking on the NWSL offseason full of massive questions. Next season is poised to be a landmark year with expansion to 16 teams and a schedule that will break through the spectacle of the men's 2026 FIFA World Cup at home. It's far too early in the NWSL offseason for concrete predictions, though that doesn't stop us from trying, but what can fans expect from clubs in the build-up to the new year? The 2026 schedule kicks off on Feb. 20 with the NWSL Challenge Cup between the 2025 NWSL Championship winners, Gotham FC, and the 2025 NWSL Shield title holders, Kansas City Current. The NWSL regular season begins on March 13, and this time, 16 teams will battle for playoff position and a shot at the 2026 NWSL Championship on Nov. 21. There are just two months till the NWSL Challenge Cup, and in the meantime, clubs are shaping their rosters ahead of the new year.Here's what to watch for in 2026 for each club:Angel CityThe club said farewell to two foundational players, Christen Press and Ali Riley, after their retirements. Now it'll be about how this team manages a new era and with whom. The club that always leads the way off the pitch, valuations, and brand recognition will need to make that next big signing. In the meantime, forward Riley Tiernan had a breakout rookie season and will now need to manage the pressures and expectations of a sophomore season while striker Claire Emslie works her way back from maternity leave.\nBay FC It was a challenging 2025 for Bay FC that started with an investigation into former head coach Albertin Montoya and ended with subpar performances on the pitch. He was later cleared in an independent investigation that found he did not violate the league's anti-harassment, discrimination, and bullying policy. He was dismissed midseason and left the club at the end of the year. The club hired new head coach Emma Coats, with Gemma Davies joining as assistant coach. Coates joins Bay FC from England, where she was U23 manager, and could help the two-year-old expansion side build a team identity.Boston Legacy There will be plenty of attention on the new expansion club, Boston Legacy, as women's pro soccer returns to the New England area for the first time in nearly a decade. New head coach Filipa Patao is a renowned coach who was up for coach of the year at the Ballon d'Or awards after she led Benfica to several domestic league titles and a UEFA Champions League appearance.\nBoston recently added goalkeeper and 2024 Olympic gold medalist Casey Murphy to the roster and will play their games at Gillette Stadium for their inaugural season while their permanent home, White Stadium, continues renovations. Chicago Stars FCThe group settled for a last-place finish, and in the new year, they'll have a new head coach, Martin Sjogren, and assistant coach Anders Jacobson. There's only up from rock bottom, and the club will still have to manage its roster as forward Mallory Swanson works her way back from maternity leave. They might have a goalkeeper battle on their hands with the re-signing of longtime captain Alyssa Naeher and new acquisition Katie Lind.Denver Summit FCAnother expansion side that will have plenty of eyes upon them as they step into their inaugural season. They hired Nick Cushing as head coach, and the club was part of rumors around landing Colorado natives, but struck out on forward Sophia Wilson. They'll play their home opener at the NFL's Empower Field at Mile High on March 26, and they plan to use a temporary stadium in Centennial for their first two season while building their permanent facility.\nGotham FC The reigning 2025 NWSL Champions will be on title defense as they prepare to run it back. Winners often have a target on their backs and 2026 will be no different. Still, having familiar faces will help, with much of their roster still intact. The club also announced that forward Midge Purce re-signed on a one-year deal. Houston DashThe Texas side managed to make things interesting in the second half of the season, but it was just a little too late for their efforts to break through into the playoffs. The new year will be all about expanding on that momentum while the organization manages a potential ownership sale. Head coach Fabrice Gautrat has a year of experience with his squad to build into 2026, and if the group can figure out how to manage a full season, they'll be a tough side to compete with.Kansas City Current After a record-setting year that crowned Kansas City Current as the greatest club in single-season history, the 2025 NWSL Shield winners will look different in 2026. The roster will welcome the return of MVP Temwa Chawinga from an adductor injury, and there was already a front office shake-up. \nFormer head coach Vlatko Andonovski will operate solely in a sporting director role, and new general manager Ryan Dell has his work cut out for him to ensure the Current remain an elite side and hire a worthy next head coach.North Carolina Courage A club that seems to be falling further from grace after more player departures in the offseason, especially following the midseason trade of Jaedyn Shaw. The organization is quietly in a growth period after a potential sale to former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry fell through in late 2024. North Carolina are still in search of a head coach after terminating Sean Nahas, and they did make an attacking signing with Nigerian international forward Chioma Okafor Orlando Pride There will be plenty to bet on when it comes to the Orlando Pride in 2026. Barbra Banda will be on comeback watch as she recovers from an abductor injury she sustained in August. The Zambian international is one of the most dynamic forwards in the world, and she'll have the opportunity to work alongside one of the world's most exciting wingers, Jacquelle Ovalle. Ovalle, a Mexican international, recently won FIFA's Marta award for best goal scored in the women's game.\nPortland Thorns FC The Pacific Northwest side managed to break through for another playoff appearance in 2025, but next season will mark four years since the franchise's last title game appearance (2022 NWSL Championship), and that's a long time for one of the most successful clubs in the league.  They'll need to figure out who will lead the club moving forward after the dismissal of Rob Gale in the offseason, but they took care of a massive bit of player business with USWNT star WilsonRacing Louisville FCThere was plenty to celebrate in 2025 for Racing -- a first-ever playoff appearance, the emergence of a top goal scorer, and head coach Bev Yanez winning coach of the year.\nStill, now that Louisville have gotten a taste of small success, they'll need to improve on their efforts. The big questions for the club's executives will be on the roster. Will it be strong enough to return to the playoffs and advance beyond the quarterfinals? And can they compete for the shield? And can they manage a long season to contend for the shield? San Diego Wave FCThe former 2023 NWSL Shield winners missed out on the playoffs altogether in 2024 and had a huge turnaround in 2025. The club welcomed several internationals, from Swedish head coach Jonas Eidevall to veteran France international Kenza Dali. They had to manage some injury down the stretch, and the season ended for them in the semifinals, but it's not far-fetched to think they'll somehow be better in 2026 with plenty to build on from the year. Seattle Reign FCHead coach Laura Harvey and her staff managed to implement a new system and get complete buy-in from her squad as they were a defensive nightmare to face in 2025. The club also brought in some late midseason additions, and more time together next year feels like it could be exactly what forward Mia Fishel needs to become a threat in front of goal for Seattle. \nUtah Royals FCIt's officially two seasons ticked off for Utah after their return to the league as an expansion side in 2024. Unfortunately, they have shown the same exact capabilities in both years. The 2025 season was a nearly identical repeat of what the group tried to manage in 2024, a second half of the season surge that simply boiled over into nothing much to show for itself, except some moral victories and lessons.What happens now for the club in 2026 will depend on how the club manages the roster moving forward, and what exactly they are going to do with all that money they got from the Ally Sentnor trade.Washington Spirit Not sure there's ever been more attention on this club than any other offseason, and once upon a time, Y. Michelle Kang coordinated her accession as the official owner. The contract saga is ongoing with Trinity Rodman, and the hope is that by the new year, there will be a solution. Till then, happy holidays. \n            ",

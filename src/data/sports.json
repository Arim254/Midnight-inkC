    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is here, and that means it's time for the rumor mill to go into overdrive. Below, CBS Sports has gathered all of Saturday's most notable news, moves, and murmurs into one convenient viewing spot.Latest on Phillies' plans for Schwarber, SuárezThe Phillies aren't expected to re-sign free-agent left-hander Ranger Suárez, and they're likely to be without ace Zack Wheeler, recovering from surgery to correct his thoracic outlet syndrome, at the onset of next season. Yet that doesn't mean the Phillies are in the market for another starter.\n\"I can't say we wouldn't,\" executive Dave Dombrowski told The Athletic. \"But, again, it's not our highest priority. … You have to be careful. You always need to look for starting pitching depth. That doesn't necessarily mean top of the market, but where does that fit in? Because you never have enough starting pitching, and really for us, after you get past (the top six starters) … now you're talking about (minor leaguer Jean) Cabrera, he would be one of those guys. But we don't have a lot of starting pitching depth, so that's something we need to be cognizant of.\"\nAs it stands, the Phillies would likely trot out a rotation consisting of Cy Young runner-up Cristopher Sánchez, Jesús Luzardo, Aaron Nola, Taijuan Walker, and prospect Andrew Painter.\nThe Athletic adds that the Phillies still want to retain slugger Kyle Schwarber. Members of the Phillies front office met with Schwarber's agency last week during the GM meetings.Astros interested in Cardinals' DonovanCardinals utility player Brendan Donovan figures to be a popular trade target this winter, given his track record (career 117 OPS+), defensive versatility, and remaining years of cost control. You can count the Astros among the interested parties, according to The Athletic's Chandler Rome.\nIn general, the Astros are known to want to add to their lineup. They ranked 21st in runs scored in 2025, though they did grade as a league-average offense through the lens of FanGraphs' park-adjusted wRC+ metric.\n\"I think we're going to be giving guys more of a break this year, and there will be moving parts, but when we move the parts, (creating an) offensive lineup is going to be a big focus,\" general manager Dana Brown said. \"When we score four or more runs, the team is really good. We want to put some more runs on the board.\"Mariners want to retain own free agentsThe Mariners, fresh off a disappointing loss in the American League Championship Series, will begin with them prioritizing keeping their own free agents, like infielders Josh Naylor, Eugenio Suarez, and Jorge Polanco.\"Our offseason is largely going to start with the guys who were on the team last year and try to bring as many back as possible,\" general manager Justin Hollander said earlier in the week, according to the Seattle Times.\nPrevious reports had re-signing Naylor top among the Mariners' winter to-do list. It's not yet clear if Seattle has made progress in those efforts. Angels seeking batsThe Angels ranked 25th last season in runs scored and 26th in park-adjusted offense. Unsurprisingly, one of their offseason priorities is adding to the lineup in a meaningful way.\"We want to be a more balanced offense,\" general manager Perry Minasian told the Orange County Register. \"There are some really attractive right-handed hitters that I'd love to have, that are just good hitters, that I don't necessarily think anyone cares if they're right-handed or left-handed. So does it have to be left-handed? No. Apples to apples? Of course, you choose left hand over right-handed.\"\nCBS Sports' free-agent rankings listed the Angels as a possible fit for several downmarket position players, including infielder Jorge Polanco and outfielder Harrison Bader. It's unclear if the Angels have or will have interest in either.The Angels are also expected to pursue pitching help, including a few starters to fill out their rotation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A matchup boasting a College Football Playoff atmosphere will take place on Saturday when the No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs host the No. 10 Texas Longhorns at 7:30 p.m. ET. Both teams will enter this SEC showdown full of confidence. Texas is 13-2 in its last 15 games on the road, while Georgia is 19-1 in its past 20 games at home. According to the latest Week 12 college football odds, the Bulldogs are favored by six points at home, while the over/under for Texas vs. Georgia is 49.5 points. However, SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Texas, which has won 10 straight games played in November, to cover the spread in 60% of simulations. The model is also backing Iowa (+6.5) to cover the spread on the road against USC, while the Over (52.5) hits 58% of the time in TCU vs. BYU.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Texas +6.5 vs. Georgia The Longhorns are fighting for their College Football Playoff lives on Saturday night, so they'll be playing with a real sense of urgency. Texas is 7-1 in its last eight games, and quarterback Arch Manning has been playing some of his best football down the stretch. Manning has thrown for over 325 yards and three touchdowns in each of his last two outings, and SportsLine's model is expecting he'll do enough to keep it close against Georgia. The Longhorns are projected to cover the spread in 60% of simulations on Saturday. Iowa +6.5 vs. USCThe Hawkeyes are coming off a heartbreaking 18-16 defeat at home against Oregon. However, Iowa is 6-1 against the spread in its last seven games, and the Hawkeyes are 5-1 ATS in their past six meetings against a Big Ten opponent. Iowa also ranks fourth in college football in scoring defense, holding opponents to just 13 points per game. SportsLine's model is projecting Iowa's defense to disrupt USC's explosive offense, as the Hawkeyes cover the spread in 57% of simulations. Over 51 points in TCU vs. BYUBoth of these teams average over 30 points per game, and SportsLine's model is projecting we'll see a high-scoring affair on Saturday night. The Horned Frogs are scoring 32.7 points per game on average, while the Cougars average 33 points per contest. In addition, the Over has hit in 11 of BYU's last 15 games when playing as the favorite. On Saturday, the Cougars are favored by 4.5 points. The model is projecting these teams will combine for 58 points, helping the Over hit in 58% of simulations.Want more Week 12 college football picks?You've seen the model's Week 12 college football best bets for Saturday.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nOle Miss -11.5 vs. Florida (-110)Ole Miss lost a shootout against Georgia in the middle of October, but it has won its other nine games this season to stay on track for a College Football Playoff spot. The Rebels have held seven of their opponents to 23 points or fewer, and the model has Florida scoring just 18 points on Saturday night. The Gators have been blown out in two of their last four games, and they have failed to score more than 10 points in losses to LSU, Miami and Kentucky this season. Ole Miss is winning by nearly 20 points in the model's latest simulations, covering 63% of the time. Back Ole Miss at bet365 here:Under 60 in Baylor vs. Utah (-110)Utah is still in the hunt for a College Football Playoff spot as well, with its defense deserving a lot of credit. The Utes are holding opponents to just 14.2 points per game this season, giving up 14 points or fewer in all seven of their wins. Baylor is scoring more than 30 points per game, but this will be the best defense it has faced this year. These teams combined for just 35 points when they met last season, and the model has the Under hitting 66% of the time on Saturday. Bet Utah vs. Baylor at bet365 here:Texas +6.5 vs. Georgia (-115)Georgia has only faced three ranked opponents this season, and all three of those games came down to the wire. The Bulldogs beat Tennessee in overtime, lost to Alabama by three points and beat Ole Miss by eight points. They are coming off back-to-back road games, while Texas had a bye last week after beating then-No. 9 Vanderbilt to open November. The Longhorns are riding a four-game winning streak that includes a pair of wins over top-10 opponents. The model expects another close game on Saturday, with the Longhorns covering in 60% of simulations. Bet Georgia vs. Texas at bet365 here:\nLooking for Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

A third loss almost certainly eliminates them from playoff contention, especially with so many other SEC teams in the hunt. A loss will be a big blow to Georgia as well. The Bulldogs would drop to 8-2 with a tough game at Georgia Tech still remaining,\" SportsLine college football expert Thomas Casale said. \"Last season Texas went 0-2 against Georgia, despite closing as the favorite both times. I think the Bulldogs are the better team here, although 6.5 points feels a bit inflated. I make Georgia -4.5 and think the line will close around that number. I'll grab the 6.5 early in what should be a competitive game for four quarters.\" Back Texas at BetMGM Sportsbook now:BYU -149 vs. TCU\"Yes, BYU was smacked in Lubbock by TTU last week but really no shame in that these days and the Cougars still have a clear path to the Big 12 title game and the playoff by winning out. And they are always light years better in Provo (especially at night), including winning nine of the past 10 there,\" SportsLine handicapper Matt Severance said. \"The defense still played pretty well in that TTU loss all things considered and is among the Big 12's best. BYU is also No. 23 in rushing nationally with 200.0 YPG. And it is bringing back the awesome classic home royal uniforms Saturday. TCU top tailback Kevorian Barnes (97-443-3) is questionable.\" Back BYU at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Fresno State -175 vs. Wyoming\"Fresno State is still alive for a spot in the MW title game and frankly should win out the rest of the RS assuming it takes care of business here. I may have worried about a letdown game after an upset win at Boise State last time out, but FSU has since had a bye. Wyoming is winless in league road games,\" Severance said. \"FSU hasn't lost at home in this series since 2014 (six straight wins) and has held Wyoming to seven or fewer points in four of the last five meetings overall. Fresno State's defense this year ranks 18th in the FBS and 2nd in the MW in turnovers gained (16). The Cowboys have been offensively challenged basically since Josh Allen left.\" Back Fresno State at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

Texas vs. Georgia is garnering the majority of the attention of the college football world on Saturday, but it's not the only game. The No. 1 team in the nation takes the field on Saturday, and although it's not going as far as to pick an upset, SportsLine's model is expecting a closer game than many may be expecting. The model has UCLA in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook to hang around with No. 1 Ohio State, playing UCLA as 33.5-point underdogs. Ohio State is 9-0 this season, but the Buckeyes are 1-2 against the spread when favored by more than 25 points.The model has a best bet on the top-10 matchup of Georgia vs. Texas as well, backing the Longhorns as 6.5-point underdogs in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel.

The Bruins are 3-3 in the Big Ten, with two of their three conference losses coming in one-score contests. They are 3-1 ATS as an underdog in conference play this season. UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava was the No. 2 recruit in the nation in the Class of 2023, only behind Arch Manning, and although he hasn't fully lived up to those expectations early into his college career, he still has that potential. Ohio State is great, but UCLA can make enough plays to cover this margin. The model projects UCLA to cover the spread in 61% of simulations. Back UCLA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Texas +6.5 vs. Georgia (-115)Speaking of Arch Manning, he'll take the field as an underdog around the same time as Iamaleava. Manning is coming off two of the best performances of his collegiate career, throwing for 328 yards and three touchdowns against No. 9 Vanderbilt last week after a career-high 346 yards and three touchdowns the week before against Mississippi State. Georgia often has one of the top defenses in the nation, and this year is no exception, with a top-30 scoring defense in the nation. But No. 10 Texas has won each of its last two games against top-10 ranked teams heading into a matchup against No. 5 Georgia. The model projects Texas to cover the spread in 57% of simulations. Back Texas at FanDuel Sportsbook:Boise State +106 vs. San Diego StateThis matchup of the top two teams in the Mountain West will be a highly competitive 10:30 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network, with both teams at 4-1 in conference play this year. Boise State is coming off suffering its first conference loss of the season in a 30-7 final against Fresno State, which also snapped its three-game winning streak and six-game winning streak against unranked teams. That game was on Nov. 1, though, so the Broncos had time to regroup and prepare for this conference showdown. Meanwhile, San Diego State is coming off its first conference loss of the season, which came last week in a 38-6 demolition by Hawaii. The model projects Boise State to win in 66% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds.\nWant more college football picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\n        At least seven SEC teams are very much in the College Football Playoff hunt entering Week 12, and four of them play each other during the Week 12 college football schedule. No. 5 Georgia hosts No. 10 Texas, while No. 11 Oklahoma travels to No. 4 Alabama. These serve as de facto elimination games for the Longhorns and Sooners, both of whom have two losses. The latest Week 12 college football odds list the Tide at -6 and the Bulldogs at -5.5 in their respective matchups. Other college football lines of note for Week 12 involving playoff contenders include No. 9 Notre Dame (-12.5) vs. No. 22 Pittsburgh, No. 3 Texas A&M (-16.5) vs. South Carolina and No. 15 Miami (-14.5) vs. NC State.

They lost to Iowa by one, competed for a half against No. 1 Ohio State, and almost upset No. 2 Indiana last Saturday. You have to wonder how much do these players have left in the tank mentally after two emotional losses to Ohio State and Indiana. The loss to the Hoosiers was particularly gut-wrenching because Penn State came from behind to take a late lead before losing in the final seconds on one of the best catches you will ever see by Omar Cooper Jr.\"This is a tough spot for Penn State on the road laying over a touchdown. I can see a scenario where the Nittany Lions start off slowly and this settles into a close, low-scoring game. I like the Spartans to cover at home and potentially pull the outright upset.\" See what other college football picks Casale likes at SportsLine, and bet that line right here:How to make Week 12 college football picks Casale has found two other college football picks he loves, including backing an underdog in one of the week's biggest games where he says the line is inflated by multiple points. You can only see his picks at SportsLine, and you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.What are the best bets for Week 12 of college football, and which underdog should you back? Visit SportsLine now to see Thomas Casale's college football best bets, all from a proven college football handicapper, and find out. \n            ",

Iamaleava was the only UCLA quarterback that took an offensive snap against the Huskers. He was on the field for UCLA's last offensive possession of the game and finished with 191 yards and two touchdowns on 17 completions. He also led the Bruins in rushing with 15 carries for 86 yards. Iamaleava reportedly began experiencing concussion-like symptoms after the game ended. Nebraska also sacked him three times, in addition to the hits he absorbed as a rushing quarterback. Iamaleava, who moved to UCLA from Tennessee in the spring as 247Sports' No. 1 transfer portal prospect, is the only UCLA quarterback to attempt a pass this season. He amassed 1,659 yards and 12 touchdowns with seven interceptions through the air. He is also the only Bruin with more than 300 yards rushing, as he's gained 474 yards and four touchdowns on 96 attempts. Without Iamaleava, former three-star prospect Luke Duncan is in line for his first career start against an Ohio State team that leads the nation in scoring defense (7.2 points per game) and ranks second nationally in pass defense (128.7 yards per game). \nThe 6-foot-6 Duncan signed with UCLA in 2023, redshirted as a true freshman and did not appear in any games last season. \n            \n    ",

Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood is expected to throw for more than one touchdown in the simulations, while Wolverines running back Jordan Marshall is expected to surpass 125 yards rushing in the model's simulations. Northwestern quarterback Preston Stone is also expected to throw for one score, along with more than 150 yards passing. The teams combine for 43 points, making the over the value side.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time. You can only get the pick at SportsLine.So who wins Michigan vs. Northwestern, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        The Land Grant Trophy isn't exactly a prize for the ages this year -- but it's still a rivalry game worth playing for when Penn State (3-6) and Michigan State (3-6) meet in a battle of winless Big Ten teams just trying to salvage slim chances of bowl eligibility in disappointing seasons. It marks only the second time in 14 meetings that neither side is nationally ranked. The Nittany Lions are a month removed from firing longtime coach James Franklin and nearly pulled off a stunning upset last week against No. 2 Indiana before surrendering a game-winning touchdown drive in the final minutes. The Spartans suffered heartbreak of their own prior to a bye week with an overtime loss at Minnesota, matching their longest losing streak in nine years. Penn State, meanwhile, has dropped six consecutive games for the first time since 2004.Bet Penn State vs. Michigan State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Saturday's matchup will be the 39th all-time meeting between the two programs. While the Spartans have won six of the last 11 contests, the Nittany Lions have taken four of the past five to hold a narrow 19-18-1 edge in the rivalry series, which has been played annually since its inception in 1993.\nPenn State vs. Michigan State: Need to know  Quarterback situation: Michigan State coach Jonathan Smith is keeping his quarterback plans flexible for Saturday. Redshirt freshman Alessio Milivojevic threw for 311 yards in his first career start at Minnesota, ranking third-most by a freshman/redshirt freshman and fourth-most for any Spartans debut. But junior Aidan Chiles -- who followed Smith to Michigan State from Oregon State last season -- remains in the mix. Smith said both players will continue splitting first-team reps in practice, and using either or both in the game is \"all on the table\" as the Spartans look to regain momentum.Record chasers: Kaytron Allen became Penn State's career leader in rushing attempts last week, surpassing Evan Royster (2007-10). Allen has 3,613 career rushing yards, just 319 shy of Royster's all-time mark. Meanwhile, Nicholas Singleton continues climbing the Nittany Lions' record books as well, tallying 41 rushing touchdowns and 51 total touchdowns in his career, putting him within reach of Saquon Barkley's all-time school marks of 43 and 53, respectively.Late down woes: Both teams have struggled in critical late-down situations against FBS opponents this season. Michigan State's offense converts just 37.4% of late downs, ranking 99th in FBS, while Penn State is more effective at 46.5% (33rd). Defensively, the Spartans allow conversions on 55.3% of opponents' late downs (92nd), and the Nittany Lions give up 54.0% (106th).\n  Where to watch Penn State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Spartan Stadium -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ PremiumPenn State vs. Michigan State prediction, picks  \nThe records may be the same, but the talent disparity heavily favors Penn State. While Michigan State has fought hard with a 5-1-0 ATS record vs. Big Ten opponents -- the Nittany Lions possess far more firepower on both sides of the ball. Last week's near-upset of No. 2 Indiana showed Penn State hasn't quit under interim coach Terry Smith, and quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer was decent, keeping the offense balanced. That could be key against a Spartans pass defense that ranks fourth in the Big Ten in yards allowed per attempt (7.6) against FBS opponents this season. With bowl eligibility still on the line and a chance to cap a tough season on a high note, Penn State should leave East Lansing comfortably.  Pick: Penn State -7.5You can bet Michigan State vs. Penn State at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nWho will win and cover in each Week 12 college football game?

    "body": "\n        Eleven more NFL games are set for Sunday afternoon either in the 1 p.m. ET or 4:05/4:25 p.m. ET window, and those matchups comprise the main slate for NFL DFS sites like FanDuel and DraftKings. One of the early kickoffs -- Bengals vs. Steelers-- has the highest over/under (49.5) for the week, so that game should be a focus for NFL daily Fantasy players with big names like Josh Allen, Ja'Marr Chase and James Cook in action. Other big names expected to be playing on the main slate include Justin Herbert, Bijan Robinson and Christian McCaffrey. Lamar Jackson (knee) missed practice on Wednesday, but returned Thursday and Friday and carries no injury designation, clearing him to be part of the player pool as well. How should they factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups?

Playing in a more run-centric Jim Harbaugh offense limited his Fantasy production last year, but a rash of injuries at running back has Los Angeles throwing the ball more in 2025 with Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen, Quentin Johnston and tight end Oronde Gadsden II all putting up big numbers. Herbert and the Chargers face the Jaguars, who have given up the second-most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Atlanta receiver Drake London at $8,400 on FanDuel and $7,400 on DraftKings. The fourth-year pro is pacing for career-best number across the board as he enters Week 11 with a 53-691-6 receiving line. He faces a tougher matchup against a Carolina defense that has been solid overall against the pass. London, however, dominated the Panthers in their second meeting last year, posting a massive 10-187-2 line, giving him huge upside at a value price on Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 11 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        With just two teams on a bye, Week 11 Fantasy football lineups may look a little more robust after four squads had off last week. The likes of Ja'Marr Chase, Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are back in action, but Kansas City receivers may not be too appealing as Week 11 Fantasy football picks. That's because the Chiefs are facing a Denver team which has allowed the fewest Fantasy points to wideouts, shutting down the likes of Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and A.J. Brown. Kansas City also won't have running back Isiah Pacheco (knee), giving Denver the ability to zero in on the passing game even more. Observing which defenses are more conducive to allowing lots of points and yards should be a part of every manager's Fantasy football strategy. If the likes of Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy stay on your bench, then you'll want to see what the Week 11 Fantasy football projections forecast for others on your roster. Before making your Week 11 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 11 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 11 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 11 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 11: The model is fading Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a 10-time Pro Bowler who ranks as the TE5 this year. Even though Kelce, who is being started in 63% of leagues, had the second-most positional Fantasy points from Weeks 5-9 before a bye last week, he has a matchup to avoid as the Chiefs face Denver, which ranks No. 3 in scoring defense and No. 6 in passing defense. Just six teams have allowed fewer receptions or receiving touchdowns to tight ends than the Broncos, who've held their last three opposing starting TEs -- including Brock Bowers -- to an average of 44.3 yards and zero scores. Kelce sits outside the top 10 Fantasy tight ends in the Week 11 Fantasy football rankings, so he's one to fade.Another curveball: The model is high on Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, despite being the QB17 entering Week 11 and coming off the worst Fantasy performance of his Pittsburgh career. Rodgers, who has an over/under of 231.5 passing yards this week, has an extremely favorable matchup versus Cincinnati on Sunday as he had a four-touchdown game versus the Bengals in Week 7. Cincinnati has allowed the second-most Fantasy points to quarterback in 2025, as it's given up the most passing touchdowns and third-most passing yards. The model has Rodgers ranked above the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Caleb Williams and Matthew Stafford, despite all three of them being among the top 10 Fantasy QBs this season.

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 11 schedule features nine divisional clashes. Among the biggest are Sunday, when the AFC West co-leading Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams face off as Sam Darnold looks to guide the Seahawks past Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Another key divisional matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos in a pivotal AFC West meeting. The Rams are 3-point favorites as both they and the Seahawks sport 7-2 ATS records, while Kansas City is favored by 3.5 points on the road.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications features the Detroit Lions against the Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5). Philadelphia has won the last two meetings, the last a 38-35 triumph in 2022. The largest Sunday spread has the Ravens (-7.5) over the Cleveland Browns. Lamar Jackson (knee) missed practice on Wednesday, but did return as a full participant on Thursday and carries no injury designation. Other big favorites include the Packers (-7) vs. the Giants, as Jameis Winston will start in place of Jaxson Dart (concussion) and the Texans (-5.5) vs. Titans, in which a concussion will also keep C.J. Stroud out.Before making any Week 11 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

Team USA, the No. 2 seed, was dominant in a 5-1 win over Germany on Sunday to close out the preliminary round with a perfect 3-0-0-0 record. Auston Matthews' three-point outing powered the Americans to victory before the competition picks up. Through the first two games, Matthews had drawn criticism for not being at his best. That went out the window on Sunday as Matthews was the best player on the ice for the United States. The Tkachuk brothers were everywhere as well in what has been a staple of the Americans' play in this competition. Against Germany, Brady was a physical force and notched an assist on a goal by Brock Faber, and Matthew picked up two more assists as he continues to be at the center of the action offensively.Connor Hellebuyck wasn't tested a lot in goal, but he was very good when called upon. The only shot that got past Hellebuyck came off the stick of Tim Stützle, one of the Germans' two best offensive players.The United States made the preliminary round harder than it needed to be with a few slow starts, but the team played its best game of the tournament on Sunday. The Americans will try to carry that momentum into the quarterfinals against Sweden as Team USA tries to shake off an ugly history of overseas performances. Since NHL players first went to the Olympics in 1998, the Americans have never medaled outside of North America.

That is not the case for 2026, as the schedule is loaded with intriguing fights in January and February.The early highlight of the schedule was Shakur Stevenson's domination of Teofimo Lopez Jr. to win the WBO junior welterweight championship. It was a true pound-for-pound performance from Stevenson, who won nearly every second of a fight against the most dangerous foe of his career.A massive DAZN PPV is set for Feb. 21 with a terrific welterweight title main event. Champion Mario Barrios is set to defend his belt against Ryan Garcia in a fight sure to deliver action. Barrios is coming off a disappointing draw against Manny Pacquiao in Pacquiao's return to the ring. Similarly, Garcia suffered a very disappointing loss in his most recent outing, dropping a decision to Rolando Romero in Times Square in a fight where Garcia showed no urgency bell-to-bell. Now, both men have a chance to get their careers back on track when they clash in Las Vegas.There are many other title fights, featuring top fighters, which have created a very intriguing kickoff to the sport for 2026.Take a look at the calendar for 2026 below.\nNote: This will be updated constantly with changes and additions.

Former Nuggets players Bill Hanzlik posted on X that Moe \"passed away peacefully holding the hand of his wife.\"\"Coach Moe was a one of a kind leader and person who spearheaded one of the most successful and exciting decades in Nuggets history,\" the Nuggets said as part of a statement. \"He will forever be loved and remembered by Nuggets fans and his banner commemorating his 432 career victories as head coach will hang in the rafters to forever honor his incredible legacy.\"\nMoe started his coaching career as an assistant in the ABA before becoming the San Antonio Spurs coach in 1976-77, the franchise's inaugural NBA season. The Spurs made the playoffs in each of Moe's first three seasons before he was fired late in the 1979-80 season.After starting the 1980-81 season as a Denver assistant, he got elevated to head coach, and stayed in that role until 1990. Moe's fast-paced, run-and-gun teams led the league scoring six times across his 10 seasons. His 432 wins were a franchise record until Michael Malone passed him in 2024.\nMoe then moved to the Philadelphia 76ers, but he was fired after a 19-37 start to his first season. He returned to Denver in the 2000s as an assistant coach. Former Nuggets coach George Karl, whom Moe worked under, also took to X following Moe's death.\nA two-time All-ACC selection at North Carolina, Moe's college career ended due to his association with a point shaving scandal; there was no evidence he was involved in fixing games, but he did admit to taking money from a conspirator. Moe was selected in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons and in 1961 by the Chicago Packers, but due to the scandal, his NBA career was delayed.\nHe eventually began his professional basketball career in Italy in 1965 and joined the ABA's New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967. He was an ABA All-Star his first year as well as the next two years with the Oakland Oaks -- who won the 1968-69 ABA title -- and the Carolina Cougars, respectively. He also finished in the top 10 in MVP voting all three years. He spent his last two years as a player with the Virginia Squires before beginning his coaching career.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Monaco couldn't have asked for a better start against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League playoffs than American striker Folarin Balogun scoring less than a minute into the first leg with a well-timed header. After the cross from Aleksandr Golovin, Balogun just had to divert the ball on target and wasted no time putting his side ahead in the match. He wasn't done there, getting his second goal in the 18th minute of play. It wouldn't be enough to secure victory with Monaco losing 3-2 at home, but it sets up a competitive second leg at the Parc de Princes on Wednesday, Feb. 26 (catch all the action on Paramount+).Here's a look at Balogun's second goal:\nThese are the fourth and fifth Champions League goals for Balogun this season and his ninth and 10th for the club in all competitions as he has gained confidence leading the line. They may have been Balogun's first goals of 2026, but they couldn't have come at a better time, leading his side in a home leg of the knockout phase with a chance to make the round of 16.An 18-minute brace wasn't enoughDespite Monaco's strong start, they then conceded three unanswered goals to end the match on a sour note ultimately losing to PSG. Three unanswered goals and a red card to Golovin, who assisted Balogun's opener were too much to come back. After Ousmane Dembele needed to leave the pitch due to an injury, it was Desire Doue, who sparked change, scoring with his first touch of the ball, before adding another goal and an assist to his tally. But Balogun's hot start to the match will still provide Monaco with a chance to advance in the second leg, as the deficit is only one goal, but it could've been worse.Balogun with ice in his veinsNow with more Champions League goals than Ligue 1 goals, the 24-year-old is establishing himself as a big-game player for Monaco with his performances in the league phase and now the knockouts. After a strong November camp for the United States men's national team, this is also something that USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino will love to see as the clock ticks closer to the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nJust like Monaco will need as much as they can get from Balogun to make it past a tough PSG side, the USMNT will look toward the striker to advance as far as possible at the World Cup. Already performing with pressure on his shoulders, this is a good start. If he can follow this up with another brace in the second leg, who knows, Monaco could shock the world and book a place in the round of 16.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A North Carolina district attorney says there's \"zero evidence\" backing up Duke coach Jon Scheyer's claims that several staffers were punched following the Blue Devils' loss to the Tar Heels on Feb. 7 during a court-storming after the final horn. Seconds after Seth Trimble's late 3-pointer pushed UNC to a dramatic rivalry win, Scheyer and his players were swarmed in what he described as a \"scary scene\" post-game, leading to an apology from Tar Heels athletic director Bubba Cunningham.Scheyer said several of his staff members were \"punched in the face\" by UNC fans. Jeff Nieman, the district attorney for Orange County (North Carolina), directed remarks toward Scheyer this week on social media, writing that \"someone with the power and influence of a major men's basketball coach should exercise more discretion before just saying things that can have real-world consequences.\"Scheyer was asked about Nieman's comments following Duke's win over Syracuse on Monday night.\"I would like to focus on Syracuse, but I'll tell you that I know what I saw and I know what happened with our staff after the game -- and that's the bottom line,\" Scheyer said. \"I'm not going to circle back or get into -- I don't know what was said or wasn't said or what people want to claim. But I know what happened, and I'm always going to support our staff in those situations and, again, I could have even said more, but I'm not going to do that.\"\n        \n            \n                Court storming halts final seconds of Carolina-Duke as Scheyer describes 'scary' scene; UNC AD apologizes\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTwo days after the loss to the Tar Heels, Scheyer said one of his staff members was injured after being \"trampled\" amid the chaotic environment and another \"looked like he had been in a complete brawl\" following the game. Scheyer also said his family was involved \"pushing people away\" while trying to get to the locker room.\nNieman, a North Carolina graduate, wrote this week that it's \"patently obvious\" none of that occurred. \nThe ACC later fined UNC $50,000 for violation of the league's event security policy. It was the Tar Heels' first offense.\"We accept the ACC's fine for having unauthorized people on the court before Duke and the officials could completely clear the floor on Saturday,\" UNC said in a statement after the fine was issued. \"The video we have reviewed confirms we followed our protocols to get Duke's players and bench personnel and the game officials off the floor safely. We will continue to review our protocols to provide the highest measures of safety in the event fans rush the court. We consider this matter closed and look forward to the rest of the season.\"\nThird-ranked Duke is 24-2 overall this season with its only ACC loss coming to the Tar Heels. Scheyer and the Blue Devils travel to top-ranked Michigan this weekend for a matchup with significant NCAA Tournament implications.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Champions League knockout playoff between Benfica and Real Madrid was delayed by 10 minutes on Tuesday night after Vinicius Junior reported an alleged racial incident. The Brazil attacker had just scored an outstanding opening goal in the 50th minute of the match in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz when anger built among home supporters, objects raining down on the pitch as Vinicius celebrated by the corner flag. The exuberance of his celebrations earned Vinicius a yellow card from referee Francois Letexier while tensions frayed between both sets of players.It was soon after that Vinicius sprinted over to Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The French referee made a gesture of crossed arms above his head, an initiative adopted by FIFA in 2024 to allow players and officials to signal that they believe racist abuse has taken place on the field. Television cameras caught Benfica forward Gianluca Prestianni speaking to Vinicius with his jersey covering his mouth; the Real Madrid man appeared to subsequently make reference to that while speaking to Letexier. Posting on his Instagram stories after the game, Vinicius said: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family's.\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\nSpeaking after the game, several visiting players also alleged that Prestianni had racially abused their teammate. \"This can't happen,\" Aurelien Tchouameni told Movistar. \"Vini told us that the kid called him a monkey. He said he didn't say anything...\"Federico Valverde added, \"We don't know for sure, but according to all the teammates who were nearby, he said something nasty that shouldn't be said. We've been fighting for this for a long time. Vini has fought for this, and if this keeps happening, it's a shame that a camera didn't record it. \"If you cover your mouth to say something, it means what you're saying isn't right. It's a shame. I'm proud of the teammates who defended Vini and proud of Vini for carrying on.\"\nMeanwhile, a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card as tempers built across the field. Vinicius was spotted in an embrace with Jose Mourinho before sitting on the Madrid bench, the delay to proceedings running to 10 minutes before the match was resumed at the hour mark.Speaking after the game, Mourinho, who was sent off for a separate incident, revealed that he had told Vinicius that \"the last thing [Benfica] is is racist,\" pointing to the fact that their greatest ever player, Eusebio, was black. The Benfica head coach said he wished to remain \"independent\" in regards to what may have been said by Prestianni but criticised Vinicius for his celebrations.\"Unfortunately, he was not just happy to score the goal,\" Mourinho told Amazon. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\nWhen it was put to the former Real Madrid manager that Vinicius had suffered racist abuse on several other occasions during his career, Mourinho said, \"Stadiums that Vinicius plays in, something happens, always.\"Though there were no further flashpoints between the players, Vinicius' every touch was booed by the Estadio da Luz and the game was stopped momentarily in the 96th minute as items were thrown onto the pitch by supporters and once again in the 103rd minute as 12 minutes of added time were issued. Madrid would ultimately hold onto their lead with relative ease.\"Disgraceful to the sport,\" was how Trent Alexander-Arnold described the incident to CBS Sports. \"It's disappointing. It's ruined the night. It's a disgrace to the sport and society. There's no place for it.\n\"If incidents like this do happen, we can only deal with it like we did tonight. Very proud of the team, the club and the squad, how everyone reacted and got around Vini. You can see it's something upsetting and disappointing. We reacted the right way, we kept our heads and kept calm. We defended each other and we also played very well.\"Vinicius has been racially abused on multiple occasions during his time as a Real Madrid player, particularly in 2023, when the incidents included an effigy of him being hung on a bridge in the Spanish capital before a match against Atletico Madrid. His campaigns against such intolerance and hatred have won the 25-year-old widespread admiration in the footballing world and beyond, with the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul implementing \"Vinicius Junior laws\" that will see sporting contests suspended over incidents of racist abuse.The Brazilian football federation swiftly issued a statement of support for their star player. \n\"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) stands in solidarity with Vinicius Junior, victim of yet another act of racism this Tuesday, after scoring for Real Madrid against Benfica in Lisbon. Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else,\" the statement read.\"Vini, you are not alone. Your action in activating the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you. We will remain firm in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We are by your side. Always.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nPrior to the start of the college basketball season, the Purdue Boilermakers were picked to win the Big Ten, with the Michigan Wolverines second. And with just 20 days remaining in the regular season, the top two Big Ten teams in the AP Top 25 poll are the Wolverines (No. 1) and the Boilermakers (No. 7).On Tuesday, the two teams long thought to be the class of the conference collide when Michigan and Purdue square off at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Ind., in what may end up being the game of the year in the Big Ten.The Wolverines (24-1, 14-1 in Big Ten) have won 10 in a row since a loss to Wisconsin on Jan. 10 and own a two-game lead over Illinois in the conference. They have dominated opponents all season by outrebounding opponents and generating extra shots.Meanwhile, the Boilermakers (21-4, 11-3) are tied for third in the Big Ten, with Nebraska. They have won four in a row since a three-game skid threatened to derail their season. Michigan is a 2.5-point favorite over Purdue on Tuesday night.While Wolverines-Boilermakers is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on Tuesday, Feb. 17. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 1 Michigan at No. 7 PurdueTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: West Lafayette, Ind. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Purdue +2.5 | Expert: Over 152.5 (Chip Patterson)\nWhile the Wolverines have excelled on the boards this season (ranking 10th in the country in rebound margin, 9.8 per game), the Boilermakers are capable of hanging with Michigan on the glass. Purdue ranks 20th in the nation in rebound margin (7.6). On the other end of the court, the Boilermakers are No. 2 in the country in offensive efficiency (128.2 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says Purdue has a 69.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Boilermakers +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"The key to the Over will be Braden Smith's playmaking in a huge game on a Tuesday night in Mackey Arena,\" he says. \"The bet here is that the four-year starter has a big night and Purdue is ready to run it up into the 80s as well.\"No. 16 North Carolina at NC StateTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Raleigh, N.C.| TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: North Carolina +6.5\nNot only is star freshman Caleb Wilson (19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game) out for the North Carolina Tar Heels, but second-leading scorer Henri Veesaar (16.4) is questionable for Tuesday's game with an Illness. The good news for the Tar Heels (20-5, 8-4 in ACC)? They'll be facing a NC State Wolfpack team (18-8, 9-4) that is struggling right now, having lost two in a row. After the Wolfpack's most recent loss, to Miami, coach Will Wade ripped his team publicly, calling his players \"soft.\" The SportsLine Projection Model says North Carolina has a 58.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Tar Heels +6.5. But make sure to check closer to opening tip for changes due to injury updates.No. 21 Louisville at SMUTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: SMU +3.5\nThere are not many teams in the country with a backcourt like the SMU Mustangs'. Boopie Miller (18.9 points per game), Jaron Pierre Jr. (17.4) and B.J. Edwards (13.2) combine to score 56.5% of the team's points. The Mustangs (17-8, 6-6 in ACC) also shoot 76.2% from the free throw line, which ranks 48th in the nation. That figures to benefit them against the Louisville Cardinals (19-6, 8-4), who are a high-fouling team (18.8 per game, 284th in the country). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance SMU covers and assigns a B grade to Mustangs +3.5. No. 9 Nebraska at IowaTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Iowa City | TV: Big Ten Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa -1.5 | Expert: Nebraska +1.5 (Micah Roberts)\nThe Nebraska Cornhuskers (22-3, 11-3 in Big Ten) are the definition of three and D. They are 11th in Division I in 3-pointers made per game (11.0) and eighth in the nation in defensive efficiency (92.5 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom). On Tuesday, they will face an Iowa Hawkeyes team (18-7, 8-6) that has lost back-to-back games and is coming off a 21-point blowout loss at home to Purdue. \"Nebraska has proved that it is worthy of being a first-class tiered Big Ten squad,\" Roberts says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says that the Hawkeyes have a 65.0% chance to cover and gives a strong A grade to Iowa -1.5.Looking aheadChampions League: Newcastle United at QarabagTime: 12:45 p.m. Wednesday | Location: Baku, Azerbaijan | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Newcastle United -253 | Expert: Qarabag +1.5 (Jon Eimer)\nQarabag will look to continue their historic run through the Champions League when they host Newcastle United in the first leg of the knockout round playoffs. Thanks to wins over Frankfurt and Copenhagen and a draw against Chelsea — all at home — Qarabag are the first team from the Azerbaijan Premier League to reach the knockout round of the Champions League. The teams will play the second leg in the United Kingdom on Feb. 24. \"Newcastle know if they just keep this close they can bring the second leg back home and dominate. I expect Qarabag to do what they did against Copenhagen, Chelsea and Frankfurt at home already, and cover this spread,\" Eimer says. However, the SportsLine Projection Model likes Newcastle to win and assigns a strong A grade to the Newcastle money line (-253).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Real Madrid's victory over Benfica overshadowed by a stoppage of play with Vinicus Junior walking off the pitch following an incident of alleged racial abuse. After scoring a goal and celebrating during Real Madrid's 1-0 victory, the match had to be delayed for 10 minutes after Vinicius sprinted over to referee Francois Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni.The Benfica player covered his face with his shirt when he said something to Vinicius Junior, and Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe said that the word used was \"mono,\" which is Spanish for monkey. CBS Sports analyst Thierry Henry reflected on the scenario and opened up, saying he had gone through similar situations during his own storied career.\"People did fight, way before my time, for us to be able to perform and to entertain people. And to still be in 2026 dealing with the same thing, it's tiring,\" Henry said. \"Obviously, I can relate, not only I can relate by the color of my skin, I can relate because I've been there. I've been lonely.\"\n\"I really don't know anymore ... Don't go there, don't do this. They are booing him. There's no way that if people understood what was happening on the field and that they've been told because they still were booing him. \"That happened to me. So at times you feel lonely because it's going to be your word against his word. And so, because we don't know what was said, because [Prestianni] was very courageous and put his shirt over his mouth to make sure we were not going to see what he said, so clearly, already, you look suspicious. Because you don't want people to see or read what you said.\"Then you have the reaction of Vinicius telling me that something was not right ... Vinicius can tell us his side, and Prestianni, I'm sure, will not tell us what was actually said. I saw him when Kylian Mbappe confronted him, and he said to Kylian, 'I didn't say anything.' But he must've said something. What I go back to is that sometimes it's lonely, you feel like you don't know what to do anymore, because I've been in that situation, Vinicius has been in that situation. So many players have been in that situation.\" \n\"Regardless of whatever happened, you don't want to see anyone throwing a bottle at anyone anywhere. I can relate because at times you feel lonely, this is why I like the reaction of the Real Madrid players, as you would expect that when you see a teammate in this type of situation, you're going to believe him straight away. Yes, Vinicius scored, but it's not something that you want to see. I've been in this situation; it's horrible. And not being able to prove it. He's going to say no, obviously.\" When Prestianni was substituted from the match in the 81st minute of play, he was applauded by the Benfica supporters. Benfica's manager Jose Mourinho claimed that Vini's goal wasn't celebrated in a respectful way, despite the Brazilian dancing in the corner, for which he was yellow carded for. Henry asked the question that many are wondering in response. \"I answered by scoring goals, I answered by being cocky, I answered by being silent, I answered by fighting. So what, are we just here to entertain?\"\nUEFA guidelines In UEFA competitions, there are official guidelines to halt a match if a referee becomes aware of racial behavior but the guidelines are geared to incidents coming from fans rather than from players on the pitch itself. Step one is for the game to be stopped with an announcement being made to cease any racist behavior. If it doesn't cease after the game has been restarted, it will then be suspended with teams going to the dressing rooms before potentially being abandoned if issues continue after a second restart. After a match, the case is referred to UEFA's disciplinary authorities.This match was only stopped as the referee attempted to sort out what was said, but since there wasn't clear proof of what happened, after things calmed down, the match restarted. Vinicius Junior released a statement on social media calling for more action.\n\"Racists are, above all, cowards,\" the Brazilian said. \"They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, in theory, have the obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new to me or my family. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like to be involved in situations like this, especially after a great victory and when the headlines should be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\" \nRight back Trent Alexander-Arnold called the event \"a disgrace to football,\" following the match, while Mbappe encouraged Vinicius to keep dancing.\n            ",

I cherished every moment my cleats touched the grass. Every time I stepped onto the field, I was determined to leave a piece of myself in every snap.\" Woods signed a one-day contract Tuesday to retire as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. \nWoods had not appeared in a regular season game since 2024, his second year with the Houston Texans. He was initially drafted out of USC by the Buffalo Bills, where he played his first four seasons. \nWoods signed with the Rams in March 2017 ahead of coach Sean McVay's first season with the franchise. He appeared in just 12 games but posted a career-high (to that point) 56 catches for 781 yards with five touchdowns. He was the Rams' top wide receiver in 2018 when they made a run to the Super Bowl, where he had five catches for 70 yards. He finished the 2018 campaign with 1,219 yards and six touchdowns. Woods was also on the roster when the Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56, though he missed the game itself due to a torn ACL. Woods signed with the Tennessee Titans in 2022 and spent one season in Nashville before he signed his two-year contract with the Texans. \nWoods finished his career with 683 catches for 8,233 yards and 38 touchdowns.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Former Dallas Mavericks majority owner Mark Cuban says the NBA needs to focus on prioritizing its fans by creating memorable experiences and not concern itself with tanking, this coming after commissioner Adam Silver promised over the weekend to increase punishment for tanking following recent significant fines for the Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers.In a social media post Tuesday, Cuban said the NBA should \"embrace tanking\" and admitted to doing so during his time with the Mavericks. Tanking is advantageous toward moving up in the draft, creating value with trades and extended cap room, all factors that could lead to a league championship, Cuban explained.\"When I got into the nba, they thought they were in the basketball business.  They aren't,\" Cuban wrote. \"They are in the business of creating experiences for fans.    Few can remember the score from the last game they saw or went to.  They can't remember the dunks or shots.  What they remember is who they were with.  Their family, friends, a date.  That's what makes the experience special. \"Fans know their team can't win every game.  They know only one team can win a ring.  What fan that care about their team's record want is hope.   Hope they will get better and have a chance to compete for the playoffs and then maybe a ring.\"The NBA is \"misguided\" in their perception of what fans want, Cuban claims. He said fans understand the benefits of tanking and said the league should worry more about affordability of games and its in-arena experiences moreso than competitive games.\"You know who cares the least about tanking, a parent who cant afford to bring their three kids to a game and buy their kids a jersey of their fave player,\" Cuban wrote.\n        \n            \n                Adam Silver forced to address competitiveness, Clippers, more crises amid commissioner's most challenging year\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas drafted former franchise favorite Luka Dončić at No. 3 overall in 2018, but wouldn't have been in that lottery position had the Mavericks not finished 24-58 overall and 13th in the West the previous campaign. Dončić went on to lead Dallas to its third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history in 2024 when it lost to the Boston Celtics.Now in his 12th season as commissioner, Silver says there's gray area when it comes to the subjectiveness of tanking and understands why teams try and disguise it. He mentioned the \"conundrum\" taking place with rampant tanking and not be able to differentiate between teams that are actually bad and ones simply manipulating performance to try and improve their draft position.\nSilver said the league has even considered taking away draft picks for blatant tanking among \"every possible remedy\" this season.\"In the old days, it was just sort of an understanding among partners in terms of behavior,\" Silver said during All-Star Weekend. \"I think what we're seeing is modern analytics where it's so clear that the incentives are misaligned. ... Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory? Yes, is my view. Which was what led to those fines, and not just those fines but to my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior, and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"The Mavericks are currently one of seven teams with 19 or fewer wins this season with 24 or so games left to play for each. Only three finished with that number or fewer last fall.\nTo Cuban's point, Silver acknowledged the league's diehard fans and said he hopes to not lose sight \"of the people who support this league day in and day out.\" The league reprimanded Indiana and Utah last week for \"overt\" tanking after certain high-profile players were held out of recent action.\n            ",

However, the Boilermakers have won four straight since and 21 of 22 games outside that stretch to enter Tuesday at 21-4 overall. Michigan is the well-deserved top-ranked team at 24-1 overall and on a 10-game winning streak, but Purdue has won three straight in their series on its home court. The Boilermakers are 15-7 all-time against Michigan at home. The model projects Purdue to win in 62% of simulations, showcasing strong value at these odds. Back Purdue to win at DraftKings here:Miami (OH) (-3.5) vs. UMass (-105)Miami (OH) is the final undefeated team left in men's college basketball, entering Tuesday at 25-0 overall and 12-0 in the MAC. The RedHawks have won three of four by double digits, and eight of their 10 road wins this season have come by at least four points. Meanwhile, UMass has lost back-to-back games to enter Tuesday at 15-11 overall and 6-7 in the MAC. Miami (OH) has three players averaging at least 13.9 points per game, led by guard Brant Byers, who scored 21 points against Ohio on Friday to lift his average to 15 ppg.

Iowa is eighth in the conference with eight wins so far, but those wins have come against second-tier Big Ten teams. Nebraska has proved that it is worthy of being a first-class tiered Big Ten squad. Their defense allows only 39.8% shooting, and offensively, they are fourth nationally in assists-to-turnover ratio (1.95). Total team effort. Nebraska averages 79.4 points and is 6-1 on the road. Iowa is outclassed in this game. Nebraska wins. Back Nebraska to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

Punk defends his world heavyweight title against Finn Balor, plus two superstars will punch their tickets to WrestleMania 42.Punk has his hands full as the world heavyweight champion. He'll rematch Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber, the last major stop before WrestleMania. If he leaves Chicago with his champion status intact, Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns awaits him in Las Vegas.Elimination Chamber's two titular matches will also take place. The superstars who emerge from their respective steel structures victorious will earn world title matches at WrestleMania. Randy Orton, LA Knight and Cody Rhodes are among those who've qualified for a shot at the undisputed WWE title. Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka will compete with two other women for a shot at one of the two women's world titles as Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan has still yet to make her decision on who she will face.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Feb. 28 with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. TBA vs. TBA: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Cody Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Je'Evon Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. TBA vs. TBA: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Alexa Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Jacob Fatu: WWE subverted expectations by booking Rhodes and Fatu in the same Elimination Chamber qualifying match. All signs pointed to an eventual triple threat match between them and McIntyre. Rhodes is still the favorite to challenge McIntyre at WrestleMania. Maybe Fatu loses his qualifying match and earns a separate title shot against McIntyre. It seems odd to reward Fatu with a title opportunity if he loses his upcoming qualifier match. Whatever direction WWE takes, expect Fatu to orbit McIntyre in the next few months.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If third base is the position you have to worry about most (and if you've read my third base strategies, you know it is), shortstop is the position you have to worry about least. That comes with a caveat, but it won't apply to 90 percent of you.  Granted, shortstop has had a reputation for being the most star-studded position in Fantasy for darn near a decade now, but it hasn't always been deep to the point that you can't really mess it up. That's how it stacks up now, though. In addition to all the early-round standouts remaining more or less in good standing, Mookie Betts and Geraldo Perdomo have unexpectedly joined the ranks of the elite, Zachary Neto and Jeremy Pena have taken a significant step forward, and Bo Bichette and Trevor Story have shaken off past injuries to regain their place of prominence. By my count, there are 15 shortstops who would be satisfactory starters in any format, along with a handful of others with that same sort of upside.  Position Strategies: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | SP | RPPosition Tiers: C | 1B | 2B | 3B | SS | OF | SP | RP  About that caveat, though: The drop-off thereafter is steep. If you look at my shortstop rankings, Nos. 21 and 22 are Carlos Correa and Otto Lopez, who aren't exactly world beaters and are probably best drafted at the other positions where they're eligible (third and second base, respectively). After them, I've simply clumped together a bunch of prospects with an outside shot at making the opening day roster, reasoning that such a gamble would be better than settling for bottom-of-the-barrel production.  To be fair, most drafts won't make it that far. Maybe in some 12-team Rotisserie leagues, a couple teams will have to gamble on one those prospects to fill their extra middle infield spot, but they may be eager to do so. Prospects are exciting, after all. In anything deeper, though, the drop-off will come into play, and it'll hurt all the more because so much of the competition will have a true standout at the position.  \nStill, you don't have to try that hard to avoid that fate, even in such a league. You just need to be mindful of it. You also need to be mindful when weighing whether to take a second shortstop that the waiver wire may be lacking in them later on. For as many studs as have accumulated here, it's a position with a high barrier to entry, so there won't be as many add-ons over the course of the season.

The Studs here run far deeper than at any other infield position. If you're familiar with my Tiers, then you've seen me divide this group into smaller ones, but tiers are intended to narrow your focus at each position. These articles, by contrast, are intended to give you the broad strokes, and the fact is that I'd be thrilled to have any of these 11 as my starting shortstop. So if you're in a 12-team league that uses standard Head-to-Head lineups with no middle infield spot, pretty much everyone gets a stud. And if you're the one who doesn't, then you'll have to settle for Jeremy Pena or Trevor Story, who themselves performed like studs last year. How do you mess that up?  Well, not everything goes right for every player, of course, and as I've already mentioned, so many shortstops are draft-worthy that the waiver wire is rarely abounding in them. So who represents the likeliest misses here that would leave you scrambling midseason? They're mostly accounted for in the cost. Clearly, drafters are wary of Geraldo Perdomo's out-of-nowhere breakthrough and weary of Corey Seager's continuous injuries. Would you believe they're among my favorites to draft, though? I feel like the cost accounts for the risk and then some, recognizing that Perdomo performed more like a second-rounder last year and Seager continually does on a per-game basis. This is by far the latest Seager has ever been drafted, which is more reflective of buyer fatigue than a loss of skill. I have to take advantage of that.  \nAnd sometimes it's as a middle infielder because I already grabbed a shortstop in Round 1 or 2. I'm not afraid to double up like that in a Rotisserie league. But I think it's also telling that Perdomo and Seager are the two of these 11 who stand out most in a points league, where the penalty for missing isn't as severe because the shortstop pool isn't stretched as much. Perhaps my points league sensibilities have helped to shape my perception of them.  So who am I less enthusiastic about drafting? Certainly, Francisco Lindor's broken hamate bone puts a damper on his draftability. All the first round-caliber bats would need to be gone before I gambled on him having no lingering effects when he returns in April, which puts him more like 24th in my rankings. Meanwhile, I think Zach Neto's price tag fixates on his home run and stolen base totals while ignoring everything else and doesn't account for the downside inherent to his poor plate discipline. I don't mind anyone else's cost, though. Bo Bichette might be a little underrated, in fact, given that he's expected to gain third base eligibility about a week into the season.

I just think both overachieved, so I'm grouping them more in line with my expectations. Pena could lose about 30 points off his batting average while Story could lose ... well, everything. He's among my bust picks for 2026 -- and perhaps the one I'm most confident in. His ADP doesn't seem to account for the fact that he averaged just 54 games over the previous three years, and even if he manages to stay healthy again, his dreadful plate discipline will make for a wide range of outcomes.  Willy Adames and Danby Swanson are more like floor plays, but they're still awfully good, with Adames being a near lock for 30 homers and Swanson for a combined 40 homers and steals. Between the two, I'm more attracted to Swanson because of the four rounds' difference for no reason that I can discern. A year ago, we were drafting him about 40 picks earlier, and two years ago, about 70 picks earlier. He's the same player now that he was then.  I said at the top that there are 15 shortstops who would be satisfactory starters in any format, but including Wilson would make it 16. The reason I left him out of the initial count is that I think he makes for a far better starter in points leagues, where his microscopic strikeout rate keeps him from losing as many of his hard-earned points as other shortstops, and you can see from his point-per-game average the effect that it has. Whether he can repeat last year's 13 home runs, even, is fair to wonder given his batted-ball profile. His 5x5 value is mostly riding on his batting average, which is the most difficult category to sustain from one year to the next.  \nThe Sleepers  \t \t  2026 ADP2025 PPG2025 BA2025 OPS\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Xavier Edwards\n                    \n            \n            \n            MIA 2B\n        \n            \n        \n1712.67.283.696\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Colson Montgomery\n                    \n            \n            \n            CHW SS\n        \n            \n        \n1763.08.239.840\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ezequiel Tovar\n                    \n            \n            \n            COL SS\n        \n            \n        \n2182.12.253.694\n    \n    \n                                            \n            \n                Konnor Griffin\n            \n            \n            PIT SS\n        \n            \n        \n237-----.333*.941*\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Carlos Correa\n                    \n            \n            \n            HOU SS\n        \n            \n        \n2422.23.276.734\n    \n    \n                                            \n            \n                JJ Wetherholt\n            \n            \n            STL 2B\n        \n            \n        \n259-----.306*.931*\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Masyn Winn\n                    \n            \n            \n            STL SS\n        \n            \n        \n2792.36.253.673\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Kevin McGonigle\n                    \n            \n            \n            DET SS\n        \n            \n        \n291-----.305*.991*\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ha-seong Kim\n                    \n            \n            \n            ATL 2B\n        \n            \n        \n3292.16.234.649\n    \n    \n                                            \n            \n                Colt Emerson\n            \n            \n            SEA SS\n        \n            \n        \n409-----.285*.842*\n    \n    \n                                            \n            \n                Jett Williams\n            \n            \n            MIL SS\n        \n            \n        \n----------.261*.828**minor-league stats  I said there were a handful of shortstops beyond the top 15 with the upside to be satisfactory starters in Fantasy. I already covered one in Jacob Wilson. The other two I had in mind were Xavier Edwards and Colson Montgomery, who are both treated more as specialists in a 5x5 context, with Edwards providing stolen bases and Montgomery providing home runs. That may be the most likely outcome for each, but we have seen more from them in the past. Edwards was about twice as prolific on the base paths as a rookie two years ago while also delivering an elite batting average. Montgomery wasn't just a pretty good source of power as a rookie last year but homered 21 times in 71 games, which prorates to 48 over 162. Edwards is at least recognized as having a high floor (albeit one better suited for second base, perhaps), but Montgomery's 29 percent strikeout rate makes him a bottom-out case in the minds of many. Fair enough, but at Pick 176, the reward probably outweighs the risk.  Most of this group is comprised of the many prospects who've been floated as opening day possibilities, with Konnor Griffin, JJ Wetherholt, Kevin McGonigle, Colt Emerson and Jett Williams being among them. Wetherholt deserves special distinction because I don't see how the Cardinals deny him a job after trading away both Nolan Arenado and Brendan Donovan this offseason. He deserved to be up last September, actually. If you're wondering why he'd replace Arenado or Donovan when neither was playing shortstop for the Cardinals, then that makes now a good time to tell you that a lot of these shortstop prospects won't actually end up being shortstops in the majors, with the most common transition being to second or third base. For what it's worth, Griffin, the No. 1 overall prospect, will leapfrog Wetherholt for top priority if it becomes clear he has a job for the Pirates. ADP already puts him there.  I don't have much interest in Ezequiel Tovar, Carlos Correa or Masyn Winn at this point, but others would disagree. Tovar could be a cheap source of power, I guess, but the overall production would be pretty hollow. Ha-seong Kim makes for a fine stash in deeper leagues as a guy who could perform at a 15-homer, 30-steal pace when he returns from a broken finger in May.  \nThe Base-Stealers  \t \t  2026 ADP2025 SB2026 hopeAlso eligible\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Bobby Witt\n                    \n            \n            \n            KC SS\n        \n            \n        \n33830-40-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Elly De La Cruz\n                    \n            \n            \n            CIN SS\n        \n            \n        \n93740-50-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Francisco Lindor\n                    \n            \n            \n            NYM SS\n        \n            \n        \n163125-30-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Gunnar Henderson\n                    \n            \n            \n            BAL 3B\n        \n            \n        \n183025-30-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Trea Turner\n                    \n            \n            \n            PHI SS\n        \n            \n        \n273630-40-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Zachary Neto\n                    \n            \n            \n            LAA SS\n        \n            \n        \n332630-40-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Mookie Betts\n                    \n            \n            \n            LAD RF\n        \n            \n        \n41810-15-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Geraldo Perdomo\n                    \n            \n            \n            ARI SS\n        \n            \n        \n622720-25-----\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                C.J.

Mookie Betts and Willy Adames contribute only a modest total while Jacob Wilson, Colson Montgomery and Carlos Correa are good for effectively zero.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire on Dec. 1, the MLB Players Association is suddenly looking for a new executive director. Tony Clark, the union's leader since 2013, resigned Tuesday after an internal investigation reportedly revealed he had been having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been hired by the union in 2023.Bruce Meyer, the union's deputy director and lead negotiator, remains with the MLBPA. CBA negotiations typically begin in the spring and really heat up around Opening Day. It is unclear who could replace Clark, though the union will want a new executive director in place soon. Clark's replacement must of course be voted on and approved by the players. Subcommittee member Brent Suter told The Athletic that there will be an interim leader to \"keep everything as stable as we can this year.\"The timing of Clark's resignation is definitely not great. CBA negotiations are always contentious and that will again be the case come December. The 2022-23 lockout lasted a record 99 days and commissioner Rob Manfred has made it pretty clear another lockout is coming. \"In a bizarre way, it's actually a positive,\" Manfred said last year about a lockout.Clark, 53, joined the union in 2010 and was unanimously approved as executive director following Michael Weiner's death in December 2013. He oversaw two CBA negotiations and had three years to prepare for his first negotiation in 2016. His replacement will not have that luxury. The next executive director will jump right into CBA talks.\nHere are six major issues Clark's eventual replacement will have to tackle once CBA talks begin with MLB.Salary capLong story short, CBA negotiations are about money. Everything else is secondary. There is a giant pile of money and the two sides haggle because they each want a bigger piece. MLB has done a good job selling a salary cap as necessary to improve competitive balance, but make no mistake, it is about money. Above all, a salary cap restricts player salaries and boosts franchise values.MLB has pursued a salary cap since the 1880s. They seek one every CBA negotiation. The question this time is how dug in are the 30 owners? They could see Clark's abrupt resignation as a moment of weakness for the union, and push harder for a salary cap than ever. (Remember, very few current owners were around to experience how much the 1994-95 strike damaged the game.)\nThe union has resisted a salary cap -- MLB is the only non-capped league in North America -- and figures to do so again this CBA negotiation. It is easy to be a doomer about these things and expect games to be missed in 2027, and maybe they will be, but it is way too early to say that for certain. MLB's national television deals are up in 2028. Losing games would be terrible for business.Also, a salary cap is not a simple yes or no item. Even if the MLBPA relents and agrees to a salary cap, the two sides have to agree on how the whole thing would work. What counts as baseball-related revenue and what percentage do the players receive? What's the cap? What's the floor? How do you implement it? The yes/no is the easy part. Figuring out the system is the real fight.Revenue sharingWith or without a salary cap, the revenue sharing system is likely to be adjusted in the next CBA. Currently, every team puts 48% of its local revenue (local television deal, tickets, concessions, etc.) into the pot, then each team takes out an equal 1/30th share. Big-market teams pay more into revenue sharing than they take out. Small-market teams take out more than they pay in.\nBaseball has always had a revenue disparity problem but it has never been this extreme. Between payroll and competitive balance tax, the Dodgers fielded a $516 million roster in 2025, or more than the bottom five payroll teams combined. Adjusting the revenue sharing program will pit the owners against each other. After that, they have to take it to the MLBPA and get the union's approval too.ArbitrationMLB has sought to eliminate the arbitration process and replace it with a pay-for-play formula, where player salary is determined strictly by their performance. Tarik Skubal's recent record $32 million arbitration win is likely to ramp up those efforts. Arbitration is a key item for the MLBPA. They're against anything that takes away a player's ability to negotiate his salary. They'll fight to keep arbitration.Postseason expansionThe postseason only grows larger -- it never shrinks -- and playoff expansion has really ramped up in recent years. Here are how many teams qualified for the postseason throughout baseball history (ignoring the 2020 pandemic season):\n1903-68: 2 teams (World Series only)1969-93: 4 teams (Championship Series added)1994-2011: 8 teams (Division Series added)2012-21: 10 teams (Wild Card Game added)2022-present: 12 teams (Wild Card Series added)MLB pushed for a 14-team postseason field during the last CBA negotiation and the MLBPA held the line at 12 teams. That gives the union a negotiating chip this time around. The players want playoff expansion too. It means more players get a chance at a World Series and (more importantly) there's more postseason revenue to go around. They will use it as a bargaining chip though.I have no idea what the next CBA will bring (no one does right now), but I am more confident in it bringing a 14-team postseason field than I am anything else.International draftAmateur players in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico are subject to the draft every summer. Amateur players everywhere else in the world are free agents who can sign with any team. Once upon a time, teams could pay international free agents whatever they wanted. Nowadays it is still a free agent system, though there is a hard cap on spending in place each summer.\nDuring the last CBA negotiation, MLB offered to eliminate the qualifying offer system in exchange for an international draft. The MLBPA said no. MLB will try again for an international draft because it will keep costs down. The union could use it as a bargaining chip -- \"We'll give you an international draft for this, this, and that\" -- though they have opposed an international draft to date.ExpansionMLB is in the middle of its longest expansion drought since the league first expanded in 1961. Manfred has said he wants to put the wheels in motion for expansion before he retires in January 2029. That does not mean there will be 32 teams for the 2029 season. It just means Manfred wants the process to begin. Soliciting expansion bids, reviewing proposals, that kind of thing.The union will surely be on board with expansion because it means more roster spots and more jobs. I'm not sure baseball is ready for expansion (there's barely enough pitching for 30 teams as it is), but it's coming either way. Expansion is unlikely to be a sticking point during CBA talks. It's just something that has to get put on the table and agreed to along the way.\n            ",

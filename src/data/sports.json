    "body": "\n        MACtion has been a fixture in college football since 1999, and there are two Mid-American Conference matchups to kick off the Week 11 college football schedule on Tuesday.

It's a place where Copenhagen have already fallen, but for Blues boss Enzo Maresca, the challenge of managing extensive travel with the demands of the Premier League can also present an opportunity for younger players in the squad.The Blues were able to capitalize on that last season in the Conference League, but with the uptick in competition, Maresca has had to stick to his core squad in Champions League play. While Qarabag aren't a team that he can overlook, it should be a time where the Blues can rotate while still securing all three points.How to watch Chelsea vs. Qarabag, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 5 | Time: 12:45 p.m. ETLocation: Tofig Bahramov Republican Stadium -- Baku, AzerbaijanLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Qarabag +800; Draw +440; Chelsea -310Chelsea's strikers got off to a hot start to the season, but without Cole Palmer, the attack has cooled off.

Guiu almost wasn't with the team this season as he was loaned to Sunderland, but he was recalled when Nicolas Jackson was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day in Sept. This match could be a chance for one of them to start and show Maresca why they should be in the squad regularly. Liam Delap had a strong Club World Cup, but he's still sidelined with a hamstring injury. Both George and Guiu were given limited minutes last season, but they're already pushing for more as the Blues look to get back into the Champions League places in the Premier League. Based on production, George should be slightly ahead of Guiu in who would get the start on Wednesday, but both are giving Maresca good problems.\nChelsea's search for a nine has been an agonizing one since Diego Costa was terrorizing defenses at Stamford Bridge, but the Blues may just have their strikers of the future on the roster if George and Guiu can use limited minutes to their advantage.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Wednesday, Erling Haaland and Manchester City will host his former team, Borussia Dortmund, looking to charge up the table in the Champions League league phase. City have been susceptible away from home, losing two of their last five matches, but their home has still been a fortress. Dortmund will be a strong challenger with their attacking ability, but they'd need to break a run of six matches so far this season at home for City without a loss. Haaland has been in unreal form this season with goals in every appearance for the club but two, leading to a total of 17 goals in only 13 appearances, and in City's last four home matches, they've won by a total of 12 goals to only one. Dortmund and City have met six times in Champions League play, with Dortmund only winning one, while two matches ended in a draw, and City won three. How to watch Manchester City vs. Borussia Dortmund, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 5 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Manchester City -230; Draw +390; Dortmund +550We're a far way off the previous inevitability that City used to carry themselves with, but winning against opposition of Dortmund's caliber will go a long way to getting back to where they want to be. Dortmund have scored four goals in three consecutive Champions League matches and can become the first team ever to score that many in four straight if they can run up the score on City.\nWhere concern comes in is that Dortmund only won two of these matches because they allowed four goals facing Juventus for that to end in a draw. Given Haaland's form, that kind of defending won't lead to a fun day away from home. But if Dortmund can figure out how to stop Haaland, that's where things could get interesting. After the Norwegian, no one on the team has scored more than two goals this season. Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku, and Rayan Cherki all have scored two goals, and then there are six players who have scored one goal. When City signed players like Omar Marmoush to improve the attack, they still haven't been able to figure out who the secondary attacker is on the squad. \nIt's been an issue since Julian Alvarez left for Atletico Madrid, and it's one that if City can't solve it soon, they won't be able to win this competition with teams like Bayern Munich getting better by the day. Haaland's form has been great and he has done a good job getting them to this point, but much more is needed before City can rise the ranks of the contenders. Facing a team that has gone deep in Champions League play multiple times in recent seasons, this will be a good chance to take a step in the right direction. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The AL champion Toronto Blue Jays have one fewer item on their offseason to-do list. Right-hander Shane Bieber will exercise his $16 million player option and stay with the club for 2026, reports the New York Post. Bieber would have received a $4 million buyout had he declined the player option, so it was a $12 million decision. Getting Bieber back on the player option is a very good outcome for Toronto. It's an affordable salary, it's a short-term commitment, and it's reasonable to believe he will be more effective as he gets further away from elbow reconstruction. The Blue Jays don't need Bieber to be an ace or even a No. 2 starter. He's more than qualified to be a No. 3, and has a chance to be even more.Our R.J. Anderson ranked Bieber as the 13th-best free agent available this offseason. Now he's off the market. Here's the write-up: Bieber returned from Tommy John surgery late in the season,  showcasing a strong handle over an average arsenal. His fastball did  clock in hotter than it has since 2021, and his slider at times flashed  above-average quality. The most interesting development here, though,  concerned a freshly minted kick-changeup that graded better than its  results. Bieber ought to find success for as long as he can locate, but  he's more of a mid-rotation starter than a frontline type. \tBieber, 30, joined Toronto in a deadline trade with the Cleveland Guardians. He was rehabbing from Tommy John surgery at the time. Bieber made seven regular season starts with the Blue Jays, pitching to a 3.57 ERA with 37 strikeouts in 40 ⅓ innings. He had a 3.86 ERA in 18 ⅔ postseasons inning during Toronto's run to the American League pennant. \nIn Game 7 of the World Series, Bieber came out of the bullpen and surrendered Will Smith's game-winning 11th inning solo homer. It was his first relief appearance since 2019. Veteran righties Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer, who combined to make 48 starts in 2025, are free agents this offseason. Bieber picking up his player option means the Blue Jays have one less rotation spot to worry about. With an entire offseason to go, Toronto's 2026 rotation depth chart currently looks like this: RHP Kevin GausmanRHP Trey YesavageRHP Shane BieberRHP José Berríos (missed the postseason with an elbow injury)LHP Eric LauerRHP Bowden Francis (did not pitch after June 14 due to shoulder injury)LHP Easton LucasThe Blue Jays have not provided an update on Berríos, who made at least 30 starts every year from 2022-25, since he was shut down for the postseason in September. Even if his injury will not cut into his availability next year, it would make sense for Toronto to pursue a starting pitcher this winter. If Berríos will miss the start of 2026, another starter will be imperative. \nIn addition to addressing the rotation, the Blue Jays will have to either re-sign or replace shortstop Bo Bichette, our third ranked free agent. Bullpen help figures to be a priority as well. Toronto went 94-68 this season and was the AL's No. 1 seed. They lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven thrilling games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Royals are keeping their captain around another two years. The Royals have signed catcher Salvador Perez to a two-year contract extension through the 2027 season, the team announced Tuesday. The deal is worth $25 million and includes some deferrals, per MLB.com. The extension replaces Perez's $13.5 million club option for 2026. \"Salvy  is a Royals legend and one of the most important players this franchise  has ever had,\" GM J.J. Picollo said in a statement.  \"We had the option for next year, but everyone knew we wanted  to make sure his legacy with us continued longer than that. We  appreciate Salvy's commitment to the Royals, and we're just as excited  as our fans.\" \nNow 35, had another productive season in 2025, slashing .236/.284/.446 with 30 home runs in 641 plate appearances. The on-base percentage is an eyesore, though Perez has never been a big on-base player, and the overall production is very good for someone who spends most of his time behind the plate. His catcher defense is passable more than an asset at this point. Perez should pass Hall of Famer George Brett for the most home runs in Royals history sometime in 2026. He has 303 and Brett retired with 317. No other Royal has hit even 200 homers. Also, Perez could become only the third player in team history to appear in 2,000 games. He's at 1,707 games. Only Brett (2,707) and Frank White (2,324) on the franchise leaderboard.\nThe two-year extension ensures the Royals will keep Perez alongside Bobby Witt Jr., All-Star third baseman Maikel Garcia, and ace Cole Ragans through 2027, which will be prime contention years for a Kansas City team that went to the postseason in 2024. The AL Central is winnable and it would more difficult to win the division without Perez than with him. That all said, Perez's new contract does great some questions about his future defensive home, and also the team's bevy of catcher prospects. Here are a few things Kansas City must now sort out with Perez locked up through 2027.  Where will Perez play? Since 2000, only seven players have caught 170 games during their age 36-37 seasons, and only one has done it since 2009: A.J. Pierzynski (195 games from 2013-14). Even with the one-knee catching stance reducing wear and tear, catcher is usually a young player's position. It is no surprise then that the Royals have cut back on Perez's catching workload the last few years. \nHere is the breakdown of Perez's starts by position since the shortened pandemic season in 2020:  CatcherFirst baseDH2021 \t\t\t\t75% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\t2022 \t\t\t\t65% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t35% \t\t\t\t2023 \t\t\t\t64% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t21% \t\t\t\t2024 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t28% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t2025 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t18% \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\tThe trend is clear. Fewer starts at catcher, more at first base and DH. Expect that to continue these next two years, perhaps to the point where Perez starts fewer than half his games behind the plate come 2027. Less time at catcher will put a bit more pressure on Perez's bat, though his power plays at any position, plus he brings off-the-charts intangibles and leadership. Something along the lines of 50% starts at catcher with 25% at first base and 25% at DH seems reasonable enough. That would still give Vinnie Pasquantino most of the playing time at first base. Perez will still catch a lot. That much is clear. He's just unlikely to carry the enormous workloads he had earlier in his career. It's time to scale back in an effort to keep him healthy and productive. What about those catcher prospects? One of them, Carter Jensen, made his MLB debut in September and impressed, hitting .300/.391/.550 with three home runs in 20 games. In those 20 games Carter split his workload evenly: 10 games at catcher and 10 at DH. The 22-year-old is Kansas City's top prospect, per MLB Pipeline, and a big part of their future. He and Perez will again share catcher/DH time in 2026. Jensen is not the Royals' only touted catcher prospect, however. Blake Mitchell, their 2023 first-round pick, is a consensus top 100 prospect. Ramon Ramirez is regarded as one of their 10 best prospects as well. He's also a catcher. The Royals have Perez under contract through 2027 plus three well-regarded catcher prospects in the system. How do they handle this? For starters, this is not something the Royals have to figure out right now. Jensen and Perez can coexist on the MLB roster and neither Mitchell nor Ramirez have played a game above Single-A. They're still at least one year away from the big leagues, likely more given the steep development curve for catchers. Perez and Mitchell/Ramirez may never be on the same MLB roster! Also, catchers are always valuable trade chips. If the Royals decide Jensen is their guy long-term, they can use Mitchell and/or Ramirez to get help elsewhere on the roster (outfield, hint hint). Mitchell, Ramirez, and even Jensen are hardly proven commodities. If the Royals find themselves with too many good catchers in a year or two, they should celebrate, not worry. The Royals went 82-80 in 2025 but were better in the second half (35-30) than the first (47-50). With better health and a few new outfielders, Kansas City can return to the postseason in 2026. The hardest part of the building the roster is done. They have their foundation in Garcia, Pasquantino, Perez, Ragans, and Witt. Now they just have to upgrade the supporting cast. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been less than a week since Luciano Spalletti was appointed as the new Juventus head coach, replacing Igor Tudor and becoming the club's third managerial change since the summer of 2024. Since the former Napoli and Italy manager was appointed, Juventus won 2-1 against Cremonese over the weekend away and then drew 1-1 at the Allianz Stadium in Turin against Sporting CP on Tuesday in the Champions League in the first home game of the new coach. In the opening two matches under Spalletti, Juventus scored three goals but also conceded two, marking some defensive issues of the Italian giants that are still looking to improve under the new manager, who didn't have much time to fix the ongoing problems. However, there was a big and immediate change: a new tactical position of Teun Koopmeiners, who played both matches under Spalletti as a left center back. The Dutch midfielder joined Juventus from Atalanta in the summer of 2024 for around $50 million, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the history of the iconic Italian club. The pressure was really high on him in his first season and he didn't deliver as much as he hoped, scoring only five goals in 44 matches played, while the season before, he scored 15 goals in all competitions under Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, in what was his best season of his career so far. Under Thiago Motta and later Tudor, Koopmeiners was deployed in several midfield roles: as a central midfielder, an attacking midfielder, and occasionally as a second striker behind the main forward. However, none of these positions truly suited his qualities or allowed him to perform at his best.\nWhen Spalletti joined Juventus, he immediately decided to deconstruct his role and started him in both games against Cremonese and Sporting CP as a left center back, a player who can not only defend but also start the attack. It's no coincidence that Koopmeiners was second with the most touches on Tuesday (74) and led the team in passes attempted (63). He had just one touch fewer than Manuel Locatelli (75), showing how equally involved he was in Juventus' build-up play and overall possession. Speaking to Sky Italy after the game, he said he feels confident playing in the new role.\"I feel very comfortable in this position. I'm not the kind of forward who plays with his back to goal, as I've had to do in some other matches and I've told the club that as well. I feel much better in this role. It's the one I also played back in the Netherlands. I like to drive forward with the ball,\" he said. \nKoopmeiners (8) saw plenty of the ball and successfully helped create attacking moments with his ball movement.   \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            As the Dutch midfielder said to Sky Italy, this is not something new for him. In the 154 matches played for AZ Alkmaar in his career before moving to Atalanta in 2021, he played 38 matches as a center back in a similar position of the one he's currently playing at Juventus. It will be interesting to see whether Spalletti decides to keep him in that role, as the coach values defenders who can play out from the back, contribute creatively, and offer an additional source of build-up quality. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Parc des Princes was the scene of a wild one on Tuesday as Bayern Munich won 2-1 over PSG to extend their unbeaten start to of the season to 16 games, all wins. It's a major result for Vincent Kompany's team, and in defeating the defending champions of Europe at their home, it's arguably the biggest win of Kompany's Bayern Munich career.Looking to bring Bayern their first UCL title since 2020, Kompany has his team on the right track in what could be a record-breaking campaign. Harry Kane has been the center of attention with his 22 goals in all competitions, but facing PSG while finishing with 10 men was a moment to showcase the defensive improvement after the addition of Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern didn't make many transfers during the summer, but in the additions of Tah and Luis Diaz, they've been impactful ones.Time will show if this is the season for Bayern to make it back to the top of Europe, but they're on the right track now.Injuries mount for Paris Saint-GermainJust when Luis Enrique's team was getting their midfield back together with Joao Neves making the bench, quickly setbacks were suffered. Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele left the match after only 25 minutes with what seemed like a hamstring injury. Dembele was only making his second start since returning from a thigh injury, which caused him to miss seven matches in all competitions, and now he'll likely be sidelined again. The Frenchman is critical to everything that PSG do, and with Desire Doue also nursing an injury, it leaves the club quite light up top. There was another injury during the match to Achraf Hakimi, who went off after a reckless challenge from Luis Diaz. The severity of Hakimi's injury is unknown, but when he is able to get forward with ease while also defending, it's quite a blow for the Parisians. Speaking of Diaz...\nTwo ends of the spectrum for Luis DiazWith a brace in the first 35 minutes of the match, Luis Diaz showed how much his signing has meant to Bayern's unbeaten start to the season. Capping off a counterattack with speed, Diaz beat Lucas Chevalier for a goal before taking the ball off Marquinhos to put Bayern up 2-0. Near the end of the half, it was his tackle on Hakimi that almost cost Bayern their victory. After a review, his yellow card was upgraded to a red, but Kompany made adjustments to keep his side on the front foot. \nAfter the half, another one of those summer signings, Tom Biischof, entered for Serge Gnabry to keep the pace in the midfield. Kane also had to press more and play as a target man as Bayern did their best to limit PSG while Manuel Neuer did what he could, facing eight shots on target in the second half and only getting beaten by one.A shift for the German giantsAttacking has never been the issue for Bayern, but even under Kompany, defense has been their issue in major matches. After already taking care of Chelsea in Champions League play and now following it up with a victory away to PSG, it's impossible to ignore Bayern's credentials. Of the teams who have played four games in the league phase, only Real Madrid, Tottenham, and Arsenal have allowed fewer goals than Bayern's three. Add that alongside their high powered attack, and it's easy to see how Kompany's men are brushing aside everything in their path. Bayern are now the top scoring team in the league phase alongside PSG after this result. \nMixing in youngsters like Aleksandar Pavlovic and Lennart Karl, Bayern are also improving their depth for the long run, which will help if any injuries crop up going forward. It's easy to forget that Bayern are doing this without Jamal Musiala and already performing as one of the world's best teams. They can take another step forward when he comes back, and that's a scary proposition. \n            ",

Duke went 35-4 last season, sweeping both the ACC regular season and tournament, before bowing out in the Final Four. Texas went 19-16 a year ago and lost in the First Four of March Madness, before replacing Rodney Terry with Sean Miller as head coach.Tipoff is at 8:45 p.m. ET from the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C. Duke has won all three prior matchups between the programs.

Lassina Traore transfers in from Long Beach State, where he was a two-time All-Big West Selection and twice led the conference in rebounds. Also, the Longhorns landed Matas Vokietaitis from FAU, where the Lithuanian was the American Conference Rookie of the Year last season, averaging 10.2 points, 5.4 rebounds and knocking down 67.7% of his field goal attempts.Perhaps the biggest addition for Texas is bringing aboard coach Sean Miller, who previously served at Xavier and Arizona. He is a four-time winner of his conference's Coach of the Year award and is known for getting the most out of his players, especially on the offensive end of the court.

That class is highlighted by Cameron Boozer, who is the No. 3 overall recruit and is one of four athletes, ever, to twice win the Gatorade National Player of the Year award in high school. His twin, Cayden Boozer, is the No. 4 point guard in his class, while Duke also landed two other 5-star prospects in Nikolas Khamenia and Dame Sarr.It's not only newcomers on the Duke roster as it returns four rotation players from last year's squad which made it to the Final Four. Jon Scheyer's team covered 67.7% of its games a year ago, and the Blue Devils have also covered in two-thirds of their games versus non-conference opponents since 2023.

    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Pelicans expected to take a step forward in the 2025-26 season, as evidenced by trading their unprotected 2026 draft pick to the Atlants Hawks so they could select Derik Queen with the No. 10 pick in June. Two weeks into the season, nothing has gone according to plan for the Pelicans, who are one of the last two winless teams in the NBA at 0-6. Adding to the dreadful vibes of a winless start is Tuesday's news that Zion Williamson will miss at least 7-10 days with a Grade 1 hamstring strain. Given Williamson's injury history, there's plenty of concern that a hamstring strain could linger or get aggravated again later, creating additional stress for Pelicans fans. New Orleans' 0-6 start has featured three losses by 30-plus points, resulting in the league's worst net rating at a staggering -18.3. That performance has led to rumblings that coach Willie Green has lost the locker room and his seat gets hotter with each loss. Losing Williamson -- the team's leader in points, rebounds, assists and blocks per game -- won't add much optimism that they'll suddenly turn things around. \n\n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Pelicans are a disaster, Ja Morant can't shoot, why Warriors struggle without Draymond\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy Zion Williamson is so important to PelicansWilliamson is the most important player on a New Orleans roster that has plenty of issues, namely a frontcourt that was already thin on size and heavily reliant on Wililamson. Kevon Looney made his debut in a blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, providing some help for Yves Missi and Queen, but both of the Pelicans' young centers are light on size (especially Queen). Given their lack of bulk in the paint, it comes as little surprise New Orleans has been one of the league's worst rebounding teams and ranks last in defensive rating. Without Williamson, Green will likely have to see what Queen can do in extended minutes. The rookie has only played 17.5 minutes per game in the first six contests off the bench, but his ability to score is something none of their other frontcourt options provide. Elsewhere, the Pelicans will need Trey Murphy III to shake out of his early slump to play like a star-level talent and Jordan Poole figures to take on an even bigger role in the offense. \nHow long could Pelicans' winless streak last?None of that provides an awful lot of encouragement and with Williamson missing at least the next four games, if not more, it's fair to wonder when the Pelicans' first win will arrive. Tuesday night figures to be their best chance against a Charlotte Hornets team that will be without LaMelo Ball (ankle) and Brandon Miller (shoulder). But with Williamson now absent, New Orleans is only a short favorite (-2.5 at FanDuel). If they don't win against the Hornets, a three-game road trip awaits before Zion could potentially return. 11/4: vs. Hornets 11/5: at Dallas Mavericks11/8: at San Antonio Spurs11/10: at Phoenix Suns11/12: vs. Portland Trail BlazersIf they cannot win one of those five games, with Dallas, Phoenix and Portland all looking beatable in the early going this season, then the Pelicans' losing streak could stretch on for a very long time even once Williamson returns. The rest of their November schedule is pretty brutal and filled with West contenders. Their most winnable games the rest of the month will be against Atlanta, Dallas (again) and the Memphis Grizzlies. \nIf they somehow can't get any of those games, Dec. 6 against the league's other winless squad, the Brooklyn Nets, could be a titanic battle of basketball inferiority. The key difference being the Nets are actively tanking after trading to get their draft picks back, while the Pelicans are trying their hardest to win because they have no incentive to lose with their pick belonging to the Hawks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Arizona Cardinals will turn to Jacoby Brissett at quarterback this Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, as Kyler Murray continues to recover from a foot injury suffered in Week 5, coach Jonathan Gannon said Tuesday. Brissett has started the last three games, leading the team to a 27-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys Monday night, completing 67.7% of his passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for another score.The Cardinals now have Brissett leading the offense on a short week as they travel to Seattle to face a 6-2 Seahawks team coming off a blowout road win over the Washington Commanders. Murray could be out longer than originally anticipated. Multiple doctors have advised that Murray's foot injury could require 4-8 weeks to fully heal, according to ESPN. \"He's doing well,\" Gannon said of Murray. \"He wants to be out there. He's a competitor. I talked to him today. He's a good teammate and he's working to get healthy.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray hasn't played since Oct. 5. He was limited in practice last week before the team announced on Saturday that Brissett would start. Gannon said last week that Murray could have a role in the Dallas game, but he was later ruled inactive.\nBrissett has performed well in Murray's absence, throwing for 320 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in a narrow Week 6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, followed by a 279-yard, two-touchdown effort in Week 7 against the Green Bay Packers.Brissett became the second player in Cardinals franchise history to pass for 250 yards, two touchdowns and rush for a touchdown on \"Monday Night Football,\" joining Jim Hart in 1974, according to CBS Sports Research. He has played well enough to spark a quarterback controversy.Following the win in Dallas, reporters asked Gannon if Murray was still his starting quarterback when he returns. \n\"Yeah, nothing's changed on that,\" Gannon said. \"That's how I feel.\" Reporters followed up by questioning if Brissett did well enough to earn deeper opportunity.\"I got nothing to add on that, guys,\" Gannon said.For now, the team will move forward with Brissett, the journeyman backup whose stats compare favorably to Murray, the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft.Comparing Jacoby Brissett, Kyler MurrayKyler MurrayJacoby BrissettYards per attempt6.07.7Total TDs77Turnovers42Passer rating88.6102.5The Cardinals' weaponry has benefitted from the change under center.

    "body": "\n        When the Red River Rivalry game ended at the Cotton Bowl on Oct. 11, both Texas and Oklahoma's seasons seemed to be in major trouble. The Longhorns already had two losses under their belt in matchups against Ohio State and Florida. Overtime wins over SEC bottom-feeders Kentucky and Mississippi State only added to the frustration. Oklahoma lost to Texas and dropped at home against Ole Miss two weeks later as the offense grinded to a halt. But in the expanded College Football Playoff, teams can shake off a bad stretch and rise back into the mix. On Tuesday, the first College Football Playoff Rankings featured Texas at No. 11 and Oklahoma at No. 12. If the season ended today, the pair would be the first two teams outside of the postseason field. And with big matchups ahead, the Longhorns and Sooners suddenly find themselves in prime position to crash the CFP.  Texas was able to get back onto radars after jumping all over Vanderbilt, the No. 16 team in the CFP Rankings. The Longhorns took a 21-point lead in the second quarter before parking the bus and letting the Commodores fight back into a 34-31 win. Still, the game was never in doubt as the Longhorns looked the part of the preseason No. 1 team that they once were. \nOklahoma had a signature moment of its own, traveling to play now-No. 25 Tennessee at Neyland Stadium in a night game. Despite going down early, a defensive touchdown and three 50+ yard field goals by Tate Sandell were enough to outlast the Vols in a tight 33-27 performance. It was the first time the Sooners scored 30 points against a Power Four opponent this season. If those results flipped, it would be Tennessee and Vanderbilt on the edge of the playoff. But that's how quickly fortunes can change in the SEC. Suddenly, once overlooked Texas and Oklahoma are sitting in prime spoiler territory in the College Football Playoff bracket. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Texas returns to College Football Playoff contention, Miami's hopes fading down stretch\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGranted, the remaining paths are exceedingly difficult. Texas has matchups against No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 5 Georgia. Oklahoma goes on the road to play No. 4 Alabama before finishing with No. 22 Missouri and LSU at home. \nHowever, the schedule cuts both ways. Notre Dame ranks just ahead of the pair at 6-2 but has only one win against a ranked opponent (No. 19 USC). There's nothing more the Irish can do to build their resume. A 10-2 Texas or Oklahoma should easily cruise past them into the field. And that doesn't even count potential losses up the board. No. 6 Ole Miss and No. 8 Texas Tech likely couldn't withstand a loss and stay ahead. The same is true for No. 9 Oregon, which has two games remaining against ranked opponents. Beating Alabama or Georgia would throw the entire SEC playoff race out of whack. But, more than anything, the placement of the Red River rivals emphasizes the message of this College Football Playoff era: Survive and advance. Beauty points are no longer necessary in the SEC, where Texas and Oklahoma have 11 combined games against CFP-ranked opponents. Only wins matter. \nBoth programs now control their own destiny. Take care of business and the postseason is within sight. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State opening at No. 1 ahead of Indiana. Just over a month remains until the final College Football Playoff bracket is selected, so OSU will need to hold off not only the Hoosiers but the rest of the top 25 if it aims to retain the top seed in the postseason.Off to a dominant start this year with wins over Texas and Illinois, the reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024).Eight of the 11 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff, an effort now made easier with the expanded 12-team field being contested for a second season.Ohio State is in a strong position to go wire to wire, standing 8-0 (5-0 Big Ten) with only one game remaining against a ranked opponent, its regular-season finale at Michigan. It will be going toe to toe atop the Big Ten with undefeated Indiana, a team whose final three opponents are a combined 7-18 on the season, 0-16 in Big Ten play.\nTexas A&M, Alabama and Georgia round out the rest of the top five.There was not a Group of Five program ranked in Tuesday's release. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, the CFP Selection Committee would choose a team to take the final bid should one not otherwise be listed in the final CFP Rankings. Memphis of the American presently holds that position, according to the committee.    College Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 4~ First-round bye | Only 11 teams in the rankings below would make the projected playoff as a Group of Five team -- the fifth automatic bid as a conference champion (Memphis) -- is not listed.Ohio State (8-0) ~Indiana (9-0) ~Texas A&M (8-0) ~Alabama (7-1) ~Georgia (7-1)Ole Miss (8-1)BYU (8-0)Texas Tech (8-1)Oregon (7-1)Notre Dame (6-2)Texas (7-2)Oklahoma (7-2)Utah (7-2)Virginia (8-1) -- No. 11 seedLouisville (7-1)Vanderbilt (7-2)Georgia Tech (8-1)Miami (FL) (6-2)USC (6-2)Iowa (6-2)Michigan (7-2)Missouri (6-2)Washington (6-2)Pittsburgh (7-2)Tennessee (6-3)\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Red River rivals Texas, Oklahoma sit in prime spoiler territory\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnalysis by bowl expert Brad CrawfordNew metrics at workThe selection committee made it clear Tuesday that they're placing greater emphasis on wins over quality opponents this season while minimizing the reward for beating teams with sub-.500 records. This is the goal of the playoff's new \"record strength\" metric, which is designed to go beyond overall records and provide deeper reasoning for where teams are slotted and why. Essentially, record strength is how well an average top 25 team plays against their schedule compared to others. No arguments here for the teams in the Nos. 1 and 2 spots -- Ohio State and Indiana. Based on eye test, both of those teams look like college football's two titans through Week 10.\nDrama brewing in ACC?Surprise, surprise in the ACC. No. 14 Virginia (8-1) and No. 15 Louisville (7-1) being ranked ahead of Georgia Tech (8-1) and Miami (6-2) was stunning given the Hurricanes' handful of notable, early season wins. Neither the Yellow Jackets nor Hurricanes are viewed as two of college football's elite in the eyes of the selection committee, at least not at the moment. That will change if Georgia Tech wins out and takes a rivalry weekend matchup with Georgia, but for now, Saturday's loss to NC State clearly damaged their stock in this first poll. No team Georgia Tech has beaten this season is ranked, and the only wins against FBS teams with winning records have come against Temple, Wake Forest and Duke. Miami fumbles early leg upSelection committee protocol states \"when circumstances at the margins indicate that teams are comparable,\" then head-to-head is part of the criteria that must be taken into consideration. However, it's obvious No. 18 Miami is not viewed on the same pedestal as 10th-ranked Notre Dame despite beating the Fighting Irish in the season opener, which eliminates that head-to-head notion. If Notre Dame wins out, that means the Fighting Irish would be riding a 10-game winning streak into the postseason with added quality victories against Navy and Pitt in November. Miami has opportunities to beat a pair of quality teams as well, the nationally ranked Panthers included, but it's not going to matter for the Hurricanes with three ACC teams ahead of them. When teams are comparable, strength of schedule and comparative outcomes of common opponents are two factors to watch during final deliberations. Unfortunately for Miami, this selection committee has already KO'd Mario Cristobal's team.Texas A&M in a good spotIn the SEC, the selection committee appreciates unblemished Texas A&M. The Aggies' strength of schedule is outside the top 10, while the overall toughness of Alabama's slate sits at No. 4. The Aggies have three wins over teams with winning records -- Notre Dame, LSU and Mississippi State -- while the Crimson Tide have four. Texas A&M's not in danger of falling behind Alabama in these CFP Rankings should both teams win out and meet in Atlanta for the SEC championship given what's left for the Aggies -- two games against ranked teams along with South Carolina and Samford.\nRemember the committee's subjective factorWhat goes on behind the scenes with the process is not public, only the rankings, along with a few details here and there from playoff chair Mack Rhoades during weekly television appearances justifying the poll. This might explain why one-loss Oregon is ranked No. 9 and behind fellow one-loss teams Ole Miss, Texas Tech and others. Oregon has only one win over an opponent with a winning record (Northwestern). Then-No. 3 Penn State tanked after losing to Oregon in double-overtime at home, but that victory has lost most -- if not all -- of its luster. To the Ducks' credit, they do sit fourth in game control and eighth in strength of record, meaning they've taken care of business as expected outside of the loss to Indiana on Oct. 11.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU had an eventful week that thrust the athletic department into chaos. But after a week of turmoil, the new power structure at the school has begun to clarify. Back-to-back losses led to the firing of football coach Brian Kelly, which was followed by an attention-grabbing press conference from governor Jeff Landry insisting athletic director Scott Woodward would not be involved in the hire of Kelly's replacement. Woodward was then fired later in the week. All the while, LSU was still without a university president. This week, Wade Rousse left McNeese State to become LSU's new president and his first order of business was to elevate interim athletic director Verge Ausberry to the full-time position, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Ausberry played linebacker at LSU and has spent the past 24 years in the athletic department, including the last six as the executive deputy athletic director. His hire doesn't come without some controversy, as he was suspended back in 2021 for his role in improperly handling complaints of physical and sexual abuse levied against LSU athletes. \n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLandry's brash, boastful press conference in which he went after Woodward and Jimmy Sexton, the most powerful coaching agent in the business, made many wonder if the LSU job would be all that desirable to coaches given the apparent power vacuum at the school that the governor seemed more than happy to fill. A week later, with Rousse now in place as president, LSU seems determined to show some stability and order to tamp down those concerns about who was in charge of what in Baton Rouge -- something Ausberry alluded to in an interview with 104.5 ESPN in Baton Rouge on Tuesday. \n\"That alignment means a lot,\" Ausberry said. \"And if you don't have leadership, you have a void there, it really, really hurts you out there going out in the market. People want to know who they report to and who they answer to. That's very, very important in our system.\"Verge Ausberry lays out vision for LSU coaching searchAusberry's decades in Baton Rouge give him plenty of sway with other powerful figures at the school and plenty of support within the football program, which he's worked most closely with in his time in the athletic department. By moving quickly to get the school and athletic department's leadership vacancies filled, LSU can now begin crafting its plan for bringing in a new football coach who will come in knowing exactly what the expectations are in Baton Rouge. Making the College Football Playoff is a must and championships are the expectation. \n\"We're going to hire the best football coach there is,\" Ausberry said last Friday. \"That's our job. We are not going to let this program fail. LSU has to be in the playoffs every year in football. There's 12 teams that make it. It's going to expand here. We have to be one of those teams at LSU. No substitute.\"To get there, Ausberry laid out his vision of how the Tigers can get back to that place, noting its his job as AD (at the time interim, but now full-time) to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support the coach so he has everything needed at his disposal to win.\"We have to make sure we have the right mechanisms in place to help that new coach, no matter who that new coach is,\" Ausberry said. \"I think the days of seeing a coach win five, six national championships, that's not going to be the same, especially with the rev sharing. We just have to make sure what we're doing here and what we have in place and the infrastructure that we have here at LSU is good enough to support the coach so that every year. Tonight the College Football Playoff [rankings] come out, so every year we need to be mentioned in that.\"\nAfter the disaster that was the Brian Kelly era, Ausberry seems to be prioritizing fit in this upcoming hiring process. Kelly never felt like a comfortable fit for LSU as a coach who built his résumé in the Midwest moving to the South, where his attempts to fit in always felt forced. \"All of these coaches can coach X's and O's,\" Ausberry said. \"They can draw it up, they can call plays, they can do all of that. But are they the right fit for the institution and are they the right fit at LSU?\"Ausberry added that they'll be looking for a coach with head-coaching experience and confirmed that they would be willing to wait for a coach to finish with the Playoff, even if it means having to go through the early signing date and running up close to the portal window. \nThat indicates LSU will largely be pursuing the biggest names on the market to fulfill those desires. And with Ausberry's interim tag removed, the school will hope to quell any questions or concerns from those candidates about who they will be answering to in the athletic department and above. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU's search for a football coach continues to draw national attention, and intrigue in the job spiked again when one of the school's most prominent alumni indicated former coach Nick Saban could be a candidate. Shaquille O'Neal, the four-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer who played for the Tigers from 1989 to 1992, said he heard LSU may be in talks Saban about a return to Baton Rouge.\"I heard through the grapevine that they were having conversations with Nick Saban,\" O'Neal told Us Weekly. \"That'd be awesome if we can bring Nick back.\"Verge Ausberry, the school's interim athletic director, quickly put that notion to rest.\"Nick Saban and I have a standing conversation probably every two or three weeks,\" Ausberry said on 104.5 ESPN. \"We're good friends, first of all. He's a person I admire a lot. Coach Saban was joking. No way he's coming back to football, okay? Miss Terry's not going to let him. That's not going to happen. Let's get that out of the way soon, because if he was and he was interested, I would drive down there and pick him up right now.\"Saban, 74, led LSU from 2000-04, capturing a national championship before departing for the NFL. He returned to college football in 2007 at Alabama, building one of the most dominant dynasties with six more national titles before retiring in 2023. This past weekend on ESPN's College GameDay, Saban addressed speculation of a potential return to coaching and emphasized that tradition alone does not guarantee success in modern college football.\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"You've got all these external factors that are constantly changing,\" Saban said. \"Whether it's the transfer portal, how much you can pay guys, revenue sharing, what kind of collective do you have? So, traditionally, how have you been able to adapt to that? ... Some of the traditional jobs, like LSU, that people always looked at as one of the best jobs, have they adapted to all these things like they need to to continue to be one of the best jobs in the country?\"\nSaban later clarified that he has no plans to return to coaching.For O'Neal, the focus remains on patience and optimism for LSU's next hire. \"We're just gonna sit and see who they choose,\" he said. \"I know it will definitely be a winner and I know it'll be somebody that's in line with our culture. I know it's somebody who's going to bring us back to winning. We realize if you lose more than two games, we don't get a significant bowl game.\"\nLSU fired Brian Kelly Oct. 26 after a 5-3 start in his fourth season. Kelly finished 34-14, with a single SEC Championship Game appearance, but was unable to get the Tigers to the College Football Playoff to contend for a national title. The decision led to the resignation of athletic director Scott Woodward, who had fallen out of favor with LSU stakeholders, including Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Rashid Shaheed is now a member of the Seahawks, and Jakobi Meyers is now a member of the Jaguars. Those were the two big offensive trades on Tuesday, and Fantasy managers didn't exactly get the moves we wanted.For example, Breece Hall remained with the Jets, who seemingly traded everyone else on the roster. Hall is still worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back for the rest of the season, but his value could have improved if he went to a team like the Chiefs.There also was the potential of Tony Pollard being dealt, and he remained with the Titans. And no tight ends were moved even though there were rumors of potential trades for David Njoku, Chigoziem Okonkwo and Michael Mayer. The Fantasy value for all of those players remains the same for the rest of the year.For Shaheed, his Fantasy value doesn't change much going from the Saints to the Seahawks, and I still consider him a No. 3 receiver in the majority of leagues. He might score more touchdowns in Seattle with a better quarterback in Sam Darnold, and Shaheed is being reunited with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak after the two were together in New Orleans in 2024.\nShaheed scored at least 11.8 PPR points in three of his past five games for the Saints, and his addition is a boost for Darnold. Shaheed shouldn't impact Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top-tier Fantasy receiver, but this trade is crushing for promising rookie Tory Horton.I had Horton as a waiver-wire priority after he scored two touchdowns in Week 9 at Washington. Now, you should only add Horton in deeper leagues as a boom-or-bust No. 4 Fantasy option. Along with that, you can drop Cooper Kupp (hamstring) in the majority of leagues, especially since he might not play in Week 10 after sitting out in Week 9.For the Saints, Chris Olave gets a slight boost in value with Shaheed gone, and Olave should easily be the No. 1 option in the passing game for the rest of the season. He struggled in Tyler Shough's first start in Week 9 at the Rams with three catches for 57 yards on four targets, but prior to that he scored at least 14 PPR points in three games in a row.\nI also expect Juwan Johnson to benefit with Shaheed gone. Johnson had three catches for 31 yards and a touchdown on four targets against the Rams in Shough's first start, and Johnson has now scored at least 10.3 PPR points in three games in a row. He should be considered a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you can look at Devaughn Vele off the waiver wire, and hopefully he'll see an uptick in playing time with Shaheed gone. Vele only has five catches for 39 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets this season, but he should get more chances now with Shaheed in Seattle.In Jacksonville, Travis Hunter (knee) is on injured reserve and will miss at least three more games, and Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) and Dyami Brown (concussion) could be out in Week 10. The Jaguars needed help, and Meyers will hopefully be a solid short-term and long-term addition.\nHe was having a down season with the Raiders prior to the trade with 33 catches for 352 yards and no touchdowns, and he scored 9.3 PPR points or less in five games in a row. Prior to this season, Meyers had averaged at least 12.9 PPR points per game in three years in a row, including a career-best 14.5 PPR points in 2024Meyers could be available in 10-team leagues and is worth adding to see what develops. If Thomas and Brown are out in Week 10 at Houston then Meyers should be a go-to option for Trevor Lawrence, and we can adjust what happens moving forward when everyone is healthy in Jacksonville. Meyers will clearly lose value when Hunter and Thomas are on the field.But even though the Jaguars acquired Meyers, I wouldn't give up adding Parker Washington. He just had eight catches for 90 yards on nine targets at Las Vegas in Week 9, and he now has 19 targets in his past two games. Lawrence will likely continue to lean on Washington, especially if Thomas and Brown are out, and Washington can be a low-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver against the Texans.\nYou can also still stash Brenton Strange, who is eligible to return from injured reserve due to a quadriceps injury in Week 11. When healthy, Strange can be a low-end starter in the majority of leagues.In Las Vegas, Tre Tucker should benefit the most with Meyers gone. He has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in three of his past six games, and he should be the No. 1 receiver and No. 2 pass catcher for the Raiders moving forward behind only Brock Bowers. Tucker should be added in all leagues where available, and he has the potential to be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you should take a flier on rookie Jack Bech, and hopefully he'll get an uptick in playing time with Meyers gone. Bech was selected in Round 2 of the NFL Draft, and he should be part of the youth movement for the Raiders for the rest of the season. Fellow rookie Dont'e Thornton Jr. might benefit as well if you want to take a flier on him also.\nOne other trade to note was Adonai Mitchell being thrown into the Sauce Gardner deal with the Colts and Jets. Mitchell could emerge as the No. 2 receiver for the Jets this season behind Garrett Wilson, and Mitchell is worth adding in deeper leagues, as well as all dynasty formats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFC division leaders with matching 8-3 records will meet in the 2025 NFL Black Friday game as the Philadelphia Eagles host the Chicago Bears. Philly saw its four-game winning streak come to an end in Week 12 as it blew a three-touchdown lead in a 24-21 defeat to Dallas. The Bears have won four in a row and eight of their last nine, most recently knocking off Pittsburgh, 31-28, on Sunday. This is the third Black Friday NFL game and the first to be a non-divisional matchup.Kickoff is at 3 p.m. ET from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The Eagles have won six straight meetings, with the last coming in 2022. Philly is the 7-point favorite in the latest Eagles vs. Bears odds, while the over/under for total points is 43.5. Before making any Bears vs. Eagles picks, be sure to see what NFL expert Adam Silverstein has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:CBS Sports' managing editor, Silverstein is coming off a second straight dominant NFL season.

In the three games since acquiring pass rusher Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline, Philly has allowed just 13.3 points, even though it's faced a pair of top-five scoring offense in Dallas and Detroit. But all of those games were close because the Eagles offense is still stuck in mud, as Philadelphia's averaged only 15.7 points over its last three.The Under is a combined 5-1 for the two teams over their last three games, and Chicago will face its first defensive test in Philly. During Chicago's 8-1 record over its last nine, all nine of its opponents rank in the bottom half of the league in scoring defense. Philly ranks No. 8, so points could be tough to come by for both teams on Friday.Silverstein has also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. You can see what it is at SportsLine, and get your first month at SportsLine for just $1 when you use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP.Who wins Eagles vs. Bears, and which critical X-factor makes one side of the spread a must-back?

On Friday, Bills coach Sean McDermott announced that Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown -- the team's two starting offensive tackles -- will not suit up Sunday. Dawkins is dealing with a concussion, while Brown has a shoulder injury. McDermott said that Dawkins was cleared to return to the Week 12 loss vs. Houston by an independent neurologist, but displayed concussion-like symptoms the next day. Allen's blind-side blocker is a four-time Pro Bowler, and a major reason why the NFL introduced the new Protector of the Year award this season to honor the NFL's best offensive lineman. Dawkins has made 133 career starts for the Bills over nine years. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills bounce back vs. Steelers? Will Shedeur Sanders cover?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown exited the loss in Houston early, and was reportedly seen in a sling after the game. The former third-round pick out of Northern Iowa has spent all five of his NFL seasons in Buffalo, and signed a four-year extension last September. Ryan Van Demark is expected to start at one of the tackle spots. He has started just three times in three years with the Bills. It's unclear who the other starting tackle will be. Alec Anderson is listed as a backup interior offensive linemen that could potentially kick out, while Chase Lundt is listed as Brown's backup on the Bills' official depth chart.The Bills offensive line struggled mightily with Houston's Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. last Thursday night, as Allen was sacked a career-high eight times. Last year, Allen was sacked just 14 times in 17 games. While the Steelers don't have a top-ranked defense like the Texans, Mike Tomlin's unit does get after the quarterback, especially T.J. Watt (seven sacks) and Nick Herbig (6.5). They currently rank fifth in the league in sacks with 34, which is one more than the Texans.\nThe 7-4 Bills' streak of five straight AFC East titles is officially in jeopardy, as they remain 2.5 games back of the New England Patriots in the division. Buffalo, a three-point road favorite in Pittsburgh (per FanDuel) is 1-2 in its past three games after a 6-2 start, and is 2-3 on the road this season. \n            \n    ",

In that game, Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz led a defense that gave up just 17 points while holding 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy to 12 of 27 passing. There's also the Shedeur Sanders factor and the energy surrounding his first home start. Sanders is 1-0 as the Browns' starting quarterback after he helped lead Cleveland to a 24-10 road win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Sanders will try to have similar success on Sunday against a 49ers defense that gave up just nine points during their Week 12 win over the Carolina Panthers. \nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Browns liveWhen: Sunday, Nov. 30 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, Ohio TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -5.5; O/U 36.5 (via FanDuel)49ers vs. Browns: Need to know Sanders has his work cut out for him. Despite some major injuries, the 49ers' defense continues to be one of the NFL's better units under veteran defensive coordinator Robert Saleh. This season, they've allowed under 200 passing yards six times, including during last week's win over the Panthers. The unit has also forced five total turnovers over their past two games. Been here before. This is the 49ers' second game this year against a rookie quarterback. Back in Week 9, they faced the New York Giants' Jaxson Dart, who went 24 of 33 for 191 yards and two touchdowns. Dart, who was only sacked twice against the 49ers, also ran eight times for 56 yards in a score in the Giants' 34-24 loss. Not pretty for Purdy. Last Monday night wasn't one of Purdy's better outings. He threw three interceptions in the first half and finished the game with just 193 yards on 23 of 32 passing. In four games this season, Purdy has thrown nearly as many interceptions (7) as touchdown passes (8). Money ball. While Purdy hasn't been great, the 49ers have been money this season on third down and in the red zone. They are currently second in the NFL on third down and ninth in red zone efficiency. A big reason for that success has been the play of running back Christian McCaffrey, who currently leads the NFL in both carries (217) and receptions (81). Historic pace. Myles Garrett is just five sacks away from breaking the all-time single season record of 22.5 sacks. Garrett, who already has 18 sacks this season, recorded three sacks during last week's win over the Raiders and four against Lamar Jackson during Cleveland's Week 11 loss to Baltimore. He had a career-high five sacks of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye back in Week 8. 49ers vs. Browns prediction, pick \nWhile the Browns are certainly game (especially on defense), it's hard to pick against the 49ers after watching what their defense did to Bryce Young and the Panthers on Monday night. It's safe to assume that Saleh will have a similar plan in place in terms of containing Sanders in his first home start. If they don't beat themselves while allowing Garrett to take over the game, the 49ers should be able to take care of business on the road while staying on the inside track of the NFC playoff picture. Pick: 49ers -5.5; Under 36.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        There's no margin for error the rest of the way for the Kansas City Chiefs, according to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who threw four touchdown passes during Thursday's 31-28 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. At 6-6 overall, the defending AFC champions have a steep mountain to climb to reach the playoffs with five games left in the regular season. The Chiefs haven't missed the postseason since 2014.\"We're going to play a lot of good teams coming up,\" Mahomes said after the loss. \"If we're going to make the playoffs, we're going to have to win them all. That's got to be the mindset when we step into the [team facility] when we get back.\"Every matchup the rest of the way is a playoff-elimination game according to Mahomes, whose team has deteriorated since a 5-3 start. The Chiefs have lost three of the their last four games and dropped to 1-6 this season in one-possession contests.\"You've got to win every game now -- and hope that's enough,\" Mahomes said.\n        \n            \n                NFL Thanksgiving overreactions: Lions playoff hopes dashed?

Kansas City took a 21-20 lead with 14:51 left in the fourth quarter on Mahomes' fourth-down touchdown pass to Rashee Rice, but the Cowboys scored on their next two possessions to push ahead by 10 points.\nMahomes pulled the Chiefs to within three points with 3:27 to play after a scoring toss Hollywood Brown, but Kansas City never got the ball back. \"We can beat anybody, but we've shown that we can lose to anybody,\" Mahomes said after throwing for 261 yards. \"We've got to be more consistent. We've had big plays and we've had runs where we can really score at any time, but we've got to be consistent for four quarters, especially when you play good teams and they have a good offense.\"The Chiefs scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the game before punting on their next four drives prior to Mahomes' touchdown pass to Rice.\nDallas (6-5-1) has won three straight games with Dak Prescott playing at an MVP level. Eight of Prescott's 25 touchdown passes this season have come during this current winning streak for the Cowboys. Dallas is two games back of the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East while the Chiefs fell to ninth in the AFC's playoff discussion, two games back of the final postseason spot.\"They're the same desperation that we are and they play better over four quarters than we did,\" Mahomes said. \"So even though we have good plays here and there, we have be more consistent at the end of the day.\"Chiefs' remaining scheduleOpponentRecordCurrent playoff picturevs. Houston Texans, Dec. 76-5Third in AFC South, wild-card bubblevs. Los Angeles Chargers, Dec. 147-4Second in AFC West; No. 5 seedat Tennessee Titans, Dec. 211-10N/Avs. Denver Broncos, Dec. 259-2First in AFC West; No. 2 seedat Las Vegas Raiders, Jan. 42-9N/AKansas City plays two of the NFL's worst teams over the final three weeks of the regular season, but the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos are sandwiched between those matchups.

The Chargers will be fresh off their bye week, while the Raiders enter this game having lost their last five.The Chargers couldn't generate much offense during a 35-6 loss to the Jaguars earlier this month. Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert finished 10 of 18 for 81 yards and an interception. As a team, the Chargers finished with just 135 yards of total offense, while allowing 345.Las Vegas has lost nine of its last 10 games since a season-opening win over the New England Patriots. The Raiders fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly following a 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns last week. The Raiders' last win came in Week 6 against the Tennessee Titans.Here's how to watch this AFC matchup as well as betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Chargers vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 30 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: SoFi Stadium -- Los AngelesTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers: -9.5, O/U 41.5 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Chargers vs. Raiders: Need to knowIt's a big game for playoff implications. Los Angeles enters the week as the No. 5 seed in the AFC. However, at 7-4, Los Angeles is tied with the Jaguars and Buffalo Bills. Not far behind those teams are the Houston Texans, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Kansas City Chiefs. Heading into Week 13 action, all three of those teams have six wins, but are just outside the playoff picture. The Chargers have a brutal schedule to close out the year, so this is almost a must-win to stay afloat in the playoff picture.Raiders changed offensive coordinators. The Raiders made a splash this offseason by hiring Chip Kelly away from Ohio State to become their offensive coordinator. However, that experiment didn't even last one full season, as the team fired Kelly after another dreadful offensive performance. Las Vegas once again elevated quarterback coach Greg Olson to become the interim offensive coordinator for the remainder of the year. This will be his third stint as the Raiders' offensive coordinator.Omarion Hampton could be close to returning. Earlier this month, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters that Hampton's activation window wouldn't open until after the Week 12 bye. Hampton, a rookie selected in the first round, hasn't played since a 27-10 loss to the Washington Commanders last month. On the season, he has rushed for 314 yards and two touchdowns on 66 attempts. His return to the lineup would be a welcome one as Los Angeles has clearly had difficulties generating offense at times this season.Chargers vs. Raiders pick, prediction\nThe Raiders have been bad on both sides of the football for several weeks. The Chargers are coming off a blowout loss and are getting healthier coming off a bye week. Although changing offensive coordinators could provide a spark for the Raiders, I expect the Chargers to cover in a high-scoring game. Pick: Chargers -9.5, Over 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule has already seen three upsets on Thanksgiving, and features Eagles vs. Bears on Black Friday. There's plenty more to come over the weekend, however. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) doubtful to suit up. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-3) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

Philly has won each of the last six matchups and is a 7-point favorite in this contest. NFL expert Adam Silverstein, who is 40-25-2 (+1260) over his last 67 picks in Eagles games, is backing Philadelphia to cover, saying, \"The Eagles will be fuming off the Cowboys loss and back at home where it has covered three of the last four. The offensive issues are a legitimate concern, but Chicago is not stout enough defensively to stop Jalen Hurts & Co., especially with the team at its peak motivation coming off the terrible Dallas loss.\" See Silverstein's full analysis here.SportsLine's self-learning AI, which has hit more than 2,000 4.5- and 5-star prop picks since the start of the 2023 NFL season, projects Bears WR Rome Odunze to go Under 3.5 receptions (+110).

The Broncos have won eight straight since opening the season 1-2. Six of their past seven wins, however, have been by four or fewer points. The Broncos are 4-3 against the spread in that span, so while they are winning, they haven't been covering with room to spare. Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) has been a limited participant at practice on Wednesday and Thursday. Mike Tierney is on a 15-9 run on picks involving Washington, and he's backing the Broncos (-5.5) to get the cover.\"With the league's 14th-ranked offense, the Broncos should be able to find sufficient points against the No. 31 defense for a cover,\" Tierney told SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and we're working our way through the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find the Black Friday roundup just below. Red Sox eyeing big batsThe Boston Red Sox have already made an early splash this offseason with the recent trade for veteran right-hander Sonny Gray. Now the club may shift its focus to powering up the lineup. Specifically, the New York Post reports that the Sox would like to spend big enough to add not one but two of the following available free agent bats: third baseman Alex Bregman (No. 2 in our 2025-26 free agent rankings and a member of the Sox this past season), DH/OF Kyle Schwarber (No. 5 in our rankings), 1B Pete Alonso (No. 9 in our rankings), and 3B/1B/OF Kazuma Okamoto (No. 22 in our rankings). As well, the report confirms the Sox's interest in veteran catcher and free agent J.T. Realmuto. \n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe big fish from a power standpoint would of course be Schwarber, who's coming off a 56-homer season for the Phillies. Boston, though, may be prioritizing right-handed hitters to balance out a lineup that projects to have an abundance of port-siders in it. Alonso certainly makes for an intriguing fit given the dimensions of Fenway Park, and his addition might herald a trade of incumbent first baseman Triston Casas, who'll be returning from a major knee injury in 2026. The path of least resistance probably includes a reunion with Bregman, who was essential part of Boston's return to the postseason in 2025. Brewers may be primed to cut payrollAs good as the Brewers have been and continue to be on the field, the organization is suffering from ongoing roster disinvestment on the part of owner Mark Attanasio. That may again be the prevailing dynamic heading into 2026, as the Athletic reports that in order to make roster improvements the Milwaukee front office might first be ordered to offload some payroll. Most notably, this may mean that ace Freddy Peralta and his $8 million team option are available in trade. \nNeedless to say, the 29-year-old Peralta, who this past season earned an All-Star selection and finished fifth in the NL Cy Young vote, would be of interest to any number of teams and fetch the Brewers an impressive return going into his walk year. That said, losing their top starting pitcher would also be a blow to the team's hopes in 2026 no matter what they get back. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis recently was No. 2 on the Fanspo NBA trade machine's list of trending players, but I do not recommend trying to come up with realistic deals for him. It is a frustrating exercise, and there's a decent chance it will bum you out. In theory, the situation for Davis -- who is returning to the court Friday night after missing a month with a calf injury -- should be simple: He's turning 33 in March, and the Dallas Mavericks aren't set up to succeed on his timeline. Both sides would be better off with a trade that sends him to a win-now team in exchange for a package of younger players and draft picks.Every expert agrees, though, that the Mavericks can't expect anybody to give up all that much for Davis. It doesn't matter that he was the centerpiece of the Luka Dončić trade less than 10 months ago, and it doesn't matter that he made Second Team All-NBA 17 months ago. \"There's not a lot of teams that are lining up\" to acquire Davis, ESPN's Tim Bontemps said on Monday's episode of the Hoop Collective. In the immediate aftermath of the Nico Harrison firing, The Ringer's Zach Lowe said that the difference between what the Mavs gave up for Davis and what they'll eventually get for him \"will set the world record for the biggest delta in trade returns for one single player in the history of professional sports.\"The big issue is not that Davis arrived at training camp well above his normal playing weight. It's not that he strained his calf a week into the regular season, either. It's his contract.Davis is making $54.1 million this season, is owed $58.5 million next season and has a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28, the season in which he will turn 35. Next August, he'll be eligible to sign an extension that would pay him as much as $275 million over four years and as much as $76 million in 2030-31, the season in which he will turn 38.\nThe first hurdle is finding a team that is mechanically capable of putting a trade package together. That front office not only needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention; it needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention even after taking into account the loss of the players it is trading away. Those players' 2025-26 salaries must total at least $43.1 million, and that team's post-trade payroll cannot exceed the first apron.The second hurdle is finding a team that isn't scared of what it will have to pay Davis down the road. It doesn't necessarily have to be willing to offer him a four-year max extension next summer, but it must be confident that it can extend him on a more team-friendly deal or be comfortable with Davis either hitting free agency in 2027 or picking up his 2027-28 option. Negotiating with future Hall of Famers in their mid-30s can be difficult.And these obstacles are just about one side of the equation. Let's say Davis plays at an All-NBA level for the next few weeks and motivates a few teams to try to trade for him. Will these hypothetical suitors be willing to -- or even have the ability to -- trade multiple first-round picks for him? If not, will the Mavericks be interested in the young players that are on the table? It's easy to say that the Mavs \"should\" trade Davis, but I have yet to see a fake trade involving him that seems both plausible and a no-brainer for them. It is not clear what bar must be cleared for them to find an offer acceptable.\nIf all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially the same story that we've seen with a number of stars under the NBA's latest collective bargaining agreement. There was not a robust trade market for Jimmy Butler, and the Miami Heat ended up accepting a package of Andrew Wiggins, Davion Mitchell, Kyle Anderson, a 2025 first-round pick (that landed at No. 20 and turned into Kasparas Jakučionis) in exchange for Butler, Josh Richardson and two second-round picks. The Phoenix Suns traded Kevin Durant for a fraction of what they'd given up to get him. The trade that ended Brandon Ingram's tenure with the New Orleans Pelicans wasn't strictly a salary dump -- they got a protected first-round pick out of it -- but it felt a lot like a salary dump, didn't it?In Jake Fischer's latest newsletter at The Stein Line, he writes that the Charlotte Hornets aren't interested in moving LaMelo Ball in part because they are \"unlikely to get the sort of offers for Ball they'd be hoping for,\" which he describes as \"somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas.\" He also writes that the Sacramento Kings are \"unlikely to bring back a significant haul\" for Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine or DeMar DeRozan. All of these players are former All-Stars, and it's not as if the whole league has decided they're bad. DeRozan is the only one making less than $38 million this season, though, and, in this landscape, acquiring any of them is complicated.Generally speaking, good teams are not looking for complicated. They don't want to blow up what's working, reorient everything in the middle of the season or set themselves up to be in salary-cap hell a couple of years from now. As trade season approaches -- it unofficially begins on Dec. 15, the day that most players who signed new contracts last summer will be eligible to be traded -- big names like Davis are bound to get the most attention, but they're not the ones who will have the most suitors.\nIf you're a buyer, your ideal target is probably a younger player who complements your core players on both ends, can defend multiple positions, doesn't need tons of touches and is on a relatively cheap contract. This is why the only player ahead of Davis on the Fanspo's NBA trade machine's trending list is a fourth-year guard who is making $2.3 million this season: the Kings' Keon Ellis. According to The Stein Line, more than half the league has called about him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield is trending toward starting his team's Week 13 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, coach Todd Bowles told reporters on Friday. Mayfield injured his non-throwing shoulder on a first-half hit during last week's 34-7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Bowles told reporters Wednesday that backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater would get the majority of starting reps ahead of Sunday's matchup as Mayfield was held out of practice. Mayfield, who reportedly sustained a low-grade strain to his shoulder, was a limited participant Thursday but was back in practice Friday, leading to a more positive outlook for Sunday's game. \"He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine,\" Bowles said Friday.After Mayfield's initial injury in the first quarter of the Week 12 game, Mayfield re-aggravated his shoulder on a Hail Mary attempt in the second quarter. Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight game. On Wednesday, Bowles said Mayfield was \"sore\" and his availability would come down to how he felt at the end of the week.\nThe Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was among the league's leading MVP candidates through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks. Now in his third season with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022, when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed last week's 31-28 loss to the Chicago Bears due to a fracture in his left wrist, but he will be back in the saddle for Pittsburgh's Week 13 matchup against the Buffalo Bills. Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday that Rodgers was a full participant in practice, and carries no game designation into Sunday.\"It's all systems go,\" Tomlin said. Tomlin said Tuesday that they were optimistic Rodgers could return this week. The veteran signal-caller did not participate in practice on Wednesday, but returned as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. \"We'll start this week with great optimism although we certainly will limit him at the early portions of the week, provide opportunities for the other quarterbacks while preserving him,\" Tomlin said. \"But again, we're comfortable with the general trajectory, but I'll keep you updated in his level of participation and the quality of his participation over the course of the week will be the greatest indicator.\"\nTomlin told CBS Sports' Evan Washburn shortly before kickoff last Sunday that Rodgers did everything he could to put himself in position to start after suffering the injury during the Week 11 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but it was the \"prudent play\" to start Mason Rudolph. \"He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,\" Tomlin said on NFL Today+. \"He won't be playing this week. We'll let Mason start, and obviously, he's absorbed most of the reps this week.\" Rudolph completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception in his first start of the season. The Steelers out-gained the Bears 345 yards to 328, but 186 of Pittsburgh's total yards came on the ground.\nWhen it comes to Rodgers' return to the lineup, the wrist issue is not so much about pain tolerance as it is the ability for the veteran signal-caller to protect himself. The Steelers, now at 6-5, blew a 3.5-game lead in the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens. However, the Ravens fell back to second place following their Thanksgiving night loss to Joe Burrow and the Bengals. \n            ",

In the latest unexpected turn of college football's most chaotic rivalry, Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin claimed during an interview on SEC Network that Mississippi State fans broke into his team's locker room inside Mississippi State's Davis Wade Stadium twice ahead of Friday's showdown between the Rebels and the Bulldogs. The first incident occurred at 10 p.m., according to Kiffin, who said Ole Miss had \"secret cameras\" in its locker room and he reported the initial break-in to Mississippi State. The (presumably) maroon-clad burglars returned at 3 a.m. and stole Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' jersey, Kiffin said. \"I guess you expect nothing less from these people,\" Kiffin said while gesturing to Mississippi State fans. \n\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin saga adds to Egg Bowl lore: Revisiting wildest moments of Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State rivalry\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJersey or not, Ole Miss needs Chambliss to play one of his best games of the year. The seventh-ranked Rebels are likely just one win away from their first appearance in the College Football Playoff. With a 10-1 record, their hopes of making the SEC Championship Game are alive, as well. Of course, the on-field competition may be overshadowed by Kiffin's murky future with the Rebels. In spite of Ole Miss' success over the past few seasons, Kiffin is mulling a move to fill the head-coaching vacancy at either Florida or LSU. The buzz grew so loud that Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter had to release a statement revealing that Kiffin will make his final decision on Saturday after the Egg Bowl. \n\"I'm just living in the moment -- it's amazing -- and our players are too,\" Kiffin said last week on the SEC coaches teleconference. \"I see their joy about the practice season, where they're at and have so much on the line. It's just awesome to be a part of.\"\n            \n    ",

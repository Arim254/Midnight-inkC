Tampa has dropped a staggering eight straight games ATS, as its 5-11 record versus the line this year is the worst in the NFL. The Bucs are just 1-6 ATS at home, while Carolina brings a 9-5 spread record as an underdog in 2025. On the field, the Panthers can take advantage of the Bucs' No. 30 redzone defense and a team that hasn't won the turnover battle in each of its last four games, which were all straight-up defeats. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Buccaneers can coverTampa has owned the recent matchups in this series, going 9-2 over their last 11 meetings. The Buccaneers also have the edge in one of the most important stats in any level of football, and that's the turnover margin. The Bucs have the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-five) in the NFL, while the Panthers are just tied for 14th with as many takeaways as giveaways. Tampa Bay also has a clear strength of running the ball as it has the No. 7 rush offense, despite missing Bucky Irving for nearly half of the season. Thus, the Buccaneers can exploit Carolina's run defense, which ranks 24th in terms of yards per rush allowed, and just three teams have given up more rushing touchdowns (24) than the Panthers. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Buccaneers vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Buccaneers 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bucs vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time?

The largest of the NFL spreads has Jacksonville as 13.5-point favorites over the Titans as the Jags could still land the No. 2 seed in the AFC. Meanwhile, one of the slimmest lines has the Bears favored by 3 points over Detroit as Chicago can clinch the No. 2 seed with a win. All of the updated Week 18 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 18 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 18 on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 18 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 18 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 18 NFL picks is that the Packers (+7.5, 35.5) cover at Minnesota on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Green Bay is locked into the No. 7 seed and will rest some starters, including a banged-up Jordan Love, but it should still have enough to stay within a touchdown versus an imbalanced Vikings team. Minnesota had 3 passing yards in its Christmas win over Detroit, which is the fewest by any team in a win in 19 years. The Vikings rank 29th in total offense, 30th in turnover differential and dead last in giveaways. Also, since Matt LaFleur became coach in 2019, Green Bay owns the NFL's third best spread record (19-10) as a road underdog. The model has Green Bay prevailing versus the spread nearly 70% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Packers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 18 NFL predictions: the Titans (-13.5, 47.5) cover versus the Jaguars in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. The Jags have won seven straight, can wrap up the division with a Week 18 win, and have a shot at the AFC's No. 1 seed if they get some help. This line keeps rising, however, and the Titans have shown enough in recent weeks to believe that this game will be more competitive than that line indicates. Tennessee is 2-2 straight up in its last four and are 5-3 against the spread in the last eight as Cam Ward continues to develop. SportsLine's model predicts that Jacksonville still wins by double digits, but it is Tennessee that covers well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Titans to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 18 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 18 NFL schedule and just revealed six teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 18 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which six picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        Team USA has announced its 2026 Olympic hockey roster just over a month before the puck drops in Italy. The talent pool has never been deeper for the Americans, and that led to some tough decisions as Team USA built a roster expected to compete for the gold medal in February.Team USA already announced Matthew Tkachuk, Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy to the Olympic roster earlier this year. That meant 19 spots were available, and general manager Bill Guerin chose from at least two dozen players worthy of making of the roster.After being left off the 4 Nations Face-Off roster around this time last year, Jason Robertson had a point to prove. In the calendar year of 2025, Robertson scored 49 goals. Only two players, Morgan Geekie and Nathan MacKinnon, scored more. His 97 points ranked sixth in the NHL over that span. Despite those efforts, Robertson was left off the Olympic roster.\n        \n            \n                Team Canada 2026 Olympic hockey roster: Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon join forces to lead favorites\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnother young goal-scorer, Cole Caufield, hoped to play his way onto the team. There were questions about whether the undersized Caufield (5-foot-8 and 175 pounds) would convince Team USA leadership that he could thrive in an intense best-on-best tournament. Ultimately, Caufield will remain at home while Team USA goes overseas.\nAs always, the Americans have an embarrassment of riches in goal, and they had a laundry list of options to choose from with three-time Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck leading the way.Here is the complete 2026 Olympic roster for Team USA:*denotes player already announcedForwardsMatt Boldy, WildKyle Connor, JetsJack Eichel, Golden Knights*Jake Guentzel, LightningJack Hughes, DevilsClayton Keller, MammothDylan Larkin, Red WingsAuston Matthews, Maple Leafs*J.T. Miller, RangersBrock Nelson, IslandersTage Thompson, SabresBrady Tkachuk, Senators*Matthew Tkachuk, Panthers*Vincent Trocheck, RangersDefenseBrock Faber, WildNoah Hanifin, Golden KnightsQuinn Hughes, Canucks*Seth Jones, PanthersCharlie McAvoy, Bruins*Jake Sanderson, SenatorsJaccob Slavin, HurricanesZach Werenski, Blue JacketsGoaltendersConnor Hellebuyck, JetsJake Oettinger, StarsJeremy Swayman, BruinsRobertson, Fox snubbedLeaving Robertson off this roster is completely and utterly indefensible. He's one of the best scorers in the league, and he upped his game after getting snubbed from the 4 Nations Face-Off last year. What more does the Team USA front office need to see from him?Taking Miller, Connor and Trocheck over Robertson is absurd. Miller, now 32, is on pace for his least productive season since 2018-19. Trocheck has topped 30 goals in a single season once, but that was all the way back in 2017-18. At least Connor provides you with some scoring touch, but he gives it all back on the defensive end. Robertson should have been an easy choice over any of those players.\nWhen it comes to Fox, the idea that the Americans took two Rangers while leaving perhaps the team's best player at home, boggles the mind. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, New York has outscored opponents 91-63 with Fox on the ice at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. That plus-28 goal differential leads the team, and no one else is even remotely close. Do the decision-makers for Team USA (which include Rangers general manager Chris Drury) think those numbers are just a coincidence?Faber is a good young defenseman who plays tough minutes -- and a lot of them. Having said that, the Minnesota Wild just stay afloat with Faber in the game. The Rangers excel when Fox is on the ice. Guerin, the Wild general manager, should have made the tough choice to bring Fox over Faber.Elite goaltending depthMost teams in the Olympics would love to trade places with the United States when it comes to the goaltending position. Just ask Canada. The Americans had a lot of options for the third spot in the crease with Hellebuyck and Oettinger essentially locked in as No. 1 and No. 2.\nSwayman of the Boston Bruins wound up getting the final spot, and that's understandable. He's played at a Vezina Trophy level in the NHL, and when Swayman is on, he can be unbeatable. That's not a bad guy to have third on the depth chart.That said, I think there was at least one more goalie who warranted serious consideration. Spencer Knight has done his best to make the Chicago Blackhawks respectable by saving 9.05 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. That ranks ninth in the NHL, and Knight has a sparkling .861 high-danger save percentage.Ultimately, there were no bad decisions for the Americans when it came to their third goalie spot. It's a good problem to have, and it's a big reason why this team has a shot to win gold in Italy.\nGood enough for gold?Despite a couple clear missteps in the roster construction department, Team USA is still capable of ending the country's 46-year gold medal drought. The Americans have just made it a little harder on themselves.I've already laid out Team USA's advantage in net. If just one of Hellebuyck, Oettinger or Swayman are at the top of their game, the team should cruise to the medal round. From there, any of them have the ability to steal a win in a do-or-die situation.In front of them, the defense is still rock solid, even without Fox. The Americans didn't have Hughes, the second-best defenseman in the world, at the 4 Nations Face-Off and still pushed Canada to overtime. Slavin and Jones provide the length and mobility necessary to slow down Canadian speed demons like Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon.\nFinally, the omission of Robertson caps the Americans' upside, but Thompson and Keller were pleasant surprises. Both have a ton of skill, and Team USA needs that to complement some players who prefer a more grinding style. While Matthews has struggled this season, he's led the NHL in goals three times, and the Tkachuk brothers will be menaces on the forecheck.It shouldn't come as a surprise that Team USA has the second-best odds (+200) to win gold in Italy, per DraftKings. This team is more talented and deeper than any Olympic team the Americans have iced before.\n            ",

The Broncos are coming off a 20-13 win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas, while the Chargers were defeated by the Houston Texans in Week 17, 20-16.The No. 1 seed in the AFC is on the line in this matchup, as the 13-3 Broncos can clinch the first-round bye with a win. They would fall to the No. 2 seed in the AFC if they lost while the 13-3 New England Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins. As for the Chargers, they are locked into a wild-card spot. They currently occupy the No. 6 seed in the AFC behind the Texans and ahead of the Buffalo Bills. Both of those teams are also 11-5, and favored to win their respective matchups this weekend. Trey Lance will start at quarterback for the Chargers, as Justin Herbert gets a week to rest. Let's break down this AFC West matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Chargers vs. Broncos liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -12.5, O/U 37.5 (via DraftKings)Chargers vs. Broncos: Need to knowChargers resting starters? On Monday, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters that quarterback Justin Herbert will not start in the regular-season finale against the Broncos. In addition to Herbert, Harbaugh said that other starters with \"the most bruises\" and that need \"the most healing\" won't play, either.The lucky one seed. Denver has a great shot to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week. The Broncos have made the Super Bowl six of eight times when earning the No. 1 seed in the conference. With no Patrick Mahomes, no Joe Burrow and possibly no Lamar Jackson, the AFC is certainly wide open this year.How inexperienced is Lance? The former No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft undoubtedly has potential, and earned the backup job in Los Angeles this preseason. However, consider this stat: Bo Nix has more passing attempts this year (589) than Lance has in his EIGHT-year college and pro career (474)!Broncos closing in on sack record? This Denver defense is one of the best in the NFL, and has recorded a franchise-record 64 sacks this season. The Broncos are now nine sacks away from breaking the NFL record. Nine is a large number, but the Broncos defense did record nine sacks in Week 6 against the New York Jets. Chargers offensive line issues. The Chargers have started 10 different offensive line combinations this season compared to Denver's four. Los Angeles has started six different offensive tackles this season, which is tied for most in the NFL. Chargers vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nIt's not a hot take to predict that the Broncos will win this game, but will they cover the spread? We did see Denver fail to cover the spread against a lesser opponent on Christmas. The Chargers are 5-0 straight up and against the spread this season against divisional opponents. Only six teams since 2000 have finished undefeated straight up and against the spread in divisional play. Thirteen points is a large number, but with this game taking place in Denver and the Broncos motivated for a win, we'll take the AFC West champions. Pick: Broncos -12.5, Over 37.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys got much more than they bargained for when they acquired 24-year-old wide receiver George Pickens from the Pittsburgh Steelers in May in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a late-round pick swap. Pickens' public displays of frustration with the Steelers' offense led Pittsburgh to decide the 2022 second-round pick's talent wasn't worth it, which was a blessing for the Cowboys. He found a home in Dallas alongside quarterback Dak Prescott, who leads the NFL with 4,482 passing yards this season, and All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb in new head coach Brian Schottenheimer's offense. Pickens erupted with career-highs in nearly every receiving statistic en route to the first Pro Bowl nod of his four-year career. He ranks third in the NFL in receiving yards (1,420), third in the league in catches for first downs (73) and tied for third in catches of 25-plus yards (13) in 2025. \"Yeah, he's had a huge impact. Go back to when we made the trade, that was a position and a place we needed help in right? We've got a guy like CeeDee [Lamb], who over the past couple of years, everybody knew that the ball was going to CeeDee, and we're trying to get it there,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"So just trying to get help for him, we landed George, and I don't think anybody could imagine the amount of help that he's been, how great of a player that's just stepped in and been from Day 1.\"\n        \n            \n                Micah Parsons laughs about Cowboys' defensive issues; DC Matt Eberflus wouldn't do anything differently\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPickens producing like an All-Pro at the age of 24 just ahead of his rookie contract expiring this offseason sets up another high profile showdown between owner and general Jerry Jones and another Cowboys' star player. Jones re-signed both Prescott (four years, $240 million) and Lamb (four years, $136 million) after drawn out negotiations in 2024, but he stunned the football world in 2025 when his contentious negotiations with All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons resulted in the latter being traded to the Green Bay Packers a week before the 2025 season kicked off. \nThe difference between Prescott's and Lamb's contract talks and Parsons' was that Parsons unwittingly began a degree of contract talks with Jones directly as the two sides exchanged contract terms. Jones initiated that conversation when he asked Parsons to come chat with him about leadership ahead of the coming 2025 season. Parsons felt like once the two sides exchanged numbers, it was time for David Mulugheta, his agent, to come in and complete the deal with Jones after looking over the fine print. Jones felt like this was a violation of the agreement he felt he came to with Parsons, which led to the relationship between the two to break down. Jones was asked on his Tuesday weekly radio appearance on Dec. 30 if he planned to negotiate with Mulugheta, who is also Pickens' agent, and/or if he planned to take a similar approach and talk directly to Pickens. His answer was \"probably both.\" \"I don't know. We'll see how it goes. Probably both, but I certainly expect to be speaking with George,\" Jones said Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan. \nWith Mulugheta well aware of how Jones operates, Pickens feels \"super prepared\" for contract talks with Jones. \"Super prepared,\" Pickens said Thursday. \"I definitely leave that type of stuff to my agent because I let them [Mulugheta and Jones] talk the deals, and all that stuff but definitely super prepared.\"Part of that preparation is also advice from Prescott, the Cowboys' longest-tenured player who has come out on the other side of two contentious contract extension negotiations with a deal to remain in Dallas long-term both times. Even though the end result has been pretty for Prescott, he's now the NFL's highest-paid player in terms of average per year salary ($60 million) on his four-year, $240 million deal, he didn't enjoy the process with Jones. One of the things Prescott did do was avoid getting into direct financial conversations with Jerry and Stephen Jones, opting to let Todd France, his agent, handle that end of the agreement. \n\"I'll give it [my advice] to George. One, just don't let it get personal. At the end of the day, this is business. Both sides are going to want negotiations,\" Prescott said. \"Honestly, mine and Jerry's weren't pretty at all right? I wasn't talking to him for some time. I remember I went and signed and he told me that 'when two sides are trying to agree, you're not going to want to see each other's differences. Or you can't see each other's differences.' But the moment you get to a contract, you shake hands, and you got to let all that go. We did that, and so it's the same mindset going into these things. Things are going to come up. Things aren't going to sit right. You're going to feel slighted when they give you a million or two less than whatever you said. It's just the business: play the game, play it back, but don't let it get personal.\" Pickens acknowledged he's aware of how things went down with Parsons, which is one of the reasons why he isn't looking to directly inject himself into his own contract talks with Jones. CBS Sports' Joel Corry, a former agent himself, projects Pickens' long-term deal to compare similarly to the four-year, $132 million extension wide receiver DK Metcalf signed with the Steelers this past offseason. \"Definitely two different positions I would say, but then again, Micah is Micah, and I'm me,\" Pickens said. \"Definitely just let them [Mulugheta and Jones] do their thing.\"\nGeorge Pickens this season, NFL ranksNFL rankCatches92T-8thReceiving yards1,4203rdYards per catch15.46thReceiving TD9T-7thReceiving first downs733rdCatches of 25-plus yards13T-3rdEntering Week 18 at the New York Giants, Pickens is three catches and 80 yards receiving away from becoming the third player in Cowboys history to total at least 95 catches and 1,500 yards receiving in a season. The other two are Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin in 1995 and CeeDee Lamb in 2023. He's having plenty of fun on the football field in Dallas. \"It's super fun, definitely. The season is super fun, it's still going on,\" Pickens said. \"That'd be an excellent company to be in with those two, but we're just going to try to finish strong and try to get us a victory.\"Outside of Pickens' family, Lamb feels he is the most happy for Pickens' success ahead of becoming a first-time free agent upon the expiration of his rookie contract this offseason.\"I think if there is anybody in this room, the building or the world that's happier [than me], probably his family ... but like other than that, I already knew what it was. I'm happy for him,\" Lamb said Thursday. \"I knew the opportunity that he was going to have coming here immediately and the impact he was going to make. I'm just happy that it all came to fruition. He's able to make it throughout the season fully healthy. I can't wait to see him again next year.\"  The Cowboys had an overall successful season on the offensive side of the ball, ranking as the league's No. 4 scoring offense (28.4 points per game) through 17 weeks, but Prescott is looking for Dallas to improve its red zone offense -- the Cowboys' 57.4% red zone touchdown rate ranks 18th in the NFL through 17 weeks. That has offensive coordinator Klayton Adams going back to the drawing this offseason to help Schottenheimer and Prescott to do a better job of featuring both Pickens and Lamb in the red zone going forward. \"For me, the biggest learning lesson this season is just I've never been on an offense that's had two receivers like we have. So I really want to dive into that of 'how can we make it even more difficult for defenses?'\" Cowboys offensive coordinator Klayton Adams said Thursday. \"What formations are we in? A lot of times when we are putting together the first and second down plan, it's just 'I want to run this out of this formation because it breaks tendency. Or I want to run this side of this formation because I think we're going to get this coverage alignment or this alignment in the [defensive] front.' I really want to take a deep dive on where we can put these guys in the run game that puts the most stress on the defense. I think we've figured some of those things out as we've gone, but that's something I'm really interested in.\" \"We've got to just use their abilities with and without the ball to maximize our efforts, and I know if we do that, this will be a dangerous offense because those are special players,\" Prescott said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff quarterfinals provided a new batch of evidence to suggest that teams which earn a bye in the CFP are actually at a disadvantage. Through two seasons of the 12-team format, squads earning automatic entry to the quarterfinals are just 1-7. While the sample size is relatively small, it suggests that the rust incurred from going nearly four weeks without a game is a problem for teams earning a bye. That certainly appeared to be the case for No. 2 seed Ohio State in its 24-14 loss to No. 10 seed Miami in Wednesday night's Cotton Bowl.After a thrilling win over No. 7 seed Texas A&M on Dec. 20, the Hurricanes were operating a high-level across the board against the Buckeyes. Meanwhile, Ohio State's offense looked out of rhythm in its first live action since the Big Ten Championship Game on Dec. 6.At the end of the round, No. 1 Indiana was the only one of the top-four seeds left standings. A long layoff was no problem for the Hoosiers, who thrashed No. 9 seed Alabama 38-3 to reach the semifinals. \nHere are the grades for each of the eight teams that played in the CFP quarterfinals.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 1 seed IndianaGrade: A+  Result: 38-3 win vs. AlabamaIndiana's systematic destruction of Alabama in college football's most historic bowl game is exactly the visual the remaining doubters needed. If they couldn't grasp who the Hoosiers were before, they'll finally get it now after watching IU physically whip the Crimson Tide on both sides of the football. Indiana pummeled Alabama on the ground and sprinkled in plenty of big passing plays. Bama's pathetic excuse for a running game never got going, and IU never let Bama's passing game get rolling.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 2 seed Ohio StateGrade: D  Result: 24-14 loss vs. MiamiOhio State was rarely tested this season, and it showed as the Buckeyes wilted down the stretch with poor offensive showings in the Big Ten Championship and CFP quarterfinals. It took Julian Sayin too long to find a passing rhythm, and the Buckeyes weren't nearly as disruptive on defense as Miami. Star receiver Jeremiah Smith came to play, but Ohio State looked like a team lacking the mental and physical makeup required to meet the physical challenge Miami posed.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 3 seed GeorgiaGrade: C  Result: 39-34 loss vs. Ole MissGeorgia had the football with a 9-point lead before and after halftime but went three-and-out on both critical occasions. That's the frame of time coaches refer to as the \"middle eight,\" and Georgia's miserable offensive execution kept it from building a potentially insurmountable advantage. Instead, the Bulldogs lost their edge in the running game and couldn't get any pressure on Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. This one may haunt Kirby Smart, who had a couple of his own head-scratching decisions that deserve to be second-guessed.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 4 seed Texas TechGrade: D  Result: 23-0 loss vs. OregonThe only reason Texas Tech didn't get an 'F' is because its defense actually played incredibly well. Had the Red Raiders played with anything resembling a pulse offensively, this would have been a fight until the end. Unfortunately, a never-ending series of three-and-outs and turnovers spoiled a spotlight moment for the Big 12 champions and overshadowed the work of a truly elite defense. This one will sting.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 5 seed OregonGrade: A-  Result: 23-0 win vs. Texas TechOregon \"only\" gets an A- because its offense played sloppy. The Ducks struggled with Texas Tech's front seven, and didn't produce a touchdown drive of longer than 28 yards. Ultimately, it didn't matter, because Oregon was so dominant defensively that its offense could have gone MIA entirely and it wouldn't have made a difference. The Ducks forced four turnovers, which led directly to 20 points. Texas Tech's offense looked like a subpar Conference USA outfit against Oregon.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 6 seed Ole MissGrade: A  Result: 39-34 win vs. GeorgiaThis was a complete team win. Trinidad Chambliss may have entered the Manning realm of Ole Miss lore with his highlight-reel quarterbacking as he guided the Rebels back from a 9-point halftime deficit. The Rebels' defense also deserves some credit, too, as it played a pivotal role in flipping the momentum back in Ole Miss' favor during the third quarter. Not to be forgotten, junior kicker Lucas Carneiro turned in a legendary performance, which included two 55-plus yarders and a 47-yard game-winner. \n    \n                                        \n    No. 9 seed AlabamaGrade: F  Result: 38-3 loss vs. IndianaThe play most emblematic of Alabama's finesse identity came early in the second quarter. Faced with a fourth-and-1 in their own territory, the Crimson Tide lined up in the wildcat and ran a gimmicky trick play that Indiana quickly stuffed. Second-year coach Kalen DeBoer knew he had no chance of lining up and picking up a yard in traditional fashion. That's what Alabama football has become, and it left the Crimson Tide with zero margin for error in 2025. Too much was asked of physically limited quarterback Ty Simpson, and a non-dominant defense that finally ran out of game-changing turnovers.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 10 seed MiamiGrade: AResult: 24-14 win vs. Ohio StateMario Cristobal's vision for Miami football came to life in a long-awaited flash of glory as the Hurricanes physically imposed their will on the reigning national champions. Ohio State struggled to hold up against Miami's front seven, while the Hurricanes' offensive line consistently opened lanes to move the chains and control the clock. Keionte Scott's 72-yard interception return for a touchdown delivered the type of game-changing moment every team needs on a championship run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final game of the 2025 regular season takes us to Pittsburgh for a doozy of a matchup between the Ravens and Steelers. For the winner, they'll be crowned AFC North champions and the No. 4 seed in the conference, while the loser will be ousted from the playoff conversation entirely. Are those high enough stakes for you? These two division rivals met less than a month ago at M&T Bank Stadium. Pittsburgh was able to walk away a winner in that Week 14 matchup thanks to a stellar showing from Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf. However, Metcalf will not be available to the Steelers in this one as the wideout is serving the final leg of his two-game suspension. Meanwhile, after missing last week's win over the Packers due to a back injury, Baltimore will get Lamar Jackson back into the lineup under center in what is essentially a playoff game. Before we dive further into this matchup, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this do-or-die showdown. Where to watch Steelers vs. Ravens liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh, PA)TV: NBCOdds: Ravens -3.5, O/U 40.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsWhat version of Lamar Jackson are Ravens getting?\nSince 2019, the Ravens are 6-12 without Lamar Jackson, so they'll certainly be happy to see their two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup on Sunday for such a massive game. That said, Jackson hasn't been the elite quarterback we've come to expect him to be for the bulk of this season. Baltimore is just 6-6 with Jackson as the starter this season, and the quarterback has eight passing touchdowns and five interceptions over his last eight games (51 passing touchdowns and five interceptions in previous 21 games). \nOn top of Jackson simply not looking like himself this season, there's also the playoff struggles that loom over him, particularly as this is effectively a playoff game. He's just 3-5 in the playoffs with 13 total touchdowns and 11 turnovers in his career. Jackson is also 3-5 against the Steelers in is career (including playoffs) and has more turnovers 13) than total touchdowns (12). StatsLamar Jackson's career vs. Steelers (regular season + postseason)W-L3-5Team PPG22.4Passing YPG167.8Totals TD/TO12/13Are those playoff struggles combined with his lackluster play this season going to rear their head on Sunday night? Or will he settle back into MVP form? The answer to that could very well tell the story of this game. Can Steelers generate a downfield passing attack?\nAs we noted, a key reason why Pittsburgh was able to pull off the Week 14 win was because of Rodgers and Metcalf gashing the Baltimore secondary on deep balls. Of Metcalf's seven receptions in the win, three of them went for 20-plus yards en route to a 148-yard day. Rodgers completed all four of his throws of 20-plus air yards, which is a stark contrast to his 24% completion rate (9 of 38) on such throws this season outside of that game. Steelers WRs this seasonMetcalfRest of WRsReceptions5964Receiving yards850725Receiving touchdowns66With Metcalf still serving his suspension, the Steelers could find it difficult to generate that same level of success on throws down the field. During Pittsburgh's Week 17 loss to Cleveland (the first game of Metcalf's suspension), Rodgers averaged just 4.3 yards per attempt.   X factor\nDerrick Henry is coming off a jaw-dropping performance against the Packers, rushing for 216 yards and four touchdowns in the win. This is the time of year when the veteran back starts to heat up as he comes into this game with the most rushing yards per game average (103.8) in December or later in NFL history (including playoffs). Henry has also enjoyed recent success against Pittsburgh, totaling 442 yards rushing in his past three games. That includes a 94-yard game back in Week 14. If Henry stays hot, it'll completely tip the scales in Baltimore's favor. Ravens vs. Steelers prediction, pick\nThe absence of DK Metcalf in this game and Pittsburgh's inability to produce through the air with any wide receiver other than Metcalf will be the biggest difference maker in this game. If Rodgers is averaging less than five yards per attempt, this offense will go nowhere fast. Pair that with the return of Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry starting to heat up, this feels like a game where Baltimore's offense starts to roar while Pittsburgh's whimpers (Prediction: Ravens 24, Steelers 20 | Pick: Ravens -3.5). \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The holiday season is now in the rearview mirror, meaning that Major League Baseball's offseason should start to ramp up again. It'll need to: teams have only seven weeks until the beginning of spring training, yet the top four free agents on the market remain unsigned. Might that change on Friday? Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of the day's most notable moves and murmurs in one handy spot.Yankees have made offer to BellingerThe Yankees have submitted a formal proposal to outfielder Cody Bellinger, according to the New York Post. Specific parameters of the Yankees' offer are unknown, but it's the latest sign that New York is serious about retaining Bellinger, one of the top free-agent hitters on the market.\nBellinger, 30, spent last season with the Yankees after being obtained in a trade from the Cubs. He batted .272/.334/.480 (125 OPS+) with 29 home runs and 13 stolen bases. His contributions were worth an estimated 5.1 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.Throughout the winter, Bellinger has been rumored to be the Yankees' No. 1 priority, with fellow free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker painted as a fallback option.\nDodgers, Yankees, Cubs check on BichetteSome of MLB's highest rollers -- the Dodgers, Yankees, and Cubs -- have at least checked in with free-agent infielder Bo Bichette's camp, per the New York Post. Bichette has previously been connected in rumors with the Blue Jays, the only team he's played for as a professional, and the Red Sox. \nBichette, 28 in March, enjoyed a rebound season that saw him bat .311/.357/.483 (129 OPS+) with 18 home runs and four stolen bases. His contributions were worth an estimated 3.5 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference.Bichette has publicly signaled a willingness to move to second base to facilitate a signing. \nAngels interested in ArenadoThe Cardinals have already traded right-hander Sonny Gray and first baseman Willson Contreras this winter. Third baseman Nolan Arenado might join those ranks at some point before Opening Day, with The Athletic reporting that the Angels have interest in adding him to their lineup.\nArenado, 34, hit just .237/.289/.377 (87 OPS+) in what served as the worst offensive season of his career. He remains a strong defensive presence at the hot corner, however, it's likely that the Cardinals will need to pay down much of the $42 million that remains on his contract. The Cardinals, to their credit, have shown a willingness to send money over in both the aforementioned trades.The Angels have an opening at third base after buying out Anthony Rendon's contract and seeing Yoán Moncada reach free agency.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been a weird NFL season in 2025. An NFL-record four teams with 11 or more losses in 2024 have already clinched playoff spots in 2025, and the Carolina Panthers could run that number up to five in Week 18. An NFL-record three teams with new coaches inheriting 12-plus loss teams have already clinched playoff spots, and if the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons win in Week 18, the 2025 NFC South will be the sixth division in NFL history to have a three-way tie for its best record.What other craziness could happen during a Week 18 NFL weekend full of season-altering playoff implications? Let's take a look with five bold predictions to close out the 2025 regular season. Bijan Robinson goes off for 260 yards from scrimmage to set NFL single-season recordPro Bowl running back Bijan Robinson toasted the playoff-bound Los Angeles Rams to the tune of 229 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns, including a career-high 195 yards rushing and a rushing touchdown on 22 carries, in the Atlanta Falcons' 27-24 upset win on \"Monday Night Football\" last week. Robinson is now up to 2,255 yards from scrimmage this season, the most in Falcons history, and he's also now 255 yards from scrimmage away from breaking the NFL single-season record of 2,509 set by Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson in 2009. In his last game of the season against the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta's archrival, Robinson produces another game for the ages with 260 yards from scrimmage to break Johnson's record. \nDetroit Lions upset NFC North champion Chicago Bears by double digitsThe Detroit Lions, who are 8-8 and eliminated from postseason contention, have nothing to play for entering Week 18 at the NFC North champion Chicago Bears. They're fresh off a gut-wrenching 23-10 loss at the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas in which they committed six turnovers to officially kill their playoff hopes. That's about as hard of a face plant an NFL team can have.However, the Lions will come into Chicago to face a Bears squad that can lock up the NFC's No. 2 seed with a win and beat them by double digits. Detroit coach Dan Campbell will motivate his Lions squad with spite and the drive to stick it to former offensive coordinator Ben Johnson with a double-digit Lions victory. All the way back in Week 2 when Johnson and Bears quarterback Caleb Williams were still working to get on the same page, the Lions humiliated the Bears with a 52-21 victory. Detroit also spoiled the Green Bay Packers' 2022 Week 18 finale at Lambeau Field to keep them out of the playoffs, and will punk the Bears at Soldier Field in an effort to block them from the NFC's No. 2 seed. Chargers backup QB Trey Lance totals multiple TD vs. Broncos defenseThe Denver Broncos (13-3) can clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed, which comes with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason, with a win against the Los Angeles Chargers without starting quarterback Justin Herbert. The Chargers are resting him for the playoffs and starting backup Trey Lance at quarterback in his place. \nDespite the Chargers' lackluster offensive line play and Lance starting for the first time since Week 18 last season with the Dallas Cowboys, he'll produce multiple touchdowns. Kansas City Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun was able to total a passing touchdown and 66 yards passing while completing 13 of his 22 passes in a narrow 20-13 loss on Christmas in Week 17 -- his first career NFL start. Lance, a former top five pick, one-ups that performance against Denver's top five defense in Week 18 with multiple touchdowns.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 18 picks: Our experts face off on Panthers at Buccaneers, Seahawks vs. 49ers and more\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSeahawks sack 49ers QB Brock Purdy multiple timesSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy is on fire. During the team's six-game winning streak, which coincides with his return from a turf toe injury, Purdy leads the NFL in passer rating (111.5), first-down rate (48%) and success rate (56%). A whopping 48% of his throws are going for a first down this season, which is the highest by any quarterback in the last 35 seasons. Purdy also became the seventh quarterback in NFL history with at least five total touchdowns in consecutive games.   One of the driving factors in his success of late is his sack avoidance: just 8% of pressures against Purdy result in sacks, the lowest rate of any QB in NFL this season, per CBS Sports Research. The Seahawks defense is generating the NFL's ninth-best quarterback pressure rate (39.8%) and has racked up the eighth-most sacks (44) in the league. What makes them difficult to block is their pass rush is a multifaceted unit without a clear alpha: Defensive tackles Leonard Williams and Byron Murphy II co-lead the team in sacks (7.0 each) with edge rushers DeMarcus Lawrence  and Uchenna Nwosu right behind them (6.0 each). \nIn Week 18, the Seahawks become just the second team this season to sack Purdy at least twice in a game in 2025. Jets intercept Bills QB Josh AllenThe New York Jets don't have any interceptions in the 2025 NFL season. That's right: zero, zilch, nada -- no interceptions. The Jets' 16 consecutive games without a defensive interception is the longest in NFL history. New York is the only team with fewer than six interceptions as a team this season, and is threatening the record for the fewest interceptions by a defense in NFL history. That number is currently two by the 2018 San Francisco 49ers.The Jets will get their first one in their regular-season finale against Buffalo Bills 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen. Allen typically cooks the Jets as he has multiple total touchdowns in each of his last five home games against the Jets. However, Allen has cooled recently with 392 yards passing and no passing touchdowns in the last two games. He did produce two rushing touchdowns in Week 17 against the Philadelphia Eagles, but he airmailed a wide-open Khalil Shakir in the back of the end zone on what should have been the game-winning two-point conversion. \nOne erratic throw could give the Jets the interception they've been starved for this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW ORLEANS -- It is apparently so hard to beat Georgia that Ole Miss effectively had to do it three times in order to advance in the College Football Playoff. Superdome staff, eager to get a jump on the celebration, wheeled on the stage for their trophy presentation while referees reviewed whether a would-be game ending lateral had left any time on the clock. The officials ruled that it had left time and even resulted in a safety against Georgia, so off it went as the players who rushed to grab helmets strewn about the sideline gathered themselves for hopefully one last play. A small splash of confetti lay in Ole Miss' end zone, another symbol of premature celebration. As Ole Miss let Georgia's free kick, onsides style, roll helplessly, the Dawgs recovered but no time went off the clock. Pete Golding had already been drenched with Gatorade when he realized it, and was left to direct his charges while drenched in Cool Blue. One more play was afforded to the Bulldogs. Finally, after 10 laterals from Georgia, the assumed became official and Ole Miss defeated Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, 39-34, to set up a date vs. Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. The stage finally stayed put, ready for a celebration by a team left behind by its coach that rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to stun the SEC's Big Bad.\nOle Miss, which had never won a CFP game before this season, is now in the sport's final four. The Rebels are seeking their second national title (they split the 1960 one with Minnesota). \"My emotions right now, it's crazy,\" quarterback Trinidad Chambliss said. \"Really speechless, honestly, about everything, because it was that same point, we were down nine -- or they were down nine the last time we played them, so it was kind of like roles reversed. I didn't play my best in the fourth quarter, so I wanted to redeem myself and get back again. So, honestly, just trusting my guys. Our coaches put us in a great position and we executed.\"\nThere were Trinidad & Tobago flags all over the dome, from the second level of the end zone that Ole Miss scored in, to the first row behind the bench, to the nosebleeds on the 600 level, and in the second deck on Ole Miss' sideline covering the side of the scoreboard that showed Georgia's losing point total. It has become the red and black totem of the fanbase in support of their portal star, popularized by the coach who left even though he isn't actually named after the island nation. \nThere was a flag in an end zone suite belonging to 11-year-old Swayze. She and her family flew in from Dallas for the game, and ended up on the field during the postgame celebration. \"We got it for Christmas,\" she told CBS Sports. \"We brought it because we wanted to be on the JumboTron.\"Chambliss with young fans who brought in the flag of Trinidad & Tobago.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            She got more than that when Chambliss, following a postgame interview, stopped to take a picture with her and her brother before he went to embrace his own family. \nIn the prep leading to the game, Ole Miss had put an emphasis on finishing -- which they had not done earlier this season in Athens, when they surrendered a two-score lead. As the old saying goes, it's hard to beat a team twice, and Georgia found that out. Chambliss, who threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns in the game, was unstoppable as the second half, escaping pockets thanks to poor contain from the Georgia pass rush; from there, Chambliss' scramble drill was just getting started, and he'd generate backbreaking chunk plays, backyard style. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            Ole Miss finished gaining 6.5 yards per play on offense and the Rebels defense bowed up with nine tackles for loss, an emphasis for coach Pete Golding, who brought up repeatedly the importance of not missing tackles. \"I think in the first half we didn't leverage the ball very well on defense,\" Golding said. \"We're getting to the ball; we just had a lot of missed tackles. This was an issue when we played them the first time. We had double-digit missed tackles and understanding angles and all that. So we weren't really concerned from a scheme standpoint. There wasn't anything at halftime where we were like, all right, we've got to change.\" \nOle Miss' best offense in the first half came from kicker Lucas Carneiro, who hit two career longs in the game from 55 and 56 yards on stalled Rebels first half drives. While he was 6-6 from 50-plus last year at Western Kentucky and 1-2 this year, he had been \"off\" leading into the game. It hadn't been a good week of practice. During Ole Miss' dress rehearsal the day before the game, Carneiro uncharacteristically missed a couple times. And in pregame warmups, he did not even practice from as far back as 55 yards, he said. Caneiro hit the longest field goal in Sugar Bowl history twice in the game with room to spare, then a 47-yarder with six seconds left to give Ole Miss the victory. \"This is something I've dreamed about, and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to come to the play in the stadium and win a Sugar Bowl,\" Carneiro said. \"And obviously we got to do it again next week [in the] Fiesta Bowl.\"  \nThe most common sound heard on the Georgia side of the stands after the game were the belts clapping from the few Ole Miss fans with tickets on the Superdome's West Side. To the victors went the belt to ass celebrations on the first night of the new year. Yes, Lane Kiffin's spectre loomed during the week leading up to the Sugar Bowl -- and he had plenty to do with that. On Monday after bowl media day activities, multiple Ole Miss coaches slated to be a part of LSU's staff as soon as the Rebels' season ended traveled the 80 miles up to Baton Rouge for staff meetings. \nYahoo Sports reported that Kiffin and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry were considering attending the game. It was reported that Kiffin reached out to ESPN personnel about appearing in the booth on the broadcast, as he did during LSU's Texas Bowl loss to Houston. ESPN was reportedly not receptive. In the end, Kiffin opted to remain in Baton Rouge and attended an LSU women's basketball game instead and was introduced like a conquering hero by coach Kim Mulkey.\nAs is typical, Kiffin tweeted his support of the Rebels postgame, but Ole Miss continues to win without him and in spite of the tumult he caused. The vindication could not be sweeter. \"That's the thing I told [Golding] after the game, what he's been able to accomplish in the last three or four weeks with all the the moving parts and being able to multitask has been incredible, and to keep these guys focused, it's been awesome,\" athletic director Keith Carter told CBS Sports. \"This is a very unique situation, we have some new staff that's in the building that's going to be here long term, some staff that's in the building that's not going to be here long term. \"But, man, I think it also is just a credit to the guys, to the players, and just the maturity that they have, and it's just fun, and I feel really happy for them. We want to support Pete. And obviously, in the short term and the long term.\"\nIn another example of the peculiar nature of Ole Miss' plight, Chambliss said after the game that he is still yet to hear back about his waiver request for a sixth year of eligibility. The transfer portal opened officially minutes after Ole Miss won at midnight on the east coast. Inside the industry, it is believed that Kiffin is licking his chops to stock his LSU roster with the stars he had originally brought to Ole Miss. But he cannot do that until Ole Miss' season ends. Among the players Golding knows he'll have to work to keep: Carneiro. \"I think a lot of people in the country think Lucas is the best kicker in the country, so a lot of people want Lucas,\" Golding said. \"So I've been meeting with Lucas a lot lately. We've had a lot of good meetings here, and especially this week. I got to spend a lot of time with him one-on-one and just getting to know him a little more and figuring out what he wants in the future.\"  Hours after the celebrations were over in an empty Superdome, the only thing left on the field was that confetti-filled stage. Strip away the distractions, and the focus on the coach who isn't here, and all the uncertainty about what's next and the only thing that matters is that this Ole Miss team found its way onto that stage even if their celebration took a little longer than they would have liked. \nThe fact that they continue playing means their uncertain future will have to wait. \n            ",

So how about those CFP quarterfinal games? If not for Indiana trampling Alabama, the real elephant in the room would be how in the first two years of the 12-team field era the top four seeded teams are now a combined 1-7.

Aside from being a three-time Super Bowl champion, our NFL insider Jonathan Jones said that Aikman's years of studying every NFL team and questioning players and other personnel for his analyst role makes him an ideal fit for the task.It's the first weekend of conference play in college basketball. Michigan has been destroying opponents around the country to start the season, but now it's time for conference foes to get a taste of what the No. 2 Wolverines have been doing. No. 24 USC (12-1) will visit Michigan (12-0) Friday night in Big Ten play. Meanwhile, on the women's side, No. 19 USC visits crosstown rival No. 4 UCLA on Saturday.The Panthers will host the Rangers at the Marlins' ballpark in the Winter Classic. Miami's loanDepot Park, home of the MLB's Marlins, will be the site of the first outdoor NHL game in the state of Florida. Although the Panthers are the two-time defending, neither team is crushing it so far this season. But that probably won't matter for the expected sell-out. Game time temperature is forecast to be 63 degrees. 😲 Ole Miss uses epic comeback to defeat Georgia, will meet Miami in first College Football Playoff semifinal \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Whoa! Ole Miss' take down of Georgia in the Sugar Bowl was one for the ages. The Rebels avenged a previous loss to the SEC champion Bulldogs on Thursday night inside New Orleans' Superdome behind a 362-yard, multi-touchdown performance from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss during a wild 39-34 victory. Ole Miss scored 20 points during a jaw-dropping fourth quarter, pushing ahead with six seconds to play on Lucas Carneiro's 47-yard field goal. Our David Cobb broke down how Chambliss got the Rebels going in the final frame. \nCobb: \"Chambliss produced a three-play sequence for the Ole Miss history books to begin the fourth quarter. With the Rebels trailing 24-19, the Division II transfer turned into a magician. His first act was to evade a huge loss with a no-look shovel pass to Kewan Lacy.  Next came a Houdini act on a third-and-7 play in Ole Miss territory. He retreated, changed directions, evaded defenders and found Lacy for a 7-yard gain. Chambliss promptly followed up with another circus play that resulted in a 44-yard downfield strike to Harrison Wallace III. Lacy finished the drive with his second rushing touchdown of the game, and the Rebels converted a 2-point play to go ahead 27-24.  Chambliss came through in a number of key situations with a number of highlight-reel plays, but no sequence embodied his performance better than those three plays to begin the fourth.\"And Lane Kiffin may be gone, but he's still going to draw at least $500,000 as a result of the Rebels' two CFP victories. Kiffin collected a cool quarter-million for the first-round victory and he's got another $250,000 coming for the New Year's Day win, terms stipulated by his new agreement with LSU. The Rebels' win pushes Ole Miss into the Fiesta Bowl semifinal in Glendale, Arizona, on Jan. 8 against a tough-as-nails Miami squad that upset Ohio State, 24-14, on New Year's Eve. Big picture, it means college football could have a first-time national champion this season unless the Hurricanes win out.  \t🌹🍊 No. 1 Indiana aces Rose Bowl test, Oregon dominates to set up second College Football Playoff semifinal  \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Indiana earned its stripes as the College Football Playoff's lone unbeaten entering the quarterfinals and Curt Cignetti's group once again left no doubt during the Hoosiers' 38-3 demolition of ninth-seeded Alabama. Playing in their first Rose Bowl since 1968, the surgical Big Ten champions seized control with a couple haymakers from Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza during a 17-point second quarter following two Alabama miscues and never looked back. \nBattered on the canvas after the knockout blow, Alabama's at a crossroads of sorts following its worst bowl loss in program history. An unlikely horror movie unfolded for Kalen DeBoer down the stretch and it got real ugly in the finale, leading many to question if he's the long-term answer following his second season with the Crimson Tide. John Talty said Alabama's setback warrants sweeping changes. Talty: \"This was the kind of devastating, humiliating loss that must invoke introspection. The current blueprint is not going to cut it. Everything from roster construction to staffing to cultural identity should be under review this offseason.\" After Oregon's disarming of Texas Tech in Miami, the Ducks will play the unbeaten Hoosiers on Jan. 9 at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta for an opportunity at their first appearance in the national championship game since 2014. Thanks to a pair of interceptions and a fumble recovery from freshman cornerback Brandon Finney Jr., Oregon nullified Texas Tech's historic season with four takeaways to subdue one of the nation's high-powered offenses. The Big 12 is now 1-8 all-time in the CFP.  \t🏈 Week 18 of the NFL season has arrived, and these are THE four games everyone will be watching \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Week 18 of the regular season has finally arrived, and while 12 of the 14 playoff spots have been sealed, there are seemingly endless seeding scenarios, draft order scenarios and, of course, all the drama that comes with the NFL, week-in and week-out. Four games stand above the rest: \nPanthers at Buccaneers, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. -- If the Panthers win this game, they head to the playoffs as the NFC South champions. If the Buccaneers win, both teams will be watching Saints-Falcons very carefully on Sunday, because if the Falcons win, the Panthers would still go to the playoffs. But if the Buccaneers win Saturday and the Saints win Sunday, the Buccaneers will be playoff-bound. One Saints star has been ruled out. Seahawks at 49ers, Saturday, 8 p.m. -- This is the battle for the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The loser will fall to a wild card spot.Chargers at Broncos, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. -- If the Broncos win this game, they will be the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Considering the Chargers will be resting several starters, including Justin Herbert, Denver should win. But this is the NFL, where the weird, the random and the unexpected happens. If the Broncos somehow lose, though, the Patriots can get the No. 1 seed with a win over the Dolphins. And if the Broncos and the Patriots lose, the Jaguars can get the No. 1 seed if they beat the Titans. Like I said, lots of scenarios here.Ravens at Steelers, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. -- Fittingly, these two rivals play with the AFC North title on the line in the very last game of the season. Game 272 out of 272. It's a huge game for Jackson, who's had a tough year and has a big, uncertain offseason ahead. Oh, and it might also be Aaron Rodgers' last game ... ever.So let's get to the picks. Here's a taste of of what our guys are saying for two of these games. For Panthers at Buccaneers, Pete Prisco is going with ... Prisco: \"This might be for the division title -- it is if Carolina wins -- even if both teams are limping into this game. The Bucs have dragged in the second half of the season, but they are at home and have guys who have played in a lot of big games. Look for the offense to get it going here as Baker Mayfield gets the better of Bryce Young. Projected score: Bucs 26, Panthers 20For Ravens at Steelers, Tyler Sullivan says ... Sullivan: \"While Henry's resurgence is a key element in why I think Baltimore wins, it's not the main reason. Specifically, it's because Pittsburgh will not have the key X-factor from its win against the Ravens earlier this season: DK Metcalf. The standout receiver is still serving his two-game suspension stemming from an altercation with a fan in Detroit. Back in Week 14, Metcalf posted a season-high 148 receiving yards against the Ravens, which included three receptions of at least 20 air yards. Without him, Pittsburgh has no viable deep passing attack, which will likely stifle its chances in this matchup. Projected score: Ravens 24, Steelers 20 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Why not start the year with a bang?

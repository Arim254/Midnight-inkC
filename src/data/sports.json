Additionally, Philadelphia has owned this rivalry since Jalen Hurts entered the picture, as the team is 6-1 versus Washington in games Hurts starts and finishes, with the quarterback having 16 total touchdowns versus two interceptions. The Eagles' defense is also coming off its best performance in shutting out Vegas, and now it gets to face a Commanders team onto its backup quarterback, and one which doesn't have a defense to make up for Daniels' absence. Washington is No. 31 in total defense, with additional bottom-five rankings versus the run, versus the pass and in the red zone. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Commanders can coverWashington is coming off scoring its second-most points (29) of the season on Sunday, and it still has a potent rushing attack even without Daniels. The Commanders boast the No. 4 rushing offense, averaging 141.8 yards over their last four games, and stopping the ground game is an issue for the Eagles. They are No. 22 in stopping the run, having allowed 165.3 yards over their last three games, and Philly can also be sloppy with the ball, having committed nine turnovers over their last four games. Also, Washington has covered in two of its last three games overall, while Philly is just 1-3 ATS in divisional games this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Eagles vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Eagles 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 47 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Eagles vs. Commanders, and which side of the spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        Several 2025-26 college football bowl games and one playoff matchup are in the books, but bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. Two of the biggest spreads in the entire college football postseason are in the CFP first round on Saturday as Oregon is favored by 20.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.  Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

James Madison, the Sun Belt champion, got a spot in the CFP bracket thanks in large part to Duke upsetting Virginia in the ACC title game, making JMU one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Oregon had a strong 11-1 campaign, but didn't hold a tiebreaker to get into the Big Ten title game.Kickoff from Autzen Stadium is set for 7:30 p.m. ET.

Oregon is the largest favorite to this point in any bowl or playoff game, and that's because the Ducks own a huge talent edge across the board and will be playing on their home field. Quarterback Dante Moore is a possible top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft as he comes into this matchup with 2,733 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes and just six interceptions on the season. Dan Lanning's squad also ranked third in the Big Ten in scoring defense (14.8 points per game) and will present a challenge that James Madison isn't accustomed to.

The Dukes are built to run the ball, leading the Sun Belt with 245.7 yards per game on the ground. Running back Wayne Knight led the way with 1,263 rushing yards, while quarterback Alonza Barnett III had 544 yards and 14 scores on the ground.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover well over 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-4.5, 44.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in almost 60% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.How to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

The Raiders could be on their way to the No. 1 overall pick, but the Commanders aren't far behind them, as Washington had an eight-game losing streak before defeating the also struggling Giants last week. With Jayden Daniels (elbow) out and the Commanders finishing up a 4-10 season, the Eagles have a significant edge in talent and motivation. The defending Super Bowl champions clinch the NFC East with a win on Saturday, and the Eagles are 3-1 over their last four games against teams currently with a losing record. The model projects the Eagles to cover in 52% of simulations. Back the Eagles at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Over 46.5 in Packers vs. Bears (-110)The Over has hit in three of the last four Packers games, while also cashing in four of the last five Bears contests. The Over is 9-5 in Chicago games this season, including 9-3 over the last 12 games, often backed by strong offensive performances by the Bears and Ben Johnson's offense. Chicago has the No. 9 scoring offense in the league at 26.1 points per game, while ranking 21st in points against at 24.1 ppg, which could make for a great combination for Overs to cash. The Packers are just behind the Bears in scoring at 24.9 ppg, which ranks 10th, and Green Bay defeated the Bears, 28-21, two weeks ago to go Over this number. The model projects another over on Saturday, with it hitting in 55% of the model's simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:James Madison (+21) vs. Oregon (-112)\"I don't want to say the Ducks will overlook the Dukes – and I definitely wanted to say Dukes and Ducks in the same sentence – but yeah, I think they might,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"This is the largest spread in CFP history.

That is based on a $417.3 million CBT payroll, easily the highest in baseball. The 2025 Dodgers are, by a wide margin, the most expensive roster in baseball history.The CBT threshold was $241 million in 2025. Tax rates escalate the more you exceed the threshold and also based on how many consecutive years you pay CBT. The Dodgers are a repeat offender and were hit with the highest tax rates, which include a 110% tax on every dollar spent over $301 million. That $301 million threshold is known as the \"Steve Cohen tax,\" after the Mets' owner.CBT payroll is based on the average annual value of player contracts, not the player's actual salary in that season. Cot's Baseball Contracts estimates the Dodgers' actual cash payroll at $347.0 million for 2025. Between a $347.0 million actual payroll and the $169.4 million CBT bill, the Dodgers will pay approximately $516.4 million for their championship roster this past season.A record-tying nine teams paid CBT this season. Here are the nine teams and their tax bills:\nCBT payrollCBT billDodgers$417,341,608  $169,375,768  Mets$346,670,456  $91,637,501  Yankees$319,522,564  $61,774,820  Phillies$314,329,912  $56,062,903  Blue Jays$286,135,551  $13,609,719  Padres$270,351,396  $6,992,447  Red Sox$248,859,139  $1,496,828  Astros$245,991,459  $1,497,438  Rangers$241,380,966  $190,483  That's just under $403 million total in CBT. Per Article XXIII(H) of the collective bargaining agreement, the first $3.5 million of that $403 million goes toward player benefits. 50% of the remainder is used to fund player retirement accounts, and the other 50% is distributed to non-CBT teams by commissioner Rob Manfred based on local revenue growth and other factors.The Dodgers paid a $103.0 million CBT bill for the 2024 season, which was the previous record. The 2023 Mets are the only other team to rack up a nine-figure CBT bill. They paid $100.8 million that year. Prior to 2023, no team had ever paid more than $43.6 million in CBT in a single season. That number was then eclipsed eight times from 2023-25.\nL.A.'s monster tax bill comes not long after manager Dave Roberts came out in favor of a salary cap, though he couched it by saying there would also have to be a \"(salary) floor to make those bottom-feeders spend money too.\" MLB and the 30 owners are once again expected to pursue a salary cap when the CBA expires next Dec. 1.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The bracket has been set and teams see the road ahead -- all that's left to do now is settle it all on the field as 12 teams vie for the national title. It comes as no surprise that Indiana secured the top overall seed after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. It's the highest ranking in program history as the Hoosiers enter the postseason as legitimate national contenders, fresh off their first outright conference title in 80 years.Ohio State didn't fall far. The Buckeyes, looking to defend their 2024 national championship, landed at No. 2, followed by SEC champion Georgia at No. 3 and Big 12 champion Texas Tech at No. 4. Those four teams earn opening-round byes.No. 9 Alabama kicked off the CFP with a first-round comeback victory over No. 8 Oklahoma. Oregon (No. 5), Ole Miss (No. 6) and Texas A&M (No. 7) will each host first-round games. The top eight was mostly locked entering Sunday's selection show. Beyond that is where the intrigue surfaced. Alabama wasn't punished for its lopsided loss in the SEC title game, holding firm at No. 9. That sets up a first-round rematch with Oklahoma, which beat the Crimson Tide earlier this season.The real controversy came at No. 10, where Miami edged Notre Dame for the final at-large bid despite trailing the Irish in every previous set of rankings.For the first time ever, two Group of Five teams reached the playoff. No. 11 Tulane earned its bid by winning the American Conference, while No. 12 James Madison benefited from ACC chaos to slide in as Sun Belt champion.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternFirst roundSaturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner -- : 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner -- : 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 20\n7:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The 2025 college football season was filled with drama and intense conference championship races, but now it's time to find out who the best in the nation truly is. Indiana's enters this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed on the heels of a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opened Friday with Alabama's comeback win at Oklahoma. Three more first-round games are on tap for Saturday before the playoff advances to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. 2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma: 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (9) Alabama: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        On Friday, the second year of the 12-team College Football Playoff format begins as a rematch between SEC foes takes center stage. No. 9 Alabama kicked off the 2025-26 CFP with a bang by coming back from 17 down to stun No. 8 Oklahoma on the road. No. 10 Miami received the final at-large spot to the CFP and will face No. 7 Texas A&M in the first game of the day on Saturday. Both programs are making their CFP debuts, and the winner will advance to face (2) Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl on New Year's Eve.Later in the day, No. 6 Ole Miss hosts No. 11 Tulane. The Rebels have been one of the biggest talking points the last several weeks after Lane Kiffin left the program before the CFP to accept the job at LSU. The winner of that game will face No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.\nThe final first-round game will see No. 12 James Madison face No. 5 Oregon. The winner earns the final spot in the quarterfinals and will face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl.As the first round of the College Football Playoff gets underway, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate all the games.All times EasternCollege Football Playoff first-round TV schedule(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma (Friday) -- 8:00 p.m. on ABC/ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The last time these teams met, Oklahoma pulled off a stunning 23-21 road win over Alabama. The victory vaulted the Sooners back into top 10 and ultimately led to their first CFP berth since the 2019 season. The key matchup Saturday is Alabama's offense against Oklahoma's stout defense. The X-factor to watch is Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams. He has been inconsistent this season, and the Crimson Tide will need a strong performance from him to advance.\n(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M -- noon on ABC/ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Texas A&M was 11-0 before suffering a loss to Texas in the regular-season finale. A win would have secured the Aggies a berth in the SEC Championship Game. Instead, Mike Elko's team has been idle since. Miami also missed out on playing for a conference title after two losses in ACC play. This shapes up as the best first-round matchup. Keep an eye on Miami freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney, a big-play threat every time he touches the ball.(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss -- 3:30 p.m. on TNT/Max: Alabama's matchup against Oklahoma won't be the only rematch of the first round of the CFP. Ole Miss already played Tulane earlier this season at home. The Rebels won the first matchup 45-10 behind a standout performance from star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. Tulane coach Jon Sumrall will depart at the conclusion of his team's season to become the coach at Florida. Does he have one more upset in him before he heads to Gainesville?(12) James Madison at (5) Oregon -- 7:30 p.m. on on TNT/Max: The final first-round matchup will see Oregon host James Madison. Oregon is hoping for good news along the injury front at wide receiver. Evan Stewart -- who has not appeared in a game this season due to a knee injury -- was practicing earlier this week, but his status is still unclear heading into the weekend.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another week of the Premier League is back, and don't look now, but we may have a title race on our hands as Arsenal are only two points ahead of Manchester City and two points ahead of Aston Villa. Unai Emery has helped the squad rebound from a rough start to the season, and they're now in the thick of the race, even with balancing European play. Things will continue to tighten with the festive period in full swing, but also with the Africa Cup of Nations kicking off on Sunday, some teams, like Sunderland and Manchester United, will be hit hard.That's something to take into account from a betting perspective because it's hard to know what will be seen out of teams with major AFCON absences, making it something that I'll look to avoid this week. So with that out of the way, let's get to it.Manchester City vs. West Ham UnitedManchester City to score 2+ goals in the first half (+154)Saturday, 10 a.m. ETIn a perfect world, we'd take City to win and Erling Haaland to score, but when both of these things have become automatic as City have climbed to second in the league, there's no value in doing that. West Ham United have improved under Nuno Espirito Santo, but this is a moment when they will be overmatched due to the talent that City have at their disposal. Even with needing to balance the EFL Cup midweek, Pep Guardiola was able to get in a rare moment where he could rest Haaland, and the Norwegian being fresh will be a scary sight for teams in their path. City are rarely able to be stopped from scoring in the first half, and West Ham won't be a team that is able to do that either.Tottenham vs. LiverpoolBoth teams to score and over 2.5 goals (-125)Saturday, 12:30 p.m. ETBoth of these teams may be just getting by in European play, but their league form has been disappointing. With Mohamed Salah and Pape Matar Sarr away at AFCON, they will need to cope with the absences of key players while also trying to kick their defense into gear. Picking a winner in this one is impossible as these teams look to defy logic in matches, but if one thing is for sure, it's that there will be goals in this meeting. Tottenham may have kept two clean sheets in their last five matches in all competitions, but considering that they were against Brentford and Slavia Praha, that's nothing similar to the attack that they'll face from Liverpool, even without Salah. Meanwhile, the Reds have been a completely different team in Premier League play as compared to the Champions League. They did shut out Inter and Brighton in their last two matches, but both are times when the Reds should've conceded, so going on the road to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will be a tall task for keeping a clean sheet.Aston Villa vs. Manchester UnitedAston Villa to win (+105)Sunday, 11:30 a.m. ET\nOkay, we're going back to the AFCON effect. Aston Villa have been flying close to the sun, and their wings may melt sooner than later, but hosting Manchester United at Villa Park isn't set to be that time. Ruben Amorim will need to replace two key players in his starting XI as Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are both on AFCON duty for their respective countries. This is also after the emotional blow of drawing 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday in a problem of the United defense's own creation. In Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, and Benjamin Sesko, there's still a lot to contend with in the attack, but Emery will find a weakness and exploit it to get Villa a win. The preparation that Villa does for every match will pay off here picking up yet another win and staying firmly in the title race through Christmas.\n            ",

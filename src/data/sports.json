The Jaguars are 1.5-point favorites at home in the latest Bills vs. Jaguars odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points is the highest of the entire weekend slate at 51.5. The Jaguars are -123 money line favorites (risk $123 to win $100), while the Bills are +103 underdogs.

That's evidenced by Jacksonville going 12-5 against the spread this year, nearly right in line with the team's 13-4 overall record. The Bills, on the other hand, have been one of the league's top teams for a few years now and went just 8-9 against the spread while going 12-5. Both teams have also played to the Over this year, with Buffalo 9-8 to the Over and Jacksonville 10-7.

    "body": "\nNFL Wild Card Weekend continues with three mouthwatering matchups on Sunday, making it one of the most exciting days of the year for online sports betting. Many people will dabble in the traditional bets of picking the winner, against the spread and over/under for total points, but anytime touchdown scorer bets have become increasingly popular over the years. With matchups like Bills-Jaguars, 49ers-Eagles and Chargers-Patriots set to unfold, many of the sport's biggest stars, including 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, will take the field, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has included McCaffrey in its NFL Wild Card Weekend anytime touchdown scorer best bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Wild Card Weekend NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Wild Card Weekend NFL picks. Wild Card Weekend NFL anytime touchdown picks:Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars (+270)Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-135)TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots (+130)Woody Marks, Texans (+190)Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars (+270)\nTuten scored a touchdown last week in his return from a two-game absence, marking the second straight game he played in where he scored a touchdown. He's scored in three of his last four games as he's become an increasingly important part of Jacksonville's offense. After scoring just two touchdowns over the first seven games, he has scored in five of his eight contests. The Bills have allowed the most rushing touchdowns (18) to running backs this season, and although Travis Etienne Jr. is the RB1, Tuten has proven the ability to score as well. The model projects him to score in 40% of simulations, showcasing strong value at his current price.Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (-135)\nMcCaffrey has been a touchdown machine over his career, and don't expect that usage to change in the biggest game of the season. The star San Francisco running back has stayed healthy throughout the season, resulting in 17 touchdowns in 17 games. He had 21 touchdowns in 16 games in 2023 in his last healthy season before this year, and McCaffrey scored five touchdowns in three games in their run to the Super Bowl that year. He scores in more than 60% of the model's simulations.TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots (+130)\nThe rookie has excelled since being given more opportunities about midway through the season, and with his big-play ability, he has touchdown potential every time he touches the ball. Henderson had two touchdowns last week against Miami, giving him four touchdowns over his last four games. Henderson scored nine of his 10 touchdowns over the final eight games of the season, and given his explosiveness, the model expects a heavier workload on Sunday. Henderson scores in 48% of simulations, creating value for anytime TD scorer bets at plus-money odds.Woody Marks, Texans (+190)\nMarks has taken over as the team's clear RB1 when healthy, and he appears to be at full health heading into Monday Night Football. The dynamic rookie could see a heavier workload in what will likely be a cold night in Pittsburgh, making the rushing attack a more popular option. The model projects him to score in 41% of simulations, with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin likely to focus the defense on containing WR Nico Collins. Want more Wild Card Weekend NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Wild Card Weekend.

While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss.

What happens when a player who relies on extreme pull tendencies for his power is subjected to the ballpark with the deepest outfield corners -- namely, going from the one pictured on the left below to the one pictured on the right?\n                                                                    via Wikipedia\n                                                            Predictably, it doesn't go well. See how the Wrigley Field fence actually moves back as it nears the corners? That makes for 40 extra feet at the foul pole around which Paredes lives, and those 40 extra feet made a world of difference. Paredes hit .223 with three homers and a .633 OPS in his 52 games for the Cubs late in 2024.\nBut then what happened when Paredes returned to a ballpark well-suited for his swing -- incidentally, the same one where Bregman has spent the majority of his career? Why, he went on to deliver a very Bregman-like stat line: .254 with 20 homers and a .809 OPS in the 102 games that he was healthy.So if Paredes produces much like Bregman in Houston, what are the chances Bregman will produce much like Paredes in Chicago?I don't want to overstate the case. I'd be reckless for doing so given the dissimilar stature of the two players. But Paredes and Bregman are hitters of a similar kind, both relying on optimal angles rather than optimal impact to deliver their home runs. Bregman hits the ball harder than Paredes, sure, but his exit velocities still typically rank in the lower half the of league. His pull tendencies aren't as extreme as Paredes', but ... well, they're pretty extreme:\n\n                                                                    via FanGraphs\n                                                            Notice that most of those black dots are going into the same protruded corner that ruined Paredes in Chicago.Now, the obvious counter for this admittedly bearish outlook would be Statcast, which estimates that Bregman would have actually hit one more home run if he had played every game at Wrigley Field last year, but I've already mentioned the difficulties in modeling home runs at that particular venue. We've discussed the shape of the fence, which defies convention by becoming deeper at points where every other fence becomes shallower, but the trickier variable than that, even, is the wind.Located on the Lake Michigan side of the Windy City, Wrigley Field is impacted more by wind than any other venue. Historically, it's been a boon for hitters, but more recent patterns have seen the wind blow in more often than out. The actual 2025 count is 51 games \"in\" and 19 games \"out,\" according to Jesse Rogers of ESPN.\nIf it's fringe power to begin with, it's likely to be warning track power against 15 mph headwinds.Given his hitting profile and the way it's perfectly suited for the past venues he's called home, I've feared the day when Bregman, a longtime favorite of mine in Fantasy, played half his games at a more ordinary venue. This one isn't even ordinary but perhaps the worst-case scenario. Maybe his hitting instincts and fiercely competitive nature will elevate him beyond his batted-ball tendencies, perhaps even reshaping them to his new circumstances. Maybe the wind patterns will change at Wrigley or he'll be so good on the road that none of these concerns end up mattering.But seeing as Bregman has been bleeding value over the past few years, going from an early-round mainstay to more of a mid-round fallback option in most scoring formats, I think we've all sensed him teetering on the edge of Fantasy significance. This venue change seems consequential enough to topple him over, and so for the first time ever in his long career, I'm saying I'm out on Bregman, at least if he continues to be drafted in the 120 range. Frankly, I'd rather have Paredes.\n            ",

That means they'll be wearing their Navy jersey with their Navy pants. It's a combination that the Bears have only worn six times in franchise history and they've gone 0-6 in those games, including 0-4 against the Packers. First, let's take a look at the threads. \nThe Bears played eight home games during the regular season and they wore the same thing in each game: Their Navy jersey with white pants. The all-Navy look that they'll be wearing on Saturday night will mark the first time in three years that they've gone with their Navy jersey combined with their Navy Pants. \nThe Bears first wore the all-Navy look in 2002 and here's how their six games have gone in the uniforms over the past 23 years:  2002 (Week 5): Packers 34-21 over Bears2006 (Week 17): Packers 26-7 over Bears2016 (Week 7): Packers 26-10 over Bears2017 (Week 1): Falcons 23-17 over Bears2017 (Week 4): Packers 35-14 over Bears2022 (Week 18: Vikings 29-13 over BearsNot only are the Bears 0-6, but they've lost those six games by an average of 15.2 points per game. \nThe Bears are facing the Packers in a postseason game for the third time in franchise history. Despite playing at home, Chicago is going into the game as a 2.5-point underdog. The Bears haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season, which is tied for the third-longest drought in the NFL, and for some reason, they've decided to try and end that drought by wearing a uniform combination that they've never won in. \n            \n    ",

Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard touchdown pass with just 38 seconds left to lead the Los Angeles Rams to a 34-31 comeback win over the Carolina Panthers. In the second game, the Bears stormed back from an 18-point halftime deficit to stun the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard scoring pass with just under two minutes left to play for the game-winning score. The win for the Bears was the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. It was also the third-largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL playoff history. The action will continue on Sunday with a tripleheader that will kickoff with the Jaguars hosting the Bills at 1 p.m. ET on CBS.With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line.

    "body": "\n        For the fourth consecutive time, the Supercopa de España will come down to an El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona took down Athletic Club in a 5-0 rout in the semifinals while Real Madrid squeezed by Atletico Madrid by a 2-1 score in Xabi Alonso's first season as manager of the club. He'll now have a chance to win his first trophy, and it could be a significant one.The last four winners of the Supercopa de España have then gone on to win LaLiga at the end of the season, so while Barcelona have a four-point lead domestically, Real Madrid triumphing on Sunday could deal a psychological blow to Hansi Flick's side. Each Clásico is a compelling installment in this rivalry, and the latest could be one that defines the season. Let's take a look at some things to watch during the match:How to watch Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: Alinma Bank Stadium at King Abdullah Sport City -- Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Barcelona -105; Draw +290; Real Madrid +250Predicted linuepsGiven injuries, there will be plenty of decisions for both coaches, but the biggest is whether Kylian Mbappe will play as he suffers from a knee injury. Odds are that he won't, but with this being a final versus a rival, Alosno could push to have his strongest side available. Barcelona: Joan Garcia, Alejandro Balde, Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Jules Kounde, Frenkie De Jong, Pedri, Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha, Ferran TorresReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Álvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen, Raul Ascencio, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Vinícius Júnior, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo García\nRodrygo is neededKylian Mbappe is going to be brought to Saudi Arabia for the final as the French forward deals with a knee injury, but that doesn't mean he'll feature in the final. Even if it's for gamesmanship, it's good to have Mbappe in Saudi Arabia just to give Flick something to think about, but Gonzalo Garcia has shown that he can lead the line in a pinch, and someone who stepped up in the Madrid derby was Rodrygo. The Brazilian winger has been linked with a move away from the club since Alonso took over, but with a trophy on the line, it was Rodrygo who got the eventual winning goal.He's made the most of limited minutes, and there's still a major role for him to play in the Real Madrid XI, especially in a rivalry match of this magnitude. He only has three goals and six assists in all competitions this season, but cups have been when Rodrygo has shined, scoring twice and assisting two more goals in only six appearances between the Supercopa de España, Copa Del Rey, and Champions League play.Joan Garcia to win the battle of the keepers?Barcelona keeper Joan Garcia crossed rivalry lines, joining from Espanyol to be the number one between the sticks at Barca this past summer. After defeating Athletic Club, he's now kept clean sheets in four consecutive matches and has been able to steady their high-wire attack. Barcelona's high line will leave a keeper isolated, and Garcia's reflexes help make Flick's high line work. But in this final, he'll duel with Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid keeper may be 33 now, but he still hasn't lost a step in top-class shootouts. The Belgian has ensured for years that even when Real Madrid's defense bends that it doesn't break, and with Barcelona looking to enter their next era of great keepers with Marc-Andre ter Stegen not being able to stay on the pitch consistently due to injuries, Garcia will need to outduel his counterpart.\nCan anyone stop Raphinha?Real Madrid were lucky not to be overrun by Atletico Madrid, and allowing similar chances to Barcelona would see them lose this match. Facing Athletic Club, Barcelona were able to open a four-goal lead by halftime while Raphinha netted a brace. Flick was able to rotate the squad with Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo coming off the bench, while Robert Lewandowski was an unused sub. Facing Real Madrid, they'll fully be involved, and it's something that could cause nightmares for what's left of Alonso's defense. Due to injuries, Antonio Rüdiger had to start in the semifinals, which is something that Barcelona will look to take advantage of. Federico Valverde also had to play out of position at right back. He has the work rate for the position, but these are areas that Barcelona will target and could be pivotal to who will come out on top.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 season is officially over for the Green Bay Packers, who blew an 18-point halftime lead in a 31-27 playoff loss to the Chicago Bears on Saturday. There were plenty of reasons why the Packers lost and one of the biggest ones was because Brandon McManus had the first postseason meltdown of his career.The Packers kicker cost his team seven points with two missed field goals and a missed extra point in the four-point loss and he was definitely down on himself after the game. \"The biggest disappointment of my career,\" McManus told reporters after the game. \"It was an embarrassment of a performance. It's disappointing. My role on the team is to make kicks and these guys pour in thousands of plays over the course of the season and I leave seven points on the board today. The most disappointing point of my career ever.\"The fact that McManus struggled was somewhat surprising, if only because he had been one of the most accurate playoff kickers in NFL history going into Saturday's game. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL wild card overreactions: Is Matt LaFleur on hot seat after Packers' meltdown? Are Rams' flaws fatal?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe veteran had kicked in five previous playoff games and hit 11 of 12 field goals (91.7%) while also going four of four on extra points. To put that in perspective, McManus was one of just four kickers in NFL history who hit at least 90% of his playoff field goals (minimum 10 attempts) and 100% of his extra points. His 91.7% accuracy rate in the postseason was also the 10th best number for anyone with at least 10 playoff field goal attempts. After missing just one kick in his first five playoff games, he melted down in Chicago with three misses against the Bears. The first miss by McManus came on the final play before halftime. He actually hit a 55-yard field goal, but it didn't count, because Bears coach Ben Johnson called a timeout. McManus then tried the kick again and sent it wide left. Considering the cold weather and the wind, it's hard to hold this miss against him, but things only got uglier after that. McManus' struggles continued in the fourth quarter after the Packers scored a touchdown that gave Green Bay a 27-16 lead with 6:36 left to play. After the score by Matthew Golden, McManus sent the extra point wide left. This ended up being a huge miss, because if he would have made the kick, the Packers would have gone up 28-16 and that would have changed the game from a strategic standpoint. \nAfter Green Bay's score, the Bears responded with a quick touchdown on an 8-yard scoring pass from Caleb Williams to Olamide Zaccheaus to trim the lead to 27-22. After that score, the Bears went for two (and got it) so they could cut the lead down to a field goal at 27-24. If McManus had made his kick and the score would have been 28-22, the Bears probably would have just kicked the extra point instead of going for two. Following Chicago's touchdown, McManus got a chance to redeem himself, but things only got worse for him after he missed a 44-yard field goal that would have given the Packers a 30-24 lead with 2:51 left to play in the fourth quarter. \nMcManus has struggled from that range all season: He hit just 42.9% of his kicks between 40 and 49 yards this year, which was the lowest percentage in the NFL from that range by far.\nAfter the miss, the Bears drove down and were able to get the go-ahead score when Williams hit D.J. Moore for a 25-yard touchdown to give Chicago a 31-27 lead. If McManus had made his field goal, the Packers would have been trailing 31-30 and they would have needed just a field goal at the end of the game to potentially win. McManus signed a three-year, $15.3 million extension with the Packers back in March, but after his three misses, it's hard to see him returning to Green Bay. The ugly playoff game ends a brutal year for McManus, who hit just 80% of his field goal attempts, which ranked 28th in the NFL for any kicker who played in at least nine games. \n            ",

The Jaguars won eight games in a row to end the season and nine out of 10 following their Week 8 bye. The Jags are arguably the hottest team in football heading into the postseason tournament, and yet they are underdogs at home for their opening-round game.Buffalo did not win the AFC East for the first time since 2019, finishing in second place in the division with a 12-5 record and claiming the No. 6 seed in the AFC. The Bills won five of their final six games following an embarrassing Thursday night loss to the Texans toward the end of November, including a Week 18 blowout of the Jets that took place almost entirely with their backups on the field.Will the Bills be able to capitalize on one of their best chances in recent years, or will the Jaguars ruin their plans? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Jaguars vs. BillsDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: EverBank Stadium (Jacksonville)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -1.5, O/U 51.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey storylinesRed-hot Jaguars. Jacksonville has won eight in a row by an average of more than 19 points per game. The Jags have scored 23-plus points in each of those games and have given up more than 20 only once during that stretch. They've allowed single-digit points more often (three times) than they've allowed teams to get more than 20. The level of competition during the season-ending stretch wasn't particularly high (they played the Colts and Titans twice each, plus the Cardinals and Jets), but in the two games they played during that stretch against playoff teams, they dominated the Chargers 35-6 and handily beat the Broncos 34-20.Buffalo's run defense. If the Bills have a major weakness, it is defending the run. Buffalo has yielded an average of 5.1 yards per carry, the third-worst mark in the NFL. The Bills have given up 100 or more rushing yards in 11 of 17 games, 150 or more in seven of 17 and 200 or more in four of 17. If you can get the run game going, you can control the proceedings against the Bills. The Jaguars averaged just 4.0 yards per carry during the regular season, but they did have four games where they ran for 150 yards or more. All four of those games, though, came in the first 11 weeks of the season.Trevor Lawrence in the playoffs. Lawrence had a fascinating payoff debut a few years ago. He had about as disastrous a first half as humanly possible in the first round against the Chargers, but he came back and led four consecutive touchdown drives and then a game-winning field goal drive to complete a comeback from a 27-0 deficit. While it was obviously an incredible feat, going down by that much against a Bills defense that is far better against the pass than the run wouldn't be quite as easy to accomplish.Josh Allen's best chance? Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, and Joe Burrow and the Bengals are all sitting at home rather than participating in this year's postseason. If ever there were going to be a chance for Allen and the Bills to break through, this would seem like the year. Of course, they'll likely have to go on the road three times (unless the Chargers win this week and next) just to make it to the Super Bowl thanks to the fact that they didn't win the division this year, which makes it tougher to do. Still, many are going to consider this Buffalo's best opportunity thanks to the wide-open nature of the conference field and the lack of the other inner-circle superstar quarterbacks in the tournament.Prediction\nThe Jags are arguably the hottest team in the NFL. Trevor Lawrence is playing the best ball of his career. Liam Coen is a Coach of the Year candidate. The defense has forced at least one turnover in six straight games and at least two in five of them. And yet... the Bills have Josh Allen, and I cannot bring myself to bet against the best quarterback in the AFC side of the bracket -- even when going on the road. Between Allen and James Cook, I think Buffalo will be able to move the ball here, and in a close game I am always going to ride with the team that has a better quarterback. That's Buffalo. \nPrediction: Bills 26, Jaguars 23\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Hugo Ekitike is in contention to return to what Arne Slot suggested would be a strong Liverpool squad that take on Barnsley in the FA Cup third round on Monday night. Ekitike missed draws against Fulham and Arsenal with what his manager termed a minor hamstring issue, forcing the Reds to field what looked like dramatically weakened attacks given the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak.Ekitike has been one of the best performers in a disappointing season for Liverpool so far and his return will be a welcome one. Asked if anyone would be available for the visit of League One opposition to Anfield, Slot immediately namechecked Ekitike, though he added, \"That's not 100% sure, but we will do everything to have him available on Monday.\"Wataru Endo is also due to return to training, strengthening Liverpool's defensive options at a time when they are fearing the worst over what looked to be a serious knee injury for Conor Bradley at Arsenal on Thursday night. Of Japan international Endo, Slot said, \"If I'm correct, he might start to train one of these days, but he's been out for two months now. That's, of course different than being out for one week [like Ekitike has been].\"Federico Chiesa is another one whose role will be under consideration, particularly with Salah still at the Africa Cup of Nations as Egypt advanced to the semifinals on Saturday. Despite the absence of Salah and Isak, Chiesa has not seen his game time dramatically expanded in recent weeks, a rare start against Wolves on December 27 the first time he has played over an hour for Liverpool this season. Slot, however, gave an indication that the Italy international was happy with his game time.\n\"I spoke to him two days ago and he said to me that he played more in the recent weeks than he ever did before under me,\" Slot said. \"He is one of the players that could feature in that game, definitely. But like I said, Hugo might be back, so let's see how we will start that game. He's one of the options that I have.\"Whatever the exact nature of the XI, Slot has indicated he will name a strong side for Monday night's game, which comes against an opponent who currently sit 17th in the League One standings. Still, Barnsley have overcome the odds at Anfield before, the last meeting between these two sides seeing Rafa Benitez's Reds dumped out in the fifth round in 2008 in dramatic fashion. Slot may be relatively new to the English game, but he has already learned the hard way the risk of undervaluing opposition in the FA Cup.\nAs they competed on four fronts last season, Slot opted to make 10 changes to his side for the fourth round against struggling Plymouth Argyle, the game falling just three days before the Merseyside derby. The gamble backfired spectacularly as Ryan Hardie's second half penalty earned Argyle a famous underdog win. This time it appears that the Dutchman is not prepared to play too fast and loose with what might be Liverpool's best chance of silverware this season.\"Last season I made the decision that some players needed to rest in the FA Cup because you cannot play every player every single time,\" Slot said. \"It's obvious that we're not in the League Cup anymore and the FA Cup has always been very important for us. Sometimes in a season where you are still competing for the League Cup, for the Champions League and the league, with the amount of players we had last season and have this season, you have to make choices. \"I can guarantee you that on Monday you will see all the players you saw against Arsenal maybe with some substitutions but then they will be on the bench. That's going to be different than last season against Plymouth.\"\nViewing information: Liverpool vs. BarnsleyDate: Monday, Jan. 12 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, United KingdomTV: ESPN SelectOdds: Liverpool -600; Draw +600; Barnsley +1100\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers versus the Chicago Bears, the NFL's oldest/most-played rivalry with 213 games on the books including their upcoming playoff matchup, will be reignited for a third time in the 2025 season. Each team won at home in the regular season with both games ending in a one-score win. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams threw an interception to Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon with 27 seconds to play to seal a 28-21 Packers home win in Week 14 while Williams threw a 46-yard, game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver DJ Moore in a 22-16 overtime win in Week 16.   The last time these two teams played in Week 16, Packers quarterback Jordan Love got knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter, but he'll be back for this matchup after sitting out the final two games of the regular season. Love is a perfect 4-0 against the Bears in the four matchups with Chicago that he has started and finished in his three seasons as Green Bay's starting quarterback. The loss in Week 16 in 2025 and the loss in Week 18 in 2024 involved backup quarterback Malik Willis finishing the game because of an injury to Love. Green Bay is making its third playoff appearance in three seasons with Love as the team's starting quarterback while Chicago is making its first playoff appearance since 2020 and first of Williams' career under the guidance of first-year head coach Ben Johnson. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's almost time for the Packers vs. Bears grudge match at Soldier Field in the postseason after two thrilling, one-possession wins for each team this regular season. Here are the key things to know plus a game prediction for the first Green Bay vs. Chicago playoff game since the 2010 NFC Championship game, a game that was won 21-14 at Soldier Field by the visiting Packers en route to a Super Bowl XLV title. \nWhere to watch Bears vs. Packers liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 10 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Soldier Field (Chicago, Illinois)Stream: Amazon Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -1.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPackers vs. Bears: Need to know\nHow crisp will Jordan Love, Josh Jacobs and Zack Tom be for Packers' offense? Love, running back Josh Jacobs and right tackle Zack Tom are all varying degrees of banged up. Love (concussion) should be good to go after not playing contact football for three weeks by the time this playoff matchup kicks off on Saturday night. Running back Josh Jacobs has been dealing with a knee issue since tweaking it on the MetLife Stadium turf back in Week 11. He had just four carries for three yards in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens before sitting out the Week 18 season finale at the Minnesota Vikings. Right tackle Zack Tom suffered a knee injury in Week 15 at the Denver Broncos, and he hasn't played since. Tom practiced as a limited participant every day this week while both Love and Jacobs are no longer on the team's injury report. That's an encouraging sign for Green Bay.Can the Bears' No. 3 rush offense take advantage of depleted Packers defensive line? \nOne of a number of things Ben Johnson was able to take with him from the Detroit Lions to the Chicago Bears in 2025 was a successful run game. Chicago is averaging 144.5 rushing yards per game this season, the third-most in the NFL this season. Green Bay is without both All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons (ACL) and stout defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle). Since Week 16, with both sidelined, the Packers are allowing an NFL-worst 198.0 rushing yards per game. Yes, that average is inflated by Derrick Henry's all-time performance (216 yards and four touchdowns on 36 carries) against them in Week 17, but the Packers did allow the Bears to rush for 150 against them in the Week 16 defeat at Soldier Field. This would appear to be an advantage for Chicago.Who is going to force the game-tilting turnover on defense? Packers safety Xavier McKinney totaled eight interceptions in 2024, the second-most in the league. Bears safety Kevin Byard led the NFL with eight interceptions in 2025. Which one of them will take away a football that flutters an extra second longer in the area out of the hand of Love or Williams after perhaps being hit on a throw? \nAs long as both quarterbacks remain healthy, this game has the makings of a high-scoring affair like the 28-21 Packers victory in Week 14. Whichever team can force that one crucial takeaway could take control of the game. Packers vs. Bears prediction\nWith Love healthy once again, he'll have a similar performance like he did in the first matchup between these teams when he threw three touchdowns, including a couple explosives to No. 1 receiver Christian Watson. Williams will play well like he did at the San Francisco 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17, but like that night in Santa Clara, he'll come up just short in his first NFL playoff game. Pick: Packers 31, Bears 27 | (Packers -1.5, Over 44.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers are no strangers to facing one another in the playoffs. Over the course of Tom Brady and Phillip Rivers' tenures, these organizations squared off three times, with the most recent contest coming back in the 2018 divisional round. Ironically enough, that postseason was the last time either franchise has recorded a playoff win, and both are trying to rectify that on Sunday night in Foxborough. This time around, while it won't be a Brady vs. Rivers clash, we do get quite the quarterback matchup as Drake Maye and Justin Herbert represent two of the brightest young quarterbacks that the league has to offer. In Year 2, Maye has put together an MVP-caliber season that helped propel New England from a 4-13 team over his rookie season to an AFC East-winning 14-3 club in 2025. As for Herbert, he's continued to blossom in his second season under Jim Harbaugh, ranking among the top-10 passing yard leaders in the league. And that quarterback head-to-head is just the tip of the iceberg of what should be a highly competitive playoff contest. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore we dive further into this matchup, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this game. \nWhere to watch Chargers vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough)TV: NBCOdds: Patriots -3.5, O/U 46.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsCan Drake Maye stay hot vs. Chargers defense? \nNew England's second-year quarterback has taken a quantum leap in Year 2, ascending as high as an MVP candidate. Maye became just the 10th quarterback since 1970 to lead the NFL in completion percentage and yards per attempt. He's also now the youngest of that group to do so. One of Maye's key strengths this season has been his proficiency in throwing the deep ball, but that could be put to the test on Sunday as he faces a stout Chargers secondary. Both Maye and the Chargers defense rank top-two in the league in completions, completion percentage, and passing touchdowns on or against passes of 15-plus air yards. Passing 15+ air yards this seasonDrake MayeChargers defenseCompletions7131Completion percentage58%33%Passing touchdown 124If L.A. can keep New England's deep passing attack on the tarmac and force them into more of a dink-and-dunk attack, it'll go a long way towards keeping this game close. Conversely, if Maye can find success with chunk plays through the air, we could be in for a shootout with Herbert on the other side.  Can the Chargers protect Justin Herbert? On the one hand, you have to commend the Chargers for withstanding the losses of both star tackles in Rashawn Slater (torn patellar tendon in August), along with Joe Alt (season-ending ankle injury in Week 9), and still reaching the postseason. However, their ability to protect the quarter has naturally worsened throughout the year. Overall, Los Angeles surrendered a franchise-high 60 sacks this season, the fifth most ever by a playoff team. Specifically, the offense's production after losing Alt took a noticeable dip. With Alt, the team was averaging 25.3 points per game. After he went down, that average dropped to 21.3 points per game. As it relates to Herbert, he averaged 8.3 yards per attempt this season when Alt was blocking for him, and that fell to 6.5 yards per attempt in his absence. New England doesn't have the best pass rush, but they are no slouches either, ranking just outside the top 10 in pressure rate (12th). So L.A.'s ability (or inability) to protect Herbert will be a central storyline. How does New England look vs. playoff competition?As impressive as New England's turnaround has been this season, increasing its win total by +10 (tied for the best year-over-year increase in NFL history), it's worth noting that its road was pretty soft. The Patriots' strength of schedule was the easiest since the 1999 Rams. They were 13-1 against teams with losing records this year and 1-2 against teams with winning records. Can you fault the Patriots for simply playing against teams that the NFL put in front of them? Of course not. However, we can be a bit skeptical of their actual ceiling until they prove to us that they can take down playoff-caliber competition, and that starts on Sunday against the 11-6 Chargers.X factorWhen we talk about some of the NFL's most talented quarterbacks, Justin Herbert comes up more often than not. He's coming off a 2025 regular season where he ranked inside the top 10 in passing yards, rushing yards, and passing touchdowns. Herbert has the second-most passing yards in his first six seasons (24,820) all-time, only looking up to Peyton Manning. As prolific a start as Herbert has enjoyed to begin his career, that success has been exclusive to the regular season. He's 0-2 in his playoff career, and those two losses have been noteworthy. The first was the Chargers blowing a 27-0 lead to the Jaguars during the 2022 playoffs. The second came last year, when he and L.A. were blown out by 20 by the Texans, as he threw four interceptions and posted a career-low 44% completion rate. That naturally raises the question of whether Herbert is the type of quarterback who can succeed in the postseason. If what we've seen in the past is who he'll remain to be, this game will be over in a hurry. If he can perform more as he has in the regular season, the narrative will begin to change, making him a true wild card over this Wild Card Weekend.Chargers vs. Patriots prediction, pickI think we're at a point with Herbert where we need to see it to believe it before deciding to back him in a playoff setting. Due to everything we mentioned above, it seems a little dicey to trust him in this spot, particularly being on the road and having a depleted offensive line. Meanwhile, the Patriots have gotten healthier in the trenches in recent weeks, welcoming back left tackle Will Campbell and defensive tackle Milton Williams in Week 18. Campbell should help keep Maye upright, while Williams will likely contribute to Herbert hitting the turf more than he'd like. Given that this game will be played in Foxborough, we'll say that helps New England get over the hump en route to the divisional round. (Prediction: Patriots 24, Chargers 20 | Pick: Patriots -3.5). \n            ",

For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen six teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals, Raiders, Ravens, and Dolphins) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons) -- the Dolphins fired their GM midseason. Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and you have 25% of the league looking for a new head coach. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader.

Harbaugh was the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach after Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, who knocked him out of the playoffs with a Week 18 victory that may have clinched his departure. While this is the end of an era in Baltimore, the Ravens suddenly become the top available job in the NFL simply due to the presence of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. Completed interviewsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (team announced)David Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (team announced)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (team announced)Interview requestsAnthony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (The Athletic)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Brian Flores -- Vikings defensive coordinator (NFL Media)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Kliff Kingsbury -- former Commanders offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Robert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinator (ESPN)Joe Brady -- Bills offensive coordinator (NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsPrevious head coach: Kevin StefanskiCleveland moved on from Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season in 2025 that saw the franchise finish last in the AFC North.

The Raiders finished with the worst record in the NFL (3-14) and now possess the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft. General manager John Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady are expected to spearhead the coaching search. Interview requestsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (ESPN)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (Sports Illustrated)Davis Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (ESPN)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious head coach: Mike McDanielThe Dolphins waited a bit longer to make a decision regarding Mike McDaniel's future with the organization, firing him on the Thursday afte the regular season. Initially, it looked as if McDaniel had saved his job, but Stephen Ross, after a meeting this week to discuss the season, decided to cut bait and go through a total reset. It's slated to be transformative offseason in Miami, as it now needs a new head coach and general manager and is likely to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. Interview requestsKlint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (team announcement)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsPrevious head coach: Brian DabollNew York fired Daboll midway through the 2025 season after a 2-8 start to the year.

He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank as he combs through candidates this time around. Interview requestsIan Cunningham -- Bears assistant general manager (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones) (for President of Football role)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious GM: Chris GrierIt was a rather seismic decision by the Dolphins and Grier to mutually part ways during the 2025 season, simply due to how long his tenure had been with the organization. He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. \nHIRED: Jon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel.

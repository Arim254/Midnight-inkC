    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, will run from Friday, Feb. 6 through Sunday, Feb. 22. Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour did not wait long to offer its second signature event of the season, as the circuit will bring the best players in the world down the California coast to Los Angeles, where they will compete in Tiger Woods' tournament, which is making its return to Riviera Country Club. In 2025, the Genesis Invitational had to move to Torrey Pines due to the devastating fires in L.A., so Riviera will certainly be a welcome sight for all involved. There are four past champions of this event in the field this week -- Ludvig Åberg (reigning champion), Hideki Matsuyama, Max Homa and Adam Scott -- but the biggest names in the field will all be vying for their first wins at Riviera. That list includes Scottie Scheffler, who has made furious comebacks the last two weeks to finish in the top 3 after slow starts, and Rory McIlroy, who began his 2026 PGA Tour season with an up-and-down T14 finish in Pebble Beach.Scheffler will be tasked with making another significant comeback just to fall inside the cut this week, as he opened the first day of play tied for last in the field, going 5 over across his first 10 holes before Round 1 was halted due to darkness. McIlroy went 5 under for his round, sitting one shot back of the lead after completing his first 18 holes.\nCollin Morikawa will also be back in action after winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am for his first victory on the PGA Tour since 2023, showing the form that once made him the No. 2 player in the world. Tommy Fleetwood, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley and Patrick Cantlay round out the group of favorites this week in L.A., as they all hope to receive a trophy from Woods and a big winner's check at the end of the week. Here's how you can watch Scheffler, McIlroy and everyone else competing at Tiger's event this week. 2026 Genesis Invitational TV scheduleAll times Eastern Round 2 - FridayRound 2 starts: 10:15 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 10:15 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveLive TV coverage: 4-8 p.m. on Golf ChannelLive streaming: 4-8 p.m. on NBC Sports App\nRadio: 2-8 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 10:15 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 10:15 a.m. - 7 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-7 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-7 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppRadio: 1-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 9:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 9:45 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports App\nLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppRadio: 1-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

    "body": "\n        From teetering on the edge of going out of business during the early 2000s to preparing to kick off a league's 31st season with some of the best players in the world, Major League Soccer has come a long way since the first ball was kicked between the San Jose Clash and D.C. United in 1996. What started as a mandate to bring first division soccer to the United States as a stipulation in landing the 1994 World Cup has become one of the top soccer leagues in the world, with no signs of slowing down. Beginning with only 10 teams in 1996, there will be 30 teams in action this weekend, as the league has grown in unimaginable ways. From multimillion-dollar facilities to the presence on national teams and World Cup rosters, and of course, Lionel Messi, the fingerprints of MLS will be all over the 2026 World Cup, taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico this summer.MLS commissioner Don Garber summed this up well during his state of the league address in December, saying, \"We'd love to say that [the World Cup is] the rocket fuel, but this jet has been running for 30 years, and it's going to run for another 30.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In what will be the biggest World Cup in history, the 2026 tournament will expand to 48 teams for the first time, featuring at least four first-time qualifiers. It's expected to surpass records set by the 1994 World Cup, which is still the most attended in history. The 16 host cities are only the tip of the iceberg as well, with training facilities being picked out all around North America to ensure that national teams can have a true home away from home. But for any of this to happen, it goes back to the soccer builders in this country -- Lamar Hunt (of the Hunt family that owns the Kansas City Chiefs), Alan Rothenberg, Philip Anschutz, and so many more.Only a few may have expected things would advance so far when MLS started. However, for the first commissioner in league history, Doug Logan, this doesn't surprise him in the slightest.\n\"Yes, I did,\" Logan said when asked if he expected to see the best players in the world playing in MLS. \"People ask me that all the time. And the answer is yes. Part of the responsibility and the charge to the top leader in entities like this is to be able to have a vision of what could be and then tirelessly and ceaselessly keep the institution and the organization on that track. I realized where it was going to go. Not where it could go, but where it was going to go.\"I also realized after the first year or a year and a half that it was going to take longer and be more expensive to get there than my owners anticipated, And those were two realities for me, but if you're asking me, did I ever envision it getting to this, the answer is yes.\"NASL collapses, MLS risesEven with the league being founded in the wake of the North American Soccer League collapsing, that didn't stop investors like the Hunt family from buying into the potential that MLS could have. The NASL brought Pele to North America, and the New York Cosmos are still to this day one of the most recognizable American soccer brands, despite not having played a game since 2020 -- although that will change in March as they take the pitch to face Portland Hearts of Pine in New Jersey in USL League One.\nAt times, being able to keep that vision may have been easier said than done, especially during a period when Anschutz owned six of the league's 10 clubs, but the message remained the same. The people involved with the founding of MLS saw the potential in the league, and it was massive, but to come full circle with another World Cup on United States soil is where things are special in this moment of reflection. It may have taken longer than expected to get the World Cup back, but this is where the league can show how far it has come from the days of 10 clubs and franchises folding (Tampa Bay Mutiny, Miami Fusion, Chivas USA) and take advantage of the increased interest in soccer in America during it.MLS cities, facilities to have huge impactHost cities during the FIFA Club World Cup took notice when Boca Juniors fans descended on Miami, ES Tunis fans took over Times Square, and Brazilian fans marched from the Art Museum in Philadelphia, and it's an effect that will only be magnified during the World Cup. Kansas City will be central to this, with Algeria, Argentina, England, and the Netherlands all training in the Kansas City region.\"A World Cup puts the host country and all of the host cities on the global map. And of course, Kansas City is a big city, but from a global standpoint, it's probably not a very well-known city, with maybe the exception of its American football league team, which has garnered a little bit of global recognition over the last six or seven years,\" said Clark Hunt, chairman and CEO of the Hunt Sports Group, which owns the Chiefs and MLS club FC Dallas. \"But I really expect that Kansas City will become known globally because of its role in hosting World Cup games.\"\nMLS facilities have come a long way during this time, as the new Red Bull New York training facility in Harrison, N.J., that will open in March has a price tag higher than most early soccer-specific stadiums as over $120 million. That facility will host the Brazil national team during this summer's World Cup. Many of the league's newest facilities have garnered praise globally, with players noting the differences as well as teams and executives abroad taking note, but with national teams making the United States their home during the summer, it will be a true show of what these facilities have to offer. They were a large part of why the first expanded World Cup is taking place in the United States, and who knows, the facilities could lead to a few transfers into MLS following the World Cup. During a changing tide of American soccer, even those will be easier with the league looking to adopt a summer-to-spring schedule shift in 2027 to aling with the rest of the soccer world. It's one of many reasons why this World Cup feels like as much of an inflection point as it does a celebration of soccer, which was also the case in 1994, which brought the pressure of a new league, as there wasn't even a commissioner until November of 1995, before beginning play in 1996.\n\"I had less than three months before we were going to play in 10 cities. It was a whirlwind kickstart. We had an incredibly successful first year because everyone was kicking the tires and thinking that it's going to be like the World Cup, and leagues are not like the World Cup. Leagues are there to endure and stay and have a legacy,\" Logan said.And more than 30 years later, MLS has endured and is building its legacy brick by brick. This year won't have such a sprint compared to what '94 did, but with the coming shift, it's clear that the league is also entering a new era. New stadium projects will also see New York City FC's time playing at Yankee Stadium come to an end, and MLS has a massive opportunity in the wake of the World Cup.But the trajectory doesn't end there because it also impacts the youth level, which MLS EVP and Chief Communications Officer Dan Courtemanche notes.\n\"We're a league now that has elite player development and incredible facilities, and 43,000 kids playing in MLS NEXT. My son plays U15 MLS NEXT. He's with an elite club; he plays against the Red Bulls, New York City FC, the Revolution, and D.C. United, and I see the sophistication now at the youth level,\" Courtemanche said. \"This is my 34th season about to start in professional soccer but I'm only a few season in when it comes to viewing it as a soccer parent at a serious level, and my son, when he's done within 24 to 36 hours, he goes onto Taka.io, the software program, our partners, and he can see videos of all the key plays that he made, the pluses and the minuses and it helps him evaluate his game he works with his coach and it makes him better, and I gotta tell you, I didn't see that coming probably even five or 10 years ago that 43,000 kids have access to that.\"With players like Alex Freeman and Obed Vargas making the jump to top level European leagues this year and others like Cavan Sullivan set to follow in the future, the impact of MLS Next on youth soccer can't be understated as well as the impact that the United Soccer League has in offering more pathways and opportunities for people to play and learn about soccer who may not have previously been able to.Capitalizing on the World Cup waveWhile there's optimism about what MLS can gain from the World Cup, it's critical to catch soccer fans soon after the World Cup. It's easier to do when the league can now say, \"Look at these players who were at the World Cup, you can keep watching them in MLS,\" which isn't something that could've been said to this degree in previous World Cups outside of members of North American national teams. Truth be told, 2022 was a banner year for MLS at the World Cup, and the 2026 edition is set to be even bigger. Messi joined MLS in the following summer, and he won the Ballon d'Or as a member of Inter Miami for his production in 2022.\nLionel Messi's 2023 Ballon d'Or was awarded to him as a member of Inter Miami. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \"During the last two years, in total attendance, we were the second-highest attended league in the world behind the Premier League. And I wouldn't have imagined that either,\" Courtemanche said. \"So look, the world's game is here. It's continuing. And even during the World Cup in 2022, we had 37 players from Major League Soccer competing for various national teams. That was more than any other league in the Western Hemisphere.\"But how that conversion is done is critical. Just because someone watches the World Cup doesn't mean that they'll automatically decide that MLS is the league for them, but the league will need to ensure that it capitalizes on those people sampling soccer to turn them into domestic fans.\"One of the things that has happened after every World Cup in recent times is that the domestic league that plays in the host country receives a big boost,\" Hunt said. \"If you look at the attendance numbers, the TV viewership, in the year or two after a country hosts the World Cup, those numbers grow significantly. And I think in a country like the United States, where we still have an opportunity to create a lot of new soccer fans, I think that'll be particularly pronounced. And so MLS will have a real opportunity to benefit both in terms of fans attending games and watching the league on TV. So I think that's very exciting for Major League Soccer and something that we need to make sure we capitalize on.\"\nMLS isn't a league that has been around for the vast majority of Americans' lives like some other places that have hosted World Cups, but with a fandom that tends to a younger demographic, the league can set itself up well for the next 30-plus years, although, hopefully, it won't take that long for the World Cup to return to America. Soccer in America has come a long way since the last World Cup, and it could be unrecognizable, taking another look back in the future, in a good way, considering the successes that have happened since the MLS' founding. American players have taken massive steps over the last several years, and MLS has as well. They are counting on their growth to continue, be further cultivated by the World Cup, and for the next set of years to bring exponential growth initial founders could have only dreamed of.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Roughly four months and 120 miles away from the Los Angeles-area stadium, where he will likely make his World Cup debut, Matt Freese was staying in the moment. In that particular moment, it was probably just as easy said as it was done – there were fire pits and palm trees in his line of sight, he and his New York City FC teammates trading one of the East coast's most brutal winters in recent memory for comfortable days in Palm Springs with a week and change left to go until their MLS season opener at the LA Galaxy.It is a perfect place to settle back into the rhythms of professional soccer, but far from the only pocket of North America where the cadence is shifting. A new MLS season finally begins on Saturday, one that will keep a wide range of people busy, each of them saddled with a variety of tasks, all of it in the shadow of this summer's World Cup. The world's biggest sporting event returns to the continent for the first time since 1994, the circumstances and spotlight as different as it gets from the last time around. MLS' decision makers will have their hands full with capitalizing on an event that rarely comes to their shores, all while hoping the arrival of global superstars like Lionel Messi and Son Heung-min creates meaningful momentum along the way. They will balance those tasks with implementing the finishing touches on their switch to a fall-to-spring calendar that will be complete next year, a move that brings them in alignment with many of the sport's top leagues.For a selection of players, though, the timing is more pressing. The start of the MLS season marks a final chance to impress national team coaches before roster selections are due in late spring, a feeling that is especially pertinent for American players. Since taking charge in October 2024, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has picked frequently from MLS' talent pool and is slated to bring a healthy number of players from the domestic league to a World Cup on home soil. The odds of earning a role that only comes around every four years naturally vary from player to player, but they share both a common goal and the unique balancing act of club and country responsibilities in a World Cup year. In some sense, the two tasks go hand in hand.\"[I'm] incredibly grateful for that opportunity,\" Freese said about his reps with the USMNT before pivoting, \"and really, really just focused on staying as present as possible and doing as well as I can and improving every day so that I can pay them back for that trust they've shown in me.\"\nFreese seizes his opportunityFreese was a regular fixture with NYCFC before he received his first call-up to the national team last January and did not earn his first cap until June, his rise up the USMNT's goalkeeper depth chart hard to predict. It happened all at once, though – successive starts en route to the Concacaf Gold Cup final and some penalty heroics along the way mean the job has been his ever since, a quick turn of events. If it has felt like a whirlwind, the 27-year-old does not show any signs of it.\"I think a lot more opportunity presented itself and a lot more minutes but it wasn't necessarily unexpected because I had been training for that and working for that moment, so that when it came, because I had faith that it would come, just to be ready for it,\" Freese said. \"It happened quickly, but it was what I had been working for and what I had been preparing for and so no, I didn't do too much reflecting on that or anything like that in the offseason.\"Heading into his eighth MLS season and his fourth as a regular starter, the new campaign will be his first with a World Cup on the horizon, which comes with a new workload – but not with new priorities in the offseason. He did not have a specialized training regimen during the winter and instead stuck to familiar patterns, including a chance to unwind after the 2025 campaign came to a close. \n\"I think it would be a mistake to change the way I prepare for a season just because of the potential of such a big moment in the middle of it,\" he said. \"The first 10 days of every offseason for me and many of the guys is really just absolutely no soccer conversations, nothing – no soccer-watching, soccer playing, no working out, nothing. Either you go on vacation or you just hang out. I had been on the road – I think I was in a hotel like 170 days last year, so I didn't really want to travel. I just chilled at home in my apartment, I saw friends. I just tried to keep it as low-key as possible because I wanted the reset to be refreshing rather than tiring.\"The way his season ended, with a 5-1 defeat at Inter Miami a week before the Florida side won their first MLS Cup, keeps him just as motivated to perform for NYCFC as a chance of impressing during his first World Cup does.\"I want to win a trophy,\" he admitted. \"I look at our new sporting director, Todd [Dunivant, a four-time MLS Cup-winning player], and he has so many trophies in his cabinet and when I heard about him and quickly read up on him when he was named the sporting director, my first thought was, 'Oh my god, he has so many trophies and accomplishments,' and that example kind of shows how trophies live forever and that really just your name or your team's name in history so that is, on the club side, a massive, massive goal from me this year.\"\nFreese's ambitions are lofty, which only reinforces his need to stay focused on what's directly in front of him.\"I'm a pretty old-fashioned, stay in the moment-esque guy,\" he said. \"I don't use my phone a lot. I really try to just avoid the distractions that come with being a professional athlete in the 21st century and two more things. I meditate a lot. I don't sleep in the room with my phone in it. I like to be really just ingrained in what is currently and presently happening, and what currently is presently happening is I'm in preseason with my team and trying to just focus on my team and spend time with them and gel off the field and on the field and FaceTime my loved ones back home when I can.\"Getting too far ahead of himself is not his style, joking that he will reflect on his career when he's 40 and retired. It is not the only thing he's saving for a conversation a decade and change from now.\n\"It's a long story,\" he said apologetically in reference to a remark about penalty kicks \"being his thing\" during last summer's Gold Cup. \"I don't really want to get into it. Sorry … That's another thing, when I'm 40, I'll talk about it.\"The push and pull of the World CupWhile Freese is likely to be a headliner on a list of MLS players who will be World Cup-bound in the summertime, the league's 30 clubs are full of players who will take a very different approach to the upcoming tournament. There's Cade Cowell, a one-time U.S. youth international who is the New York Red Bulls' marquee signing ahead of a rebuilding season. Reminders of the senior national team are all around him, even if he has not been in camp for roughly two years – the World Cup is top of mind for most, while the Red Bulls' new head coach Michael Bradley comes with a decorated USMNT pedigree of his own.\"I think every American player, it's still a goal to be on the World Cup [roster] and last year, I didn't get a chance to go to any camps,\" he said. \"I know the window's tight, but it's in God's hands and whatever happens, I'm going to work my hardest to get there … When you're in the camps it's a very, very good culture. Everyone is very nice. It's very, very fun. I do miss it and it'll definitely be back.\"\nPochettino's project to cast a wide net with his player pool means players like Cowell still hope for a World Cup roster spot, even if there are only 26 to go around every four years, the dream at least providing \"motivation to keep [going],\" in the player's words. Pochettino's open-door policy comes with a hint of added incentive for someone like Cowell, a winger hopes to integrate seamlessly into Bradley's version of the Red Bull way that hopes to attack quickly and settle into a defensive shape just as fast.\"I would say help defensively a little bit more, I can always do that,\" he said. \"Every attacker doesn't like to do it but it's something we have to do and finishing off plays, whether that's a shot or a cross and just making the right decision once you're in front of goal.\"Then there's LAFC captain Hugo Lloris, for whom World Cup experiences are unforgettable – and in the rearview mirror. He captained France to their World Cup triumph in 2018, took part in their run to the final in 2022 and retired from the national team soon after, now in a fully different phase of his career ahead of his third MLS season.\n\"I'm more relaxed than I used to be,\" he noted. \"I take football in a less intense way, I would say, and that's also one of the reasons I come to discover a new football, a new environment and in a way, I can also enjoy my time with my family so it's a good mix but I still want to compete and I still want to challenge myself but I would say in a different way. It's very different than [what] I used to face in Europe but my motivation is still the same.\"He has chosen the route of focusing solely on the club game, no small tasks ahead of him. LAFC, now under the steward of former assistant and new head coach Marc dos Santos, are angling for silverware as they balance the demands of MLS, the Concacaf Champions Cup and the Leagues Cup in 2026.\"I think we used to be really good and we developed a strong reputation the way we used to play, especially in transition, using the speed and the pace from offensive players,\" Lloris said. \"I think today we want to keep this strength but at the same time, we want to get more control of games so we try to be more in possession, try to occupy our opponents' field in a better way, so by bringing more discipline in terms of positions with and without the ball. Also, we want to keep something that we used to do well the last two years, the way we used to press the opponent, we want to keep the same philosophy but I think we just want to become more dominant and manage games in a way we really want and it doesn't matter who we are facing, who is the opponent, we just want to play in the same way.\"\nLloris' World Cup days are behind him but as he contemplates at age 39 if this will be his final season as a professional, he embodies the multi-pronged approach many in North America have taken with this summer's tournament in mind. The ex-France international is an ambassador for soccer in a country that's still learning to embrace it, choosing to carry out his duties by sharing his experiences with players and other club staff eager to integrate any lessons in their day-to-day.\"For me, it's very simple,\" he said about his objectives for the year ahead. \"It's to keep enjoying football, the competition. There is no limit. I'm also here to share my experience in football so I have this responsibility to lead the youngest players in a roster. I'm here to help but the main thing is to keep enjoying my football. I know that I don't see further than next year and I don't want to see it so I just enjoy day by day.\"He is, at times, an influential observer of soccer's grip on the U.S., boasting the expertise to know what a successful run for the USMNT could mean for the sport's future in the country. Lloris, though, feels that things are already trending in the right direction.\n\"I really see a development,\" he said. \"I see my girls competing, playing soccer [at school] and I see parents, I will say, dedicated to the game and I think it's coming. It's growing in terms of popularity. It's growing in terms of demand and I think for the American national team, it's also a big challenge ahead of them because they [have a] responsibility, they are the face of soccer in the U.S. and they have to perform and show a great identity towards their fans but I'm quite comfortable about the future of soccer. I'm sure it will continue to grow in the U.S.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Every Friday leading up to conference tournaments, I'll take an early look at some of Saturday's biggest college basketball games based on the opening lines. This Saturday features the college basketball Game of the Year between Michigan and Duke, while Houston hosts Arizona in a key Big 12 matchup.  I'll give an early lean for each game and where I think the line will move closer to tip-off. These are just leans, unless I mention I officially gave out a pick on SportsLine in the analysis.Note: Saturday's opening lines and subject to change. Michigan Wolverines vs. Duke Blue DevilsMichigan -2.5, 148.5 (DraftKings)\nI have a list of 10 teams I believe can make a realistic Final Four run, then there is a pretty wide gap to the next group. Obviously, Michigan and Duke are near the top of the list, so this is a monster matchup on a neutral court in late February. I can't argue against taking the points with Duke here. However, it's just hard for me to go against Michigan in a big game. The Wolverines have passed every test this season when stepping up in class, with their lone loss coming against a Wisconsin team that hit 45 percent from 3-point range. Having said all that, Duke is better than any team Michigan has faced this season. The Blue Devils have also excelled when facing tough competition, with wins over Kansas, Arkansas, Florida, Michigan State and Louisville. This game is close to dead even on paper. The one thing that stands out is Michigan can struggle with turnovers. The Blue Devils are the best team in the ACC in creating turnovers and turning those mistakes into points. I think the key number is 15. If Michigan has 15 or more turnovers, Duke wins. I'm probably just going to watch this game, although my lean is to the Under. These are the two top defensive teams on KenPom, and neither shoots a lot of 3-pointers. Another factor could be free throw shooting. Both teams are average from the foul line, shooting below 74% on the season. I lean Under at 148.5, and think that number will go down by tip-off. Lean: Under 148.5Bet the Under in Michigan vs. Duke at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their bet wins:Arizona Wildcats at Houston CougarsHouston -4.5, 141.5 (FanDuel)\nI already gave out Houston -3.5 on the DraftKings opening number. As of early Friday, FanDuel still had the Cougars -4.5 with all the other major sportsbooks at 5.5. I took the 3.5 right away because the lines in these high-profile Big 12 games have all gone up, even when I thought the number would go the other way. Arizona-Houston is following that trend. Oddsmakers have given the top Big 12 teams a big edge for home court, and so far it hasn't deterred bettors from backing the favorites. This is one of the few times I am going with my gut. Houston doesn't really have many big statistical edges here. The game is pretty even on paper, but the way to attack the Cougars is from the perimeter. Defending the 3-point line is one of Houston's only defensive weaknesses, that's why Texas Tech is a tough matchup for them. Shooting 3s isn't Arizona's game, though. The Wildcats rank last in the Big 12 in 3-point attempts per game. We'll find out a lot about Houston in the next week with games against Arizona and Kansas. I still believe the Cougars are one of the top three or four best teams in the country, and I like them at home coming off the close loss to Iowa State. I would bet Houston at -4.5. Anything higher is a lean. Lean: Houston -4.5Bet the Cougars to cover the spread in Arizona vs. Houston at FanDuel, where new users get get $100 in bonus bets if the bet wins:Kentucky Wildcats at Auburn TigersAuburn -2.5, 156.5 (FanDuel)\nLast week in this article I leaned the Wildcats +11.5 and over 152.5 against Florida, with both of those hitting. I'm going back to the well here with Kentucky and the Over. I mentioned earlier this season in the SportsLine Discord that I thought there might be a point in the season where the bottom falls out on Auburn. It's not easy losing a legendary coach like Bruce Pearl, and I didn't think the overall talent level was where it's been in years past. We are now at that point, with the Tigers entering Saturday on a five-game losing streak. Kentucky has lost back-to-back games themselves to Florida and Georgia, although I would still make the Wildcats slight favorites in this spot. Auburn's defense has been brutal recently, ranking dead last in the SEC at defending the 3. The Tigers are a tough team to back right now, especially as favorites.I expect another wild SEC game between these two teams that will likely be played in the 80s. I lean taking the points with Kentucky and going over 156.5. Leans: Kentucky +2.5 and Over 156.5Bet the Over in Kentucky vs. Auburn at FanDuel:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tua Tagovailoa has spent his entire career with the Miami Dolphins, but after six seasons, it looks like the team is ready to move on, which means Tagovailoa is likely going to be suiting up for someone else in 2026. At this point, the only question is whether Tua is going to get released or traded. Both scenarios would come with some complications for the Dolphins and that's because Tua has $54 million in guaranteed money owed to him for the 2026 season. If the Dolphins cut Tua, they would be stuck with an NFL-record $99.2 million dead cap charge this year. However, they could knock that number down to $67.4 million if they designate him as a post-June 1 cut, a move that would allow them to split the $99.2 million hit over two seasons (they'd also take a $31.8 million dead cap hit in 2027). The best-case scenario for the Dolphins would be to find a potential trade partner. The problem there is that it's highly unlikely that any team is going to be willing to take on Tua's $54 million guaranteed salary for 2026. However, the Dolphins could still try to make a deal happen by agreeing to pay some of that salary. If Miami was willing to pay $24 million, then the acquiring team would only have to pay Tua $30 million in 2026, which is a much more manageable number. So if Tua does leave Miami, where could he end up? Let's take a look at four possible landing spots. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota VikingsThe Vikings are currently in a nightmare situation at quarterback. They appeared to have their quarterback of the future in 2024 with Sam Darnold, who led them to a 14-3 record. The Vikings could have kept him last year, but instead of signing Darnold to a long-term deal (or even just franchise tagging him), they decided to roll the dice by going all in with J.J. McCarthy and that gamble totally backfired. In his first full year as a starter, McCarthy looked much closer to being a bust than someone who will eventually be the team's future franchise quarterback. Say what you will about Tua, but he's definitely a much more polished quarterback than McCarthy. Although he's had some trouble staying healthy, Tua has been productive when he's on the field and he's been especially good when he's had the right weapons around him and the Vikings have a lot of offensive weapons to work with in Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. Tua might have to compete with McCarthy for the job, but that's likely a competition where he would be feeling pretty confident. And let's not forget, Tua's former offensive coordinator, Frank Smith, is now in Minnesota. Smith worked with Tua for four seasons in Miami and he's now the assistant head coach for the Vikings after being hired this year, so there would be some familiarity there. \nThe biggest question mark here is whether Tua would want to join a team that includes Brian Flores. The Vikings defensive coordinator was Tua's head coach in Miami for two seasons (2020-21) and the two definitely didn't get along. Tua ripped Flores' coaching style back in 2024 and it's not clear if the two sides have mended fences. If they have, then Minnesota seems like an enticing spot for the former fifth overall pick. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsKyler Murray has almost certainly played his last down in Arizona, which means the Cardinals will likely be in the market for a quarterback this offseason. Jacoby Brissett, who started 12 games last season, is under contract for 2026, so the Cards do have a safety net, but it would make a lot more sense tor them to bring someone in. New Cardinals coach Mike LaFleur just spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator with the Rams, where he got to work with one of the NFL's top pocket passers in Matthew Stafford. That's not Murray's playing style, but it definitely is what Tua prefers, which why he might be able to fit in with Arizona's new offense. \nThe Cardinals have some solid weapons, including Trey McBride, who's one of the best tight ends in the NFL. They have also have an impressive receiving duo in Marvin Harrison Jr. and Michael Wilson. Tua was at his best in Miami when Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle were both on the field, so the Cardinals know what kind of production he's capable of when he has some weapons around him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts might be the biggest wild card when it comes to the quarterback position this year and that's because it's not clear if Daniel Jones will be ready to play in Week 1. Jones had a strong season in his first-year with Indianapolis, but it came to a painful end in December when he tore his Achilles. That's one of the most brutal injuries in sports and it wouldn't be surprising at all if he had to miss the first few weeks of the 2026 season. As a matter of fact, if you look at the recovery timeline for quarterbacks, it would be a borderline miracle if Jones were to play in Week 1. Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins both tore their Achilles in 2023 and they ended up playing in Week 1 of the following season, but both of those injuries happened early in the season (Cousins' injury came in Week 8 while Rodgers tore his Achilles in Week 1. Jones suffered his injury in Week 14).Not only is Jones' health up in the air, but he's also set to be a free agent, so the Colts have fo figure out what they want to do with him, and that's where Tua would come in. If the Colts decide to re-sign Jones, Tua could sign a one-year deal -- if the Dolphins release him -- and be the QB until Jones is ready to play. A trade could also make sense if the Dolphins are willing to eat a healthy chunk of Tua's $54 million salary for 2026. Tua doesn't have any guaranteed money left after the 2026 season, so he could fill in for Jones for a few weeks, finish out the 2026 season in Indy and then the Colts could release or trade him during the 2027 offseason (Tua will have $3 million of his 2027 salary become guaranteed on March 13, so the Colts would have to deal with that if they acquired him in a trade from Miami). \nOne thing working in Tua's favor is that the Colts have a set up where he could thrive: They have a solid offensive line, they have one of the best running backs in the NFL (Jonathan Taylor), they have a solid receiving group led by Michael Pittman and they have a solid young tight end in Tyler Warren. Tua could put up some big numbers in Indy. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThe Falcons currently have two quarterbacks in Kirk Cousins and Michael Penix Jr., but that won't be the case much longer. The team is expected to release Cousins before the start of free agency, which will leave Penix as the top guy on the depth chart. Penix comes with some serious question marks, though: He just tore his ACL for the third time in his football career and he hasn't proven that he can play consistently good football. Although the Falcons expect him to be ready for Week 1, he's playing for a new coach and a new front office that didn't draft him, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if they brought in some competition for him. Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski has shown that he can win games even if he has to cycle through quarterbacks. He led the Browns to the playoffs during a 2023 season where Cleveland started five different players at quarterback. Stefanski is a smart offensive mind and if he thinks that Tua has more upside than Penix, then he would almost certainly be interested in bringing him to Atlanta. \nBringing in a left-handed QB to compete with a left-handed QB would be a plus for the Falcons because it means that Atlanta wouldn't have to make any huge changes from an offensive standpoint. The man making the decisions in Atlanta's front office, Matt Ryan, was noncommittal when asked if Penix would be the starting QB in 2026. Ryan told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that Penix's role will be decided by new head coach Kevin Stefanski. \"Kevin's responsibility is to be the head coach of the football team and he's going to let you know who our starters are and who our starters are not. It's not my place to go in there,\" Ryan said during Super Bowl week. \nSo the QB job will be up to Stefanski, which certainly leaves the door open for Atlanta to bring in a new quarterback. Why several QB-needy teams didn't make this listOne thing you may or may not have noticed about this list is that every team on it plays indoors. If Tua has proven one thing in his career, it's that he struggles when the weather gets cold, so it doesn't make much sense for him to play in a cold-weather city, which is why we don't have the Jets, Steelers or Browns listed here. The final start of Tua's Dolphins' career came in a December loss to the Steelers where the kickoff temperature was 17 degrees. That dropped Tua's career record to 0-6 when the temperature is below 40. If I'm a team in cold-weather city, I don't want Tua, and if I'm Tua, I don't want to play in cold-weather city. For Tua, playing indoors will guarantee that he'll get perfect weather for at least eight games per year. Tua has an 8-4 career record when playing indoors (dome or retractable roof) with his last game coming in Week 8 against the Falcons, a day that saw him throw four touchdown passes in a 34-10 win. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        33 days until Opening Day ... Baseball games are happening today. Real-life baseball games.Well ... as real as the first day of Spring Training games can be, with a bunch of mostly prospect pitchers set to pitch an inning or two against teams that will likely only feature a fraction of their Opening Day starters in the lineup. Teams are going to work their stars into the lineup slowly over the next week or so, limiting their starters to one or two innings and their position players to only a few more early on.Still! We've been starved for baseball for months, and today is the end of that drought. And this spring gives us baseball obsessives a couple of things to be excited about: The World Baseball Classic! Complete Statcast data for every Spring Training game!The WBC opens in a few weeks, and I cannot wait. The USA side is stacked, with Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal headlining by far the most talented squad in that side's history in this tournament. Japan is always a threat, of course, and the Dominican Republic team seems to have multiple All-Stars at every position. But don't sleep on Venezuela -- Vinotinto! -- who lost Pablo Lopez recently but still have a deep, exciting team full of major-league stars. It's going to be a phenomenal tournament, and unlike spring action, those games increasingly mean a lot to the players involved.For our purposes, though, that Statcast data might be just as exciting. In years past, we've had to deal with incomplete spring data, and the only thing worse than incomplete data is no data. In fact, incomplete data might even be worse -- did a player truly show improved skills in the spring, or did he just happen to play his best games in parks where the Statcast data was available? That won't be an issue any longer, which means we should have full data this spring for guys like Spencer Strider, George Kirby, and Grayson Rodriguez, whose Fantasy fates could depend on how good the data they can produce is. \nFor the first time ever, we'll have full access to that data. And that data will be part of what we're watching for every team. Yesterday, I went through every National League team to highlight the biggest question facing each heading into spring action. Today, we're turning to the other side of the majors, looking for answers to the biggest question for every American League team: The biggest question for each AL teamChicago White Sox - Can Munetaka Murakami make enough contact?It seems like most Fantasy analysts are very confident he can't. I remain open-minded, especially with his price remaining outside of the top-200 in early drafts. We know three things for sure about Murakami:He's going to play every single day for the White SoxHe's going to have struggles with contactHe's going to hit the ball incredibly hardNo. 2 may be the most important factor here in the end, but folks are acting like it's a guarantee that it'll sink him. I'm less convinced. Yes, Murakami had just a 64% contract rate last season in Japan, a league with both less overall talent and specifically less fastball velocity. It's reasonable to assume that number will get worse, and he's already in a range that few successful major-league hitters live in. Strikeouts are going to be a problem for Murakami, and it's possible that will be an insurmountable problem. \nBut Murakami also has top-of-the-scale power to help him overcome it. He had a max exit velocity of 116.5 mph in 2025, something only 23 MLB hitters managed in 2025. The power is legitimate, and even with the contact concerns, he could be a 30-homer guy as soon as this season. He also makes pretty good swing decisions, with a 25.4% chase rate in 2025, so there should be a pretty good walk rate with his profile, which helps mitigate some of the downside risk. It all sounds like a Matt Wallner-esque profile, especially if the lefty Murakami struggles against same-handed pitching. But you don't have to squint too hard to see some similarities to other high-strikeout, big-power hitters like Nick Kurtz or Rafael Devers. Murakami's flaws are big and real, and they may be exposed by MLB pitchers. But this guy was a historically great power hitter in Japan who posted a wRC+ north of 200 on two separate occasions, and he should have a lot of playing time security in Chicago. He'll have to make some adjustments to thrive, but I'm not at all comfortable writing off a player with his talent and accomplishments off the way some are doing. I'll also point this out: Shohei Ohtani had very similar contact issues in his final season in Japan while being a less productive hitter overall, and well, it's worked out for him, hasn't it?\nDetroit Tigers - Is Kevin McGonigle up on Opening Day?Nothing is certain in either direction, but the Tigers are going to give McGonigle the chance, at least. And while I won't say the hole at shortstop in the Tigers' lineup is Kevin McGonigle shaped and sized, there's definitely a hole there despite an entire offseason where they could have addressed it. We know McGonigle, the No. 2 prospect in baseball, pretty much across the board, is the future at shortstop for the Tigers, and he's coming off a season where he hit .305/.408/.583 with incredible plate discipline while reaching Double-A as a 20-year-old. I'd still learn toward him starting the season at Triple-A, but every day he spends in big-league camp makes that a little bit less certain. His immediate future might just be in his hands. Los Angeles Angels - Does Grayson Rodriguez have anything left? Rodriguez is fully healthy. That's a good first step after bone spurs and a late injury totally wrecked his 2025 season before he ever really got going. He had surgery to remove the bone spurs in his elbow, and the hope is the other injuries that have derailed Rodriguez's rise from being a top prospect were a result of that fundamental issue. That's the bet the Angels are making in trading for him this offseason.Rodriguez isn't guaranteed a rotation spot yet, so he really does have something to compete for this spring. The 26-year-old has shown flashes of high-end upside, but his 4.11 career ERA tells the story of his inconsistency. Health has been a part of that, so a breakout case might be as simple as, \"Hey, he's finally healthy.\" But he needs to show he still has the premium stuff that made him such an intriguing young pitcher before all of the injuries, so that's something to keep a close eye on this spring. \nBaltimore Orioles - Can they fix Adley Rutschman?There are other questions about how playing time in the outfield and at DH will be split up, but those questions might not matter all that much if Rutschman is the guy he's been the past year and a half. He has dealt with some nagging injuries along the way, so maybe it's as simple as getting and keeping him healthy. If Rutschman can get back to being a legitimate impact bat, then Samuel Basallo gets to sink or swim while playing the majority of his time at DH, which would probably be for the best anyway – developing as a catcher just puts even more pressure on him. A big spring won't prove Rutschman is back, but it would sure be nice to see a bunch of examples of him driving the ball with authority, at least. Athletics - Is Lawrence Butler still an everyday player?Butler entered 2025 with as much hype as any player, but after a promising start, he mostly flamed out. He still finished with a 20-20 season, but with a .234 batting average and mediocre counting stats as he often lost playing time down the stretch. And why not, as he hit just .188/.228/.342 against left-handed pitching, with the underlying numbers to back it up. He's still just 25 and under contract for six more years, so I don't think he's going to be outright benched. It's possible his struggles in 2025 were the result of the knee injury he ultimately had surgery on this offseason, but if he's just a platoon bat, it narrows the margin for error even at his discounted 2026 ADP of 145.3.Houston Astros - Do they trade Isaac Paredes? I actually think this is one of the biggest looming questions in the whole league. If Paredes was locked into an everyday role for the Astros, I think you could make the case for him as a top-100 pick – he was on pace for 32 homers, 84 runs, and 84 RBI before a quad injury derailed his season in 2025. But the Astros, in the heat of a playoff race, reacted to the injury by acquiring Carlos Correa, which left them with one too many infielders (at least) for 2026.\nThe logical move would be to just bench Christian Walker after a disappointing season, but it doesn't sound like that's the plan; instead, Paredes is being talked about like the extra piece, who might serve as a utility player. He could still get something close to everyday opportunities in that role (and injuries could always happen, especially with Correa out there), but it's hard to draft him as if that will be the case. It's also hard to draft Paredes as if a trade will rescue his value, because his swing is so geared for success in Houston in a way we've already seen won't translate from his disastrous stint with the Cubs. It's a quagmire in Houston, but from their perspective, having too much depth can hardly be viewed as a bad thing. Moving Paredes for an outfield upgrade would help, too, but they might be content to open the season with Paredes in limbo. That would be a shame. Kansas City Royals - How much is Carter Jensen going to play? With Carter Jensen's emergence, the Royals have their heir apparent. And the ideal mix might just be to have Jensen and Salvador Perez split time between DH and catcher, similar to what we expect the Orioles to do. If that's the case, Jensen figures to play every day and has real breakout potential – just ask Scott White, who declared his love for Jensen on a recent FBT episode. Jensen put up a .290/.377/.501 line across Double-A and Triple-A last season and then put up a remarkably similar line in his 20-game cup of coffee with the Royals, so there could be serious upside here if the Royals commit to playing him every day. If he dominates this spring, it might be hard not to. \nCleveland Guardians - Is Chase DeLauter an everyday player right away?It sure sounds like the Guardians are opening the season with DeLauter in their outfield, and they may even be open to moving Steven Kwan to center field to facilitate it. DeLauter is a former first-round pick who has been extremely productive when he's been able to be on the field, but that has happened just 140 times over four seasons since he was drafted. That's a lot of lost development time, and potentially a loss in the underlying physical tools that made DeLauter such a prized prospect, but the truth is, we just don't know. We haven't seen enough of DeLauter to really have any sense of who he is as a player at this point, though I will note that he has remained productive in the high-minors when healthy, despite all the missed time. The Guardians will probably need to limit his reps just in the name of keeping him healthy, but I'd like to see DeLauter be limited only by what he is physically capable of, so let's see if they'll give him reps against lefties and righties this spring, to start. Nothing is assured, but I think his future is in his own hands. The drumbeat in the early part of camp around the shows Griffin is putting on during batting practice has been loud, and the Pirates probably can't afford to play service time games with another top prospect after the backlash they generated (including in their own clubhouse, reportedly) from doing that with Bubba Chandler last year. If Griffin falls on his face this spring, he won't make the team. But if he holds his own, I think we're looking at our first age-19 MLB debut by a position player since Juan Soto. And Griffin will be a top-150 pick (at least) if that happens.Boston Red Sox - Is there room for Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer?It's more a question for Campbell, as Mayer looks like he at least has the inside track for the starting second base job right now. The Red Sox have actually already said that Campbell's focus this spring will be in the outfield, which is curious, given that the Red Sox already have four viable outfielders on their roster and it isn't Campbell's natural position. They could just be looking to increase his flexibility with no clear role available, but it's still a curious move for a guy who looked like their future second baseman this time a year ago. Maybe Campbell's struggles (in the majors, especially, but also at Triple-A, relatively speaking) could have changed the long-term plans despite the contract extension he signed last season, but I'm still kind of in disbelief that they seemingly aren't really giving him a chance to earn a role this spring. I'd like to see them prove me wrong. \nMinnesota Twins - Was 2025 a fluke for Luke Keaschall?This is one of those questions we won't really know the answer to until the games actually count, but I will tell you what I'm looking for from Keaschall: Power. He didn't show much of it in 2025, putting up just an 86.2 mph average exit velocity despite being productive overall. It's hard to be a .300 hitter without impacting the ball more than that, and Keaschall was projected to have something more like average pop as a prospect, so I do wonder if the forearm injury he suffered just a few games into his MLB career sapped him of some of that power. We'd like to see Keaschall lifting the ball to the pull side this spring, and we'd like to see him hitting it with authority consistently. I'm not expecting or even hoping for more than 15 homers, but it'd be nice to know Keaschall could pair his 40-steal upside with legit power production. New York Yankees - Are they really going to send Jasson Dominguez down?It sure sounds like it. The idea is that they want to make sure Dominguez is playing every day, and his performance in 2025 on both sides of the ball didn't demand an everyday role. In fact, with Ben Rice locked in at first base, the Yankees' ideal alignment probably doesn't include Dominguez at this point. But he's also one of the few young, cost-controlled players on the roster, and thus one of the few paths the Yankees have to elevating their ceiling. Dominguez might have just been overhyped throughout his prospect career, but he's still a career .274/.373/.444 hitter in the minors with good tools, so it's too early to give up on him. And I do worry about what the effect of demoting a guy who made his MLB debut four seasons ago might have at this point. It'd be nice to see Dominguez force the Yankees to keep him around. Seattle Mariners - Can Colt Emerson win a job? Emerson looks like a long-term answer at shortstop, potentially even more so than he did when they drafted him. But it seems unlikely he'll be able to push stalwart J.P. Crawford aside, and with Brendan Donovan's acquisition, the Mariners only really have one spot on the infield open, likely at second base. Emerson is working out at third, second, and shortstop this spring, but second is the most likely spot, occupied currently by a combo of Cole Young and Leo Rivas. Young is a moderately interesting recent prospect, but Emerson is the much more hyped talent, reaching Triple-A as a 20-year-old in 2025 and hitting .285/.383/.458 across three levels of the minors. It might be asking too much for him to make the leap to the majors (in a notoriously difficult hitting environment in Seattle, no less) with just 40 games under his belt in the high minors. But given the opportunity in front of him, I won't write it off. They're going to give him a real chance to take this job. \nTampa Bay Rays - Who will close? The market is about to move in a big way to Griffin Jax after Edwin Uceta's shoulder injury didn't improve following some time off from throwing. Most people have been approaching this as if it's going to be one of Uceta or Jax, so if Uceta is out of the way, it's just Jax's job, right?Well, when we had Ryan Bass, who covers the Rays for their TV broadcasts, on the FBT podcast a few weeks ago, he said he expects the Rays to have no set closer, citing the 2021 team that had an MLB record 13 different pitchers record a save. Certainly, Uceta being out of the picture helps Jax's case, but if the Rays truly are going to go with a full-blown committee, it would be easy to push Jax too high up your draft boards in response to this injury. I'm usually skeptical that any team will actually stick with a committee, but in the Rays' case, we've seen it before. \nTexas Rangers - Who is the closer?All we've seen so far is this: A quote from new manager Skip Schumaker early in camp saying that Robert Garcia and Chris Martin are the frontrunners for the closer job right now. However, Schumaker also made a point of highlighting Alexis Diaz, a former All-Star who is on his third team since the start of last season, as a candidate. And I think he's the dark horse to watch here. Garcia and Martin are fine, but Martin is 39 and hasn't thrown more than 50 innings in a season since 2023, while Garcia is a lefty, which is often a hurdle for managers to get their minds around. Diaz will have to prove that he has anything left after putting up an 8.15 ERA last season, and he very well may not. But the fact that the Rangers are open to him winning the job should at least put him on your radar for what should be at least a competitive team in 2026. Toronto Blue Jays - How much job security does Jeff Hoffman have?I can't imagine it's much, but the Blue Jays didn't add an obvious alternative to the end of the bullpen this offseason, so we're operating under the assumption that he'll be the guy to open the season. Hoffman's 4.37 ERA in 2025 is the primary reason his job security seems so shaky, but the fact that he blew the save in a heartbreaking Game 7 loss in the World Series after seemingly getting back on track in the playoffs surely didn't help matters. The biggest thing Hoffman has going for him is a lack of proven alternatives in the late innings, especially with Yimi Garcia being brought along slowly this spring after August elbow surgery. But if Hoffman struggles this spring, that door could start to swing open for someone like Louis Varland to step into. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It has been a tough spring for the Atlanta Braves, who play their first exhibition game on Saturday. They've already lost righties Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep to elbow surgery after getting hit so hard by injuries last year. Both are having loose bodies removed from their elbows and their recovery will be measured in months, not weeks.     \"There's  nothing you can do,\" new manager Walt Weiss said (via MLB.com). \"These guys get hurt doing what they  do. You go out there and pitch enough, at some point, something is bound  to happen. So I don't beat my head against the wall with stuff like  this. I just know it's part of the deal. I wish it hadn't happened. But,  we put our heads down and keep going.\"     In the grand scheme of things, getting loose bodies taken out of your elbow isn't that bad. It's not Tommy John surgery, it's nothing to do with ligaments or tendons. The prognosis for a full recovery is very good. It's just that surgery will keep them on the sidelines for a big chunk of the season. Schwellenbach is already on the 60-day injured list. Waldrep will join him soon enough.     At one point last season all five members of Atlanta's Opening Day rotation were on the injured list. A starting pitcher seemed to be a clear need in the offseason, at least a back-end innings guy, but the Braves instead focused their efforts on improving the bullpen and the lineup. Here is the club's rotation depth chart:     \nLHP Chris SaleRHP Spencer StriderRHP Spencer Schwellenbach (out with elbow surgery)RHP Reynaldo López (missed most of 2025 with shoulder surgery)RHP Grant Holmes (coming back from a partial UCL tear)RHP Hurston Waldrep (out with elbow surgery)RHP Bryce ElderRHP AJ Smith-Shawver (will miss most or all of 2026 with Tommy John surgery)LHP José SuarezLHP Martín Pérez (minor-league contract)RHP Carlos Carrasco (minor-league contract)There is an awful lot of age/injury risk in that group. Elder is probably Atlanta's safest bet to take the ball every fifth day, and he has a 5.26 ERA with poor under-the-hood numbers in close to 300 big-league innings since going to the 2023 All-Star Game. The Braves threw 20-year-old Didier Fuentes into the fire last summer and the result was 20 runs in 13 innings.     Schwellenbach has performed at a near-ace level when healthy the last two years. Waldrep was so impressive down the stretch last season. Those two were expected to be a significant part of the rotation this year (especially Schwellenbach) and now Atlanta is scrambling to fill their innings. Not the best start to the spring for a team looking to bounce back from a 76-win season.     Where can the Braves turn to add pitching between now and Opening Day? Here's a look at their pitching options.     \n     Free agency     \nIt's too late now, but I thought Chris Bassitt was an excellent fit for the Braves dating back to the start of the offseason. Bassitt -- who signed with the Orioles -- is a steady presence you can reasonably count on to take the ball every fifth day, and you needn't try hard to see him being worthy of a start come the postseason. The Braves never seemed to show much interest though. So it goes.     Anyway, there are still some solid pitchers sitting in free agency and waiting for a contract. No one who will swing a division race or a postseason series, but pitchers who are plenty qualified to help a contending team get through the grind of the 162-game regular season. Here are the top unsigned starters according to FanGraphs' projected 2026 WAR:     RHP Zack Littell: 1.6 WARRHP Lucas Giolito: 1.2 WARRHP Max Scherzer: 1.2 WARLHP Patrick Corbin: 0.9 WARLHP Tyler Anderson: 0.5 WARIt's frankly ridiculous Littell is still unsigned. He's not a frontline starter or anything, but he's thrown the 24th most innings the last two years (just ahead of Bassitt and Zac Gallen) and has been roughly league average. He's only 30, too. This isn't a veteran in his mid-30s trying to hang on. Guys who can give you 30 league average-ish starts should not still be unemployed in February.     \nGiolito was unable to pitch in the postseason last year because of an elbow injury, though he declined his end of a $19 million mutual option to become a free agent, so the elbow must be in good shape. Giolito received a $1.5 million buyout. Will he be able to recoup the $17.5 million he walked away from? I'm not sure. Would the Braves pay that anyway? I don't think so.     Scherzer is nearing the end of the line and has hinted at signing at midseason, so file him away for later. If Anderson or Corbin will take a minor-league contract, sure, sign them, otherwise I wouldn't guarantee them a rotation spot. Littell seems like such an obvious fit, especially since he has bullpen experience and can shift into a relief role in the event everyone gets healthy.     Per FanGraphs, the Braves have a $260 million competitive balance tax payroll, eighth-highest in baseball and just under the $264 million second penalty tier. If the Braves want to stay under $264 million and avoid escalating tax rates, it won't be possible to add a starter, especially not one of Littell's or Giolito's or Scherzer's caliber. Money could be an issue.     \n     Trades     \nSpring training is a bad time to need starting pitchers. First and foremost, very few teams are willing to trade pitchers this time of the year. There's just not much out there. Also, the teams that are willing to move arms know the Braves are in a bind and perhaps a bit desperate, and will raise their asking prices accordingly. Spring trades for pitching can be tough to swing.     \"We're  going to continue to have discussions all spring training,\" POBO Alex Anthopoulos told MLB.com about the team's pitching search. \"There's still guys out there and guys you can get through trade.  But again, we like the four (veteran starters we have) and we like the guys  competing for the fifth spot as well.\"     It's easy to connect the dots on a Joe Ryan trade given A) his place in trade rumors the last year or so, and B) Pablo López's elbow injury putting a big dent in the Minnesota Twins' contention hopes. If the Twins seriously consider offers for Ryan, there will be a fierce bidding war, and I'm not sure Atlanta has the prospects to make that happen. Try though, for sure.\nLefty Bailey Falter has been pushed pretty far down the depth chart in Kansas City and the Royals could move him if they'd rather not pay him $3.6 million to be a swingman/spot starter. Righties Landon Knack (Los Angeles Dodgers) and Keider Montero (Detroit Tigers), and lefty Jordan Wicks (Chicago Cubs), stand out as possibly available depth starters.     I wonder about Patrick Sandoval. The left-hander missed last season with Tommy John surgery and is facing hitters now, but even after all their offseason trades, he's no higher than sixth on the Boston Red Sox depth chart. Boston is right up against the $264 million second competitive balance tax penalty tier and may want to move Sandoval's $12.75 million salary.     Unless there really is a way to make Ryan happen or someone unexpectedly shakes loose, a trade probably isn't the best way for the Braves to reinforce their rotation. Few teams are looking to move starters in the spring and the pitchers who are available will cost you a pretty penny because supply is low and demand is high. I'd consider a trade a last resort.     \n     The scrap heap     \n                                    \n                    Walker Buehler\n                \n            SP\n        \n                    ERA4.93WHIP1.52IP126BB61K92        \n            \nMost likely, Anthopoulos will scour the waiver wire and see whether any cheap depth arms become available. Righty Osvaldo Bido, who had a solid 2024 and a not-so-good 2025 with the Athletics, seems unlikely to win a job with the New York Yankees. He was with the Braves for a few weeks between waiver claims in December, and they could circle back if he hits the wire again.     Right-handers Cooper Criswell (Seattle Mariners), Janson Junk (Miami Marlins), Luis Medina (A's), and Matt Waldron (San Diego Padres) are out of options (i.e. must go through waivers to go to Triple-A), on the 40-man roster chopping block, or both. Those are exactly the kind of pitchers who shuffle around the league on waivers in the weeks leading up to Opening Day.     Walker Buehler (Padres), Austin Gomber (Texas Rangers), Marco Gonzales (Padres), and Cal Quantrill (Rangers) are veterans on minor-league contracts with an opt out at the end of spring training. If they don't get a big-league roster spot with their current teams, they could opt out, and which point the Braves could sign them for something close to the league minimum.     \nThat is more or less the scrap heap market. Waivers, veterans who opt out, etc. The Braves already have a few players like this in camp (Carrasco, Pérez, etc.) and may feel covered there, but Atlanta has some 40-man roster flexibility. They can throw a few darts throughout the spring and see whether anyone sticks. There's no risk in giving a player a spring audition.          Do nothing     Doing nothing is always an option, sometimes even a good one. Is a good option for the Braves? I'm inclined to say no -- I'd rather have too much pitching than not enough -- but, if you believe FanGraphs projections, the Braves have the 10th-best rotation in baseball even after baking in the Schwellenbach and Waldrep injuries. Tenth is not amazing, but it's not a disaster either.     Sale, Strider, López, Holmes, and Elder is a credible rotation and it's reasonable to expect Schwellenbach and Waldrep back later in the year giving the timing and nature of their surgeries. The risk is losing another starter and having to turn to Carrasco, Pérez, et al. The Braves are already pushing the limits of their depth. They don't have to add pitching now, but it would be wise.     \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss was 10 minutes away from upsetting LSU on Thursday night, but a devastating fourth quarter turned into a 78-70 loss for the Rebels. Both teams were fourth in the SEC standings, but now Ole Miss could be missing out on a coveted double-bye for the conference tournament. That being said, Ole Miss is still looking at the bigger picture,In the women's NCAA basketball tournament, the top four seeds in each region host the first two rounds. This year, Ole Miss is firmly in contention for a top-four seed, something they haven't achieved since 1992.\"If we've won it would have really helped us, but it doesn't hurt us,\" coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin said postgame. \"...I am confident that this week is going to prepare us for something even greater in March. And I am not talking about the SEC Tournament, I'm talking about March Madness.\"The Rebels have reached the Sweet 16 twice in the past three seasons, but both times they did so in front of road crowds. Last weekend, the NCAA made an early reveal of the current top 16 seeds with Ole Miss coming it at No. 15. Earlier this week, CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel projected them as a No. 5 seed, and after the LSU loss, they sit at No. 18 in the NET rankings. The loss to LSU was not ideal, but not all hope is lost; the Rebels still have a game against No. 3 South Carolina this weekend, which, if they pull the upset, would be a huge boost to their resume. Plus, they should have an opportunity to pick up more Quad 1 wins in the SEC tournament. \nRegardless of what happens, Ole Miss already has a lot to be proud of. When winter storm Fern hit Mississippi and left 62,000 people in Oxford without power, the team had to make Alabama its home base for a while and did not get to play a true home game for a month. Despite the struggles, the Rebels picked up a statement win against Vanderbilt and their 19-4 record at the time gave the program its best start in the McPhee-McCuin era.Ole Miss is not the only team that could host an NCAA Tournament game after a long drought. Vanderbilt got off to an 18-0 start this season and the Commodores have done a good job handling a tough SEC conference schedule. CBS Sports currently has them projected as a No. 2 seed, while still having a chance at stealing the last No. 1 seed from Texas. Regardless, Shea Ralph's team will finish the regular season as one of the top 16 teams, which means the program will host for the first time since 2009. \nTexas Tech was also one of the last undefeated teams this season with a 19-0 start. The Raiders have not played in the tournament since the 2012-13 season, but that drought is ending soon. They are currently projected as a No. 6 seed and would probably need to make it far in the Big 12 Tournament for a chance to rise enough, but if they did, the Lady Raiders would be hosting for the first time since 2005.\nMinnesota has been another surprising team. The Gophers have not been in the NCAA Tournament since 2018, but earlier this week the team was projected as a No. 5 seed, which would be the Gophers' best seeding since 2005 when they hosted as a No. 3 seed. Their win against Ohio State certainly helped their case, and they can still continue to improve their resume by beating Michigan State this weekend. Speaking of the Spartans, they could also be hosting for the first time since 2016. They are a projected No. 4 seed at the moment, and they were the No. 14 overall seed in the early reveal of the top 16 seeds.Alabama might be a bigger stretch, but the Crimson Tide were close to hosting last year as a No. 5 seed. Right now they are No. 7 on the CBS Sports projections and No. 6 in the ESPN bracketology. They have not hosted since 1998 and they have a lot of work to do if they want a chance to do it this year, but it does help that SEC competition can give them the wins needed to climb up the NET rankings.Here is what else is happening in women's college basketball:Rough month for TennesseeTennessee suffered a 43-point loss to No. 3 South Carolina on Feb. 8, which was the largest margin of defeat in program history. The team is not looking any stronger as the season winds down. The Lady Vols took a shocking 82-74 loss at home to Texas A&M on Thursday night, which means Tennessee has now lost four of its last five games. Kim Caldwell's squad has a lot to figure out before the postseason, but it will be challenging with Oklahoma, LSU and Vanderbilt still on the schedule.\n\"I don't think we're doing much of anything, so I don't have anything to say about that,\" Caldwell said postgame when asked about her system. \"I think that all of our errors are, at the end of the day, on me, and I think that's understood.\"\nAddy Brown returnsAfter missing 11 games due to a lower-body injury, Addy Brown returned to the court in Iowa State's 90-64 win over Arizona State. Brown played 20 minutes and contributed with 6 points, 7 reb, 6 assists and a block. During her absence, her team went 6-5, which included a five-game losing streak.\"She's back,\" coach Bill Fennelly said. \"Every team is built in a certain way, and we've built our team — as you guys know, I'm a baseball guy -- and we built it up the middle with (point guard) Jada (Williams), Addy, and Audi. And when Addy's not in there, a lot of our offensive flow is not very good. \n\"She's ultra-skilled, but she's one of the smartest basketball players I've ever been around. There are not a lot of players that I've been around that see the play before it happens. Not in the women's game. The great ones do. There are not as many as you think. She's one of them.\"\nGeno Auriemma ties another Tara VanDerveer recordThis week marked No. 1 UConn's 654 appearances in the AP Top 25 poll under Geno Auriemma, which tied former Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer's record during her 41-year Hall of Fame career.The Huskies have been ranked for 619 consecutive weeks, a streak that dates all the way back to the 1993-94 preseason poll. The program already holds the record for most appearances at No. 1 with a total of 260 weeks.\nRori Harmon keeps making historyThis past week, the Texas point guard became the first women's basketball player in Division I history to reach 1,500+ points, 900+ assists, 600+ career rebounds and 350+ career steals. Coach Vic Schaefer called her the best point guard in the nation earlier in the season and described her as \"generational\" during the Athletes Unlimited game on Feb. 12. \"They just don't make them like her,\" he said. \"She will guard you baseline to baseline and make life miserable for you and then will go run your team on the offensive end and get everyone in the right place and get the ball to the right people at the right time. \"And then you better not take your eye off her because she will make you pay. She is really special. If they hired me tomorrow in the WNBA she would be the first one I would go get because she can run a team. She knows leadership, she knows playbook, she knows players, she knows what we are doing and how we are doing it. She is an extension of me on the floor.\" \nGame to watch this weekendNo. 6 Michigan at No. 13 Iowa -- Sunday (12 p.m. ET on FOX)Michigan has lost the last five encounters against the Hawkeyes and there is the added difficulty of this game being played in Iowa. However, the Wolverines have given both No. 1 UConn and No. 2 UCLA serious upset scares. Michigan is the higher-ranked team in this matchup, but playing with an underdog type of urgency could help the Wolverines get a solid win to stay above Iowa in the Big Ten standings. That being said, the Jan Jensen's Hawkeyes should not be overlooked. Earlier this week, Jensen became the first Iowa coach to secure over 20 wins in each of her first two seasons at the helm of the program. \n            ",

On the first Friday of this month, we got St. John's over UConn. Last Friday, it was Wisconsin over Michigan State. This Friday, it's a Big Ten showdown between in-state rivals that have seen better days.This Friday, it's Indiana at Purdue.Both are coming off of double-digit losses -- but, if anything, that just makes the game even bigger because it means the loser of this one will enter next week trying to avoid a three-game losing streak. In other words, it's a huge game for both. But I'd argue it's bigger for Purdue than Indiana, if only because if the Boilermakers lose they'll A) take their first Q2 loss of the season, and B) suffer their fourth loss inside Mackey Arena in the same season for the first time since 2013-2014.Truth is, Indiana is about where it was supposed to be. The Hoosiers started 38th at KenPom.com and are currently 37th at KenPom.com. But Purdue was the preseason No.1 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, meaning the Boilermakers are not supposed to be coming off of a double-digit loss at home -- but this is the second time they're doing it this season.Tip is scheduled for 8 pm ET.You can watch it on Fox.\nPurdue is listed as an 11.5-point favorite. Among the storylines going in is Braden Smith's pursuit of the NCAA's all-time assist record. He currently has 986 in his career. That ranks fifth all-time -- one spot ahead of former East Tennessee State star Keith \"Mister\" Jennigs, one spot below former LIU Brooklyn standout Jason Brickman.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Miami (Ohio), VCU lead off massive weekend for NCAA Tournament cut line\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTop 25 And 1 rankings\n        Biggest Movers\n    RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Michigan\n                                \n                            Elliott Cadeau finished with 17 points and seven assists in Tuesday's 91-80 win at Purdue.

    "body": "\n        College basketball's regular season is coming down to the wire, and the NCAA Tournament bubble is popping. Every day brings a new wrinkle to the picture along the cut line for the field of 68, and the CBS Sports Bracketology model remains on top of it all.This weekend's slate is stocked full of games that will impact the picture surrounding the Last Four In, First Four Out and beyond. At this point, the NCAA Tournament fates of a couple dozen at-large candidates remains up in the air.On Friday night, the action ramps up with a pivotal Atlantic 10 showdown between VCU and No. 18 Saint Louis. The Rams are hovering on the cut line but could bolster their resume in a huge way by taking down the Billikens on the road.Also in action on Friday night is Miami (Ohio), which is trying to reach 27-0 at home against Bowling Green. The Redhawks edged the Falcons 93-83 in the first meeting back on Dec. 30. But the stakes are higher now as Miami tries to avoid a late slip up that would bring a significant negative impact to its at-large prospects.\nHere is the full bubble breakdown entering the weekend.Check out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hub                                All times ET                  Bubble teams in action xday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    VCUFriday at No. 18 Saint Louis | 7 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 1The moment of truth has arrived for VCU. If the Rams can take down mighty Saint Louis on the road, it would do wonders for their at-large hopes. A win would bring an estimated 6-10 spot leap in VCU's WAB ranking, which is a vital resume metric that will be looked at closely by the selection committee. It would be the Rams' first Quad 1 victory, and it would be a doozy of a win. Saint Louis is a strong squad that got the best of VCU in their first meeting on Jan. 7.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami (Ohio)Friday vs. Bowling Green | 8:30 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the weekend: No. 11 seed (auto-bid)Game status: Quad 3Miami's needle-threading, unbeaten ride is coming down to the end. Five more wins would send the Redhawks into the postseason with a 31-0 mark and maybe even give them some leeway to suffer a MAC Tournament loss and still be an at-large team. But the margin for error remains minuscule for this team, which has played zero Quad 1 games and just one Quad 2 game. Here's a deeper look at the potential NCAA Tournament scenarios for Miami.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    MissouriSaturday at No. 20 Arkansas | 4 p.m. (ESPN)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 1\nMissouri picked up another \"Quad 1A\" win on Wednesday against Vanderbilt, which adds to a tally that also includes victories over Florida and at Kentucky. At 18-8 (8-5 SEC), the Tigers are held back by a soft nonconference slate that included eight Quad 4 games. But they have clearly demonstrated some high-end potential and could do so again by taking down Arkansas on the road. If not, a big home game game with Tennessee is up next.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USCSaturday vs. Oregon | 4 p.m. (FS1)Entering the weekend: No. 11 seedGame status: Quad 3Illinois ran USC off its own floor on Wednesday night by a score of 101-65. Other than a Jan. 25 win at Wisconsin, which is aging well, the Trojans don't have another victory over a team currently expected to make the Big Dance. The status of leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara is a huge storyline here. The well-traveled wing has missed three straight games for what's been termed as a knee strain. USC should beat Oregon with or without Baker-Mazara, but his status will be key moving forward. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    TCUSaturday vs. West Virginia | 5 p.m. (Peacock)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 2TCU's roller-coaster resume includes wins over Florida and Iowa State along with losses to New Orleans, Notre Dame and Utah. Most recently, the Horned Frogs took an 82-71 loss at UCF on Tuesday. That's a non-fatal Quad 1 loss, but it ratchets up the pressure on TCU to hold serve against West Virginia and Arizona State at home over the next few days. The demonstration of some consistency would likely be reassuring to the selection committee as it seeks to decipher a wonky resume.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    West VirginiaSaturday at TCU | 5 p.m. (Peacock)Entering the weekend: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 1\nGiven West Virginia's controversial exclusion last season, Mountaineers fans are likely bracing for impact here. After a 61-56 Quad 3 home loss to Utah on Wednesday, they should be. WVU is in desperation mode as it heads to TCU for a must-win game. It would take a strong finish -- think 4-1 -- to get WVU back in the mix heading into the Big 12 Tournament. Undersized flamethrower Honor Huff needs to get on a legendary heater from 3-point range.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seton HallSaturday vs. Georgetown | 6 p.m. (FS1)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 3Seton Hall's Wednesday home loss against DePaul plunged the Pirates into desperation mode. Their resume metrics are hovering in the mid-to-high 50s, and their predictive metrics are in the same neighborhood. Beating Georgetown won't help much, but losing to the Hoyas would likely be the final straw. Beating UConn on the road on Feb. 28 is Seton Hall's best hope for a life raft.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Diego StateSaturday at Colorado State | 6 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 2You might expect a road game against Colorado State to fall in Quad 1. But because the Rams (16-10, 7-8 Mountain West) are lagging a bit in the NET, this is a Quad 2 game for San Diego State. If the Aztecs take care of business here, they will be in position to make a late charge since they have likely Quad 1 showdowns with Utah State, New Mexico and Boise State on deck.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    CalSaturday vs. Stanford | 6 p.m. (ACC Network)Entering the day: First Four OutGame status: Quad 2\nBeating Stanford is always important for Cal, but this one has extra meaning since the Bears are trying to fight their way back into field. The home stretch is fairly light from a scheduling perspective, so Cal needs to stack some victories if it wants to enter the ACC Tournament with legitimate at-large hope.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLASaturday vs. No. 10 Illinois | 8 p.m. (Fox)Entering the weekend: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 1UCLA is hanging on to the last No. 9 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, but the Bruins have little margin for error. Where they sit, the bubble gets steep in a hurry. After taking two blowout losses on a trip to Michigan, UCLA now must contend with an Illinois team that has been hanging out in southern California for a few days since drubbing USC 101-65.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New MexicoSaturday at Fresno State | 8 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the weekend: Last Four InGame status: Quad 3A likely Quad 1 showdown at Nevada is up next, but New Mexico can't afford to look ahead as it travels to face a Fresno State team that could play a spoiler role. The Lobos average out at around 46th in both resume and predictive metrics, which puts them squarely on the bubble. While they are in the field for now, they would be subject to expulsion if bid thieves emerge.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    AuburnSaturday vs. Kentucky | 8:30 p.m. (ESPN)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1\nPlaying Kentucky at home is right on the threshold of what's considered a Quad 1 game. But don't get caught up in that. Auburn has lost five straight games and needs a victory over somebody -- anybody -- to stop the slide and regain traction. The Tigers have decent metrics, but at 14-12 (5-8 SEC) they will be a tough sell if they are hovering around .500 on Selection Sunday.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas A&MSaturday at Oklahoma | 8:30 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1Texas A&M squeaked out a must-win home game against Ole Miss on Wednesday to stop a four-game losing streak. The work continues with back-to-back road games against Oklahoma and Arkansas as first-year coach Bucky McMillan seeks to lead an overhauled Aggies roster to the Big Dance. Regardless of who the coach is, A&M always seems to endure violent swings in league play, and this year is no different.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCFSaturday at Utah | 9 p.m. (ESPN+)Entering the weekend: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 2UCF snapped out of a three-game skid by toppling TCU in a double bubble battle on Tuesday. Beating Utah is paramount to keeping things on track for the Knights, who have a solid resume but lagging predictive metrics.

Another chance for a statement comes Wednesday at Saint Mary's, when the Broncos will go for a season sweep of the Gaels. For now, beating San Francisco would be highly advisable if Santa Clara wishes to stay on the right side of the bubble heading into the final week of the WCC regular season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio State Sunday at No. 15 Michigan State | 1 p.m. (CBS)Entering the day: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1 Ohio State is still searching for its first Quad 1 win. The Buckeyes are 0-8 in Q1, 6-1 in Q2 and spotless across Quads 3/4. Their predictive metrics average out around 37th nationally, which is good. The resume is simply in need of a boost. Clearly, slaying Michigan State inside the Breslin Center would be a jolt for their at-large hopes. Even if it doesn't happen, a forthcoming road game against Iowa and a home game against Purdue are still waiting.\n            ",

He's the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft and is averaging 20.0 points per game when he is in the lineup, so he could be the player to take Bill Self's squad over the top in the 2026 NCAA Tournament if he can get healthy and stay healthy.\nDuke Blue Devils: Jon Scheyer's squad made the Final Four last season, but he had to replace his entire starting five after they all left for the NBA. Enter superstar freshman Cameron Boozer, who is averaging 22.8 points, 10.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game.

While Saturday's results will immediately impact the picture, it will be an illuminating exercise that gives college basketball fans a look at where things stand.     \r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the CBS Sports Bracketology model is a strong believer in Michigan as the No. 1 overall seed, there are plenty of interesting questions that will be answered. Does the committee respect Florida's strong standing in predictive metrics enough to make the Gators a No. 2 seed?     \r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                Inside the committee room: What it's like to pick, seed and build the NCAA Tournament bracket\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nWhat about Texas Tech? Will a season-ending injury to star forward JT Toppin keep the Red Raiders off the No. 4 seed line? Then there's the case of Alabama. The Crimson Tide have won five consecutive games and have strong resume. But their predictive metrics suggest they may be closer to a No. 5 seed. Will the committee include Alabama on the No. 4 seed line?     \r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll get answers to those questions and more insight from the bracket preview, which will be aired on CBS at 12:30 p.m. ET on Saturday. For now, our writers are taking their best guess at how the 1-16 hierarchy will look. Here are our takes:     \r\n\n\r\n     Gary Parrish     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastWestSouth\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                   \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                   \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious that Michigan, Duke and Arizona will be three of the projected No. 1 seeds. I'd give the fourth to Iowa State, the school that's currently fourth in the Top 25 And 1. The Cyclones are 14-3 in the first two quadrants with six Q1 wins and zero losses outside of the first quadrant. That's a comparable resume to the resume Houston possesses, and Houston is the other best candidate for the fourth No. 1 seed. But I'm going to let the tiebreaker be the Cyclones' 70-67 victory over Houston that happened just four days ago, and that's why ISU is a No. 1 seed and Houston is a No. 2.     \r\n\r\n\r\n     Matt Norlander     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastWestSouth\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                  \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                  \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Alabama\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me, the No. 1 seeds aren't debatable. Michigan is a lock for No. 1 overall, while Houston beats out Iowa State (despite the head-to-head loss) because it ranks better than the Cyclones in six of the seven team sheet metrics. Both teams are 23-3. ISU has two losses to two teams that could easily miss the tournament (Cincinnati, TCU). I think the No. 2 line is easy until you get to Purdue, and during Thursday's mock exercise in Indy, the Boilermakers started as a No. 3 until the case was made they needed to hop Florida. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think there is a chance the Gators are the last No. 2 seed on Saturday, but the full resume doesn't really support that. If we see UF as a No. 2, it will be because predictive metrics put it there (or Purdue lost on Friday night vs. Indiana). Gonzaga is another one that's interesting to me. The resume metrics definitely put it as a 4-seed, and that Quad 3 loss at Portland I think is the differentiator to get Michigan State a slot above. Alabama is my final team on the line, getting there after winning that epic OT game at home over Arkansas on Wednesday.\r\n\n\r\n     David Cobb     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastWestSouth\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                   \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                   \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Alabama\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are good points to be made on both sides of the Houston vs. Iowa State debate for the fourth No. 1 seed. Iowa State has some better wins, but its losses were also worse. While the Cyclones own a head-to-head victory in Ames, the Cougars rate better in both resume and predictive metrics. If they were dead even on selection metrics, Iowa State would get the nod. But Houston's edge in factors like Wins Above Bubble (WAB) and KenPom make it a deserving No. 1 seed at this juncture.     \r\n\r\n\r\n     Kyle Boone     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastWestSouth\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt the No. 1 seeds were the most straightforward when filling out my predictions. Michigan, Duke and Arizona are locks as of now, yes, and without much pushback, but I think Houston also has the edge for the fourth and final No. 1 seed by a margin wide enough for now to feel good about. It has a higher WAB, it rates better in the predictive metrics and doesn't have the ugly losses like Iowa State has on its resume -- even if ISU currently has a head-to-head win over the Coogs.      \r\n\r\n\r\nWhere things get squirrely for me is the No. 2 line. Iowa State and Illinois were the first No. 2 seeds for me, fairly comfortably, rounded out by Florida and Purdue. Not including UConn or Kansas in that bunch may draw some scrutiny, but Florida and Purdue both have more Quad 1 wins over UConn and also rate higher in the NET, KenPom and BartTorvik. This is where the margins are thin and where the next couple of weeks will prove to be paramount as teams gain separation.     \r\n\n\r\nSince we're here predicting the future, I'll close with one final prediction: The current No. 1 seeds I have -- Michigan, Duke, Arizona, Houston -- will also be the No. 1 seeds on Selection Sunday. But by Selection Sunday, UConn and Kansas will have supplanted two current teams on the No. 2 seed line. Virginia and St. John's will also eventually play their way into  No. 3 seeds.     \r\n\r\n\r\n     Isaac Trotter     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastWestSouth\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Alabama\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nHouston or Iowa State was my biggest pivot point for the final No. 1 seed. Both teams are 15-3 in Quad 1 or 2 games and separated by just a hair in Wins Above Bubble, signaling just how eerily similar these resumes are. Iowa State beat Houston at home in a nail-biter, and the Cyclones' road win over Purdue is better than any of Houston's best victories, but I gave the Cougars the slight nod because predictive metrics are a touch more bullish on what's to come. Houston is second nationally on Bart Torvik; Iowa State is a smidge lower at seventh, largely because it got trucked by Kansas and posted poor offensive showings in losses to two teams (TCU and Cincinnati) that could miss the Big Dance.     \r\n\r\n\r\n     Cameron Salerno     \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSeedMidwestEastSouthWest\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 1                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 2                                                  \r\n  \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNo. 4\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Alabama\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe No. 1 seeds are easy to predict. Michigan and Duke should be on opposite sides of the bracket, and the committee can put Houston and Arizona as the third and fourth No. 1 seeds in the bracket. The toughest decision for me was where to place Kansas, Florida and Illinois. I strongly considered putting Illinois on the No. 2 line, but ultimately went with Kansas. There is still a long way to go before Selection Sunday, but I feel confident that Michigan, Duke, Arizona and Houston will be staying on the No. 1 line next month. The rest of the bracket is up for debate.     \r\n\n            ",

With Porziņģis set to make his regular season debut in Atlanta on Wednesday night, Fred Katz of The Athletic published a story on Porziņģis that revealed the diagnosis he received and why it caused him so many problems trying to play through it. Doctors later diagnosed him with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, he said, more commonly referred to as POTS, an autonomic condition that can dramatically increase a patient's heart rate when standing up instead of spread horizontal. Handled wrong — or not yet diagnosed — and POTS can lead to extreme exhaustion or dizziness.In his worst moments, Porziņģis' heart rate could stabilize while he was lying down, but the act of standing up could rev it to 130 beats per minute.Now that he has a diagnosis, doctors have been able to craft a plan to help him manage his condition without medication. Porziņģis told Katz he's on a \"high salt diet\" and has a regimented rest schedule when he's not playing basketball that allows him to maintain his energy on the court. \n\n        \n            \n                The Conversation: Are the remodeled Hawks ready to take off?\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf that plan is successful, the Hawks could benefit tremendously from acquiring Porziņģis this offseason. He will give them a different offensive dynamic than they've had in the frontcourt alongside Trae Young, as Porziņģis can stretch the floor from the center spot as well as almost anyone in the league. At 7-foot-3, he remains a strong rim protector and his addition is one of the reasons Atlanta is projected to vault into the top six in the East this season -- and potentially nab a top-four spot if all goes well. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Jason Kidd did not confirm Monday that Cooper Flagg will be the Dallas Mavericks' starting point guard in Wednesday night's opener against the Spurs, but don't be surprised if he is. In the Mavericks' last two preseason games, they went with a massive starting five: Flagg, Klay Thompson, P.J. Washington, Anthony Davis and Dereck Lively II.\"When we're looking at him starting at the point guard, it's probably more of a point-forward situation,\" Kidd told reporters. \"But technically we gotta list someone at the point guard position, so I guess we're listing him at the point guard position.\"Flagg, the No. 1 pick in the draft, is one of the more well-rounded 18-year-old basketball players who has ever lived. He's a 6-foot-9 \"forward,\" but at Duke he did everything. He can run pick-and-roll, isolate, post up, set screens, cut and come off pindowns. It makes sense that Kidd wants to empower him, particularly with Kyrie Irving sidelined for at least the first few months of the season. What does it say about Dallas, though, that the rest of that lineup five looks like this? With Davis and Lively sharing the frontcourt, Flagg is going to be saddled with subpar spacing. And with Thompson and Washington on the wing, Flagg is going to have an enormous playmaking burden.That's my concern, anyway. The counter-argument, I suppose, is that defense wins championships.\nThe State of PlayLast year: I have no idea what occurred during the 2024-25 season, actually. I know that Luka Dončić led the Mavericks to the 2024 NBA Finals, and, obviously, I'm aware that Flagg is on the team now. I'm guessing Dončić demanded a trade and Dallas swapped him for the top pick, but my internet is being weird right now so I can't confirm that. Must be an Amazon Web Services issue.The offseason: The Mavs picked Flagg first overall, and the next day they signed undrafted guard Ryan Nembhard to a two-way contract. They re-signed Irving (three years, $118.5 million, player option), extended Washington (four years, $88.8 million) and Daniel Gafford (three years, $54.5 million) and brought back Danté Exum for the minimum. They also added D'Angelo Russell (two years, $11.7 million, player option), waived former No. 24 overall pick Olivier-Maxence Prosper and hired Frank Vogel as Kidd's lead assistant.Las Vegas over/under: 41.5 wins, per FanDuel SportsbookThe ConversationMavericks believer: Cooper Flagg landing in Dallas was a miracle. It is amazing how one player can entirely, instantaneously change a franchise's outlook. If Anthony Davis sprains his ankle on opening night, they still have Flagg. If Kyrie Irving can't play a single game this season, they still have Flagg. The Mavs made a big bet on the Davis-Irving partnership, but if that peaked in Davis' debut, well, they still have Flagg. This is not to say, though, that Dallas can't compete right away. It absolutely can, and it should be easier to win games without the suffocating pressure to do so.\nMavericks skeptic: Yeah, \"miracle\" is the right word: They had a 1.8% chance of landing the No. 1 pick. I'm happy for Mavs fans, but I still can't believe Nico Harrison actually uttered the words, \"Fortune favors the bold.\" I agree with you, too, that Flagg's presence has subdued a previously fraught, volatile situation, but I have a question: What exactly do you mean by \"compete right away?\" Like, compete for what? You don't think this oddly shaped team is a contender, do you? Spacing is important! Playmaking is important! Point-of-attack defense is important! I'd figured that Dallas would make an effort to balance out the roster in the offseason, but, in retrospect, I should've known better than to assume it would do the rational thing.Mavericks believer: Huh? Did you want the Mavs to waste precious resources on another ballhandler even though they know Irving is going to fix that issue? D'Angelo Russell is a perfectly fine stopgap, and they got him at the right price. Personally, I'm hoping that they never even have to start Russell. Flagg is not a conventional PG, but his playmaking ability is what made him one of the best prospects in recent memory. He's a rare bird, so let him spread his wings. If he grows into an All-Star as quickly as I think he will and Irving is in All-NBA form by playoff time, there's no reason this team can't contend right away. We've already seen Washington hold his own at the point of attack in Dallas, by the way, and the same is true of Max Christie, Naji Marshall and Danté Exum. (Exum has been dealing with a right knee injury, but, just like with Irving coming off a torn ACL, this doesn't mean we should forget he exists.)Mavericks skeptic: You know who's a pretty good perimeter defender? Quentin Grimes. He can knock down 3s and create off the bounce, too! Such a shame the Mavs gave up a second-round pick in order to turn him into Caleb Martin at last year's deadline. Anyway, as versatile as Washington has proven to be on defense, he's not exactly my first choice to defend Stephen Curry or De'Aaron Fox. This is just one of the reasons why the Flagg-at-1, Davis-at-4 lineups are cumbersome. Sure, Dallas should be able to dominate the glass and save Davis some wear and tear, but, in addition to the obvious offensive downsides, it makes matchups complicated. Thompson is best guarding 4s, but how often will he be able to do that? Transition defense could be an adventure, too. I preferred positionless basketball when it meant that teams were putting more ballhandling, shooting and speed on the floor.\nMavericks believer: If the Rockets could play Steven Adams, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson together last season -- and win those minutes by 36.5 points per 100 possessions! -- then surely the Mavs can give jumbo ball a try. Regardless of whether or not it ends up working, you're fixating way too much on one starting unit that may or may not be the opening-night starting lineup. What do you think about an Irving-Exum-Christie-Flagg-Davis unit? How about Russell-Marshall-Flagg-Washington-Lively? These lineups are available to Kidd (or, in the case of the first one, will eventually be available) and I trust that he'll turn to them when necessary. And if the size of this team does turn out to be \"cumbersome,\" as you put it, then it's nice that Gafford and Washington signed such fair extensions and Lively is on a rookie deal. The Mavs should have no problem getting good value for any of those guys on the trade market.Mavericks skeptic: I never even considered the possibility that they might trade Lively. That would be an outrageously stupid decision, but I guess I shouldn't put it past them. Look, I'm aware that there is no rule preventing Dallas from playing Davis at the 5 and Flagg at the 4. This roster construction, though, tells us that the organization has no real interest in doing that. It's almost as if the Mavs are catering to Davis, who sees himself as a power forward despite the mountain of evidence that he's best as a center, instead of catering to Flagg. If it were me, I would have already traded Davis, who is 32 years old and will be extension-eligible next summer, and reoriented the entire franchise around its new face. That's how you plant your Flagg.\n            ",

The Raiders hope to beef up their wide receivers room, as they worked out former Kansas City Chiefs wideout Mecole Hardman on Tuesday, per the league's transaction wire. Hardman played the preseason with the Green Bay Packers after he spent 2024 with the Chiefs. In 12 games played last year, he caught 12 passes for 90 yards, and rushed five times for 62 yards and a touchdown. He also returned 20 punts for 203 yards and five kicks for 132 yards.Hardman was a second-round pick of the Chiefs in the 2019 NFL Draft out of Georgia, and he caught a career-high six touchdowns in his first NFL season to go along with 538 yards receiving. His best season as a receiver came in 2021, when Hardman caught 59 passes for 693 yards and two touchdowns.\nHardman is a three-time Super Bowl champion, including Super Bowl LVIII, where he caught the game-winning touchdown in overtime against the San Francisco 49ers. It capped a dramatic 2023 season for Hardman, as he began the year with the New York Jets, before the Chiefs traded back for him just six games into the season. Regarding the Raiders, Tre Tucker is Geno Smith's leading receiver this year, having caught 29 passes for 389 yards and four touchdowns. Vegas spent two draft picks on Dont'e Thornton Jr. and Jack Bech, but the rookies have combined for just 12 receptions, 167 yards and zero touchdowns. \nThe Raiders' passing attack ranks fourth-worst in the NFL with 182.7 passing yards per game. This offense is coming off a humiliating, 31-0 defeat to the Chiefs, in which Pete Carroll's offense ran just 30 plays and picked up 95 total yards.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        CHARLOTTE — Alberto Riveron is on the hunt for sugar.It's Friday night inside ACC headquarters in uptown Charlotte, and halftime of the first game in a rare doubleheader offers a brief reprieve -- and a chance for the conference's supervisor of football officials to grab a Cuban coffee and a second wind before the long night ahead.One problem: The sugar canister is empty. Riveron leans over the counter, tearing open packet after packet until a small white mound forms in a container for use later that night.How much coffee does this guy drink?\"You'll see Saturday,\" he says with a grin. \"Eight or nine shots, at least.\"Riveron, who worked 17 years in the NFL as an official and supervisor, is the point man inside the conference's Game Day Operations Center, located on the 12th floor of the Bank of America Tower. It's here that every reviewable play involving the ACC's 17 teams -- plus Notre Dame and UConn -- is reviewed by replay officials with the help of state-of-the-art technology developed by DVSport.This fall, the league and its broadcast partner, ESPN, rolled out a new initiative to provide a peek behind the scenes of its replay reviews. Now, select games include full access to the audio and video deliberations among the replay supervisor in Charlotte, the replay official at the game, and the on-field referee.\nThe initiative has drawn rave reviews from fans and media alike, prompting the Big 12 to adopt a similar approach and provide audio access on reviews during its broadcasts midway through the season.\"It shows America the due process,\" Riveron tells CBS Sports. \"It shows Americans how we come to a decision. Pulling back the curtain on officiating is always a good thing. It shows everyone the preparation, the passion, the dedication and the ability to want to get it right. Just like the teams, we want to get it right. We need to get it right. This shows what we go through in order to get it right.\"Inside the operations center, 32 screens line two walls. At the front of the room, a 140-square-foot video board displays up to six games at once. Eight workstations, 33 screens, 24 communication lines — and a handful of replay officials obsessed with precision.\nFriday night includes two marquee games: Louisville at No. 2 Miami and Bill Belichick's North Carolina at Cal. By the end of the night, 10 plays are reviewed live on television. Six on-field rulings are upheld, and four are overturned.\n                                                                    Brandon Marcello, CBS Sports\n                                                            Even when plays aren't being reviewed, Riveron and replay supervisor Mark Bitar hover over the touchscreens, flicking through a dozen camera angles like air-traffic controllers. They're constantly rewinding big moments with re-tooled XBox controllers to ensure the game is officiated correctly.An on-field ruling of an interception early in the third quarter of the Louisville-Miami game is questionable at best, and is clearly an incomplete pass on the broadcast as the ball skips off the turf and into the arms of Miami's Jakobe Thomas.\"I'm gonna overturn that,\" Bitar tells the room of 12 ACC workers, including an intern seated at the station, whose job is to chart plays on paper.Riveron calmly walks behind Bitar, and reminds him of the steps ahead. It may seem like an easy call, but there's work to be done.\n\"OK,\" he says. \"Let's go through the process.\"The most famous head in college footballThe man beside Riveron has developed a following of his own. Bitar's disembodied voice emanating from the Charlotte operations center is the one you hear most Fridays and Saturdays as officials review plays on ESPN and the ACC Network. Bitar, a New Jersey educator, has become the ACC's version of \"Mr. Wilson\" from Home Improvement -- his face hidden, his voice the unseen guide over every slow-motion replay.\"Honestly, it's a little funny knowing that the back of my head gets more airtime than my face,\" Bitar tells CBS Sports. \"With that said, it's also a reminder of how many people are tuned in and invested in every game. Replay is about getting things right for the players, coaches and fans, so if people recognize the back of my head, hopefully it means they trust the work we're doing behind the scenes.\"\nBitar, usually in a tucked gray polo, rarely sits. Controller in hand, he flicks the gamepad like a professional gamer on Twitch, chasing perfection in every frame. He guides the game's replay official and on-field referee through a discussion of every reviewable play. Riveron, who watches and studies most games via the large videoboard in the front of the room, typically rises from his seat and walks to the replay station, where he quizzes and reminds Bitar of the processes outlined in the ACC's Replay Manual.Riveron calls it \"The Process Bible.\" \"I'm still teaching. I enjoy teaching. That's why I'm still here,\" says Riveron, 65.Bitar or Riveron begins most conversations with a simple question: \"What's the ruling on the field?\" After the review concludes and a ruling is reached, Bitar asks the officials at the game if they concur.\nBitar began officiating football games at 19, starting with youth games involving third graders. \"Not exactly the bright lights of college football,\" he says, \"but it was the perfect place to learn and was highly enjoyable.\" He rose up the ranks, officiating high school football in New Jersey before stints in Division III and Division I college football. He met Riveron at officiating clinics and was hired as one of Riveron's replay assistants in the NFL. Bitar followed him to the ACC in 2023. \n\"He was probably a little raw, but the hustle in that kid is just unbelievable,\" Riveron says. \"The want-to, can-do, will-do attitude is beyond anybody I've ever seen. He's proven us right. He's hungry and he's one of the best in the country right now, if not the best.\"In many ways, the behind-the-scenes access shown every Saturday has humanized game officials, who are some of the most disliked and controversial figures in sports. Officials are rarely allowed to speak to the media, which leads to more criticism for the lack of transparency after making game-changing calls. \"Once you get away from [process] is when you start making mistakes,\" Riveron says. \"The few times we've made mistakes, I can go back and say we didn't follow the process. There are some judgment situations where you go back and say, 'You know what? We should have gone this way.' That happens. But the majority of the time it's because we don't follow that process. It's very important. I'm a process-oriented person. Maybe that's one of my OCD traits, I don't know, but I know it works in replay and it works in officiating.\"\nAt 1:56 a.m. on Saturday, North Carolina is marching down the field and appears destined to take the lead at Cal. A beautiful throw on a crossing route in the red zone has Nathan Leacock in position to grab the lead, but the ball pops out of his hands and into the end zone for a touchback. Cal's Brent Austin recovers in the back corner of the end zone. The game is not stopped for a review, but Bitar and Riveron converse, rewatching the replay over and over again to make sure everything is above board -- from the fumble happening before crossing the goal line, to the ensuing recovery in the end zone (though the recovery doesn't matter since it was bounding out of bounds).\"It's a good exercise,\" Riveron says.The ACC's Mark Bitar, left, and Al Riveron review a play late In the North Carolina-Cal game on Oct. 18, 2025. \n                                                                    ESPN/ACC\n                                                            At 2:16 a.m., the headsets come off after Cal wraps up a 21-18 win. \"Thank you, everyone,\" Riveron tells the room.In less than nine hours, the crew will return for a 16-hour workday that includes seven more games and plenty of Cuban coffee.\nSlow it downSaturday's early window opens with two games. Just minutes into Georgia Tech-Duke, the first replay review hits. A runner loses the ball,  or so it seems. The officials rule his forward progress was stopped, and the Charlotte crew, live on ESPN, backs them up.\"It's a learning experience every time you listen to it because it's nice and methodical and controlled as far as how they discuss these situations,\" ESPN broadcaster Louis Riddick remarks after the ruling. \"We've learned a lot ourselves just listening to them go through it.\"Back in Charlotte, Riveron's voice booms. \"Methodical,\" he repeats. \"That's the process. If we can do it, we're doing it well.\"Riveron was born in Cuba and emigrated with his mother to the United States in 1963 when he was five years old. He grew up in Miami, where he still lives, and started officiating football games in 1977. He started reffing college games in 1990 and was hired as a side judge in the NFL in 2004, becoming the first Hispanic to officiate in the league. He served as a crew chief referee for five years before he was elevated to the NFL's senior director of officiating and later to the senior vice president of officiating.\nAs the afternoon games wind down, Riveron starts editing cut-ups of plays he'll use to teach and inform ACC officials and coaches the next day.He's referring to a fair-catch call in the Miami game, where Malachi Toney ever so slightly waves his arm side to side below his waistband before sprinting ahead after the catch -- a subtle move, but still technically a fair-catch call that was correctly identified by on-field officials.These are the moments that test officials most. In real time, it's easy to miss calls as 22 bodies fly past you at 20 mph. It is easy to criticize in retrospect, but still difficult to identify in the moment.The best officials learn to slow the game down and find stillness amid the chaos, Riveron says. They grow accustomed to the speed and tendencies of quarterbacks and runners, picking up on body language to boost their confidence as they study the field. Officials, like coaches, study hours of film before officiating a game.The process reminds Riveron of a car accident he suffered years ago, when a drunk driver, he says, ran through a stop sign and hit the back side of his vehicle, sending it spinning across the intersection.In a recollection that sounds similar to those who say they see their life flash before their eyes during traumatizing events, Riveron said time slowed as the car spun. He spotted a tree out of the corner of his eye and immediately thought: \"I hope the car spins enough that it hits the other side.\" His son, Austin, wanted to ride with him to the store, but he told him to stay home and clean the cage housing their pet rabbit, Fluffy. If he had joined his father, the tree would have hit the passenger side of the car.\"I still get goosebumps,\" Riveron says, lifting his left arm.Riveron escaped with only bruises. He called his NFL boss, Mike Pereira, that Thursday and said he'd be ready to work Sunday.\"Officials,\" he says with a laugh. \"We're crazy like that.\"Crazy? Possibly. A life lesson for an NFL official? Sure. \"I also thought, I hope slowing this down is also something I can take to the field.\"The impetus for transparencyTwo controversial finishes in Miami victories in 2024 spurred the ACC to make changes, allowing ESPN unprecedented access to their replay reviews this season. If fans are confused, the ACC figured, why not let them listen in?ACC Network executive Jeremy Michiaels described the ACC's decision as a \"calculated risk to be innovative with the television audience\" in an interview earlier this year with The Virginian-Pilot. \"We really have nothing to hide,\" said ACC football executive Michael Strickland.The ACC began allowing cameras in the replay center in 2023, but without audio. Since then, the United Football League has allowed video and audio access on replay reviews to broadcast partners. Riveron said the NFL was contemplating a similar experiment before the pandemic shut everything down in 2020.\"People understand coaches are human; they're going to make mistakes,\"  Riveron said. \"Players are players; they're going to make mistakes; and we're going to make mistakes, too. But now they can see the process. That's important. When people realize there's a due process, and we follow that process to reach a decision, that's the most important thing. As long as coaches coach, players play and officials officiate, there's going to be mistakes in the game. It's a human element.\"In the end, there's always controversyOn Saturday, 15 plays were reviewed across seven games. But as the clock hit midnight on the West Coast, tension spiked as Florida State and Stanford traded blows. In a 37-minute span, four reviews were initiated.Among those was a critical third-down catch to convert a first down for the Seminoles, and a targeting call on a 35-yard run by FSU quarterback Tommy Castellanos. Both on-field rulings were upheld after review.This one wasn't part of ESPN's \"mic'd up\" slate, meaning no live audio from Charlotte. Fans could only guess what Bitar and Riveron were seeing and saying.The television broadcast suffered technical difficulties, including digital artifacts appearing on the feed. Camera angles were also limited.The ACC's biggest replay review came on the weekend's final play. At 2:14 a.m. ET, FSU's Gavin Sawchuk lunged for the goal line and was ruled inches short.FSU trailed 20-13. A touchdown could tie or win the game for the Seminoles, and alleviate the hot-seat chatter surrounding coach Mike Norvell, who entered Saturday on an eight-game losing streak in the ACC. \"The game is not over,\" an on-field official announced twice over the public-address systemReplay views from the final play of Stanford's 20-13 victory against Florida State. FSU was ruled short of the goal line. \n                                                                    ESPN/ACC\n                                                            In Charlotte, Bitar cycles through cameras to identify the two best angles for the review: a handheld camera near the goal line and an overhead camera stationed at the 50-yard line, which was zoomed in on the play.Bitar scrubs the play again and again: Sawchuk leaning to his right side, stretching his arms and the ball inching toward the goal line as the frame freezes mid-fall. Biltar pinpoints the moment Sawchuk's shin hits the turf, and then freezes on the last possible frame when Sawchuk's legs are still upright.\"Identify where the ball is,\" he directs replay official at the game. \"... I'm trying to be able to identify whether or not this ball is crossing the line, and based off the 50-yard line and near handheld. So, what do you think about this one with the 50-yard line and the near handheld?\"There was one problem: the handheld camera's view of the ball was impeded by a player. \"I'm not exactly sure where the ball is at this point,\" Bitar communicated to the replay official and referee. \"Right?\"Silence. The officials at the game answered Bitar's question.\"I agree with you. Ruling on the field is upheld,\" Bitar said. \"The ruling on the field is upheld.\"It's 2:17 a.m. ET, and in a few seconds, Stanford fans will hear the news and explode in celebration. Riveron nods in Charlotte. The process, once again, has the final word.\"Thank you, everyone,\" Riveron tells his crew..Head official Darryl DeBerry turns on his microphone in Stanford. \"After further review, the ruling on the field of the runner being short of the goal line is upheld. That's ball game.\"The replay officials in Charlotte look to their screens, staring at the scene unfolding in Stanford. Stunned? Relieved? \"Please don't storm the field,\" Strickland mutters from the back of the room.On cue, Stanford students storm the field.\"There's a certain judgment at the end of the day involved in mostly everything we do,\" Riveron said before Saturday's games. \"But we can control how the process is laid out. If people sit down for two games today, we have six reviews, and we do every review the same way and follow the process, we win.\"In Charlotte, the room exhales after a 16-hour day at ACC HQ. Screens fade to black. Another night, another judgment, another reminder of what Riveron preaches most: Follow the process and live with the rest.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Big 12 has been the most unpredictable conference in college football over the past several years, and the title race is once again up in the air. Prohibitive favorite Texas Tech lost a stunner against Arizona State, opening the door for several others.Heading into the month of November last year, there were nine Big 12 teams technically alive for the Big 12 title because of tiebreakers. Four teams tied for first place at the end of the year, with Arizona State beating out Iowa State for a Big 12 title and College Football Playoff appearance. It's worth noting the conference has produced a brand-new participant in the Big 12 Championship Game in seven of the last eight years. Four of the five teams with one or fewer losses in conference play would be first-time participants. The Big 12 chaos wheel keeps turning. Here's how we handicap every school in the Big 12 title race, from top contenders to bottom of the barrel. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Texas A&M, Alabama rise into top five amid shakeup in college football rankings\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe top contendersTexas Tech (6-1, 3-1): Despite looking mortal in a loss to Arizona State last week, Texas Tech remains the team to beat in the Big 12. The defensive line has exceeded all expectations as linebackers David Bailey and Jacob Rodriguez both earned Midseason All-America honors. With quarterback Behren Morton healthy, this is still the best team in the Big 12, but he needs to get healthy. BYU (7-0, 4-0): The Cougars have played one of the easiest schedules in the Big 12, but a win over Utah last weekend vaulted them into the top group. There's a marquee matchup with Texas Tech on Nov. 8 and road trips to Iowa State and Cincinnati, but even 1-2 in those games should be enough to reach Arlington. Arizona State (5-2, 3-1): The Sun Devils' 2025 season is eerily similar to their 2024 campaign, down to losing big without quarterback Sam Leavitt in the lineup. However, Leavitt's 319-yard return against Texas Tech helps push them back towards the contender pile with only one loss. The schedule is tricky from here on out, but not impossible, and the tiebreaker against Texas Tech is huge. While Texas Tech remains the prohibitive betting favorite on FanDuel, the Sun Devils now have the second-best odds to win the Big 12.\nJust need one breakCincinnati (6-1, 4-0): The Bearcats have been the surprise team of the Big 12 season, and perhaps belong in the top group. Cincinnati was a near-comeback against Nebraska away from an undefeated start. The trenches have been the star of the show, led by All-American Dontay Corleone and FCS transfer Joe Cotton. Games against Baylor and Utah in the next two weeks can cement their contender status. Utah (5-2, 2-2): The Utes are a high quality team, perhaps third-best in the Big 12. The problem? The Utes have tiebreaking losses to both Texas Tech and BYU through the first seven games, along with a matchup remaining against No. 21 Cincinnati. Tiebreaker math just isn't on their side. Houston (6-1, 3-1): Willie Fritz wins everywhere he goes, but he has outdone himself with this instant rebuild at Houston. The Cougars have already clinched their first bowl trip since joining the Big 12, and have plenty of potential wins left on the schedule. That said, Houston has been a little streaky offensively, but there's another level there. \nIowa State (5-2, 2-2): After a fantastic start, the Cyclones lost head-scratching road games against Cincinnati and Colorado in recent weeks. Now, they play No. 11 BYU, No. 24 Arizona State and on the road against TCU in the next three games. It's a frustrating way to whiff on what could have been a historic season. Outside looking inTCU (5-2, 2-2): The Horned Frogs' inconsistency has reared its head over the past few weeks, including a 13-point loss to Kansas State on the road. The schedule ahead has many pitfalls, including at No. 11 BYU, Iowa State and No. 21 Cincinnati. The Frogs likely still control their own destiny, but it's a rough road. Baylor (4-3, 2-2): Baylor has underwhelmed after lofty expectations to start the year, and needed strokes of luck just to outlast SMU and Kansas State. A struggling defensive line has led to them ranking amongst the worst defensive units in college football, but a stacked offense at least gives them a chance every week. \nKansas State (3-4, 2-2): Beating UCF served as a get-right game, and the Wildcats have turned things on over the last three games. But the early season woes are still dragging Kansas State down, and a blocked 57-yard field goal against Baylor prevents them from having a realistic path to contention. Kansas (4-3, 2-2): Quarterback Jalon Daniels has been everything that was promised, but the defense has cost the Jayhawks games. There are plenty of 50-50 games ahead, but none are more important than the Sunflower Showdown against Kansas State this week. Working through thingsArizona (4-3, 1-3): Outside of a game against Oklahoma State, the Wildcats have played a brutal Big 12 schedule. Even still, they beat Kansas State in nonconference and played BYU and Houston to within six points. The Wildcats are a much more competent football team in 2025 under Brent Brennan, and the resurgence of Noah Fifita has been a welcome change. \nColorado (3-4, 1-3): The Buffaloes have been inconsistent, but the team has been well coached and given themselves a chance in every game. Colorado shocked Iowa State and took BYU to the wire. The schedule is brutal, but a bowl game could be in sight. UCF (4-3, 1-3): The Knights have shown some promising signs under first-year coach Scott Frost. The headliner was a 45-13 decimation of lowly West Virginia, but close games against Cincinnati and Kansas show that the program has clearly taken a step. Assuming a win against Oklahoma State, they just need to pull an upset against Baylor or Houston to return to the postseason. Battle for lastWest Virginia (2-5, 0-4): Rich Rodriguez got his revenge against Pittsburgh in Week 3, and the wheels have fully flown off since. The Mountaineers have been outscored by 111 points in four Big 12 games, including a 45-13 loss to UCF last week. If the Mountaineers finish winless, it will be the first such conference campaign for WVU since 1960. \nOklahoma State (1-6, 0-4): The Cowboys are comically bad, but the vibes have gone up tremendously under interim coach Doug Meacham. According to SP+, the Cowboys rank behind FCS Monmouth and just ahead of Division II Ferris State in quality. Neat! \n            ",

    "body": "\nThough there are six teams on a bye in Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season, we've still got 13 games on the schedule headlined by Aaron Rodgers facing his former team when the Green Bay Packers visit the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Philadelphia Eagles getting a rematch with the New York Giants and the New York Jets searching for their first win when they visit the Cincinnati Bengals. The Steelers and Jets are underdogs while the Eagles are favorites at top sportsbooks.If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 8 NFL games, be sure to see what SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has put together. He's going with two parlays for Week 8, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 8 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a 3-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL moneyline favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-2024, NFL moneyline favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.NFL favorites dominated the opening week, winning 13 of 16 games for an 81.2% success rate. The second Week saw more competitive results, with favorites winning 9 of 16 games for a 56.2% success rate. In Week 3 of the 2025 NFL season, 12 out of 16 favorites won outright, giving betting favorites a 75.0% success rate. In Week 4, favorites struggled on a relative basis, going 10-5-1. Two weeks ago, NFL betting favorites had their worst Week this season, going 8-5. In Week 6, NFL betting chalk bounced back by winning 11 of 15 games. Last Week, favorites had another excellent performance, going 12-3 after both chalk won on MNF.NFL betting favorites have won 75 out of 107 games in the first seven weeks of the 2025 season, achieving an overall success rate of 70.0%. This figure is slightly lower than last year's rate of 71.8%, but it has increased over the past two weeks. What does this mean for Week 8? Will there be any upsets?Kansas City Chiefs over Washington Commanders\nThe Chiefs have rediscovered their championship form at precisely the right moment, entering their Week 8 Monday night matchup against Washington as 9.5 to 10.5-point favorites with commanding -650 money line odds. Kansas City's 31-0 shutout victory over Las Vegas in Week 7 marked the first shutout of Andy Reid's illustrious coaching career. It showcased the Chiefs' offensive firepower with the return of wide receiver Rashee Rice. Patrick Mahomes is playing at an MVP level, ranking third in QBR (77.9) with 1,800 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and only two interceptions through seven games.Defensively, Kansas City ranks third in scoring defense (17.7 points per game) and fifth in total defense (280.3 yards per game). The unit has generated crucial turnovers and pressures at opportune moments, with the defensive front recording consistent pressure rates. Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels is dealing with a hamstring injury that may limit his mobility—the exact attribute that makes him dangerous. His status is still up in the air as of Wednesday. A healthy Marcus Mariota is a downgrade. Even if Daniels plays, the Commanders rank 28th in yards allowed per play (5.8 per game) and will struggle to contain Kansas City's diverse offensive attack.The Chiefs have won four of their last five games and are hitting their stride as the schedule intensifies. Patrick Mahomes has a 9-4 record on Monday Night Football in his career, including 8-2 when favored. This includes the Chiefs' most recent Monday night game on October 6, when they lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars. There is no way Mahomes and company will drop two straight games on MNF in the same season. New England Patriots over Cleveland BrownsThe  Patriots have emerged as one of the NFL's most surprising stories, riding a four-game winning streak into their Week 8 home matchup against Cleveland as 6.5 to 7-point favorites with a hefty money line of -320. Drake Maye has elevated his game in his second season, breaking Tom Brady's franchise record for completion percentage by completing 91.3% of his passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns against Tennessee. Head coach Mike Vrabel got his revenge after being fired by the Titans, although the first half remained competitive. I don't think the Patriots will have a letdown, as Vrabel won't allow that to happen.Maye's four-game stretch without a turnover has coincided perfectly with New England's winning streak, and his efficiency metrics are exceptional. He's completed over 80% of his passes in three games this season, demonstrating excellent decision-making and mobility. The Patriots rank fifth in scoring defense and have allowed just 312.9 yards per game. They have faced the easiest schedule up to Week 7, but their underlying metrics remain strong.Cleveland enters at 2-5 with significant offensive limitations, ranking 30th in total offense (270.7 yards per game) and 30th in passing yards per game (178.1). We might get a look at Shedeur Sanders at some point in this game. The Browns have underperformed offensively, averaging only 16.1 points per game, which puts them near the bottom of the league (30th overall). They're up against a Patriots defense that's good at creating turnovers and limiting big plays. On the other side, New England's offensive line has performed surprisingly well this season, ranking fourth in pass-blocking efficiency according to Pro Football Focus, allowing pressure on 32.9% of plays. That's key when playing a front seven of Cleveland's ability, although their road/home splits are significant. New England continues its winning ways.Baltimore Ravens over Chicago BearsThe Ravens desperately need to win their Week 8 home game against the Chicago Bears to end a disappointing 1-5 start, and the conditions are favorable for a strong performance. Most importantly, Lamar Jackson is expected to return from the hamstring injury that sidelined him for two games before the bye week. Jackson's absence exposed the Ravens' offensive limitations with backup Cooper Rush, as Baltimore was outscored 61-13 in those two contests. The organization has always been careful not to rush Jackson back from injury.The matchup favors Baltimore significantly. Chicago's offense has committed 15 turnovers in its last four games, creating additional possessions for opponents. While the Bears enter 4-2, their defensive rankings are middling—25th in total defense and scoring defense. The Bears have had an easier schedule compared to the Ravens, who have faced the most difficult slate this season.Baltimore is also getting healthier across the roster, with Ronnie Stanley, Kyle Hamilton, and Marlon Humphrey returning before the bye, and potentially Roquan Smith, Chidobe Awuzie, and Patrick Ricard joining Jackson for this matchup. The Ravens, with Jackson as quarterback, have a top-10 offensive EPA, and he is 24-5 against the NFC in his career. If Jackson chooses to wait another week, I am confident in Cooper Rush at a significantly lower price with an additional week to prepare. John Harbaugh has a record of 14-3 after a bye since he began coaching the Ravens in 2008. Take Baltimore in this spot.Week 8 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.New York Jets over Cincinnati BengalsThe money line for the home team is significantly inflated. We should place a bet on this on principle alone. Tyrod Taylor is expected to become the starting quarterback for New York, taking over from the ineffective Justin Fields. This change represents a substantial improvement in several areas. Taylor averaged 36 pass attempts and 152 yards per game in limited action, compared to Fields' averages of 21 attempts and 130 yards. While Taylor threw two interceptions in relief against Carolina, his Week 3 start against Tampa Bay produced two touchdowns on strong accuracy. He was 26-of-36 for 197 yards.The Jets have a solid defense, holding their last two foes to 13 points. They rank 14th in yards per play defense (5.3), while the Bengals are ranked 31st. New York possesses one of the league's premier cornerbacks in Sauce Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro. He represents an elite matchup tool and can neutralize one side of the field against the Bengals' receiving corps.When you bet a significant underdog, you need that team to at least be better at \"something\" than the other team. That box is checked, and if the offense can put up at least 20 points, this will be an easy upset winner. There is no way Joe Flacco and these Bengals should be this large of a favorite. It will be the coldest game (mid-40s) that both teams have played so far, which typically leads to crazy outcomes. Be on the lookout for an upset involving a winless team.New Orleans Saints over Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nWe have seen this before from the Saints. They defeated Tampa Bay in 2021 as 4-point home dogs 2021. Tom Brady was the quarterback for the Buccaneers, while the Saints had Trevor Siemian and Jameis Winston take snaps in that victory. They have four outright wins against their NFC South rival over the last 10 meetings. Division games are usually closely contested when the line is less than five, and home underdogs in the division have been the sharp side for decades.The Buccaneers are coming off a brutal Monday Night Football loss to the Detroit Lions, falling 24-9 in their first road defeat. This short week presents significant challenges for Tampa Bay, as the Bucs have just six days to prepare. Travel fatigue is often one of the most understated storylines in professional sports, and the Buccaneers' schedule has been particularly taxing with three games on short rest this season.The road team's injuries are piling up and it's not exactly at the best time. The Buccaneers suffered two devastating blows during their Monday night loss, with star wide receiver Mike Evans going down with a broken collarbone and concussion. Haason Reddick was carted off the field with a knee and ankle injury in the fourth quarter. That certainly hurts their pass rush.The Saints' performance in Week 4 against Buffalo, staying competitive with a Super Bowl contender, indicates they can exceed their record when execution improves. They achieved more first downs and ran more total plays, but were outgained by 58 yards. New Orleans has been competitive at home with all three losses by 7 points or less. Rookie head coach Kellen Moore has his team playing hard. This game has upset written all over it.Pittsburgh Steelers over Green Bay Packers\nThis Sunday Night Football matchup features one of Week 8's most intriguing storylines. By winning this game, Rodgers would defeat every NFL franchise in the modern era. Green Bay has a record of 4-1-1 but faces a challenging schedule quirk against an angry team coming off a narrow 2-point loss.The Steelers have ten days to prepare after losing by two points on the road last Thursday, while the Packers will play their second consecutive road game and four of their previous five games away from home. That is not an ideal situation, especially when playing in Pittsburgh. Interestingly, Green Bay will also be participating in its second outdoor road matchup; the Packers lost the first one 13-10 against Cleveland in Week 3. Mike Tomlin's teams are 7-2 after losing on Thursday Night Football, including 5-1 in the last six tries. The extra prep time is another advantage for the home team.Pittsburgh operates in the NFL's most challenging home environment. The Steelers rank first in home-field advantage, with a 37-21-1 record at home since 2018, with a substantial penalty advantage over opponents. The crowd noise at Acrisure Stadium generates false starts and pre-snap penalties at a rate 42.5% higher than any other NFL venue. The Packers rank 28th, averaging 8.3 penalties per game. Combining all the above mentioned data points, I believe the Steelers are an excellent bet to win outright at plus money.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Both the Los Angeles Chargers and Minnesota Vikings are coming off losses to teams that have looked elite in the first half of the NFL season, but both teams will have the opportunity for a quick bounceback on Thursday Night Football in Week 8.

Allen has 44 catches for 435 yards and four touchdowns in his first seven games back with the Chargers and is coming off his most productive game yet against the Colts, catching 11 passes for 119 yards and a score. The model predicts that he scores 0.50 touchdowns on average while the odds imply a 40.8% chance to score.Jordan Addison, Vikings (+180, DraftKings)The former first-round pick scored 19 touchdowns over his first two seasons in the NFL and he's been heavily involved in the Minnesota offense since returning from a three-game suspension to start the season. Addison has been targeted 26 times in three games and has 18 catches for 283 yards and a touchdown so far in 2025. Last week, he was targeted 12 times and finished with nine catches for 129 yards (all season-highs). The odds imply that Addison scores 35.7% of the time, but the model predicts that he scores 0.43 touchdowns on average.Josh Oliver, Vikings (+900, DraftKings)Oliver sits behind T.J. Hockenson on the Minnesota depth chart, but Kevin O'Connell incorporates plenty of two-tight sets into his offense and that's yielded some scoring opportunities. Oliver had five touchdowns on 44 receptions over his first two seasons with the Vikings and he's already scored twice over the first six games of the 2025 season. He's only been targeted seven times overall, but has played nearly 40% of Minnesota's offensive snaps and his size (6-foot-5, 260 pounds) has been an asset in the red zone. The model predicts that Oliver scores 0.20 touchdowns on average while the odds imply a 10% chance to score.Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Chargers vs. Vikings.

    "body": "\n        Tuesday is more like an opening ceremony than an opening night. Yes, we get two high-profile games, but those are really more about the pomp and circumstance. The Thunder got their rings. The NBA returned to NBC. There was drama. There was emotion. There were only two basketball games.  Wednesday is opening night for the diehards. Of the 26 teams didn't tip on Tuesday, 24 will take the court for the first time with a total of 12 games. Those games will range the entire spectrum of competitiveness, with contenders and pretends alike vying for your eyeballs and betting dollars. So let's go through all 12 games and make one pick for each of them using lines from DraftKings Sportsbook.  Big news, NBA fans. The all-new DraftKings promo code gives new users three free months of NBA League Pass and $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Get started here. NBA League Pass lets you watch out-of-market NBA games, live and on demand. NBA League Pass users can also use multi-view features to stream multiple games at the same time, making it even easier to watch your favorite players,  teams, NBA bets, or Fantasy basketball lineups. Claim your offer now: Cleveland Cavaliers at New York Knicks  \nNo Mitchell Robinson? No Josh Hart? Jarrett Allen will be able to rebound in peace without his two tormentors from the 2023 first-round series between the Knicks and Cavaliers. Allen has averaged above this line in rebounding in each of the past six seasons, and with two key Knicks sidelined, he should be able to start off well on the glass. The Pick: Jarrett Allen Over 9.5 Rebounds  \n  \tMiami Heat at Orlando Magic  \nI ranked the defenses before the season. Orlando came in at No. 2 and Miami at No. 10. Tyler Herro is out, so it's not clear where Miami's offense is going to come from. Orlando's offensive preseason was pretty choppy, so it should take some time for them to figure out how to incorporate Desmond Bane. Basically, I'm expecting a slugfest. The Pick: Under 217.5    \tBrooklyn Nets at Charlotte Hornets  \nI really want a prop based on turnovers in this one considering how many ball-dominant rookies the Nets just drafted. While I certainly wouldn't extoll LaMelo Ball's defensive virtues in most regards, the idea of him stalking passing lanes against careless freshman appeals to me. He's averaged 1.5 steals per game for his career, so the extra juice I'm getting on two or more steals at +175 is worth the risk of trusting his defense. The Pick: LaMelo Ball Over 1.5 Steals  Big news, NBA fans. The all-new DraftKings promo code gives new users three free months of NBA League Pass and $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.

NBA League Pass users can also use multi-view features to stream multiple games at the same time, making it even easier to watch your favorite players,  teams, NBA bets, or Fantasy basketball lineups. Claim your offer now:  \n  \tPhiladelphia 76ers at Boston Celtics  \nYou're never going to get a healthier Joel Embiid than you do on opening night, and a questionable Jaylen Brown only underlines how limited Boston's post-teardown front court really is. By all means, doubt Philadelphia's long-term prospects. I'm pretty optimistic about Embiid destroying Neemias Queta, Chris Boucher and Luka Garza. The Pick: Embiid Over 25.5 Points    \tToronto Raptors at Atlanta Hawks  \nMy first straight up game line pick. I'm a massive Toronto doubter. I don't think the starters make any sense together, and the team will only really be viable when they've removed RJ Barrett from the starting five in favor of more shooting. For now, locker room politics force them to trot out the wrong players against a Hawks team that finally makes quite a bit of sense together. Trae Young has his athletic wings, who in turn have a shooting big man in Kristaps Porziņģis to space the floor. This should be a statement win for the Hawks. The Pick: Hawks -5.5    \tWashington Wizards at Milwaukee Bucks  \nThere isn't a realistic line high enough for me not to take the over on Giannis Antetokounmpo's points in this game. A well-spaced offense for him against a tanker with one of the skinniest front courts in the NBA? Alex Sarr will eventually be a very good defender. Giannis might put him through the rim at some point in this game. This will be a statement from Antetokounmpo. His time in Milwaukee may be coming to an end, but he's still here now, and he's going to make the most of it. The Pick: Antetokounmpo Over 31.5 Points  \n  \tDetroit Pistons at Chicago Bulls  \nJosh Giddey made multiple 3-pointers in 17 of his last 25 games last season. The volume is way up, and while he's still not much of a threat as a pull-up shooter, he's at least gotten more comfortable firing up in spot-up situations. The Pistons will make Giddey prove he's capable of making those shots, so expect him to fire away early and often. The Pick: Josh Giddey Over 1.5 3s    \tNew Orleans Pelicans at Memphis Grizzlies  \nGiddey had a great end of the season from a shooting perspective. Herb Jones had a down shooting year when healthy last year. Keep in mind: the Pistons lost Fred Vinson, the best shooting coach in the NBA, to Detroit before last season began. I don't mind making Jones prove that he can maintain his strong 2023-24 shooting without Vinson in the building. The Pick: Jones Under 1.5 3s    \tLos Angeles Clippers at Utah Jazz  \nThis game has blowout potential, so don't be surprised if key players are done before the fourth quarter. The Clippers are integrating a number of new ball-handlers. Oh, and James Harden doesn't seem to be in great shape to kick off the season. I'm expecting the Clippers to coast to such an easy victory that Harden doesn't have to maintain an especially high usage. The Pick: Harden Under 8.5 Assists  \n  \tSan Antonio Spurs at Dallas Mavericks  \nThe Mavericks seem to be leaning heavily into Cooper Flagg as a primary ball-handler. I don't trust the Dallas offense to shoot well enough to be viable or have enough space inside for consistently strong alley-oops. In other words, I'm quite low on D'Angelo Russell props. The Pick: Russell Under 5.5 Assists    \tMinnesota Timberwolves at Portland Trail Blazers  \nPortland's defense is one of the most underrated units going into the season. Minnesota's shooting is a bit suspect despite last year's jump. A lot of younger perimeter players like Rob Dillingham and Terrance Shannon will have to step in now that Nickeil Alexander-Walker is gone, so the transition there could get ugly. I'm expecting a low-scoring game here. The Pick: Under 221.5    \tSacramento Kings at Phoenix Suns  \nNeither team can protect the basket. Sacramento has two reliable defenders. One of them is Keegan Murray, who is hurt, and the other is Keon Ellis, who is buried behind older former stars. Phoenix has Dillon Brooks. Cool. Ryan Dunn's shot still raises questions about how many minutes he can play. Neither team can protect the rim. I'm anticipating a lot of offense in this one. The Pick: Over 228.5  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL season is nearing its halfway point, and the league is as unpredictable as ever.Entering the Week 8 slate of games, six of the eight divisions have a team in first place -- or tied for first -- that did not win its division last season. All of the divisions in the AFC have new leaders: the New England Patriots in the AFC East, the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC North, the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South and the Denver Broncos in the AFC West. The Green Bay Packers lead the NFC North and the San Francisco 49ers top the NFC West, rounding out the six divisions with new frontrunners.The Colts still have the AFC's best record at 6-1, while the Packers are atop the NFC at 4-1-1. Green Bay has a huge matchup Sunday night in Pittsburgh, which highlights the Week 8 slate. The Broncos host the Dallas Cowboys, and the Buffalo Bills return from their bye to face the Carolina Panthers.Of course, overreactions are part of the NFL experience these days. Can we will them into existence? Perhaps, depending on how this week's games unfold -- and how we predict they'll go.\nThese overreaction predictions are based on what we think will happen this week, rather than the actual results.Buckle up.Dak Prescott will vault himself to front of NFL MVP conversation\nPrescott has been playing at an MVP level all year, yet he's been overshadowed by the Cowboys' record (3-3-1) and a defense that ranks last in the NFL in yards allowed per game (401.6), tied for 30th in yards per play allowed (6.1), and 30th in points per possession (2.72).There's a real conversation to be had regarding Prescott's MVP candidacy. He ranks fourth in the league in completion percentage (71.4%), second in passing yards (1,881), second in passing touchdowns (16) and eighth in passer rating (107.6). Prescott has been outstanding but remains under the radar among MVP candidates.\nIf the Cowboys beat the Broncos in Denver and Prescott maintains this form against a top-five pass defense, expect the MVP talk around him to grow louder.NFL MVP oddsvia FanDuel Sportsbook PlayerOddsImplied ProbabilityPatrick Mahomes+12544.4%Josh Allen+35022.2%Drake Maye+70012.5%Baker Mayfield+90010.0%Matthew Stafford+12007.7%Jared Goff+18005.3%Dak Prescott+22004.3%Daniel Jones+22004.3%Jordan Love+25003.8%Lamar Jackson+33002.9%Sam Darnold+33002.9%Jalen Hurts+33002.9%Justin Herbert+40002.4%Best Week 7 NFL games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.Vikings have a quarterback problem\nThe Vikings are starting Carson Wentz on Thursday night against the Chargers, as head coach Kevin O'Connell said J.J. McCarthy (ankle) isn't ready to return. Minnesota is on a short week, but McCarthy was questionable to play before being ruled inactive as the emergency third quarterback.\nWentz has been solid but inconsistent in his four starts, completing 66.9% of his passes for 1,072 yards with five touchdowns and four interceptions for an 89.3 passer rating. That inconsistency has been a theme since his 2017 knee injury. Sunday's loss to the Eagles was another example, as Wentz threw two interceptions in the defeat.Now Wentz is dealing with a shoulder injury on a short week, and McCarthy still isn't ready to return. Do the Vikings even want him back yet? Outside of the fourth quarter in Week 1, McCarthy has struggled mightily in his brief tenure as a starter.If Wentz struggles again, the Vikings will have to go back to McCarthy after their bye week. If McCarthy struggles, a talented Vikings team will remain without a reliable quarterback. Meanwhile, Sam Darnold is thriving in Seattle -- and Minnesota let him walk in free agency.\nThe Vikings created this mess. Moving on from Darnold may have been a mistake.\n        \n            \n                Did the Vikings botch their QB situation? Reassessing Minnesota's now-bumpy bet on J.J. McCarthy, backup plans\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBengals will win the AFC NorthWhy was the Bengals' win over the Steelers significant? Cincinnati avoided falling too far behind in the AFC North race, remaining just two games back in the loss column -- and holding the tiebreaker. The Bengals are also only one game out of the final playoff spot, so there's plenty to play for.The Bengals face the 0-7 Jets this week, which should be a win based on how New York has played. The Jets aren't a pushover, but their offense has been stagnant all season. The Steelers, meanwhile, host the Packers, who own the NFC's best record. Pittsburgh is facing a must-win game to maintain its division lead.If the Bengals beat the Jets and the Steelers lose to the Packers, Cincinnati will be just one game back in the loss column. The Steelers play the Colts and Chargers before meeting the Bengals again in Week 11. Cincinnati faces the Bears before its bye, then gets Pittsburgh again.\nThe AFC North is far from decided.Bears are a playoff team in the NFC\nThe Bears have a big game this week against the Ravens, who should be getting Lamar Jackson back at quarterback following their bye. This is a true road test for Chicago, which sits at 4-2 as the No. 8 seed in the NFC. The Bears' strength of victory isn't great (.339), and they haven't beaten a team currently above .500.While the 1-5 Ravens wouldn't count as a win over a team above .500, Baltimore remains dangerous with Jackson healthy and a defense that showed improvement in a Week 5 loss to the Rams. A win would knock the Ravens further out of the AFC playoff picture and put the Bears at 5-2 -- squarely in the mix for both the NFC North and a playoff berth.The back half of the Bears' schedule is tough, but this game is a chance for Chicago to prove it's for real. The Bears are making legitimate progress toward that under first-year head coach Ben Johnson.\nJets won't win a game until after Thanksgiving\nThe only winless team in the NFL, the Jets have bigger problems than they may want to admit. While questions surround whether Aaron Glenn can coach, the defense hasn't been the issue -- ranking 16th in yards allowed per game (326.4) and 14th in yards per play (5.3). That's not the profile of an 0-7 team.The offense, however, has been abysmal. The Jets rank 29th in yards per game (271.3), 30th in yards per play (4.5), and 28th in offensive points per game (17.1). Justin Fields was benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor last week, as New York ranks last in passing yards per game (143.4), and Fields ranks 40th among quarterbacks in net yards per pass attempt (4.9). Fields takes far too many sacks, as the Jets rank last in sack rate (15.2%).Simply put, Fields isn't a starting quarterback in the NFL. Taylor may bring stability, but he isn't the long-term answer either. The Jets would need an elite defense to stay competitive, but upcoming matchups with the Bengals, Browns, Patriots and Ravens make that unlikely.\nTheir best shot at a win before Thanksgiving might be against the Browns, but even Cleveland tends to take care of business against bad teams. There's a real possibility the Jets won't have a good chance to win until Week 14 against the Dolphins -- and by then, Mike McDaniel may not even be the team's coach.The Jets are in the midst of one of the worst seasons in franchise history, and it may only get worse.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Chargers host the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 8 NFL schedule. The Chargers have gone from looking like arguably the best team in football after the first three weeks to now a team that may fight its way into the postseason. The Chargers (4-3) have lost three of their last four games and are coming off a 38-24 loss to the Colts in a game they trailed 23-3 at halftime. The Vikings (3-3) are coming off a 28-22 loss to the Eagles. Kickoff from SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Calif., is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Chargers are 3.5-point favorites, according to the latest Chargers vs. Vikings odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Vikings vs. Chargers. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Chargers vs. Vikings on Thursday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Vikings vs. Chargers on Thursday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

Users receive the $200 bonus whether the bet wins or loses.At DraftKings and FanDuel, you need to win your first bet to receive the bonus, but the reward is even greater. FanDuel offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins. DraftKings also offers $300 in bonus bets with a winning wager of at least $5, but with the latest DraftKings promo code with the 2025-26 NBA season beginning, new users also receive three months of NBA League Pass free, on top of the $300 in bonus bets.The latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code provides new users who place a cash wager of at least $1 on any market with odds of -500 or longer up to $200 in FanCash per day every day for ten (10) consecutive days, if the initial wager settles as a loss.

BetMGM users in New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania or Michigan can get a different promotion and receive $150 in bonus bets if you win your first bet of $10 or more.  The Caesars Sportsbook promo code is different than the aforementioned offers, providing profit boosts instead of bonus bets. At Caesars, new users can get 20 100% sportsbook profit boosts with a $1 bet. Bettors can use any of these promotions for Chargers vs. Vikings for Thursday Night Football on Thursday, October 23.Vikings vs. Chargers betting preview, picksChargers (-3.5) vs. VikingsThe Chargers have lost three of their last four games, but three weeks ago, if you asked many football fans to name their top five teams, the Chargers would have been in many people's lists. That just shows the ups and downs of an NFL season, and with Los Angeles at home against a Carson Wentz quarterbacked Vikings team, the model projects the Chargers to return to their winning ways. Justin Herbert threw for 420 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions last week against the Colts, and he leads the NFL with 1,913 passing yards this season. The Vikings are 2-2 in Wentz's four starts, with wins over a Bengals team quarterbacked by Jake Browning and the Browns with loss to the Eagles and Steelers. Beating the Chargers would be Wentz's most impressive win this season by far, and the model doesn't expect that to occur on Thursday. Los Angeles covers the spread in 50% of simulations.Over 44.5 pointsThe Over has hit in back-to-back Chargers games, and it's also cashed in all four of Wentz's starts for the Vikings. Wentz doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in fans to produce offensively, but he doesn't for sportsbooks either, which has actually made him an asset for Over betting due to how the books have lowered the numbers in his starts. He still has one of the best offensive minds in Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell orchestrating the offense, which has led to the Vikings averaging 28 points in Wentz's four starts with at least 21 points in all four contests. This matchup is filled with big-play receivers on both sides, such as Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen. The Chargers are averaging 26.5 ppg over their last two contests.  Once again, the Vikings' game has one of the lower over/under totals on the weekly NFL schedule, and the model likes the Over trend to continue, projecting the Over to hit in 52% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        If there is one major lesson that Umar Nurmagomedov learned from his January title loss to Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 311, it's that not everything goes in life as planned, even when the proper preparations were executed to perfection. Nurmagomedov (18-1) entered as the betting favorite to become the new UFC bantamweight champion and looked strong in the early going until a broken left hand compromised both his effectiveness and his gas tank. Still, the native of Dagestan, Russia, remained competitive in a close loss via unanimous decision. \"Not always everything is going to be how you want but you can't give up,\" Nurmagomedov told CBS Sports last week. \"Sometimes, you are going to have a broken arm and are going to get injured in the middle of a fight. You have to come back stronger.\"Nurmagomedov, the 29-year-old cousin of former lightweight champion Khabib (and older brother of PFL champion Usman), returns to the Octagon on Saturday for the first time since suffering his lone pro defeat when he faces Mario Bautista (16-2) at UFC 321 in Abu Dhabi. \n\n        \n            \n                UFC 321 fight card: Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Mario Bautista among can't miss fights\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGiven the fact that Dvalishvili, who returns in December in a rematch against Petr Yan, has just about completely cleaned out the division as he looks to become the first UFC champion to defend the title four times in one calendar year, there's plenty of reason to believe that Nurmagomedov, should he snap Bautista's eight-fight win streak, gets an immediate second shot at the title. \"There is nobody else,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"There is just Petr and he will fight for the title. Who else? I don't see nobody. If Mario Bautista wins, he will be 9-0 [in his last nine fights] and all the other guys have just one or two-fight win streak in the top 10. I think for fans and everybody, [Bautista] is a very interesting fight.\"\nDespite Bautista's win streak, Nurmagomedov enters as more than a 6-to-1 betting favorite. Now fully healthy, the feeling remains that if there's anyone capable of ending the increasingly historic title reign of Dvalishvili, it's Nurmagomedov. \nThe biggest flaw exposed in Nurmagomedov's loss was the fact that he couldn't visibly keep up with Dvalishvili's legendary gas tank after finding success early on. According to Nurmagomedov, that was more of a medical byproduct of the injury he sustained. \"To be honest, I don't think I got tired too much more than him,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"But when you break something in your body, your body begins to give to you some adrenaline to close this injury and take this pain. [Dvalishvili] is good and we can't tell that he's not good. A lot of things happened and we will see next time. I think I will close a lot of questions in next fight. We will see.\"Nurmagomedov said he respects the skills of Bautista and credits him as \"good striker\" who \"moves a lot.\" He also believes Bautista has proven he's an elite fighter on the level of those -- like Dvalishvili and Nurmagomedov -- in the title picture. \n\"I think I need to show a very good performance but I will not risk too much,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"I will try to take this victory but I think I will try to do submission to take him down, take back and choke him. I want to show better skills in the striking.\"From my side, I have to work very hard. I have to be focused and do everything to [eventually] take [Dvalishvili's] belt. It's part of my doing, I have to do this.\"\n            ",

Voting by the Modern-Era Players Screening Committee reduced the pool for next year's class from September's 128-player list to the current 52.Brees, Rivers, Fitzgerald and Witten are among eight players in their first year of eligibility who are still in the running for inclusion in the 2026 class. Also in that group are running backs Frank Gore and LeSean McCoy, tight end Greg Olsen and center Maurkice Pouncey.Five players eligible for the first time -- quarterback Alex Smith, offensive lineman David DeCastro, defensive linemen Geno Atkins and Jurrell Casey and linebacker Thomas Davis -- did not make the cut from 128 to 52.The 2010 Super Bowl MVP when he led the Saints over the Colts, Brees ranks second all-time in career passing yards and career passing touchdowns. Rivers presents an interesting case. He ranks seventh in career passing yards and sixth in career passing touchdowns. However, he never reached a Super Bowl, and he compiled just a 5-7 record in the playoffs. He is also a contemporary of two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, who did not get in last year in his first year of eligibility and is once again eligible this year.\nFitzgerald and Witten rank second and fourth, respectively, in career receptions. Fitzgerald is also second in career receiving yards and sixth in career receiving touchdowns.The following 52 players will now receive consideration from the full Selection Committee.

With all of his height, Wemby doesn't make the Spurs a good rebounding team (-4 per game on the road last season).  In home games Davis was especially big on the boards with a 12 rebound average (16-9, 64% over). In three games vs. the Spurs he averaged 13 and went over all three times.

Anfernee Simons clearly isn't as good a player as Tatum but he's a 20+ point per game scorer, if the Celtics want him to be, and he'll provide plenty of assists for Brown. Embiid may be playing but he's not a great rebounder for a star center and the Celtics are projected to outrebound Philly despite Brown leading the team with just 7.3. Without Tatum, Al Horford and Krystaps Porzingis, they'll need Jaylen Brown to have a career year on the boards.

Mitchell Robinson is out, newly acquired Yabusele is too small and Karl-Anthony Towns is too vulnerable a 1:1 defensive player to keep Allen from scoring in the paint, especially off of dunks and offensive rebound putbacks.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series matchup is set and, one way or the other, something that hasn't happened in a long time will happen. Either the Los Angeles Dodgers will become the first back-to-back champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees, or the Toronto Blue Jays will win their first World Series since their own back-to-back titles way back in 1992 and 1993.   \"Pretty cool.  Pretty humble to be part of it,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said following his club's ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. \"I've said it before, besides my wife and kids, this is what I pour my life into, so to be  leading the team that's going back to the World Series for the first  time in 32 years, kind of hits me a little bit.  I couldn't be happier  for every single guy on the team and in the clubhouse. Not just the  players, but the staff too.\"   Other than regular-season interleague series, the Blue Jays and Dodgers have no on-field ties or rivalry, but there are plenty of off the field connections. The two teams hotly pursued several of the same free agents in recent offseasons, most notably current Dodgers Shohei Ohtani and Roki Sasaki. I'm sure both pitchers will receive a warm reception Friday at Rogers Centre.   With the Fall Classic set to begin Friday, let's compare these  two teams position-by-position. The World Series rosters  won't be announced until midday Friday, so we have to make some  educated guesses with regards to some injury cases. We'll do the best  we can. Come with me, won't you?   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Catcher: Alejandro Kirk, Blue Jays   So many of these positions are toss ups. Will Smith is excellent and the superior hitter, at least when his hand is healthy, which it seems to be now. Kirk is a better defender though, especially the better pitcher-framer. We saw him steal more than a few strikes in the ALCS. Strikes that swung innings and helped snuff out rallies. Plus it's not like Kirk is a slouch at the plate. Smith's hand not being 100% -- he hasn't driven the ball with much authority this postseason -- makes me lean Kirk behind the plate. Perhaps the fact there has been a Will Smith (either the catcher or the lefty reliever) on each of the last four World Series means I should pick Smith? Much to ponder.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       First base: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays   Vlad Jr. is the only first baseman in baseball I would take over Freddie Freeman. Freeman's had a sluggish postseason by his standards. Not bad, just good rather than great, whereas Guerrero has been the best hitter in the world this month: .442/.510/.930 with twice as many home runs (six) as strikeouts (three) in 11 postseason games. He's also played some nifty defense too. Very rarely can you go wrong with Freeman. This is one of those times. Guerrero's the pick at first base.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Second base: Tommy Edman, Dodgers   Bo Bichette's status for the World Series is up in the air. He hasn't played since early September because of a knee injury, and he said he'll be ready to go earlier this week, though he admitted he didn't know in what capacity. Can he start at short? Will he be limited to pinch-hitting duty? If he starts at short, that will push Andrés Giménez back to second base. If he can't, it'll be Isiah Kiner-Falefa at the keystone. For now, I'm going to assume Giménez has to play short and it'll be Kiner-Falefa at second, making Edman the easy pick. He's nursing an ankle injury and isn't overly mobile right now, but he's having a strong postseason offensively, with a knock for key hits. Edman vs. Giménez would be more of a toss up.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Shortstop: Mookie Betts   It really is remarkable not only that Betts is playing shortstop, but playing it as well as he is. He's a Gold Glove finalist and he deserves it! Even if Bichette is able to start at short in the World Series, Betts is the pick here. He shook off that early season slump and has looked like prime Mookie Betts the last few weeks. There would also be valid questions about Bichette's effectiveness after the knee injury and the long layoff. Mookie's the pick. Can't imagine anyone outside Canada would disagree.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Third base: Ernie Clement, Blue Jays   I am a Max Muncy fan and he has a history of excellent postseasons, but Clement has been out this world good this October: .429/.444/.619 with more than twice as many extra-base hits (five) as strikeouts (two). Clement's excellence stretches back to the final few weeks of the postseason too, plus he's a very good defender and baserunner. Normally I would bet on the track record over small sample size postseason performance (Muncy's having a good postseason himself), but Clement's been such a tough out and do-it-all guy for Toronto that I'll take him over the next 4-7 games.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Left field: Enrique Hernández, Dodgers   Hernández and Nathan Lukes have almost indistinguishable batting lines this postseason: .306/.375/.417 for Hernández and .333/.381/.410 for Lukes. Lukes is the superior and more natural outfield defender. I just have a hard time betting against October Kiké. He has, once again, raised his game in the postseason after a downright bad regular season. The rational part of my brain says Lukes because it's been similar offense this October with better secondary skills. The rest of my brain doesn't want to bet against Hernández this time of year. Clement is my vibes pick for the Blue Jays. Hernández is my vibes pick for the Dodgers.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Center field: Daulton Varsho, Blue Jays   Andy Pages had a terrific regular season, one in which he broke out as a long-term keeper for the Dodgers, but he's been just dreadful during the playoffs. I'm talking a .086/.135/.114 batting line dreadful. Varsho has performed well (.273/.304/.500) and he is one of the best defensive outfielders in the game. That plus Pages falling off a cliff this postseason makes Varsho an easy call in center field. Also, I feel like he hasn't gotten enough love for hitting 20 home runs in only 271 plate appearances around injuries during the regular season. That's basically a 40-homer pace with elite center field defense.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Right field: Teoscar Hernández, Dodgers   Another toss up. Addison Barger has quietly had an excellent postseason, hitting .286/.375/.514 with a ton of hard contact. He's also cut his strikeout rate from 24.1% during the regular season to 17.5% in the postseason while raising his walk rate from 7.2% to 12.5%. Barger's put together a lot of tough at-bats for Toronto. He started the postseason at third base and moved to right field when Anthony Santander went down with a back injury. He's not a natural there, though he is almost certainly a better defender than Hernández. In the end, Teoscar has shown a knack for big hits (big home runs, specifically) the last two postseasons, and I'm going to lean on that. With the game on the line, I'd rather have Hernández at the plate than Barger.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Designated hitter: Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers   I think Ohtani's performance in Game 4 of the NLCS -- three home runs as a hitter and 10 strikeouts in six scoreless innings as a pitcher -- was the best single-game performance ever. At minimum, it was the coolest single-game performance ever. Ohtani's competition at DH is George Springer, who hit the ALCS game-winning home run in Game 7. One guy is hitting .239/.321/.609 this postseason. The other is hitting .220/.333/.634. I'm not even going to bother to tell you which is which because they're so similar. These are the only two DHs in baseball that make for a toss up. If it was any else on the other side, Ohtani or Springer would be the pick easily. I just can't not pick Ohtani. That guy seems superhuman. I was leaning Ohtani anyway, and Springer playing through a knee injury is enough to push me over the line.   \nWith our nine position players picked, let's build an All-World Series starting lineup, shall we? This is how I'd line up the starting nine:   DH Shohei Ohtani, LHBSS Mookie Betts, RHB1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr., RHBRF Teoscar Hernández, RHBCF Daulton Varsho, LHBC Alejandro Kirk, RHBLF Enrique Hernández, RHB  3B Ernie Clement, RHB2B Tommy Edman, SHBThe Betts/Vlad/Teoscar pocket in the 2-3-4 spots would invite the opposite manager to use his best righty reliever, but who cares? I'll take my chances with those three guys against any righty reliever. Four Blue Jays and five Dodgers, though some of these positions are so close (catcher, third base, left field, right field, DH) that you could argue the All-World Series team should have as many as seven Dodgers or six Blue Jays. Betts at short, Edman at second, Guerrero at first, and Varsho in center are the only obvious positional advantages for either team, I think.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Rotation: Dodgers   You know you're in good shape when Tyler Glasnow is the worst of your four postseason starters. Toronto's rotation is not getting enough love, I don't think. Kevin Gausman and Trey Yesavage are a strong 1-2 punch and Shane Bieber and Max Scherzer have both come up with strong starts this postseason. That said, those guys aren't Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Ohtani, and Glasnow. In fact, if you build out an All-World Series rotation, do any Blue Jays' starters make the top four? I'd rank the eight World Series starters like this:   \nLHP Blake SnellRHP Shohei OhtaniRHP Yoshinobu YamamotoRHP Tyler GlasnowRHP Kevin GausmanRHP Trey YesavageRHP Shane BieberRHP Max ScherzerYou could argue for Gausman (or even Yesavage) over Glasnow, but I don't think I could go higher than that. Ultimately, these are all excellent pitchers. Both teams have strong rotations. On paper, L.A.'s is superior. It has certainly played out that way on the field to date this October.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       Bullpen: Blue Jays   The weakest part of the two World Series teams is their bullpens, so we could be in for some late-inning fireworks on both sides. That's fun. Not so much for fans of the two teams, but for everyone else. Sasaki and Jeff Hoffman have both looked excellent at times and combustible at others this postseason. Louie Varland is the best setup man between the two teams and boy, it sure feels like Dodgers manager Dave Roberts' continued reliance on Blake Treinen will bite him at some point, no?   Build an all-World Series seven-man bullpen and it probably looks like this: Closer: RHP Roki Sasaki (Dodgers)Setup: RHP Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and RHP Louie Varland (Blue Jays)Middle: RHP Seranthony Domínguez (Blue Jays) and RHP Braydon Fisher (Blue Jays)Lefties: LHP Anthony Banda (Dodgers) and LHP Alex Vesia (Dodgers)Both managers have done very good work navigating their shaky relief crews. In L.A.'s case, the starters have made life easy on Roberts by pitching so deep into games. Schneider has had to get a bit more creative throughout October. I'll take Hoffman and Varland over Sasaki and Vesia. Go any deeper than that into either bullpen and you're crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. The Dodgers have the better rotation, the Blue Jays the better bullpen, and both lineups are very great. If the World Series isn't evenly matched, it's darn close to it.\n            ",

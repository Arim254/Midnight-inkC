It enters the 2025 World Series a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. Anybody following its MLB betting or NBA betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Wednesday's best bets at BetMGMOver 8 runs in Dodgers vs. Blue Jays (-110) Pistons +1.5 vs. Magic (-110)Trail Blazers -3.5 vs. Jazz (-105)Combining these three picks into a Wedneday MLB and NBA parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +611 (risk $100 to win $611). Bet it at BetMGM here:\nOver 8 runs in Dodgers vs. Blue Jays (-110)\"The Blue Jays are not blinking in this World Series as the normal Dodger intimidation games don't seem to be working. Toronto could easily have won these last two games at Chavez Ravine as the Jays have blocked out he Dodger Stadium factor, and LA can't be quite as comfy with Blake Snell on the mound after he was roughed up in Game One,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, John Schneider is confident he can get five or so innings from Trey Yesevage, though the Blue Jays bullpen is again going to be asked to do some heavy lifting. Three of the four games already in this series have reached at least eight runs.\" Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Pistons +1.5 vs. Magic (-110)After a 30-win improvement last season, the Pistons have their sights set on contending in the East. Meanwhile, the Magic had a similarly transcendent 47-win season two years ago, but followed it up with a disappointing 41-win campaign last year. Both teams have underwhelmed a little bit early, with Detroit off to a 2-2 start and Orlando sitting at 1-3. However, the Pistons did win and cover as 2-point favorites at home in January and the model predicts that they cover in 59% of simulations on Wednesday. Back the Pistons at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Trail Blazers -3.5 vs. Jazz (-105)\"We're still figuring out how Phoenix was able to force OT at Utah on Monday. In the end all was well as the Jazz recovered for a 138-134 win helped greatly by 51 points from F Lauri Markkanen, who's had a blazing start to the season as Utah tries to build a fortress out of the Delta Center. Yet we've also been impressed by the Blazers, who don't look like they're missing suspended HC Chauncey Billups one bit,\" Marshall said. \"Portland getting All-Star like production from F Deni Avdija (23.5 ppg), while Jerami Grant (22.5 ppg) looks like Sixth Man of the Year candidate, and vet G Jrue Holiday (17.8 ppg) proving he's still got some petrol in his tank.\" Back the Trail Blazers at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks for this week?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        The college football coaching carousel creates chaos on an annual basis. With 10 jobs open already before the end of October (not including two gigs filled over the offseason on what may be a temporary basis), insiders are forecasting one of busiest seasons of coaching changes we've seen in recent years. It's not just about the coaches who are fired and filling those jobs. It's then about filling whatever vacancies are left behind, creating domino effect of coaching changes. This week on CBS Sports HQ, we sought out to create the most chaotic series of coaching dominos while still maintaining some tie to reality. It is very important that you, the reader and the viewer, to understand that this is a work of fan fiction and not to be mistaken for reporting. Some of these moves very well could end up happening, but ultimately the goal was to connect as many dots as possible while also creating as much upheaval as possible across the coaching landscape. \nSo let's have some fun and set off a couple of dominos to see how far down the coaching carousel rabbit hole we can go. Domino 1: The B1G One UCLA hires James Franklin Penn State hires Mike Elko Texas A&M hires Lincoln Riley USC hires Jedd Fisch Washington hires Ryan Grubb Penn State is already open, and while candidates like Matt Rhule and Curt Cignetti were the first names mentioned after James Franklin was fired it's possible that both coaches are going to stay with their current employer through at least the 2026 season. \nThat would have the Nittany Lions looking for some of the other top names in the industry, which would include seeing if a former Penn player and New Jersey native Mike Elko would be interested in getting the keys to one of the most storied programs in the country. Texas A&M opening would be an intriguing opportunity for anyone, but here we're using it as a chance for Lincoln Riley to return to Texas to restart the clock. And while Jedd Fisch has been doing great work at Washington, USC would be smart to check his availability given his success with the Huskies and at Arizona. UCLA gets the program-builder it needs with Franklin (sorry, Virginia Tech), and finally Washington could fill its open spot with former Huskies offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, who is currently doing great work with Ty Simpson at Alabama.  Domino 2: The Lane Train fallout Florida hires Lane Kiffin Ole Miss hires Jon Sumrall Tulane hires Hugh Freeze Auburn hires Rhett Lashlee SMU hires Eric Morris While Ole Miss fans are feeling increasingly confident that Lane Kiffin will remain in Oxford, we all realize that any chaos scenario probably requires the Lane Train to be on the move and get the dominos falling in the SEC. \nTulane head coach Jon Sumrall is widely viewed as one of the top candidates for any SEC job, and in this run we've got Ole Miss securing his commitment to take over an operation that now has the blueprint for success in the modern era. That's where things get a little tricky, because Tulane will need a coach and it's possible that Hugh Freeze will need an off ramp after some tough years at Auburn. In a very Dana Holgorsen-to-Houston type move, our fan fiction has Freeze out at Auburn and landing on his feet with the Green Wave, which then opens up another opportunity in the SEC. \n        \n            \n                As coaching carousel floods, will other big schools -- like Auburn and Florida State -- pause on changes?\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile SMU is well-funded and certainly prepared for a bidding war, we've got Rhett Lashlee leaving to return to Auburn where he was previously an offensive coordinator and then the Mustangs tap one of the top Lone Star State coaches to replace him by hiring North Texas' Eric Morris. Domino 3: LSU, Beamer Ball and Brian Kelly Virginia Tech hires Shane Beamer South Carolina hires Brent Key Georgia Tech hires Brian Kelly LSU hires Eli Drinkwitz Missouri hires Scott Satterfield Cincinnati hires Mike Denbrock Shane Beamer was very careful about his coaching moves while Frank Beamer was still at Virginia Tech, choosing to link up up with his father only near the end of his program-changing run in Blacksburg. But enough time has passed now and things have been rocky enough in Columbia to guess (again, in fan fiction) that returning to Virginia Tech looks more enticing now than it may have in September. Beamer leaving South Carolina could have the Gamecocks looking to Brent Key given the previous SEC assistant experience and success he's had with Georgia Tech. \nAs for replacing Key we're using Atlanta as a soft landing spot for Brian Kelly, who might not command the same salary in the wake of the LSU buyout.Speaking of LSU, Eli Drinkwitz remains one of the top coaches on the hot board for any power conference job that thinks they can lure him away. The Tigers have arguably one of the best jobs in America, with three national championships under three different coaches in the 21st Century (only Ohio State can also claim such an honor). So Drinkwitz lands in Baton Rouge, which then has Missouri looking to another former App State coach in Scott Satterfield, who has flipped Cincinnati into a Big 12 title contender in just a few years. Then when it's time for the Bearcats to make a hire it's not going to be running it back with Brian Kelly, but instead with a former offensive coordinator in Mike Denbrock, who is currently doing great work with Marcus Freeman at Notre Dame. \nPhew. How's all that sound? \n            ",

Lamar Jackson, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury that caused him to miss three games, was listed as a full participant in Wednesday's walkthrough practice. This marks the third straight practice he was listed as a full participant.Earlier in the week, coach John Harbaugh expressed confidence that the two-time MVP would be back for their Week 9 game.\"I feel very confident about it. We'll expect him to be out there Thursday night,\" Harbaugh said on Tuesday.\nJackson initially suffered the hamstring injury suffered against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sept. 28 and has not played since. \n\n        \n            \n                Season-changing win?

One day before the game, the Ravens made a correction, saying Jackson was actually a limited participant and was \"out\" for the game. Harbaugh called the situation an honest mistake.Without Jackson last week, the Ravens started Tyler Huntley over Cooper Rush, who started two games in No. 8's absence, and Baltimore went on to win 30-16 at home.In his first four starts this year, Jackson had a career-high 71.6% completion percentage for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception. He also had 166 yards and a touchdown on the ground.\nOverall, the Ravens have struggled without Jackson at the helm. They sit at 2-5, third place in the AFC North.\n            \n    ",

Quarterback Jayden Daniels is expected to be a full participant in practice all week, which means if all goes according to plan, he will return for this Sunday's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. However, star wide receiver Terry McLaurin re-injured his quad, and has already been ruled out for Week 9. Daniels missed Monday night's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs after injuring his hamstring in the Week 7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He did not practice all week, and Marcus Mariota started in his place. Daniels has already missed three games this season, leading his mother to ask fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son. In five starts this season, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year has completed 61% of his passes for 1,031 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 9 NFL picks: Bills cool off red-hot Chiefs in classic shootout, Texans upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for McLaurin, he tweaked his already-injured quad in the second half of Monday night's loss to Kansas City. Sunday will mark the fifth game he's missed this season. The 30-year-old held out of training camp while he fought for a contract extension, and was victorious in doing so. In late August, McLaurin signed what was reported to be a three-year, $96 million deal. However, he's on track to have his worst NFL season since being selected in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, as McLaurin has caught just 13 passes for 203 yards and one touchdown in four games.\nTight end Zach Ertz said following the loss to the Chiefs that the \"clock is ticking\" for the 3-5 Commanders, and things don't get much easier with Washington's next two games coming against NFC contenders in the Seahawks and Detroit Lions. FanDuel Sportsbook currently considers the Commanders a long shot to make the playoffs at +430 -- the same odds as the rival Cowboys. \n            \n    ",

Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 50.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Unfortunately, we don't live in such a world, and injuries continue to play a central storyline every week, and Week 9 is no exception. While we do focus more on who will be sidelined in a given week, this upcoming slate does feature some positive injury updates. The Ravens will see the return of MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson after a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray (foot) is in play to return this week for the Cardinals, along with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) of the Vikings. Of course, that other side of the coin is prevalent as well, with stars a bit dinged up as we begin the week, which we'll track below. There, you can find the initial injury reports from most teams as they hit the practice field for the first time on Wednesday, as well as the final reports and game designations for Baltimore and Miami. NFL odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

Less than 24 hours after the Pittsburgh Steelers made a trade to help their secondary, their Pennsylvania neighbor did the same. The Philadelphia Eagles acquired cornerback Michael Carter II from the New York Jets in a deal that also saw wideout John Metchie III head to the Big Apple. At 1-7 on the season, the Jets are pegged as a seller at the deadline, but it is interesting to see them move off a player like Carter. His departure comes just over a year after the franchise signed him to a three-year, $30.75 million contract extension that made the 2021 first-rounder out of Duke the NFL's highest-paid slot corner at the time of signing. So, why did New York make this trade? What kind of player are the Eagles getting, and what will this mean for their secondary? We answer those questions and hand out our grades for the trade below. The tradeEagles get: CB Michael Carter II, 2027 seventh-round pickJets get: WR John Metchie III, 2027 sixth-round pickPhiladelphia Eagles: AThe Eagles needed to improve the secondary, and this trade will trigger a chain reaction in hopes of doing just that. Specifically, Philadelphia struggled at the outside corner position opposite Quinyon Mitchell, with the likes of Adoree' Jackson and Kelee Ringo not suitably filling the role. Carter himself doesn't help on the outside as he's made his bones in the slot. What his arrival does, however, is free up Cooper DeJean to kick outside from the slot. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said this week that moving DeJean to a full-time role on the outside was under consideration, and now that possibility has been made easier with Carter coming in to fill his shoes in the slot. And it only cost them moving down a round on Day 3 of the 2027 NFL Draft and Metchie (played 7% of the offensive snaps so far this season) to do so. \nNew York Jets: CIt does feel like a lukewarm return for someone the organization once made the highest-paid player at his position, even if it was under a previous regime. Carter was under team control through the 2027 season, but New York may have wanted to move off of him to avoid a possible contract scuffle this offseason. Carter has just $1.3 million left in guaranteed salary for the 2026 season, and none in 2027. On top of avoiding that, the Jets did acquire defensive back Jarvis Brownlee Jr. from the Titans earlier this season, which made Carter expendable. That said, moving up from the seventh to the sixth round two years from now isn't exactly going to blow anyone's socks off. When it comes to Metchie, he should be looked at as simply a depth piece with the veteran slated to be an unrestricted free agent this offseason. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The former Alabama standout signed with the Ravens in 2024 and delivered a massive output in his first season in Baltimore, carrying the ball 325 times for 1,921 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. His physical style and durability remained elite even after turning 30, showcasing several long runs and a dominance after contact that reinforced his Hall of Fame trajectory. In 2025, Henry continues to be a major factor in Baltimore's offense, though his workload has slightly decreased. Through six games, he has totaled 88 carries for 439 yards (5.0 yards per carry) and four rushing touchdowns. While those numbers are below his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most respected and productive power backs in the league. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Dolphins running back De'Von Achane. The former third-round pick out of Texas A&M emerged as a dynamic dual-threat back for the Dolphins in 2024, rushing 203 times for 907 yards and six touchdowns while adding 78 receptions for 592 yards and six more scores. His average of 4.5 yards per carry showcased his balance of power and burst, while his impact as a receiver made him one of the NFL's most versatile backs. Through the early part of the 2025 season, Achane has maintained that explosiveness, totaling 107 carries for 539 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Although his touchdown pace has dipped slightly, his overall efficiency and big-play potential remain strong. Achane's combination of elite speed and pass-catching ability continues to make him a key weapon in Miami's high-octane offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Ravens vs. DolphinsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday that LeBron James (sciatica) has a timeline to return either the second or third week of November, while Luka Dončić (finger sprain/leg contusion) could return in the \"next couple of games.\"James, who is entering his 23rd season in the league, hasn't played this season. The Lakers originally announced on Oct. 9 that James would be out at least 3-4 weeks because of the nerve irritation in his glute that caused him to miss the entire NBA preseason. However, his timeline to return to the lineup appears to be longer than that.\n        \n            \n                How scorching starts from Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić could redefine LeBron James' role on new-look Lakers\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf James is out until the second or third week of November, it means James would miss at least the first 10 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz. That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season.As for Dončić, the Lakers star got off to an incredible start to the 2025-26 season before being sidelined. Dončić finished with 43 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in the Lakers' first game of the season against the Golden State Warriors and followed it up with another near-triple double (49 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists).\nDespite James not playing at all to start the season and Dončić missing the last two games, the Lakers are off to a 2-2 start. Lakers star Austin Reaves has scored at least 25 points in each of his team's first four games -- which includes a 51-point outburst against the Sacramento Kings last weekend. Reaves also finished with 41 points in the Lakers' loss to the Portland Trail Blazers earlier this week.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks' majority owners filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Dallas Stars, accusing the NHL team of blocking long-planned upgrades to the American Airlines Center and breaching their lease agreements. The legal action signals a deepening rift between the two franchises that share the downtown arena.Dallas Sports Group (DSG), which owns the Mavericks and is led by billionaire Miriam Adelson and her son-in-law Patrick Dumont, said in the lawsuit that \"the Stars are holding the American Airlines Center hostage.\" The ownership group claims the NHL team has blocked efforts to improve the 24-year-old arena and is seeking court confirmation of its lease rights, along with injunctive relief to move forward with planned renovations. DSG acquired a 69% majority stake in the Mavericks in December 2023 for roughly $3.5 billion.The Stars, led by owner Tom Gaglardi, quickly responded with a countersuit seeking to restore normal operations at the arena. Team officials called the Mavericks' lawsuit \"nothing short of an attempted hostile takeover of the management of the AAC,\" saying it attempts to reduce the Stars to \"a mere tenant\" and could ultimately push the franchise out of Dallas. The NHL team also highlighted recent investments, including $30 million in renovations, aimed at enhancing the fan experience.Could Mavericks or Stars leave Dallas?Both teams share a joint operating company that manages the American Airlines Center, which is owned by the city of Dallas. DSG alleges that the Stars have resisted improvements and violated a long-standing agreement to maintain their corporate headquarters in Dallas through 2031 by moving offices to Frisco. The Stars counter that the Frisco facility is used in conjunction with their principal downtown office.\nDallas City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert weighed in on the dispute, urging both franchises to maintain their commitment to the city. \"That would be the best outcome for the two teams and their fans,\" she said, via CBS News Texas.The legal battle comes amid separate plans by both teams to explore new venues. Front Office Sports reported earlier in October that relocating the Stars to suburban Plano by 2031 is a leading option, potentially allowing for a mixed-use development around a new arena. Meanwhile, the Mavericks have begun planning a new arena independent of the hockey team, a project led by CEO and Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Welts, per the report.\nThe dispute echoes past co-tenant conflicts in other cities, such as Philadelphia, where NBA and NHL team owners debated arena development. Unlike that situation, however, the Dallas case has already moved into Texas Business Court.\n            ",

With the Pirates, Shelton went 306-440 (.410) with two last-place finishes and two fourth-place finishes in his four full seasons on the job. He previously served as the bench coach for the Twins under Paul Molitor in 2018 and Rocco Baldelli in 2019.Shelton took over a team deep in a rebuilding phase -- a phase that still hasn't yielded much in the way of wins at the big-league level -- and the team showed incremental improvement on his watch until they stalled out in 2024 and for the early weeks of this season. As a player, Shelton spent two minor league seasons as a catcher and first baseman in the New York Yankees system but never rose above Single-A. \nAs for the Twins, they're coming off a 2025 season in which they went 70-92 and placed fourth in the American League Central. That plus an 82-80 record and another fourth-place finish in 2024 cost Badelli his job in late September of this year. In all, Baldelli guided the Twins to three playoff berths in his seven seasons on the job. While there is some talent in place in Minnesota, Shelton walks into an uncertain ownership situation, especially when it comes to a top-down willingness to invest in payroll.\nWith Shelton's hiring in Minnesota, four MLB teams remain in need of a manager for the 2026 season: the Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, and Atlanta Braves. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025-26 NBA season is just over a week away as the action tips on Tuesday, Oct. 21 with a two-game slate of Rockets vs. Thunder and Warriors vs. Lakers. That means the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings are beginning to solidify, with the latest Fantasy basketball ADP listing Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama as the top consensus picks.Can you trust those Fantasy basketball picks at the top of drafts, and which Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts do you need to be aware of? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. After spending the 2023-24 season out of the league, Porter joined the Clippers last season before being acquired by Milwaukee at the trade deadline. He proceeded to become one of the Bucks most consistent players, averaging 11.7 points and 3.7 assists in just 19.9 minutes, and over his last five games of the season, Porter put up 20.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.8 steals. Porter should see a huge jump in playing time this year with the injury and subsequent trade of Damian Lillard.Porter is penciled in to be Milwaukee's starting point guard, and outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo, no other player on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster averaged more than 2.9 assists last year. Thus, the team will need both his ball-handling and playmaking skills, and Porter has already shown he can produce when given ample minutes. In the 2022-23 season with Houston, he was one of just five NBA players to average at least 19 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.4 steals per game. He is someone whose production should far exceed his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 72. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was one of the major pieces in a trade between the Wizards and Pelicans in the offseason. The 26-year-old now goes to New Orleans, where he'll have to be a bit more of a complimentary player to Zion Williamson. New Orleans also brings in two lottery picks -- Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears -- so Poole could lose some of his scoring opportunities as the season progresses. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are being picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks, and find out.\n            ",

Alomar Sr. was to turn 82 years of age on Oct. 19. Alomar, a native of Puerto Rico, first signed with the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur free agent in 1960 and went on to spend parts of 15 seasons in MLB, six of which came with the California Angels. Over that span, he batted .245/.290/.288 with 1,168 hits and 227 stolen bases. With the Angels in 1970, he earned his only All-Star selection. Alomar Sr. also played in the World Series as a member of the 1976 New York Yankees, and spent playing time with the Chicago White Sox, New York Mets and Texas Rangers. Sons Sandy and Roberto combined for 18 All-Star appearances during their career, and Roberto was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011.\"The Yankees mourn the passing of Sandy Alomar Sr. and extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones,\" the team said in a statement Monday.Tony Clark, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, also released a statement through the union: \"The baseball world suffered a great loss today with the passing of Sandy Alomar Sr., whose impact spanned more than five decades as a player, manager, coach, and beloved ambassador for the game in his native Puerto Rico. We remember Sandy for his achievements on the field, his lifelong commitment to the game, and a proud family legacy that was represented with distinction by his sons Sandy Jr. and Roberto.\"The MLBPA and the community of players extend our sympathies to the Alomar family, Sandy's legion of friends throughout baseball, and to all his fans and admirers in Puerto Rico who are grieving his loss.\"Alomar Sr. retired as a player following the 1978 season with a career WAR of 10.5. After his playing career, Alomar Sr. managed the Puerto Rican national team and in the Puerto Rican winter leagues before returning to MLB as a coach and then minor-league manager within the Chicago Cubs organization. Major-league coaching stints then followed, first with the San Diego Padres and then with the Cubs, Colorado Rockies and Mets. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Specifically, Tagovailoa pointed to player-led film sessions where players were late -- or not in attendance at all -- and called on the team's leadership and coaching staff to set the standard and expectations. Those comments didn't sit well with everyone, and on Monday, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel responded to those comments from his star quarterback, noting he felt it was not the place to air those grievances. McDaniel also called Tagovailoa's comments a \"misguided representation\" of the film sessions in question. \"I think regardless of intent and what was on Tua's mind, after a loss as the franchise quarterback that's not the forum to displace that,\" McDaniel said. \"I think he knows that now. I do honestly believe there was no ill intention, but you're talking about kind of a misguided representation of player-orchestrated film sessions ... So you're trying to look for reasons you can attribute to losses, and heavy is the crown of being a franchise quarterback. \n\"What I do know is he's directly communicated with a lot of guys starting with last night, and that's what teammates do and you live and you learn. Ultimately, I look at it like everything else. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it -- accountability and our team's performance lies squarely on my shoulders. So, we know that as well,\" McDaniel added. \"But the focus to beat the Cleveland Browns and fix what we need to get fixed in our game to go attack the next opponent ... and everything else is not leading us into the direction of [a] solution.\"When asked if was worried of a deeper problem within the organization, he replied \"Ultimately, no. And I think that is at the crux of the issue is it's inherently assumed that you're attaching reasons for failure to that. I've got a lot of things to worry about, and one of them is not those comments ... we just had meetings about the game itself — the factual successes and failures that led to the ultimate result — and that's where people's focus needs to be. I'm confident ... we are all very motivated to fix our problems and find a way to win.\" \nMcDaniel seems well aware of his position on the hot seat in Miami, and that situation isn't helped by the quarterback calling out the team's leadership for not making clear what is demanded of the roster. After the Titans fired Brian Callahan amid his abysmal start to 2025, McDaniel has to feel like his time is running short. A win against the similarly bad Cleveland Browns may buy him a bit more time, however. \n            \n    ",

Alston was named a team captain prior to the season, but he had missed to games with a shoulder injury. Asked about the status of Alston at his Monday press conference, Freeze said Alston was no longer with the team because he fell short of the \"expectations and standards\" set by the program.\"Damari failed to meet the expectations and standards of our program,\" Freeze said. \"We love him and wish him the best, but that's where it's at.\"\nA former three-star recruit out of Atlanta, Alston was in his fourth season with the Tigers. A shoulder injury forced Alston to miss games against Ball State and South Alabama, but even when he was healthy, he saw limited action. After getting 16 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown in Auburn's season-opening win over Baylor, Alston's opportunities have declined sharply of late.\nIn the Tigers' last three games, all losses, Alston hasn't seen more than seven carries of 25 yards. In Saturday's game against Georgia, Alston rushed for just nine yards on seven touches.In his Auburn career, Alston rushed for 809 yards and six touchdowns while adding 143 receiving yards.\nWith Alston gone, Jeremiah Cobb will shoulder and even bigger workload in the backfield. The Tigers' leading rusher this season, Cobb has 453 yards and four touchdowns on 70 attempts. Quarterback Jackson Arnold, who has 247 yards and six scores on the ground, will continue to be a big factor in that department.\n            \n    ",

Thomson in October of 2024 had agreed to a one-year extension that covers the 2026 season, so in that sense his return isn't surprising. Thomson and the Phillies are fresh off a 96-win season and a second-straight National League East title. However, they were bounced in the National League Division Series by the reigning-champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and from the Phillies' standpoint it happened in agonizing fashion. Across three full seasons and most of a fourth as Phillies manager, Thomson has guided them to a record of 346-251 (.580) with four postseason appearances and a 21-17 record in those playoff games. The Phillies are, however, 3-10 in their last 13 playoff games dating back to Game 3 of the 2023 NLCS. Rob Thomson's managerial recordYearReg. season recordPlayoff recordPlayoff finish202265-4611-6Lost World Series vs. Astros202390-728-5Lost NLCS vs. D-backs202495-671-3Lost NLDS vs. Mets202596-661-3Lost NLDS vs. DodgersTotal346-25121-17Thomson in 2022 guided the Phillies to the eighth pennant in franchise history before falling in six games to the Houston Astros in the World Series. The 62-year-old Thomson is 10th on the Phillies' all-time managerial wins list, and he's first in franchise history in managerial winning percentage among those to have skippered a meaningful number of games.\nUnder Thomson in 2026, the Phillies figure to contend once again, but they do face an important offseason, especially when it comes to the pending free agency of star slugger Kyle Schwarber.  \n            \n    ",

In Sunday's 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos, quarterback Justin Fields completed 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards, as the offense recorded just 82 yards of total offense.Following the game, a reporter asked Jets coach Aaron Glenn if Fields would be his starting quarterback next week. The first-year coach took offense to this inquiry, asking \"what kind of question is that?\" Glenn said multiple players had bad games, but that doesn't mean you bench them all. Glenn appeared to change his tune a bit on Monday morning, telling reporters that Fields did take a \"step back.\" \n\"I thought about this a lot last night. I thought about the question that was asked. When you look at what Justin did the games that he played,\" Glenn said. \"I didn't think he was bad at all. I actually thought he did some pretty good things in those four games, and this fifth game, he took a step back. And I'm with you guys 100%, and we can't have that. We have to get better than that. And he knows that. He knows that better than anyone. I don't think you just try to bench a player after having one true bad game, because I thought the other games he played fairly well.\"\nThe Jets are the lone remaining winless team in the NFL, and Fields averages just 159.8 passing yards per game with four passing touchdowns and zero interceptions. On Sunday, Glenn's offense recorded the fewest net passing yards (-10) in a game in franchise history. The Jets registered nine pass completions, eight first downs and seven punts. \nNew York's 144.2 passing yards per game rank dead last in the NFL, and Sunday sure felt like rock bottom. Up next for the 0-6 Jets is Bryce Young and the 3-3 Carolina Panthers at MetLife Stadium this weekend. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We have a precious few days left in 2025 with two baseball games. Monday, Oct. 13, is of one them. That makes it a great day. We'll get Game 2 of the ALCS between the Blue Jays and Mariners before Game 1 of the NLCS between the Brewers and Dodgers. Game 1 of the ALCS did not disappoint. George Springer hit a leadoff bomb for the Blue Jays and then they had two runners on base after that, but they were shut down the rest of the game as the Mariners won. Big props to Bryce Miller for the start of his life. It hurt us here in best bets, but we'll get back on track today. Lines courtesy of DraftKings. Trey Yesavage over 5.5 strikeouts (-133)Whoa, this one is popular. It was plus money last night and enough people have wagered on it that the odds have moved well into \"that's some juice\" territory. With good reason. The Mariners have a sneaky-good offense that is underrated, with their stats suppressed by their oppressive home ballpark, but they will strikeout. They do it plenty. They struck out 11 times in Game 1. They had the seventh-highest strikeout percentage in baseball this season. \nYesavage gets punchouts, too. He struck out a ridiculous 160 in 98 innings in the minors this season. He struck out 16 in 14 MLB innings after his promotion. He struck out 11 Yankees in Game 2 of the ALDS. If you're concerned about workload, he only needed 78 pitches to get to that 11. The Mariners have never seen him and his power splitter is going to be a problem. He might only go five innings, but getting to that sixth strikeout won't be an issue.Andrew Vaughn over 1.5 hits + runs + RBI (+108)The Brewers saved Vaughn's career. He was one of the worst major-league players with the White Sox this season, possibly even the single worst position player. After joining the Brewers, though, he hit .320 with a .583 slugging percentage in American Family Field. \nHe obliterated lefties, hitting .403 with a .569 slugging percentage. He hit a three-run homer off lefty Shota Imanaga in Game 2 of the NLDS. Dodgers lefty Blake Snell is a tougher assignment than Imanaga, but Vaughn's success at home against lefties in the middle of an underrated batting order cannot be ignored. \n\n        \n            \n                MLB playoff predictions: Expert picks for NLCS between Dodgers and Brewers\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBONUS: Brewers win NLCS +170So many people think the Dodgers are going to steamroll the Brewers. I don't. I think the Brewers are going to ride \"doing the little things\" in addition to doing the obvious good things in this series. They are a great team. I'm going with the plus money here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers used his Monday pregame press conference to express his frustrations with the mass arrests being conducted by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago. The Bucks were preparing to play the Bulls in Chicago Sunday night, and as a Chicago native, Rivers felt compelled to speak about the matter.\"It bothers me,\" Rivers said. \"I'm trying, I'm trying. I mean, it's just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that's not this country. That's not what we're about.\"ICE has been conducting mass arrests across Chicago since early September in a large-scale deportation effort at the direction of President Donald Trump, though a federal judge ruled recently to extend a consent decree that limits ICE's ability to arrest people without warrants or probable cause. Meanwhile, the Defense Department is attempting to send 200 National Guard soldiers from Texas, and another 300 from Illinois, into Chicago to aid ICE across the city. For the time being, the National Guard has been temporarily blocked from deploying in Chicago after the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from U.S. District Judge April Perry to deny the deployment of the troops, though they temporarily remain under federal control.\n\"I think [Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson] has done an amazing job with everything he says,\" River said. \"You know, I think this is starting to separate us all, which I hate. This is not, you can be pro-civil rights or what's right and not be, like, anti-white. And I think that's what it's starting to become in some ways. And it shouldn't be. It really shouldn't be. I would hope that if this was Ukrainian immigrants being detained that everyone on both races would fight for it. That's wrong. It's just wrong.\"Rivers continued, \"I think every American is good with if there's criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad [Grady] was a [Maywood] cop for Christ's sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem. I couldn't imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they're doing. I couldn't imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he'd call in sick. And it's just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.\"ICE has been conducting targeted arrests in many neighborhoods across Chicago, primarily in areas with higher numbers of people of color. Protestors have been active outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, where they've clashed with ICE agents, the National Guard and police officers. \n\"Riding down the elevator with a couple -- I wish I could remember where they're from -- their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, 'Man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I've never been to this city, wow,'\" Rivers said. \"And the dad says, 'But we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere.' And he was like, 'Where is it?' It's nowhere. It's just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I'm from Chicago. I'm very prideful about this place, so I hate it.\"\n            ",

Richardson injured his eye while doing band work, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.Following the game, Colts coach Shane Steichen told reporters that Richardson suffered an orbital fracture, forcing him to spend Sunday's game in a local hospital. The injury allegedly occurred as a result of a malfunction of the elastic band he had been using. Richardson attached the band to a pole in the locker room, and the pole snapped and made forceful contact with his face.Swelling around Richardson's eye is reportedly so severe that his vision is temporarily impaired. Richardson is not believed, however, to have sustained damage to his eyeball.Richardson's role as backup to Daniel Jones went to rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard, who will remain the Colts' QB2 while Richardson recovers unless the team acquires another backup option.\nLeonard -- who last year helped lead Notre Dame to an appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship -- played well during the preseason. He started and played the entirety of the Colts' preseason finale against the Bengals, going 15 of 20 for 189 yards that included a 59-yard touchdown pass to wideout Laquon Treadwell. \nA former first-round pick, Richardson lost his starting job to Jones prior to the start of the regular season. During his first two seasons with the Colts, Richardson went 8-7 as the team's starter but threw more interceptions (13) than touchdown passes (11) over that span; injuries and erratic play largely told the story of his first two NFL seasons. \nA fellow former first-round pick, Jones has enjoyed a career rebirth this season with the Colts, who continued their hot start by improving to 5-1 with a 31-27 win over Arizona.\n            \n    ",

Williams has a new partner in coach Ben Johnson, who's opened his first season atop Chicago's staff on a 2-2 stretch and is eyeing a third straight victory. Daniels, meanwhile, just returned from a knee sprain in Week 5 to lead Washington past the Los Angeles Chargers. When he's healthy, the Commanders are still viewed as one of the NFC's top contenders, even with fellow standouts like Terry McLaurin nursing their own injuries.Can Williams exact his revenge against the Commanders after getting a full week of rest on Chicago's bye? Or is Washington primed to inflict more pain upon the Bears with a home victory to close Week 6 in prime time?

Washington's top wideout, Terry McLaurin, will miss this matchup while recovering from a quad injury. So, too, will fellow receiver Noah Brown, the man who hauled in Daniels' improbable Hail Mary to beat the Bears last season. Even Deebo Samuel, the top remaining pass catcher, isn't fully healthy while battling a heel issue. That might leave aging tight end Zach Ertz as Daniels' most trusted outlet through the air.Will the Bears sell out to stop the run? If the Commanders are shorthanded at pass catcher, it's possible Chicago will go all in on trying to crowd the line and slow Washington's vaunted rushing attack. It's a risky proposition no matter how you slice it, because with Daniels at the helm, the Commanders are always liable to break one loose; they lead the NFL in rushing with 155 yards per game. Making matters worse: The Bears rank 31st against the run, giving up almost 165 yards per contest.Can Chicago get anything going on the ground? Not only are the Bears struggling to contain the run under the guidance of defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, but they're also failing to establish a reliable ground game of their own. D'Andre Swift is averaging just 3.3 yards per tote, and even with Caleb Williams' scrambling, the Bears are mustering 3.8 yards per carry as a team. We know from his days in Detroit that Ben Johnson likes to call a balanced attack. He's still searching for it in Chi-Town.You can bet Commanders vs. Bears at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nJayden Daniels may be the face of the Commanders' offense thanks to both his arm and legs, but Washington's rushing attack has remained fearsome in large part due to the emergence of \"Bill\" Croskey-Merritt, the undrafted rookie who parlayed preseason stardom into a lead role for Kliff Kingsbury. He still cedes some carries to Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez Jr. in Washington's backfield, but he's easily the most explosive of the bunch, averaging 6.6 yards per touch with four scores and a team-leading 17 first-down carries. After hitting 111 yards in Week 5, he appears primed for one of his biggest opportunities yet.Commanders vs. Bears prediction, pick\nInjuries are nothing to sneeze at, especially when they decimate the top of your pass catching corps. But we saw on Sunday with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that a game-changing quarterback can overcome the challenge of depleted weaponry. Another week removed from his knee sprain, Jayden Daniels feels entirely up to that challenge. Especially when considering he'll be up against one of the NFL's most porous run defenses, which will also be without veteran interior defender Grady Jarrett (knee).Will Caleb Williams be motivated to erase the sting of last year's walk-off defeat at the hands of the Commanders? Sure. Will former Washington pass rusher Montez Sweat help Dennis Allen's defense keep things reasonably close? Perhaps. But Ben Johnson's Bears still feel like a work in progress, whereas the Commanders -- even on an off day or without a fully healthy arsenal -- register a bit more reliable. This should be a gritty back-and-forth brawl, but in the end, we can't help but ride with the group that did it before.\nPick: Commanders 26, Bears 23 | Bears +5.5, Under 49.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Six weeks into the NFL season have come and gone, which means a third of the year is completed. The league is really starting to figure out who the bad teams are, and which head coaches are on the hot seat going forward.One coach has already been fired, as the Tennessee Titans relieved Brian Callahan of his duties Monday. Callahan was 4-19 in 23 games as the Titans coach, a paltry .174 win percentage as he didn't get to finish his second season in the NFL. This shows how tough of a business this is. In the wake of Callahan's firing, the other hot seat candidates are obvious and the storylines are growing every single week. Look at what the New York Jets are dealing with as the only winless team in the NFL and how the Miami Dolphins locker room is collapsing before our very eyes. Those franchises appear to be in disarray as their seasons are going off the rails.The teams that are off to poor starts are pondering whether to retain their head coach or let him go, like what Tennessee did with Callahan. Some head coaches have been with their team a long time while others have barely got started (here's looking at you Aaron Glenn). The hot seat is getting hotter around the NFL, as quite a few head coaching jobs could be opening -- perhaps even more this month. \nWhich coaches are on the proverbial hot seat through six weeks in 2025? Who may be joining Callahan on the unemployment line? Is there anything they can do to save their job at this rate? 1. Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins)2025 record: 1-5Career record: 29-28 (.509 win percentage)Previous ranking: 2Surprising McDaniel wasn't the first head coach to be relieved of his duties in 2025, but that demonstrates how bad Callahan was. The Dolphins lost a heartbreaker to the Chargers on Sunday to fall to 1-5, with the lone victory this seaosn being against the Jets. The Dolphins fought hard, which was a tip in McDaniel's cap.Then Tua Tagovailoa stood at the podium saying Dolphins players were late for players-only meeting, calling them out in a public press conference. That's a very bad look for the quarterback of the Dolphins and his head coach, who is fighting for his job every week. \nMiami has winnable games against Cleveland and Atlanta coming up, but does it matter? McDaniel seems to be a loss away from a change in leadership. 2. Aaron Glenn (New York Jets)2025 record: 0-6Career record: 0-6 (.000 win percentage)Previous ranking: 5Can things get any worse for Glenn and the Jets? New York is the only winless team in the NFL at 0-6 and had chances to steal victories this season. The Jets aren't a talented roster, but are they this bad?This is where Glenn's mismanagement and feel for the game comes in. The halftime debacle on Sunday was laughable, as Glenn calls for a fake punt, converts it, then lets the time run out before halftime a few plays later. Garrett Wilson was visibly upset, while Glenn appeared to show no trust in Justin Fields as his quarterback -- then decides to chide the media asking him about a potential change. \nGlenn just doesn't appear to be a head coach in the league, and it's fair to wonder if he's the Jets head coach by December at this rate. The Jets are a bad football team, and they are worse with Glenn as head coach. 3. Kevin Stefanski (Cleveland Browns)2025 record: 1-5Career record: 41-49 (.456 win percentage)Previous ranking: 7The beginning of the end appears to be happening for Stefanski, as the Browns' failures in the front office with Deshaun Watson had led to a good head coach fighting for his job. The Browns did trade Joe Flacco to a division rival after starting Dillon Gabriel, but it's fair to wonder how long the leash is for him. Could there be enough public outcry to force the Browns to start Shedeur Sanders?The Browns have done an excellent job with their 2025 draft class, and they have one of the best defenses in football under Jim Schwartz (23.9 yards per possession allowed is first in NFL). The Browns team is a quarterback away from being competitive, but will Stefenski be around long enought o gte that chance?\nIf the Browns move on, Stefanski will get another head coaching job somewhere. This mess isn't on him. 4. John Harbaugh (Baltimore Ravens)2025 record: 1-5Career record: 173-109 (.613 win percentage)Previous ranking: 9Has Harbaugh's shelf life really run its course in Baltimore? The Ravens are 1-5 and have their season off the rails with a defense that has allowed 37+ points per game in four of their six games and Lamar Jackson missing multiple weeks with a hamstring injury. The offense was abysmal with Cooper Rush, enough to make a quarterback change to Tyler Huntley in Sunday's loss to the Rams.Can Jackson save the season, especially with the defense showing an encouraging performance last week? The Ravens aren't out of it yet, especially with the schedule much easier coming out of the bye week (Bears, Dolphins, Vikings, Browns, Jets). The pressure is on Harbaugh and the Ravens to go at least 4-1 in those games with a healthy Jackson, or there will be discussion if he'll get a year 19 in Baltimore. \n5. Brian Daboll (New York Giants)2025 record: 2-4Career record: 20-36-1 (.360 win percentage)Previous ranking: 4Did benching Russell Wilson and going to Jaxson Dart save Daboll's job? The Giants are 2-1 since making the switch to Dart, upsetting the previously unbeaten Chargers and the defensing Super Bowl champion Eagles at home. That's a huge positive for Daboll, especially since he has his quarterback running the offense. The Giants are on the upswing with Dart, who looks to be the best quarterback in the 2025 draft class after six weeks. Dart has the confidence to succeed, which is crucial toward success in the NFL. Keep in mind Dart is playing well without Malik Nabers and beat the Eagles without Nabers and Darius Slayton. Daboll's future is tied to Dart and how he performs, not fully how the Giants perform in the win-loss column. The Giants play a gauntlet of a schedule, so Daboll's future will seesaw all year -- unless they are competitive and find ways to steal games like they have over the last three weeks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The AP Top 25 men's basketball poll was released Monday, signaling that the start of the 2025-26 college basketball season is on the horizon. Purdue earned the No. 1 spot in the poll after receiving 35 of 60 possible first-place votes. Houston, Florida, and UConn -- the teams ranked behind the Boilermakers -- all received first-place votes.Rounding out the top five of the poll is St. John's.The Red Storm reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015 under coach Rick Pitino and will be one of the favorites to win the Big East alongside UConn.The Cooper Flagg era may be over at Duke, but the Blue Devils have plenty of talent on their roster entering this season, including star freshman Cameron Boozer -- a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Duke opened last season ranked No. 7 in the preseason poll and will start this year ranked No. 6. \n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Purdue earns No. 1 spot in preseason AP Top 25 poll ahead of Houston, Florida\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking of the ACC, Louisville coach Pat Kelsey led a remarkable turnaround last season and helped the program reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2019. The Cardinals are one of our \"underrated\" teams heading into the season.\nWith that said, here are the overrated and underrated teams from the poll.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Overrated: St. John'sAP Top 25 ranking: No. 5The hype around St. John's program entering the season is real. There is no denying that. After reaching the second round of the NCAA Tournament and loading up in the transfer portal by adding players such as Bryce Hopkins (Providence), Joson Sanon (Arizona State) and Ian Jackson (North Carolina), it's clear to see why a voter would rank St. John's so high entering the season.However, my biggest concern heading into the season for St. John's is what they do at point guard. After landing Jackson this offseason, Pitino labeled him as \"the next great point.\" However, Pitino told reporters this month that Oziyah Sellers is the starting point guard and Dylan Darling, another transfer, is the backup. St. John's has the talent to be a Final Four team, but it's hard not to question if these pieces will fit together.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Underrated: LouisvilleAP Top 25 ranking: No. 11If you're a fan of an NBA team that needs a point guard in the draft, you should be watching every single Louisville game this season. Five-star Mikel Brown Jr. is a star in the making and someone who can raise the ceiling of this Louisville team. \nI loved what Louisville did in the transfer portal by adding Ryan Conwell, Isaac McKneely, and Adrian Wooely. Louisville has the talent to be a team that's playing for a national title this spring. Three years ago, that sentence almost seemed impossible to utter because former coach Kenny Payne had Louisville at rock bottom.  I would be very surprised if Kelsey's squad doesn't finish ranked in the top 10 at the end of the season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Overrated: North CarolinaAP Top 25 ranking: No. 25It's pretty simple. This season is a make-or-break for UNC coach Hubert Davis. The Tar Heels surprisingly heard their name called on Selection Sunday this past spring after finishing the regular season 22-13 with just one win (UCLA) over a ranked opponent. By sneaking in as one of the last teams in the field, North Carolina avoided missing the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three seasons under Davis. Regardless, that standard isn't acceptable for a program of its stature.North Carolina's frontcourt of Caleb Wilson -- a projected lottery pick in the 2026 NBA Draft -- and Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar will be its greatest strength heading into the season. However, I think it's more likely that North Carolina finishes unranked than higher than 25. Obviously, I am not a voter in the poll, but it wouldn't be surprising if in-state foe NC State, under first-year coach Will Wade, had a better season than UNC. NC State received the most votes in the poll without being ranked.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Underrated: ArkansasAP Top 25 ranking: No. 14Even after all the chaos that transpired in John Calipari's first season at Arkansas after his breakup with Kentucky, his team still had a chance to reach the Elite Eight before a late collapse against Texas Tech. Something not common for Calipari during his tenure with Kentucky was continuity, as most of his best players were one-and-done.However, this version of Calipari's roster will return several key players, including DJ Wagner, Karter Knox, Trevon Brazile and Billy Richmond III. On top of that, five-star Darius Acuff Jr. is going to be the next one-and-done point guard Calipari produces. The returning experience, coupled with the newcomers on the roster, makes Calipari's squad a threat to play deep into March and finish as a top 10 team.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Underrated: KansasAP Top 25 ranking: No. 19Kansas is in an unfamiliar spot heading into the season. The Jayhawks began the season as the preseason top-ranked team in each of the last two years and will instead start at No. 19 behind Big 12 foes Houston, BYU, Texas Tech, Arizona and Iowa State.\nThe Jayhawks have massively underperformed during the last three seasons, with three consecutive exits in the NCAA Tournament before the second weekend. What makes this version of Kansas (potentially) different is five-star Darryn Peterson, who profiles as the projected No. 1 pick this summer and one of the best guard prospects in recent memory. Peterson alone raises the ceiling and floor of this Kansas team. The Jayhawks haven't had a player like Peterson in the Self era. There's a reason why the Kansas coach has labeled him the best player he has recruited at the school. I'm buying all the hype around Peterson bringing Kansas' program back to glory.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 1-5 Tennessee Titans are making yet another change in leadership, as the franchise fired head coach Brian Callahan on Monday following Tennessee's Week 6 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. The Titans franchise has been in an aggressive tailspin ever since the infamous postseason loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. In 2021, the Titans were the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Since then, they have fired two head coaches and two general managers while going 17-40.  Tennessee parted ways with Mike Vrabel following the 2023 season, and opted to hire the offensive-minded Callahan. The former Bengals offensive coordinator had worked with notable quarterbacks such as Peyton Manning, Matthew Stafford and Joe Burrow at different points of their careers, so it was believed he could groom a franchise quarterback. That did not happen. Will Levis struggled mightily in his second NFL season, as the Titans finished with a 3-14 record. That awarded the flailing franchise the No. 1 overall pick -- which the Titans used on quarterback Cameron Ward. The first-year signal-caller has not been a disaster this season, but he could not will this roster to wins by himself. So, where do the Titans go from here? What do the Titans have going for them? Well, a No. 1 overall pick at quarterback that has shown some potential, a shiny new stadium that's in the process of being built and a general manager that saw a dynasty built in Kansas City with Mike Borgonzi. Who could Tennessee be looking at to hire as its next head coach? Let's take a look at five candidates. \nBuffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe BradyBrady was once viewed as the next Sean McVay. The former William & Mary wide receiver landed an offensive coordinator job with the Carolina Panthers in 2020 at the ripe age of 30 after he served as the passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach for the historic 2019 LSU team. In his one season in Baton Rouge, LSU went undefeated with college football's top-ranked offense, winning a national championship while Joe Burrow picked up the Heisman Trophy. Under Brady's guidance, Justin Jefferson and Ja'Marr Chase both recorded over 1,500 yards receiving, and combined for 38 receiving touchdowns. After just one season as Carolina's offensive coordinator, the young Brady received interview requests from teams searching for a new head coach. However, Brady was fired during his second season with the Panthers -- viewed by many as a scapegoat of the tragic Matt Rhule era. Brady then made his way to Buffalo, and served as the Bills' quarterbacks coach before he was promoted to offensive coordinator during the 2023 season. In 2024, the Bills made the AFC Championship game while Josh Allen won MVP. The star quarterback led Buffalo to a 13-4 record and became the first player to ever throw 25 touchdowns, rush for 10 touchdowns and commit fewer than 10 turnovers in a season. He did this without his top two wide receivers from the previous year.\nBrady may be viewed as the best coordinator in the NFL right now, and in a quarterback-driven league, developing Ward is something the Titans have in mind. Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff KingsburyTom Brady's former backup quarterback has worked with some big-name signal-callers, such as Baker Mayfield, Patrick Mahomes, Caleb Williams, and of course, Jayden Daniels. Kingsbury had a hand in one of the biggest surprises in the NFL last season, as the Commanders went from 4-13 to 12-5, and ended their magical campaign with an NFC Championship appearance.In his first NFL season, Daniels became the second quarterback to ever throw for 4,000 yard and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, including playoffs. He scored the most total touchdowns (37) and racked up the most total yards (5,416) by a rookie all time, and had more games in one year where his team had zero punts and zero turnovers than Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning and Mahomes had in their combined careers. Kingsbury's unique, up-tempo offense ranked top seven in both yards per game (369.6) and points per game (28.5) in 2024. \nKingsbury has been a head coach before, as he led the Arizona Cardinals from 2019-22. He improved Arizona's win total every year, going from 5-10-1 to 8-8 to eventually 11-6, but was let go after a disastrous 4-13 campaign in 2022. Overall, the 46-year-old coach has gone 28-37-1 as a lead man. Consistency is a question when it comes to Kingsbury, but he will be aboard the coaching carousel this offseason.Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthyIf the Titans are done experimenting with young offensive minds, they could entertain the 61-year-old Mike McCarthy. He spent 13 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, going 10-8 in the playoffs, which includes a Super Bowl XLV championship with Aaron Rodgers. McCarthy went 125-77-2 during his time in Green Bay, and was fired in 2018 after a 4-7-1 start. McCarthy then took a year off and enrolled himself in head coach bootcamp, before the Cowboys came calling in 2020. After going 6-10 in his first season, McCarthy put together three straight 12-5 campaigns. Despite all of the regular-season success in Dallas, he won just one playoff game in five seasons with the Cowboys. McCarthy walked following a 7-10 campaign in 2024. \nMcCarthy is definitely not the sexiest name aboard the coaching carousel, but he should be the most experienced. That's something that could intrigue Titans ownership. Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse MinterMinter is a name quickly rising up coaching \"big boards.\" The former Michigan defensive coordinator followed Jim Harbaugh to Los Angeles, and helped the Chargers become the first team since the 1993 New York Giants to go from 24th or worse to first in scoring defense. The Chargers went from 5-12 to 11-6 in 2024, while Minter's unit allowed just 17.7 points per game. The 42-year-old defensive mind has limited NFL experience, but there's no debating his impact on the Chargers in a short amount of time. ESPN analyst and former scout/executive Louis Riddick even said on a \"Monday Night Football\" broadcast in September that Minter will be a head coach in 2025. \nKansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt NagyTennessee's current general manager has a relationship with Nagy from their days together in Kansas City, making him a natural candidate. The Chicago Bears hired Nagy to be their head coach in 2018, and he won NFL Coach of the Year in his very first season after going 12-4. Chicago won the NFC North for the first time in eight years with quarterback Mitch Trubisky and the backing of a Vic Fangio-led defense. Things just got worse from there, as the Bears finished 8-8 in each of the next two seasons, and then 6-11 in 2021 before Nagy was fired. Nagy went 0-2 in the postseason, and his offense never finished better than 21st in yards per game. Nagy then returned to the Chiefs and won two Super Bowls as Mahomes' quarterbacks coach and then offensive coordinator. Andy Reid said in 2018 that Nagy is the best head-coaching candidate he's ever had. Maybe he deserves a second chance. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nigeria are at serious risk of not qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup that will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer. The Super Eagles, by far one of the most talented rosters among the African national teams, will face Benin on Tuesday at noon ET in a crucial match for their World Cup hopes. It's the the last match of the group phase for qualification and they are currently in third place of Group C of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Confederation of African Football (CAF) first round with 14 points, while Benin are at the top of the group with 17 and South Africa in second place with 15 points after nine games. On top of this, the plane carrying the Nigerian squad from South Africa was forced to make an emergency landing in Angola on Saturday, according to the Nigerian press. The flight took off from Polokwane in South Africa and made a refuelling stop in Angola before leaving for Nigeria again, but 25 minutes after they took off, the plane was forced to return in Angola after, \"a heavy crack on the aircraft's windshield distorted what had started as a smooth flight,\" the Nigerian FA announced. Let's now take a look at what can happen if they win against Benin.Let's run through the scenarios ahead of the Super Eagles. Nigeria qualification scenarios? If Nigeria lose on Tuesday they will officially be out of the World Cup, something that would probably mark one of the lowest points of the African national team, considering the value of their roster. Winning is the only option Nigeria have ahead of Tuesday's game, but even winning might not guarantee them a spot in the World Cup directly. Benin currently lead Group C by three points and have a two-goal advantage on goal difference. In theory if Nigeria hand Benin a heavy enough defeat, and if South Africa lose they could still top the group. South Africa were handed a three-point deduction by FIFA earlier this year for fielding an extra player against Lesotho, complicating Bafana Bafana's path to the 2026 World Cup and keeping Nigeria's hopes of directly qualifying alive. Still, South Africa's opponents on Tuesday are Rwanda, who have already been eliminated from contention and sit fifth in the six team group.\nIf Rwanda don't get it done for them, but Nigeria win and finish second in the group, they wouldn't be eliminated from contention, but they'll have a long road ahead of them. The top four second place teams from the nine qualifying groups will play a knockout tournament to determine which of them then progress to the intercontinental playoff. That playoff will award two total spots to the six teams that qualify for it. So to sum up, Nigeria need to win, then either they need Rwanda to beat South Africa which would mean Nigeria qualify automatically, or they need to hope they finish in the top four of the nine runners-up in CAF qualifying. If they do make the top four, they then need to outlast three other teams to qualify for the intercontinental playoff, which will award two slots to the winners of the six team tournament.

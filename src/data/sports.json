Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott leads an offense that is scoring nearly 30 points per game, while the Raiders have been one of the worst offenses in the NFL. Quarterback Geno Smith is just 6-14 against the spread in his last 20 home games, and the Raiders are just 2-8 in their last 10 games at Allegiant Stadium.

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 11 finale has the Dallas Cowboys visiting the Las Vegas Raiders on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET, with Dallas listed as a 3.5-point favorite and the over/under at 50. Those seeking NFL picks will likely gravitate towards Cowboys when filling out daily Fantasy lineups considering they rank fourth in scoring offense. Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens will be popular selections, but some helpful NFL DFS advice would be to not overlook Raiders players, despite Vegas having the No. 31 scoring offense.The team trading away Jakobi Meyers created a receiving void, as several under-the-radar Vegas pass catchers could bubble up to the surface. While Ashton Jeanty and Brock Bowers were likely already under consideration for your Monday Night Football DFS strategy, others could also provide an immense return on investment if they can break through against a struggling Dallas defense. Before making any NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to Cowboys vs. Raiders on 'Monday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Raiders vs. CowboysPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering CeeDee Lamb. The four-time Pro Bowler is coming off back-to-back seven-catch games and ranks sixth in the NFL with 81.8 receiving yards per game. However, if you take away the game in which he injured his ankle, playing just seven snaps and getting no targets, Lamb's 98.2 yards would rank second in the league. The Raiders have given up the sixth-most Fantasy points to opposing wideouts, so inserting Lamb into MNF DFS lineups is a no-brainer. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Raiders tight end Michael Mayer. Vegas' other tight end shouldn't be overlooked as he has standalone value even with Bowers back in the lineup. After trading away Meyers, Mayer played 37 snaps last week, as Tre Tucker was the only Raiders wideout who played more. Averaging 27 yards with one total touchdown over his last four games, all starts, Mayer is a low-cost, high-upside option for Monday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Cowboys vs. RaidersMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

The Cowboys will visit the Raiders on Monday Night Football. The Cowboys are averaging 29.2 points per game this season, including scoring at least 27 in four of their last six games. Meanwhile, the Raiders have been held to seven points or fewer in two of their last three games. The offensive discrepancies are why the SportsLine Projection Model is backing the Cowboys to cover as 3.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model also sees value in playing the Clippers to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the 76ers in NBA action.

Las Vegas has the No. 20 scoring defense (24.4 ppg allowed), and the Raiders have allowed at least 30 points in two of their last three games. Meanwhile, the model doesn't project the Raiders to be able to keep pace with Dallas' offense, whether the Cowboys are at their best or just average, as the Raiders rank 31st in scoring at 15.4 ppg this year. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Dallas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Clippers (+5.5) vs. 76ers (-112)The Clippers have been hit hard with injuries this season, but so have the 76ers. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid (knee) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (knee). Paul George (knee) is questionable. The Clippers were hoping for a Big Three this year of James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal, but Beal is out for the season with a hip injury, and Leonard has played just six games while dealing with a foot injury. Harden has done his part, though, averaging 26 points and nine assists per game this season, with Ivica Zubac adding 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. Harden is averaging 39 points over his last two games, and the Clippers went 1-1 with their loss coming by three points over that span. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games and haven't covered a 5.5-point spread in any of their last three games. The model projects the Clippers to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Sabres (+1.5) vs. Oilers (-198) \"Bit of a trap game potential for Edmonton after winning a possible Cup Finals preview on Saturday at Carolina and then with Alex Ovechkin and the Caps up next.\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The Oilers are 4-6-2 away. Buffalo is last in the Atlantic Division but 5-3-2 at home and off one of the team's better efforts of the year on Saturday in Detroit. The return of captain and blueliner Rasmus Dahlin, a former No. 1 overall pick, from a personal leave made an obvious difference in that huge comeback win.\" Back the Sabres at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Monday Night Football, NBA, NHL picks?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

Dallas (3-5-1) has lost back-to-back games, last falling to Arizona, 27-17, also on 'MNF' in Week 9 before having a bye. The Raiders (2-7) are mired in a three-game losing streak and fell to Denver, 10-7, last Thursday. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 7-6, and won the last matchup in 2021. This will be the Cowboys' first regular season visit to Vegas since the Raiders relocated from Oakland in 2020.

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers exited the Steelers' Week 11 win against the Bengals after sustaining a left wrist injury late in the first half. While he was initially labeled as questionable to return, Rodgers never returned to the sideline during the second half, much less the field. Rodgers specifically suffered a tiny fracture in his wrist, according to NFL Media, which is also reporting that the veteran quarterback is pushing to play in this week's game against the Chicago Bears. Rodgers is reportedly 50-50 for this Sunday's game. There are several factor that will determine whether or not Rodgers faces the Bears, his former NFC North rival during his 18 seasons with the Packers. The potential of further injuring himself is one reported factor, along with his ability to grip a football. Rodgers' injury appeared to occur late in the first of Pittsburgh's 34-12 win over Cincinnati. He was seen holding his wrist after being hit by multiple Bengals defenders during the Steelers' final offensive play of the first half. Tomlin told CBS Sports' Melanie Collins at halftime that Rodgers was being evaluated and that they were hopeful that he would return at some point. Rodgers was replaced during the second half by Mason Rudolph, Pittsburgh's longtime backup who entered the game with a 9-8-1 record as an NFL starting quarterback that included an 8-4-1 mark as the Steelers' starting quarterback. During the second half, Rudolph went 12 of 16 for 127 yards and a touchdown while directing two scoring drives. \n\"He's always delivered when called upon in the past,\" Tomlin said of Rudolph, the only quarterback to start a playoff game for Pittsburgh since Ben Roethlisberger. \"That's why we value him. His performance was consistent with what he's done in the past for us. Not that we take it for granted. We don't. We appreciate it.\" Rodgers, 41, helped lead Pittsburgh to a 10-6 halftime lead over a Cincinnati team that defeated the Steelers back in Week 7. Rodgers gave the Steelers an early lead by throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Kenneth Gainwell on the game's opening drive. With Rodgers sidelined, Pittsburgh added to its lead in the third quarter. After Rudolph's first drive ended in a Chris Boswell field goal, Steelers safety Kyle Dugger made it a 20-9 game when he recorded a 73-yard pick-six off of Bengals quarterback Joe Flacco late in the third quarter. \nAfter a Bengals field goal made it 20-12 with less than 10 minutes to play, Rudolph put the game out of reach with a five-yard touchdown pass to Gainwell with 3:40 left. The Steelers' defense recorded its second touchdown of the day moments later when defensive back James Pierre scooped up a fumble and took it 34 yards to the house. \nRudolph said that Rodgers notified him at halftime that he would be leading the Steelers' offense at the start of the second half. When asked to assess his performance, Rudolph pointed to the end result. \"We won, and that's the only objective,\" he said. \"I thought I settled down a little bit. I had a couple errant ones early, but just tried to get it to out to our guys. [The Bengals] played a lot of soft, one-high zone, and so we were letting a whole lot of stuff go over the middle. ... I was really proud of the way the guys. We had a couple bad penalties that backed us up, and we overcame it and got some points on the board.\" \nWith the win, Pittsburgh improved to 6-4 on the season while retaining its lead over second-place Baltimore in the AFC North standings. This Sunday, they will try to win in a city that they haven't won in since 1995. In fact, the Steelers have a lifetime record of just 1-6 in the Windy City. Rodgers' career against the Bears is much better. Including the playoffs, Rodgers has a 25-5 record against the Bears, a mark that inspired Rodgers to yell \"I own you!\" at Bears fans following a touchdown during win at Chicago during the 2021 season. Rodgers is surely hoping to get another chance to play his former rival in what could be the final season of his future Hall of Fame career. \n            ",

This offseason, George underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee after suffering an injury in a summer workout, causing him to miss the first 12 games of the Sixers' season. Without George, the Sixers have been one of the NBA's pleasant surprises, going 7-5 thanks to All-NBA caliber play from Tyrese Maxey and third overall pick VJ Edgecombe emerging as a frontrunner for Rookie of the Year. Adding George back into the lineup will require some finesse from coach Nick Nurse, as it isn't as simple as just plugging in a former All-NBA player and making the team better.\n        \n            \n                The Sixers' Paul George problem: Why veteran's imminent injury return may cause more issues than it solves\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are some potential challenges in adding George back to the Sixers' lineup, as three of their best players in this young season have been wings -- Edgecombe, Quentin Grimes and Kelly Oubre. Nurse will have to figure out how to shift their roles with George back in the fold while trying to keep the style of play that's allowed Philly to thrive early this year. \nStill, that's a challenge the Sixers should embrace, because if George can return to the form he showed two years ago in L.A., he is still among the NBA's best two-way wings. Last year he struggled to find his fit alongside Maxey and Joel Embiid -- who has been in and out of the lineup this year once again -- but perhaps Philly's new emphasis on pushing the pace can bring a bit more out of George, provided his knee is healthy enough to play that kind of style. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The second AP Top 25 poll of the 2025-26 season released Monday, and college basketball has a new No. 1 team. Purdue, the preseason top-ranked team, was leapfrogged by Houston last week despite not sustaining a loss. The Boilermakers jumped back to the spot the program held in the preseason after recording a statement 87-80 win over Alabama.Preseason All-American forward Trey Kaufman-Renn made his season debut against the Crimson Tide after missing the first two games and finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and five assists. Braden Smith, the preseason CBS Sports Player of the Year, was also brilliant in the upset. He finished with 29 points, seven rebounds and four assists.Alabama came off a statement win over St. John's. After jumping into the top-10 (No. 8), Alabama dropped three spots to No. 11 following the loss to Purdue.One of the biggest winners of last week was Louisville. The Cardinals jumped six spots to No. 6 after defeating in-state rival Kentucky 96-88 behind the brilliance of star freshman Mikel Brown Jr. The former five-star recruit scored a team-high 29 points in the win over the Wildcats. Kentucky dropped three spots to No. 12 after the loss. \nThe full AP Top 25 rankings after the third week of the season are below.AP Top 251. Purdue (44)2. Houston (12)3. UConn (2)4. Arizona (2)5.

NC StateOthers receiving votes: San Diego State. 71, Indiana 65, Vanderbilt 57, Oregon 28, Ohio State 21, USC 16, Georgetown 16, Creighton 12, Baylor 11, Saint Mary's 8, Missouri 7, Mississippi 5, Iowa 3, Utah State 2, Georgia 2, Virginia 1, Virginia Tech 1, Stanford 1, Kansas State 1.The No. 1 spot could fluctuate this seasonThe voters surprisingly gave Houston the nod last week at No. 1 despite Purdue not losing a game. The Boilermakers looked sluggish in their win over Oakland, but part of that can be attributed to not having Kaufman-Renn in the lineup. The voters got it right this week by giving Purdue the nod at No. 1. \nHowever, it seems college basketball may be due for some chaos as the season progresses. That's because five different teams received votes for the No. 1 spot. UConn and Arizona each received two, while Duke got a single first-place vote. UConn registered a marquee win over BYU, while Arizona added a win over UCLA to its résumé last week. If last week's voting showed anything, it's that weekly shake-ups at the very top of the poll could be the norm, especially with all the ranked-on-ranked matchups coming up during November.Illinois is one of the biggest winners of the weekIllinois defeated Texas Tech 81-77 last week behind a huge performance from Cal transfer Andrej Stojaković, who finished with a team-high 23 points in one of the biggest ranked-on-ranked matchups of the season. That win over the Red Raiders bumped Illinois into the top 10 (No. 8).The Fighting Illini were one of three teams that jumped six spots in the poll this week, with Louisville and Gonzaga being the others. This is Illinois' highest ranking in the AP poll since finishing No. 6 in the final rankings of the 2023-24 season. Illinois is now one of three teams from the Big Ten ranked inside the top 10.\nNC State enters the poll for the first time under Will WadeAfter reaching the Final Four in one of the craziest runs in college basketball history during the 2024 NCAA Tournament, NC State finished 12-19 overall last season and fired coach Kevin Keatts shortly thereafter. The Wolfpack made a splash this offseason by hiring away Will Wade from McNeese State, and it's already paying off.NC State (No. 25) entered the rankings for the first time this season. The Wolfpack are off to a 3-0 start, with wins over NC Central, UAB and UNC Greensboro. The first real test of the Wade era comes Dec. 3 when NC State faces No. 22 Auburn on the road.\n            ",

Penix may be out for the season, and the team is expected to turn the reins over to Kirk Cousins as long as Penix undergoes further evaluation, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones.The Falcons subsequently announced that Penix will be placed in injured reserve. That makes him out for at least the next four games as the team determines the full severity of his injury. The earliest Penix could return is in Week 16 against the Arizona Cardinals, but that may be optimistic based on the early reports.Penix sustained the injury after a third-down sack in the third quarter and slammed his helmet down, appearing frustrated, after the hit. He was able to walk off the field on his own and immediately went into the blue medical tent as the special teams unit punted.Before leaving the game, Penix went 13 of 16 with 175 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. The Falcons were up 21-19 in the divisional matchup when Penix exited.\nPenix has a history of knee injuries, as he torn his ACL in 2018 and in 2020, before entering the NFL.Cousins took over for the injured second-year player, and he will be the starter for the rest of the season if Penix can't return.  Cousins, last year's starter, has one start this year, a loss, and has appeared in two games before this week. He went 26 of 38 with 202 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in both games.Cousins finished with six passes on 14 attempts with 48 passing yards.\nThe news of Penix's injury is only compounded by the fact that star wide receiver Drake London left the game late in regulation after suffering a knee injury as well. London didn't return for overtime, but Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network reported that London likely avoided a major injury.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        College football has been filled with upsets and letdowns this season, even for the best teams in the sport. No. 2 Indiana needed a historically great catch by Omar Cooper to survive Penn State. No. 3 Texas A&M needed a historic comeback against South Carolina to stay unscathed. No. 8 Oregon barely outlasted No. 21 Iowa. With the exception of No. 1 Ohio State, nearly every other team has shown a moment of weakness against a lackluster opponent. And then ... there's No. 9 Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish didn't start the season well, dropping their first two matchups to Miami and Texas A&M in heartbreaking fashion. Since then, Notre Dame has been one of the most dominant teams in the country. In a 37-15 decimation of No. 22 Pittsburgh, the Fighting Irish brought out all the stops. Running back Jeremiyah Love exploded for 147 yards and a touchdown. Receiver Malachi Fields had seven catches for 99 yards and two touchdowns, and tight end Eli Raridon had six catches of his own. The defense decimated Pitt, holding them to 3.4 yards per play. Even special teams generated returns of 43 and 21 yards. \nThe win only emphasizes what the Irish have done since Week 3. Notre Dame has won eight straight games, all by double-figures. That includes a 10-point win against No. 17 USC, a 22-point win over No. 22 Pittsburgh and a 43-point road destruction of Arkansas where the Irish held one of the SEC's best offenses to 20 points below their season averages. Because of their dominance, the analytics absolutely love Notre Dame. FEI has them rated No. 6 in the nation, ahead of Alabama, Texas A&M and Oklahoma. SP+ has them even higher at No. 5, ahead of Georgia. Of course, the Fighting Irish still have those two losses hanging over their heads. But in a year where multiple playoff contenders have lackluster losses, both are highly defensible. Miami beat them on a last-second field goal after Notre Dame fought all the way back. Texas A&M needed a miraculous 4th-and-13 touchdown pass -- and has since ran roughshod through the SEC to reach No. 3. \n\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Georgia moves into first-round bye in College Football Playoff, Oklahoma enters bracket\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince the beginning of the season, Notre Dame has improved dramatically, especially defending the pass. In their first three games, the Irish gave up 289.3 passing yards per game on 8.1 yards per attempt. Since then, they're down to 225 yards per game (not including option Navy) on 6.0 yards per attempt. Much maligned defensive coordinator Chris Ash has settled the unit. Quarterback CJ Carr has also emerged as one of the most exciting young quarterbacks in the nation, completing 67% of his passes for 2,487 yards and 21 touchdowns. Next to Love, the star running back, the Notre Dame offense is incredibly potent and physical. Results matter, and Notre Dame deserves to be treated like a two-loss team. They sit behind five of the seven Power Four one-loss teams in the CFP Rankings. But as high-level opponents stumble, Notre Dame is only getting stronger. \nThe expanded 12-team College Football Playoff was built to let teams grow and improve over the course of a season. When the bracket is set, the Fighting Irish's consistency will make them one of the toughest outs of the postseason. \n            ",

He played well in his first start this season, going 26 of 36 for 197 yards with two touchdowns and one interception during New York's Week 3 loss to the Buccaneers. A 15-year veteran and former Pro Bowler, Taylor brings considerable experience to the Jets' huddle. He has played in 97 regular season games that includes 59 career starts. \nWhile Taylor gets another opportunity to start, Fields heads to the bench roughly seven months after he signed a two-year deal with the Jets. \nA former first-round pick, Fields completed 62.7% of his passes this season with seven touchdowns and just one interception. The Jets went just 2-7 with Fields under center. Fields also comes off two of his worst games of the season; he went just 6 of 11 passing during the team's Week 10 win over the Browns and completed fewer than 60% of his throws during last week's loss to New England.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 college football schedule coincides with that annual late-season SEC slate where many of the teams face Group of Five opponents. While 14 SEC teams are in action, just four games you can make Week 13 college football picks on are conference matchups. It's highlighted by Oklahoma vs. Missouri, a top-25 matchup that has OU as 9.5-point favorites. There's just one other ranked contest, and it has Oregon as 9.5-point favorites over USC, according to the latest Week 13 college football odds.Even with the lack of elite matchups, there are still several interesting games, many of them pitting bitter rivals versus one another. Among them are Tennessee vs. Florida (+3), UNC vs. Duke (-6.5), Texas vs. Arkansas (+9.5) and Miami vs. Virginia Tech (+16.5). It wouldn't be the worst thing to seek out some college football betting advice with something unexpected happening seemingly every Saturday. Before locking in any Week 13 college football picks, be sure to see the latest Week 13 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and Week 13 college football betting lines on the spread, money line, and over/under. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top college football predictions for Week 13One of the college football picks the model is high on during Week 13: Kansas State (+16.5, 52.5) covers at No. 13 Utah in a 4 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff. The K-State defense is among the most opportunistic in the nation, with 24 takeaways on the season and five in Saturday's win over Oklahoma State. Meanwhile, Utah has just six takeaways over its last six games, and the Utes can be sloppy as times, as they've averaged seven penalties over their last four games. That contrasts with the disciplined unit that Chris Klieman leads as KSU averages the fifth-fewest penalties (3.5) in FBS. Excelling on the margins should allow the Wildcats to stay within this spread, with the model having this as a one-score game as KSU covers well over 70% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Georgia Tech (-2.5, 61.5) covers against Pitt in almost 60% of simulations Saturday at 7 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh faced its first top-15 squad in Notre Dame on Saturday, and the Panthers were embarrassed in a 22-point defeat. Pitt couldn't stop the Irish's rushing attack, giving up a season-high of 175 yards on the ground, and now Pittsburgh has to face a Yellow Jackets rushing attack that's top 10 in FBS in both yards per game and yards per carry. Not only that, but Georgia Tech's quarterback, Haynes King, also ranks fifth in the country in completion percentage as the Yellow Jackets offense should overwhelm the Panthers. In addition to Georgia Tech covering, the sims also have the Over hitting over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 13The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 13, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London will miss at least Week 12 after suffering a PCL sprain in his team's loss to the Carolina Panthers, according to NFL Network. London left the game late in regulation and did not return for overtime.Prior to his injury, London diced up the Panthers for seven catches and 117 yards. As the Falcons drove to tie or win the game in the fourth quarter, London took a hard hit going over the middle and landed hard when diving for a ball down the sidelines. He remained on the sidelines after that possession.Losing London for any amount of time, even if it is just one week, is a crushing blow to the Atlanta offense. London is the passing game as he leads the team in receptions (60), receiving yards (810) and receiving touchdowns (6).\nThe No. 8 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, London evolved into one of the best receivers in the league. Since entering the NFL in 2022, London posted 301 receptions for 3852 yards and 21 touchdowns. London is on pace for career bests in both yards and touchdowns, but his knee injury could derail that.Coming off a devastating overtime loss to the Panthers, the injury news for the Falcons continues to get worse. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. could be done for the season with a knee injury of his own, and receiver Darnell Mooney left the game with a rib injury. With Penix and London both out for at least one week -- and Mooney possibly joining them -- the Falcons have a steep hill to climb if they want to get back in the playoff race. Atlanta is 3-7, riding a five-game losing streak.\nIn the wake of another loss the this injury news, the Falcons' chances of winning the NFC South plummeted to +17500 at FanDuel Sportsbook, which makes them an even longer shot than the last-place New Orleans Saints.\n            \n    ",

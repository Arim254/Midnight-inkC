The Under is 8-3 over the last 11 Heat games, despite Miami having the No. 3 scoring offense in the league. The Magic have consistently been one of the better defensive teams in the league over recent seasons, and that has continued this year as Orlando ranks eighth in scoring defense at 113.6 points per game allowed. Orlando plays its first game without leading scorer Franz Wagner, who suffered an ankle injury, and that could hinder the Magic's scoring.

The Raptors enter Tuesday at 15-10 on the year, but they went 4-0 in NBA Cup contests and the younger, up-and-coming team has clearly prioritized the in-season tournament. Brandon Ingram (21.2 points per game) and Scottie Barnes (20 ppg) make a formidable 1-2 combo, and the Raptors are 8-5 at home this season.

    "body": "\n        The Chicago White Sox won Major League Baseball's fourth Draft Lottery on Tuesday night, ensuring they'll make the No. 1 pick in next summer's draft. That will represent the third time the South Siders have done the honors, and the first since they selected Harold Baines in 1977.MLB installed the draft lottery as part of the 2022-27 Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Players Association. The lottery determines only the top six selections and there are restrictions on how often teams can qualify for a lottery pick based on their revenue sharing status. Previous winners include the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Guardians, and Washington Nationals -- those clubs selected right-hander Paul Skenes, infielder Travis Bazzana, and infielder Eli Willits, respectively.It's only natural to wonder now who the White Sox might select next summer. My full preseason draft rankings won't be released until February, but below I've highlighted five players who appear, at this point in time, to have the best odds of headlining the class. To state the obvious: a lot -- and I mean a lot -- can change between now and then, so don't grow too fond of this particular group.The players are presented in no particular order.\n        \n            \n                White Sox win MLB Draft Lottery: Winners and losers as Chicago secures No. 1 pick in 2026 Draft\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. Roch Cholowsky, SS, UCLACholowsky will probably enter the preseason ranked as my No. 1 draft prospect. He's an athletic shortstop who hit .353/.480/.710 last season with 23 home runs, seven stolen bases (on eight attempts), and 15 more walks than strikeouts. Cholowsky, also recruited by Notre Dame to play quarterback during his prep days, is a well-rounded player who ought to also provide value on defense and on the basepaths. He could become the second Bruin ever selected No. 1 in the June draft, joining Yankees ace Gerrit Cole (2011).\n2. Grady Emerson, SS, Argyle HS (TX)Emerson will become the second player from Argyle High School ever selected in the MLB draft (onetime Yankees farmhand Austin Aune was the first). Where, exactly, he goes will be determined over the spring, but it's easy to envision him topping the class. Emerson is a projectable lefty hitter who already employs a mature operation and gameplan at the plate. Defensively, he checks all the boxes to remain at shortstop. It' a good year for shortstops, prep and collegiate, and he might end up being the best of the bunch.3. Jacob Lombard, SS, Gulliver Prep HS (FL)Lombard comes from a baseball family. His father George appeared in parts of six big-league seasons and is now the Detroit TIgers' bench coach. His brother George Jr. is a top prospect with the New York Yankees. Bloodlines aren't the only thing working in Jacob's favor. His game includes both power and speed, giving him an enticing upside -- and a chance at lifting himself to the top spot over the coming months. 4. Drew Burress, CF, Georgia TechBurress is listed at only 5-foot-9, but he's more evidence that height doesn't measure slug. He homered 44 times over his first two collegiate seasons thanks to his feel for lifting and pulling the ball. Burress did see some of his numbers decline year to year, with both his strikeout and walk rates veering in the wrong directions, and not every team will be as high on his chances of sticking in center field. Still, he should be able to cement himself as an early pick with another strong showing for the Yellow Jackets.\n5. Justin Lebron, SS, AlabamaLebron hit .327/.425/.593 with 30 home runs and 24 stolen bases (on 25 attempts) in his first two collegiate seasons with the Crimson Tide. Impressive stuff. There's just one problem: he struck out in 31% of his plate appearances during SEC play. Teams often place extra emphasis on conference play with SEC-based prospects, as that's usually the best quality of competition those players will face in a given year. Lebron will need to slice into that K rate if he wants to assure himself a top-five selection in July.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the nation's capital, Washington, D.C, is a city full of political maneuvering and power plays, and a new type of high-stakes negotiation between NWSL and the Washington Spirit needs a top-level executive to handle the details. The Washington Spirit recently hired Haley Carter as the club's new president of soccer operations, and it's a move that comes with buzz as the club works towards a contract solution with free agent winger Trinity Rodman. Carter's appointment was finalized before Rodman's free agency reached the point of a grievance filed on her behalf by the NWSL Players Association. Now, the Spirit and Carter are back to work after a previous contract option, which would've made Rodman the highest-paid soccer player in women's pro soccer, was vetoed by NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman. In an introductory press conference on Tuesday, the new club president of soccer operations told the media that there were \"no updates\" on Rodman and that they're \"having conversations every day.\" Cater's role with the Spirit isn't just some front-office promotion; it's a signal of ambition. The former NWSL goalkeeper, retired United States Marine Corps officer, and licensed attorney, made her return to the league as an executive in 2023 when she was hired as general manager and vice president of operations for the Orlando Pride. Carter helped build the 2024 roster that went on to win the league double in 2024. \nNow, her new role came with plenty of responsibility and an urgent mission by the Spirit for negotiations to keep Rodman a member of the club.\"We're going to need mechanisms right that allow NWSL clubs to compete for, not only players from overseas, but our own players, and being able to retain them,\" Carter told the media. \"We are going to have to start getting creative, I believe, because it's bigger than just one team. It's bigger than just one player. It's about the league's ability to keep its best players in this league as we continue to grow.\"Per the NWSLPA grievance, reviewed by CBS Sports, the Spirit and Rodman had initially agreed to a contract on or around Nov. 30, but the deal was vetoed by the commissioner for allegedly violating the \"spirit of the league rules.\" Now the league has 14 days to respond to the grievance filing that the NWSLPA says Berman and the league violated several CBA rules regarding free agency. Carter wants to see the \"American league\" evolve to meet the moment in a \"global sport.\"\n\"We have to be cognizant of what's happening in the global market. The evidence kind of speaks for itself. We have multiple examples of athletes, U.S. women's national team players, who are going overseas to compete, and they have their reasons for doing that, and I'm wholly supportive of athletes doing what they think they need to do, and that's in the best interest of their development. I totally get it,\" Carter said.The former Orlando Pride executive uses an example with former Pride starting midfielder Adriana. The Brazilian international signed a hefty deal to play in Saudi Arabia's league, and Carter's maneuvering is not to get in the way of players seeking those opportunities, but cites the experience as a league learning. \"It matters that we have the ability to compensate players. And I think that now there's enough writing on the wall, there's enough evidence, there's enough tangible information that's available that reflects what's happening in the market and the impact that it's having. And to be fair, we're not, we're not necessarily competing with other leagues, I think, outside of Women's Super League [England],  is certainly like the number one threat to the NWSL in terms of players. But we are really competing with a handful of clubs that are very, very serious about talent acquisition, and those are the clubs that we need to be able to compete with, collectively as a league,\" Carter told the media on working with cap issues.\nStill, the new Spirit president of operations remains \"cautiously optimistic\" at the attention and resources being spent on the negotiations, and that the club and the league are ultimately on the same page when it comes to retaining Rodman's talents in NWSL. She's hopeful that a solution will be reached for all parties involved.\"We owe it to ourselves to make sure that we're coming up with the solution that serves to compensate the athletes but also ensures that the league is in a good space and that's really where the innovation has to happen, right? Like, that's where we have to strike a balance. We have to walk through some pretty nuanced conversations,\" Carter stated. She also joked that she's no stranger to being critical of the league when it's warranted. But she credits the league office working with the board of governors on the urgency of negotiating a deal while working through various mechanisms and proposals. \n\"I think everybody who knows me knows that I'm very much on the train to pay the players, but I also, you know, am, again, pragmatic enough to recognize that we need to make sure that we're getting the revenue generating channels aligned and open and ready to go, so that, you know, as we're increasing spend, we're also increasing spend in the things that are going to generate us that revenue and get us that return on investment. So, it's got to be, it has to be a really holistic solution.\"As the league, club, player, and player agents are at the center of a contract impasse, Carter's presence alongside a negotiation team that includes general manager Nathan Minion could not only solve the puzzle of Rodman's future but reshape the league entirely. \n            ",

Green, who \"significantly changed his physical appearance, presumably to avoid detection,\" eventually surrendered to authorities.Boyd was shot in the abdomen early on the morning of Nov. 16 in Manhattan after an argument. Boyd was previously listed in critical but stable condition, and CBS News reported that a bullet was lodged in his lung. The cornerback was released from the hospital sometime afterwards, and even surprised his teammates at the Jets' facilities last week. On the morning in question, investigators say that a group unknown to Boyd's entourage began \"taunting\" them outside a bar and restaurant on West 38th Street. That led to an altercation, where one of the men pulled out a gun and fired two shots. \nBoyd is currently on injured reserve after he hurt his shoulder over the summer, and has not suited up for the Jets this season. He has played in 81 career games for the Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans, recording 105 tackles, three pass defenses and two forced fumbles. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Clippers have fallen far short of expectations through the first quarter of the season. They're 6-18, have the 23rd-ranked net rating in the league. They've gone just 2-8 in their last 10 games, and things came to a head last week when it was announced that the team would be parting ways with franchise legend and future Hall of Famer Chris Paul.It was a shocking move that is still difficult to fathom, as Paul's harsh criticism of the team's poor start was the reported reason for being sent home while the Clippers were preparing to play the Atlanta Hawks on the road. In the aftermath of L.A.'s decision, there was a report that said Paul and Clippers coach Ty Lue were not on speaking terms for weeks. On Tuesday, though, Lue refuted that claim.\"That ain't true,\" Lue said. \"We were talking. How's he gonna play if I'm not talking to him? There was a stretch where he wasn't going to play and be out of the rotation, it was tough for him because he's a competitor. But after that, it wasn't really much.\"\n        \n            \n                The Clippers are a mess, and there is no clear path forward to salvage the situation in L.A.\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFormer Clippers star Blake Griffin said on an NBA on Prime broadcast that Paul told him Lue and team owner Steve Ballmer have not reached out to him since the decision. Lue confirmed that to be true.\n\"Yeah, I haven't heard from him either,\" Lue said.The long-time Clippers coach also noted that he was not part of the decision to part ways with Paul. When asked about why now was the time to make this decision, Lue said, \"You've got to ask [Clippers president] Lawrence [Frank].\"The Clippers' plan forward is to work with Paul in hopes of facilitating a trade to a destination he prefers, per Jake Fischer. With the 40-year-old guard announcing in late November that he plans to retire at the conclusion of this season, it's fair to wonder if he would just call it a career right now. But Fischer is reporting that Paul is more likely than not planning on finishing out the season with another team. It's a sour way for Paul's Hall of Fame career to end, especially because he signed with the Clippers specifically to retire with the team that he experienced the most success with and led for many seasons.Now, though, that won't be happening. Finding a team willing to take on Paul may be difficult, and the veteran guard isn't simply looking for a roster spot. Paul wants to find a place where he can be a meaningful contributor, something that was not the case with the Clippers this season. He was averaging a career low in minutes, despite starting all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs a season ago. \n\n        \n            \n                The Clippers did Chris Paul dirty: 'Legendary Clipper' sent packing in the middle of the night\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's a world in which Paul could provide a young team with veteran leadership and still have a spot in the rotation, but it's a matter of which team is interested in bringing him in for the rest of the season. His strong leadership style didn't work on a Clippers team with two superstars in Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, but his words could make a positive impact on a young core still developing. Over the summer, Paul drew interest from the Dallas Mavericks, New York Knicks, Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns, per Fischer. Of that group, the Mavericks seem like a logical fit. Paul may not start every game, especially when Kyrie Irving returns, but he could provide guidance for the likes of Cooper Flagg and a young backcourt of Brandon Williams and Ryan Nembhard, the latter of whom has been a breakout star for Dallas.But that's assuming the Mavericks, or any of the above teams, are still interested in Paul. Right now, though, the Clippers are in a holding pattern until Dec. 15 when Paul is eligible to be traded. But in three games since the announcement, the Clippers have gone just 1-2. So sending home a franchise icon certainly hasn't helped things.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Barcelona's return to the Camp Nou for Champions League play for the first time in more than three years was almost spoiled by Eintracht Frankfurt in a 2-1 victory on Wednesday. A second-half brace from Jules Kounde helped Barcelona overturn a deficit and win at home, but it's also a deficit that they never should've been in, as despite having ambitions to win this competition, the defense hasn't been able to hold up, while the attack hasn't hit the highs of last season either.Previously, when a team went to the Camp Nou, it felt like a challenge that they wouldn't be able to overcome, but when players are speaking out about how they can study the offside trap, and it doesn't change and a team who allowed six goals in their last match can mark Robert Lewandowski out of a match, that mystique is gone.There are a few reasons for that, as one is the offside trap and how, if players can stay in line or play around it, Barcelona don't have a true defensive stopper to play enforcer when a counter is getting out of hand, but their play style only works when their entire attacking band is in sync. On Tuesday, it wasn't as Lewandowski only took 19 touches during the entire match, the fewest of any Barcelona starter despite playing 66 minutes. The 37-year-old took two shots, not putting any on target, and he has now failed to score or assist a goal in Champions League play despite playing in five matches. The lone match that Lewandowski didn't feature in was Barcelona's 6-1 victory over Olympiacos, which accounts for almost half of their 14 goals scored during the league phase.\nFerran Torres and Marcus Rashford have also taken turns leading the line, creating a more mobile attack, and it's something Hansi Flick will have to think about as he sets up his team moving forward. Barcelona are set to make it through the league phase as they sit 14th after six matches. They could fall to 20th, but with Slavia Prague and Copenhagen as their remaining teams, they should be comfortably through.The issue is that when Barcelona are expected to win the Champions League after making it to the semifinals last season, after six matches, they've scored 14 goals and allowed 11 goals. Facing top teams in UCL such as Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, Barcelona have failed to get results there, showing the cracks in Flick's tactics when they can't control a game from start to finish. They've struggled with big teams and even ones they'd be expected to top easily. Frankfurt had a chance of going in that direction, but Marcus Rashford and Kounde had to save them from allowing one of the easiest counters that you'll see. Nathaniel Brown played a ball that the Barcelona defenders couldn't get to, and Ansgar Knauff slotted it home. \nFrankfurt have been far from defensive stalwarts as of late, which is where concern sinks in. If Barcelona can't take care of these teams with ease, how can they expect to push past teams in the knockout phase? It's easier to change the attacking personnel than it is to sign defenders, so this may be the time to begin looking into what life may be without Lewandowski leading the line.\n            ",

Two weeks later, the Clippers announced they were waiving Paul in a shocking move that Paul learned about in the middle of the night while the team was on a road trip in Atlanta. In the week since, we've gotten tons of reports with sourcing on both sides of the situation about what went down, including an alleged rift between Paul and Clippers coach Ty Lue -- who refuted reports that he wasn't on speaking terms with Paul by the end of his second tenure in L.A. The one person we hadn't heard from yet was Paul himself -- aside from his Instagram post at 2:40 a.m. in Atlanta the night he found out he was being sent home. That changed on Tuesday when People ran a brief interview with the future Hall of Famer, who wasn't interested in fanning the flames surrounding his sudden departure from the struggling Clippers. \"I'm actually at peace with everything,\" Paul said. \"More than anything, I'm excited about being around and getting a chance to play a small role in whatever anything looks like next.\"\nPaul is still looking for a more fitting way to end his illustrious career than what happened with the Clippers, but in the meantime he's embracing the rare opportunity to be home for a bit during the season -- including the chance to watch his son play for the first time later this week. \"I have never seen my son play a game in person,\" he said. \"Not a middle school game, not a high school game. So I'm excited about seeing him play.\"\nPaul planned on having that time at home with the family next year once he is officially retired, but is getting a sneak peek at what that retired life will be like while he searches for a potential final destination on a legendary NBA journey. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Wether it's the Broncos, Patriots, Rams, Seahawks or any other NFL contender, one thing is for sure -- the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer earlier this season, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game next February.The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 10 Grammy nominations, with three wins. His three Grammy wins are for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.\nBad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" Usually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. \nBut the day's festivities begin long before halftime. Multiple artists will perform ahead of the game, including Grammy-nominated singer Charlie Puth, 11x Grammy-winning artist Brandi Carlile and Grammy-winning R&B artist Coco Jones.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\"\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC.

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.                      The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.                      By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                     \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.                      Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                          \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

    "body": "\n        Milan -- The game is over, and Liverpool won 1-0 against Inter in Milan thanks to a controversial penalty, but the away end was only singing one name: Arne Slot. Normally, that wouldn't seem unusual, but given what has happened in recent days, it feels more significant than ever. It's clear the fans have made their stance known. It was an intense weekend for Liverpool manager Slot, who had to face the frustration of one of the most influential players in the recent history of the English giants going against the Dutch manager and the club. Mo Salah, one of the biggest stars of the team, went public after Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday and spoke openly about this moment.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame. I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club,\" he said. Since the bombshell interview became viral, many things happened. Salah wasn't included in the Liverpool squad traveling to Milan where the Reds faced Inter on Tuesday at the San Siro, a decision that was agreed by Slot and the club, while the manager seemed annoyed but also clear in his words when he was asked his opinion on the matter ahead of Tuesday's match.\"I have no clue if he played his last match with Liverpool. I am a firm believer there is always a possibility for a player to return. But if he has the right to share it with the media, then we have to react with it. So he's out,\" Slot said.\nOn Tuesday morning, few hours before kickoff of such an important match for the Reds that are not facing their best moment, Salah posted on his social media a picture of him training alone at the club, and a few minutes before the Liverpool match started, the CBS Sports crew spoke on the matter, with Thierry Henry believing he made a mistake.\"When I was at Barcelona, I went away with the team. They put me in the stands. Did you hear me talking about it? No … We won the treble the year before but I wasn't performing so if you're not performing, you put yourself in the situation where you leave the door open for someone to [get] in. I traveled, we arrived at the stadium, I'm in the stands. Am I going to make a fuss about it? Am I going to make it about myself? Am I going to talk to the press after? I have achieved stuff in the game but team first. If I had to say something – and by the way, I said it. I said it to [manager] Pep [Guardiola], what I thought about what was happening, but not publicly,\" he said. The game was pretty even, and Liverpool showed they are still in control of their future, even if they didn't play their best game, especially for how the penalty was awarded for a weak foul of Alessandro Bastoni on Florian Wirtz. But what emerged from the match at San Siro was how the fans reacted and chanted the name of Slot twice, once before and once right after Tuesday's win after the final whistle.\nSalah will travel for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18, when the winter transfer window will be open. His future is in doubt and we don't really know what will happen in the coming weeks, but for sure Liverpool fans know where they stand and this time they have decided to take the side of Slot, the Dutch manager who won the Premier League in first season at the club and replaced club icon Jurgen Klopp in the summer of 2024. That may feel ages ago, but after a rough beginning to the season, perhaps this is the start of a new chapter.\n            ",

Congratulations. Now, the age-old question must be answered: Do you start the guys who got you here or play the matchups and the projections? Nowhere is that question more polarized than in the case of Jacoby Brissett.Brissett has made eight starts this season, and he has scored at least 20 Fantasy points in each. In seven of those eight starts, he has scored at least 23 Fantasy points. Since Week 6 only Josh Allen, Matthew Stafford, and Drake Maye have outscored him. Brissett has thrown 40 passes in six of those starts and thrown two touchdown passes in seven of them. He's also added a cool 2.5 points per game with his rushing. In other words, he seems like a bulletproof QB1. Enter the Houston Texans.The Texans have given up a league-low 12.23 Fantasy points per game to opposing QBs. They just held Patrick Mahomes to five. Josh Allen scored eight two weeks ago. Only three QBs have scored 20 Fantasy points against them all season and none have scored more than 23. While Brissett has produced against the Seahawks, Paackers, and Rams, none of them have been at the Texans level of shutting down opposing QBs.This may seem like a draw, and if it is, we may have gotten the tiebreaker. Star tackle Paris Johnson has a sprained MCL and is week to week. If he is out against this pass rush, it gets easier to justify sitting Brissett. There are two QBs available on the waiver wire that I would start over Brissett. Of course you may have to fight the Daniel Jones manager over them. More on those players below. Let's get to the rest of the Week 15 preview:\n\n        Week 15 QB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            12.62 -- The Chargers are the only defense within a point of the Texans in terms of preventing Fantasy points. They face Patrick Mahomes this week.7.5 -- Shedeur Sanders' 7.4 yards per pass attempt leads all rookie QBs.405 -- Patrick Mahomes leads all QBs with 405 scramble yards.49.0 -- Since Week 6 Jacoby Brissett leads the NFL with 49 drop backs per game. Joe Burrow is second at 43.4 -- Jaxson Dart had a season-low four rush attempts in Week 13. We'll be watching to see if that is a blip or a trend.8.1% -- Matthew Stafford leads the NFL with an 8.1% TD rate. That should signal regression, but maybe not since he also leads the league in red zone pass attempts and pass attempts inside the 10.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB

      \n                As of Tuesday, we are not expecting Jayden Daniels to play in Week 15. If he doesn't, Marcus Mariota is the clear top streamer. He has topped 20 Fantasy points in two of his last three starts, has Terry McLaurin back, and still has rushing ability to boost his floor and his upside. The Giants have given up the third-most Fantasy points to opposing QBs. The last four QBs they have faced have topped 20 Fantasy points and eight QBs in a row have scored 19 or more against them.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -9.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                58%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2181\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    194\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    16.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Stroud's play has been better than his Fantasy production but he is at home against Arizona and I think he has a good chance to get you to 19 or 20 Fantasy points. I would not start him over Brissett, but he's an excellent Daniel Jones replacement. I would start him against Bo Nix, who faces the Packers.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    DFS Plays\n                \n                    \n            Top DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAR\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

He is at home against a Lions defense that is better against the run than the pass. This game has an over/under of 54.5 and the Lions have an implied total of 30. He's the fifth highest priced QB on FanDuel, $1,000 cheaper than QB1 Josh Allen. I would not be surprised at all if Stafford outscores him.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 15 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        MLB's fourth amateur Draft Lottery will take place Tuesday night at the Winter Meetings in Orlando. MLB and the MLB Players Association agreed to the lottery as part of the current collective bargaining agreement in an effort to curb tanking and anti-competitive behavior in general. The top six picks are now awarded through the lottery. The Nationals won the Draft Lottery last offseason and received the No. 1 pick in the 2025 Draft despite finishing with the league's sixth-worst record. Washington took shortstop Eli Willits with the No. 1 pick. The Mariners also won big when they moved up from the No. 14 pick to the No. 3 pick. The 121-loss White Sox got bumped back to the No. 10 pick for revenue sharing reasons, which we'll explain in a moment. 2026 MLB Draft Lottery streaming info Date: Tuesday, Dec. 9 | Time: 5:30 p.m. ET TV channel: MLB Network | Live stream: Fubo (try for free) The lottery itself will be held at approximately 4 p.m. ET. The results will then be announced on MLB Network a little later. Here now is everything you need to know going into Tuesday's Draft Lottery.\n Odds for No. 1 pick The 18 non-postseason teams in 2025 each have a chance at the No. 1 selection in the 2026 Draft through the lottery, though the worst teams have the best odds.

That's why the Rangers (78-84 in 2024) have better 2026 Draft Lottery odds than the Giants (80-82 in 2024) even though the two clubs finished with identical 81-81 records in 2025.Why are the Rockies not eligible? Despite going 43-119 this past season, baseball's worst record by 17 games, the Rockies are not eligible for a lottery pick in next year's draft. That's because teams cannot pick in the lottery in more than two consecutive years and Colorado had the No. 3 pick in 2024 and the No. 4 pick in 2025. That bumps them out of the lottery in 2026. The earliest the Rockies can pick is No. 10 overall.Why are the Angels and Nationals not eligible?Teams that pay into the league's revenue-sharing program cannot hold lottery picks in consecutive years. The Nationals (No. 1 pick in 2025) and the Angels (No. 2 pick in 2025) both fall into this bucket. They pay revenue sharing, so last year's lottery picks bump them out of this year's lottery. Like the Rockies, the Angels and Nationals cannot pick any earlier than No. 10 overall. This rule is why the White Sox were ineligible for the 2025 Draft Lottery despite losing 121 games in 2024. They pay revenue sharing and had the No. 5 pick in 2024.The rest of the first round Previously, the Draft order was set by the reverse order of the previous year's standings. It was nice and easy. Now the top six picks are determined through the lottery, the remaining 12 non-postseason teams then pick in reverse order of the standings (picks 7-18), and the 12 postseason teams pick in order of their finish (picks 19-30).  Furthermore, within each \"tier\" of postseason finish, those teams pick in reverse order of the standings, with teams that receive revenue sharing picking before teams that pay into revenue sharing. Got it? Good. Here is the order for the No. 19-30 picks: Wild Card Series losers19. Reds (83-79, receive revenue sharing)20. Guardians (88-74, receive revenue sharing)21. Red Sox (89-73, pay revenue sharing)22. Padres (90-72, pay revenue sharing)Division Series losers23. Tigers (87-75, receive revenue sharing)24. Cubs (92-70, pay revenue sharing)25. Yankees (94-68, pay revenue sharing)26. Phillies (96-66, pay revenue sharing)Championship Series losers 27. Mariners (90-72, receive revenue sharing) 28. Brewers (97-65, receive revenue sharing) World Series loser 29. Blue Jays (94-68) World Series winner 30. Dodgers (93-69) This order is not final. The Dodgers, Mets, and Yankees will all have their first-round pick moved back 10 spots because of their competitive balance tax (CBT) status. Teams that exceed the third CBT threshold ($281 million in 2025) have their first rounder pushed back 10 spots. The Yankees and Dodgers will get bumped back from Nos. 25 and 30 to Nos. 35 and 40, respectively. We don't know where the Mets will pick yet because they're eligible for the lottery. Lottery picks are not subject to CBT penalties. If the Mets move into the top six picks in the lottery, the penalty will be applied to their second-round pick, and that will be moved back instead. New York keeps a lottery pick. Otherwise their first rounder moves back 10 spots. The rest of the draft Only the first round is set using the Lottery. The order of rounds 2-20 is the reverse order of this year's standings, so the MLB-worst Rockies will have the first pick of the second round regardless of how the lottery shakes out. There are also free-agent compensation and competitive balance round picks scattered throughout the draft. Those additional picks will be determined throughout the offseason. Tuesday's lottery will set the first-round order. Everything after that is TBD as the offseason plays out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    OF/DH Kyle Schwarber, free agentSchwarber, one of the game's most productive hitters, hasn't yet chosen which team he'll suit up for during the coming regular season. He has, however, declared that he'll play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. Schwarber has averaged a 135 OPS+ with 47 home runs per season over the last three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Will Smith, DodgersSmith, fresh off winning a second World Series title in a row, will be in the squat for Team USA as he pursues an international championship to add to his collection. Smith has developed into one of the best backstops in baseball and over the past three seasons has amassed a 125 OPS+ and 12 Wins Above Replacement.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    INF Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson will be making his first WBC appearance after blossoming into a star with the Orioles in recent years. Over the course of his first four seasons in the majors, he's compiled a 134 OPS+ and more than 21 Wins Above Replacement. His experience at shortstop and third base could come in handy, depending on the rest of the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2B Brice Turang, BrewersTurang is fresh off a breakout season with the Brewers that saw him post new career highs in home runs (18) and WAR (5.6).

He threw 61 ⅓ innings with a 2.35 ERA in 2025, and struck out 33.7% of the batters he faced. That was a top-15 mark among relievers, and fourth highest among lefties. Cleavinger held same-side hitters to a .187 batting average and .274 on-base percentage this past season, his sixth in the majors and fourth with Tampa.\n            ",

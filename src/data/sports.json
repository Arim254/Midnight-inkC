    "body": "\n        The 2025 NBA Cup quarterfinals came to a close on Wednesday with the Western Conference half of the bracket. As expected, the Oklahoma City Thunder made easy work of the Phoenix Suns to improve to 24-1 on the season and tie the best 25-game start in league history. Later on, the San Antonio Spurs put together a brilliant offensive display to upset the Los Angeles Lakers. On the Eastern Conference side of the bracket on Tuesday, the Orlando Magic came back from a 15-0 deficit to defeat their in-state rivals, the Miami Heat, while the surging New York Knicks used a dominant second quarter to race past the Toronto Raptors and win for the eighth time in their last nine games. The semifinals of the NBA Cup are set for Saturday in Las Vegas:Knicks vs. Magic, 5:30 p.m. ET -- Amazon PrimeSpurs vs. Thunder, 9 p.m. ET -- Amazon PrimeBefore the Cup action resumes, here's a look at the winners and losers from the quarterfinals:Loser: Anyone in the Thunder's wayThe Thunder are the defending champs and were 23-1 entering Wednesday night, so there was no confusion about their status as the league's best team. Still, their destruction of the Suns had to be demoralizing for the other 29 teams, and particularly those hoping to challenge for the title. \nThis was the first time the Thunder have had anything at stake in a single game since Game 7 of the Finals, and if this is what it looks like when they actually step on the gas, good luck to everyone else. Sure, the Suns were shorthanded, but the gap between the Thunder and the next best teams looks bigger than ever. The Thunder have now won a franchise record 16 games in a row, and their 24-1 start is tied for the best in NBA history with the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors. Their 49-point win on Wednesday was the biggest margin of victory in the league this season and was their fifth win already by 30-plus points (the record in a season is 10). If you want more proof of their dominance, check out this stat, courtesy of Ben Golliver:\nWinner: Stephon CastleStephon Castle was the near-unanimous Rookie of the Year last season, but was dismissed in some corners as simply the best of a bunch of bad options. But while his class may not go down as an all-timer, Castle has proven this season that he was no charity case. His effort on Wednesday night to lead the Spurs to the semifinals was his latest piece of evidence. Castle, who only recently returned from a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for over three weeks, finished with a season-high 30 points, 10 rebounds and six assists on 10-of-14 shooting from the field, including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He was all over the place on both sides of the ball, and joined Tim Duncan and Victor Wembanyama as the only Spurs players to have a 30/10/5 game at age 21 or younger. Wembanyama and No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper rightfully receive so much attention, but Castle's performance against the Lakers was a strong reminder that he's a big piece of the Spurs' future, too. \nLoser: The Lakers' defenseThe Lakers entered Wednesday night's quarterfinal with the 21st-ranked defense in the league (116.2 defensive rating). That number is only going to look worse after their no-show against the Spurs. The Spurs poured in 39 points in the first quarter and never looked back. They crossed the 30-point mark in each of the first three quarters -- they \"only\" managed 28 in the fourth -- and put up 132 points for their fourth-highest scoring game of the season. San Antonio shot 50% from the field, made 17 3-pointers, got to the line for 36 free throws (they made 29) and only turned the ball over 10 times. All night long, the Spurs were able to do whatever they wanted. There was little resistance from the Lakers' perimeter players on their drives, and even less when they got out in transition. They scored 27 fastbreak points, including two late in the first half on a notable possession where Harrison Barnes got an uncontested dunk because the Lakers stopped playing for some reason. \nThe Lakers have an incredible offense, and as long as Luka Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves are all healthy, they're going to win a lot of games. But to ultimately compete for the Western Conference crown, they'll have to figure out a way to get stops. It's worth noting that they're the only team in the bottom-third of the league in defensive rating with a winning record. Winner: The KnicksThe Knicks have largely flown under the radar this season -- in part because they got off to a lackluster start, but largely because there have been other more interesting stories. Over the last few weeks, however, the Knicks have started to round into form. \n        \n            \n                Knicks, Jalen Brunson issue reminder to East as they surge into NBA Cup semifinals\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThey've won eight of their last nine games to improve to 17-7 and move within two games of the Detroit Pistons for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Tuesday's big win over the Raptors was a reminder of why they're currently the Eastern Conference favorites (+270, per Caesars) despite being in second place in the standings. \nThe semifinals in Las Vegas will be a chance for the Knicks to take center stage for perhaps the first time all season and ensure they're overlooked no more. And, while the NBA Cup is obviously nowhere near as important as the Finals, the competition offers a franchise that has been starved for success an opportunity to lift a trophy. Winner: Desmond BaneThe Magic gave up Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, a 2025 first-round pick (Yang Hansen), three unprotected first-round picks (2026, 2028, 2030) and a 2029 first-round pick swap (top-two protected) to acquire Desmond Bane from the Memphis Grizzlies during the offseason. That was a massive price to pay, especially for a non-superstar, and when Bane and the Magic got off to a rough start this season, Grizzlies fans were doing victory laps. As it turned out, Bane just needed some time to acclimate to a new city and teammates. \nBane's been very good for a few weeks now, but it had to feel good for him to have a big night in a showcase game in front of a national audience. No better way to remind everyone that you're a borderline All-Star than by pouring in 37 points (14 of 24 from the field, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range) and chipping in six rebounds and five assists in a comeback win.  During the Magic's 8-3 hot streak, Bane is averaging a team-high 22.2 points on 46/38.7/96 shooting splits, 4.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Loser: Grayson AllenGrayson Allen got off to an incredible start for the Suns this season, but has struggled since returning from a quad injury that sidelined him for just over two weeks. He did not get back on track Wednesday. \nNot only did Allen finish with just 10 points on 3 of 9 from the field in the Suns' 49-point loss (the worst defeat in team history), he was ejected in the third quarter after chucking Chet Holmgren to the ground. \nThe play was reviewed and upgraded to a Flagrant 2, which, to be fair to Allen, seemed a bit harsh. Even so, it was a completely unnecessary moment that will only further tarnish Allen's reputation. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Oklahoma City Thunder and pre-Kevin Durant Golden State Warriors share a number of similarities.The superstar point guard who won his first MVP, and first title, two years after his first All-Star selection.The shooting-guard wingman who became the second All-Star (Klay Thompson and Jalen Williams).The dominant defense built on like-sized switchers and the pressure they provide.The hidden gem in Draymond Green (drafted in second round) and Lu Dort (undrafted).The defensive-ace acquisition (Andre Iguodala and Alex Caruso).The first-time head coach.Those Warriors felt the cynicism surrounding their first championship. They heard the critics pointing to the opponent injury luck they'd enjoyed along their postseason path. Nobody called it outright luck. But to say that team was universally accepted as the best in the league would be a lie. People pointed to the 2-1 hole in which those Warriors found themselves against Memphis in the second round, and the fact that Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined to play one game in the Finals, as evidence that they weren't actually as dominant as they'd been made out to be. The Warriors heard it all, and used it as fuel to bombard the league the following season to the tune of a 24-1 start en route to an NBA-record 73 wins in the 2015-16 season.It's the same deal for these Thunder, who had their dominance questioned after needing seven games to squeak past the Nuggets in the second round before being on the right side of Tyrese Haliburton's blown Achilles in Game 7 of the Finals. Were the Thunder actually the best team? \nYes, they were. And like those Warriors, they have used the stage of this season to drive that point home. No championship hangover. No mercy. Their most victim was the Suns, who took a 49-point thrashing (Phoenix's most-lopsided loss in team history) in the NBA Cup quarterfinals Wednesday night, which ran OKC's record to ...24-1. These Thunder have virtually mirrored those Warriors at every turn, and it begs the question: Is Golden State's 73-win record in jeopardy? Yes, it is. Personally, I'd go so far as to say I'll be surprised if the Thunder don't break the record. The odds don't agree. Caesars currently has the over 73.5 wins mark for these Thunder at +325, and the under at -500, which makes sense as we're talking about a win total that has never been reached. Things happen. Players get hurt. Schedule losses show up. \nI get all that, and I'm still saying I'll be surprised if Oklahoma City doesn't win 74 games. This is a team that entered Wednesday demolishing its opponents by 15.9 points per 100 possessions, which would shatter the current NBA record. And that was before they beat Phoenix by 49. Injuries are the obvious X-factor, but ask yourself who's going to get hurt that's going to upend Oklahoma City's attack? Jalen Williams is the second-best player on the team, and they started the season 18-1 with him in street clothes. Even the one loss never should've happened as it required the Thunder blowing a 22-point lead to the Blazers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the MVP of the league for crying out loud, and on paper the Thunder don't even need him to bury you alive. Seriously, the Thunder are carving opponents up by 16.2 points per 100 possessions when SGA's not on the floor, per CTG, which is a number no logical mind can wrap itself around. \nSpeaking of insane numbers, the Thunder have now outscored their opponents by 439 points this season. That's the highest point differential in history through 25 games by an almost laughable margin. TEAMSEASONPOINT DIFFERENTIALOklahoma City Thunder2025-26+439Boston Celtics1967-68+380Golden State Warriors2017-18+375Milwaukee Bucks1972-73+367New York Knicks1970-71+358Last season the Thunder outscored opponents by 12.9 points per 100 possessions, which was the best net rating in history. This season they are annihilating their own record with an utterly absurd +17.5 through 25 games. As noted in Michael Pina's recent piece for The Ringer, Oklahoma City entered play on Wednesday having played 18% of its minutes this season with at least a 20-point lead. On Wednesday the Thunder had their first 20-point lead less than a minute into the second quarter and they played the entire second half leading by at least 26. So often are the Thunder blowing the doors off their opponents that Gilgeous-Alexander has only had to play the fourth quarter in 12 of his 24 games so far, and yet he still leads the league in total clutch points. There's no hole to potentially exploit here. No single player, not even SGA, dominates the ball, so OKC isn't susceptible to its superstar having an off night, if he ever plans on actually having one of those. He's scored at least 30 points in 19 of his 24 games this year, and dating back to last regular season SGA has scored at least 20 points in 97 straight games. The guy is averaging nearly a point per minute. That's Wilt territory (and Giannis, who's actually averaging 0.99 points per minute this season, per NBA.com). \nTo have arguably the best offensive player in the world paired with the best defense in history is like putting prime Aaron Rodgers on the 2000 Ravens. That's what we're talking about with the Thunder, who have so many \"next guys up\" than it literally doesn't matter who goes down. At the very least, even if everyone goes cold on the same night, the defense -- which is currently operating at a rating some 12 points above the league average, by far the largest gap in league history, per PBP Stats -- is on every night. To call this defense a machine, even a monster, is an understatement. Words don't exist for this kind of pressure. And by the way, that idea I floated about the whole offense going cold on the same night is basically just a theory posited for the sake of argument. It's not going to happen. OKC ranks third in field-goal percentage. Fifth in 3-point percentage. They create more turnovers than any defense in the league but basically never cough it up themselves (only the Celtics have a lower offensive turnover rate). Look back at those early Warriors teams. You could at least have the hope of catching them on a sloppy turnover night, or perhaps you could beat them with size. It almost never happened because they would shoot their way out of every mistake. but this Thunder team? They hardly make mistakes in the first place. Think about how many things have to go wrong for them to lose even one game. For starters, the opponent has to play brilliantly. Then, on top of that, the Thunder have to shoot poorly, which they almost never do, or have SGA put up an average night, which he never does and which also doesn't even matter because they murder you even when he isn't playing at all, or have the defense play poorly (hilarious), or have about five players hurt at the same time because two or three doesn't even dent their depth. And that's just to lose one game. The Thunder can lose eight in total, seven more, and still break Golden State's 73-win record. Now ask yourself, how likely is it that all this stuff happens seven more times? No, you can't account for the unforeseeable. A ball bouncing the wrong way. A back-to-back letdown. A big blown lead. It's going to happen. It already did once against the Blazers. But that was like lightning striking, and lightning doesn't strike seven times. I think this record is going down. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers will host the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday Night Football, and these two NFC South rivals have each won 32 games over 64 all-time meetings. Bucky Irving might have only had 18 touches for 45 scrimmage yards when these two teams met in Week 1, but he scored a touchdown that helped the Buccaneers pull off a 23-20 win. He's scored in each of his two games since returning from a lengthy injury absence too, but he's still priced at +115 in the Buccaneers vs. Falcons anytime TD scorer odds from DraftKings. That recent penchant for the endzone is why we're including him among our top anytime touchdown scorer picks on TNF.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 15. With NFL props available for almost every player in Falcons vs. Buccaneers at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Tampa Bay vs. Atlanta NFL picks. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Buccaneers vs. Falcons.Best Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Bucky Irving, Buccaneers (+115)Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+130)David Sills V, Falcons (+475)\nBucky Irving, Buccaneers (+115)Irving was a fourth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, and he began his career playing behind Rachaad White, who had racked up over 1,500 scrimmage yards and nine touchdowns the season prior. However, that didn't stop Irving from earning himself a starring role in Tampa Bay's offense by midseason, and he finished with 1,122 rushing yards and eight touchdowns in his rookie season. He began his sophomore season as Tampa Bay's clear-cut top option, but foot and shoulder injuries sidelined him for two months. However, Irving has scored twice in two weeks since returning to action despite being on a snap count, and the model predicts that he scores 0.65 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 46.5% chance to score.\nEmeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+130)Egbuka was the early-season frontrunner for NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, but a dry spell during a period of struggle for Tampa Bay has him down to fourth-favorite at +650 on DraftKings. He hasn't reached the endzone in a month for the Buccaneers, but he did burst onto the scene with four catches for 67 yards and two touchdowns in his NFL debut against the Falcons. Atlanta's 21 passing touchdowns allowed are the 19th-most in the NFL this season, and the model predicts Egbuka scores 0.57 touchdowns against odds that imply a 43.5% chance to score.\nDavid Sills V, Falcons (+475)You might remember Sills as the seventh-grader who committed to Lane Kiffin at USC back in 2010, but he actually signed with West Virginia several years later and transitioned to wide receiver. Now the 29-year-old has carved out a role for himself on the Falcons, scoring in two of the last three weeks and playing a season-high 93.8% of the offensive snaps in last week's loss to the Seahawks. With Drake London listed as day-to-day with a knee injury on a short week, the model sees value in this price for Sills. It currently has him projected for 0.19 touchdowns on average with London playing, and these odds imply a 17.4% chance to score, but the prospects get even better if Atlanta's top receiver is ruled out.\nWant more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Falcons vs. Buccaneers.

    "body": "\n        The inaugural league phase of the 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League is nearly over, and it has delivered on its promise of elevated stakes matches through expanded competition. After Matchday 5, the knockout playoff picture is coming into view, and traditional powerhouses are making statements along the way, while other clubs are hopeful to make tournament history.The penultimate round of the league phase was capped off by stellar individual performances. Serie A side Juventus secured qualification with a statement, 5-0, win against St. Polten, with captain Cristiana Girelli leading the charge by converting two penalties. Reigning title holders Arsenal are quietly making their return to the knockout rounds thanks to the help of Beth Mead. She delivered the lone goal against Twente and secured the defending champions' place in the next phase.As the tournament league phase reaches its end, there are still loose ends that need to be tied. While the quarterfinals and playoff puzzle still have some pieces missing, anything can happen with hope for plenty of teams as the new format heads to matchday six. Here's everything you need to know from matchday five:UWCL ScoresTuesday's resultsSt. Pölten 0, Juventus 5Real Madrid 2, VfL Wolfsburg 0Arsenal 1, FC Twente 0Paris Saint-Germain 0, OH Leuven Women 0 Wednesday's resultsChelsea FC 6, Roma, 0FC Barcelona 3, SL Benfica 1 OL Lyonnes 3, Manchester United 0Atlético Madrid 2, Bayern München 2Paris FC 1, Vålerenga 0UWCL TablePositionTeamMPWDLGDPts1FC Barcelona5410+15132OL Lyonnais5410+9133Chelsea FC5320+16114Juventus5311+6105Real Madrid5311+6106Bayern Munich5311-3107VfL Wolfsburg5302+498Arsenal 5302+299Manchester United 5302-3910Paris FC5221-1811Atlético Madrid5212+8712Oud-Heverlee Leuven5131-2613Vålerenga Oslo5113-2414FC Twente Enschede5023-6215SL Benfica Lisbon5014-7116Paris Saint-Germain5014-8117AS Roma5014-15118SKN St. Pölten5014-201FC Barcelona and OL Lyonnes top teams in the huntTwo teams sealed their place directly in the quarterfinal round in FC Barcelona and OL Lyonnes. The two squads have flexed their Champions League muscles over the previous matchdays and showed other tournament opposition exactly who they are.\nThe Catalonian side had to manage an injury blow as they'll now be without Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati for the next five months due to a broken left fibula. The group rose to the occasion with plenty of key players stepping up. Alexia Putellas missed her second penalty of the league phase, but the midfielder still led the squad in total shots (eight), and Caroline Graham Hansen showed once again why she'll still be a contender for end-of-season awards. The Blaugrana won't slow down ahead of the quarterfinals.Champions League icons OL Lyonnes are doing everything they can to not only rival Barcelona and make their own individual statements along the way. Haitian international Melchie Dumornay officially enters the Ballon d'Or chatter after a spectacular run of form in the tournament. She opened the league phase with a brace against Arsenal and added another to her resume against Manchester United to help the French giants return to the quarterfinals. \nThe Liga F showcaseReal Madrid and Atletico Madrid look primed for the next phase of the Champions League. While there's plenty of attention on FC Barcelona for their talent and history of success, other Liga F clubs are playing like they have something to prove this tournament. Real Madrid's progression was crafted by an electric performance by Colombian international Linda Caicedo. She covered plenty of ground and was often the creative channel for the Madristas throughout their 2-0 win against Wolfsburg; her insurance goal and three shots on target earned her player of the game honors. Atletico Madrid kept their knockout playoff phase dreams alive with a thrilling come-from-behind win against Bayern Munich. The squad stole all of Bayern's momentum, and Flamma Benitez channeled it into an equalizer. \nPSG embarassing exitThe flip side of the league phase coming to a close is that some Champions League journeys come to an end. The most seismic elimination belongs to Paris Saint-Germain. Once perennial contenders, the former French titans were bounced from the competition after failing to win any of their five league phase games. Despite a hard-fought draw against tournament debutants OH Leuven, it wasn't enough to keep their Champions League campaign alive.They are joined by the Netherlands FC Twente, and Austria's SKN St. Polten, and all three teams will officially say farewell after Matchday 6.Next roundThe final games will be a seeding scenario with plenty of quarterfinal spots and knockout phase playoff places up for grabs. The final round of the league phase will conclude on Dec. 17 with all nine matches kicking off at the same time.\n            ",

His dad, Rick Minter, was a head coach at Cincinnati for a decade and coached college football most of Jesse Minter's life, so he's familiar with the grind.\" See more candidates at TheMichiganInsider.\nHow to get insider Michigan coaching search updates The rest of the list includes several other exciting possibilities, including a coach who is in the College Football Playoff field.

    "body": "\n        The UEFA Champions League's 2025 slate is complete and as the new year approaches, a handful of teams enter Europe's winter break in good standing. Some have already booked a spot in the knockout stages and look certain to clinch top-eight finishes when the competition returns, while others have punched above their weight to dream about a direct berth to the round of 16 come January.Six games into the Champions League season, a few have even begun to build their case as title contenders. The list feels like a somewhat familiar one – last season's semifinalists Arsenal sit atop the league phase table, followed by perennial contenders Bayern Munich and reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. Previous champions Manchester City, Inter and Real Madrid also crack the top eight and remain the frontrunners for direct passageway to the round of 16, their trophy credentials still quick to spot no matter the ebbs and flows of their campaign so far.It forces the question ahead of the business end of the Champions League season: which ones of these teams are the real deal, and which ones are merely filling in the blank space on the bracket?Champions League tableWDLGFGAGDPTS1.

Kairat015415-111In need of a turnaroundLiverpool (9th), Chelsea (13th), Barcelona (15th)The good news for these teams is that they are still more likely to participate in the knockout rounds than not, while Liverpool can take more confidence from the fact that they are only out of the top eight on tiebreakers. Never say never on a run to the May 30 final at Budapest's Puskas Arena – PSG, after all, went on to win last season's competition despite finishing 15th in the league phase – but it is hard to deny that they each have genuine room for improvement. The Reds, quite simply, have been all over the place this season and should prioritize consistency above all else, while Chelsea's sputtering attack will likely keep them from a trophy lift in the Champions League this season. Barcelona have so far had the most notable fall from grace – they went to the semifinals last season and were well and truly a contender during that run but their defense has been remarkably porous, costing them time and time again. That does not feel like an easy fix, either, between manager Hansi Flick's stylistic choices and the quality of the players at his disposal.\nPretendersAtalanta (5th), Inter (6th), Atletico Madrid (8th)Each of these teams deserves credit for a consistency that has allowed them to rise to the top eight places with two games to go, many of them likely to reach the knockouts with few complications. From there, though, they may have to rely on the luck of the draw – Atalanta's most impressive result of the Champions League season was against an unimpressive Chelsea, which only means so much in terms of a title run. Inter and Atletico Madrid have more star power to speak of but it's unclear if they have enough talent to go all the way.ContendersArsenal (1st), Bayern Munich (2nd), Paris Saint-Germain (3rd), Manchester City (4th), Real Madrid (7th)Admittedly, this is an overly long list but it is hard to rule out any of these teams with so much time left on the clock – and with last season's competition still top of mind. Granted, some of these teams are more realistic contenders than others. Arsenal are the easiest answer to any question about who might win the Champions League next spring, both as the only perfect team left in the competition and as a group with a cohesive idea and a deep squad. Bayern Munich are slowly but surely proving themselves as Europe's elites with a defense-first strategy, while Paris Saint-Germain should still be a contender if they have a majority of their stars around. Manchester City can be iffy but even as Pep Guardiola mounts another rebuild, they manage to win more often than not and just might be able to make a run if things click.\nReal Madrid may be a head-scratcher on this list, but there were elements of their performance in their 2-1 loss to City that offered some encouragement. There is a huge asterisk on this pick, considering it would require Madrid to actually stay on the right track, which is much easier said than done at a club as volatile as that one. Xabi Alonso's intense, high-press approach allowed them to stay competitive against City – and just might be a winning strategy in the long run, too.\n            ",

Moore, who was fired for cause for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member, was detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for \"an investigation into potential charges,\" the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN. \"The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"According to a statement from the Pittsfield Police Department, officers responded to a location at 4:10 p.m. Wednesday \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault.\" A suspect in the case \"was taken into custody\" and \"this incident does not appear to be random in nature,\" the statement says. An investigation is ongoing and no charges have been formally filed. Moore was not named in the statement. \"This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community. The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement says. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing.

He finished 16-8 (11-6 Big Ten) in his two seasons with the program. Moore had been on Michigan's staff since the 2018, when he was hired as the tight ends coach. He ascended to offensive coordinator before succeeding Harbaugh. Moore had a buyout of around $14 million, but because he was fired for cause, Michigan may be off the hook for nearly all of it. \nMichigan went 9-3 this season and is slated to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood. He acknowledged that \"there's just a lot of things going on right now\" during a subdued press conference that also included him sharing new perspective following his most recent injury. \"It certainly doesn't change my desire to win,\" said Burrow, who is preparing for his third game after missing nine weeks with turf toe. \"You know, if I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.\" Burrow, on the heels of a tough road loss to the Buffalo Bills, was asked if it's hard to have fun given his injury and the Bengals' 4-9 record. \"Certainly,\" he said with Sunday's home game with the Baltimore Ravens looming. \nWhen healthy, Burrow has been one of the NFL's best quarterbacks since he entered the league in 2020. But health has largely eluded him to this point in his career. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA knee injury sidelined him for the second half of his rookie season. Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl the following year, but he sustained an MCL sprain during Cincinnati's Super Bowl loss to the Los Angeles Rams. After rehabbing that injury during the offseason, Burrow missed a significant portion of training camp after he had an emergency appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. A year later, Burrow missed a little over a month after injuring his calf during the first day of training camp. \nDuring the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery. He returned in 2024 and led the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns en route to winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time. \"It's certainly something you have to think about,\" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury. \"That's that's life as a professional athlete, no different than basketball and MMA, baseball. It's what we chose. [We] make a lot of sacrifices, and your body is often one of them.\" \nGiven all of his injuries, it's easy to see why Burrow has decided to put more of an emphasis on enjoying himself for as long as he continues playing. \n\"It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,\" he said. \"I think I've been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body. So, just trying to have fun doing it.\" Burrow is often compared to Andrew Luck, the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback and No. 1 pick who retired at 29 after injuries had diminished his desire to continue playing. And while Burrow's comments will undoubtedly conjure up more Luck comparisons, he didn't say anything on Wednesday that would suggest that he is planning to hang up his cleats anytime soon. Burrow, who is under contract through the 2029 season, is likely frustrated with his team's current situation. Burrow underwent a grueling rehabilitation process in order to make it back from his toe injury sooner than most people expected. He was hoping that the Bengals would win enough games without him so they could go on a legitimate playoff run when he did return. \nThat didn't happen, however, as the Bengals (who were 2-0 at the time of his injury) won just one game during his absence. And while their playoff hopes are still technically alive, that isn't giving Burrow much solace. \"I don't think anybody's really thinking about the playoffs right now,\" he said. \"That's within reach, but it's on our fingertips, so we've got to keep doing what we're doing and try to get better.\"While the majority of the presser was dark, Burrow cracked a smile when asked about the Pokémon box he received from his offensive linemen as a birthday gift. He was specifically asked what exactly is a Pokémon. \n\"I'll let you research that,\" he said in a rare moment of fun. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers won five of their first six games of the 2025 NFL season and gave the impression that they would cruise to their fifth consecutive NFL South title and the 11th division crown in franchise history. But they've lost five of their last seven contests and are clinging to first place, with a pair of crucial matchups against the Carolina Panthers remaining on their schedule.Before worrying about those showdowns, Tampa Bay (7-6) must take care of business against another division rival as it opens Week 15 by hosting the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Raymond James Stadium. The Buccaneers dropped a 24-20 decision to the lowly New Orleans Saints at home last week and are tied for first place in the NFC South with the Panthers (7-6), who upset the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams 31-28, but currently own the tiebreaker.While Tampa Bay only lost to New Orleans by four points, three of its previous four defeats were by double digits. Since their bye in Week 9, the Buccaneers' lone win in five games was a 20-17 triumph over the inferior Arizona Cardinals, who have won just once in 11 contests after beginning the season with back-to-back victories.Two weeks after leaving Tampa Bay's 34-7 loss to Los Angeles with a shoulder injury, Baker Mayfield completed only 14 of his 30 pass attempts against New Orleans last Sunday for 122 yards. The 30-year-old quarterback, who was in the league MVP discussion earlier this season, has failed to eclipse the 200-yard mark in five of his last six outings and finished with fewer than two touchdown passes in six of the past seven.Tampa Bay's struggles have opened the door for Carolina, which has gone seven seasons without a playoff appearance and hasn't won the NFC South since a three-year run from 2013-15. The Panthers fell two games behind the Buccaneers after their 40-9 setback against the Buffalo Bills in Week 8 but climbed back into contention for the division title by winning three of their next five contests.Carolina held its own against Los Angeles last Sunday, as the lead changed four times before Bryce Young connected with Tetairoa McMillan for his third touchdown pass of the game with 6:34 remaining in the fourth quarter to put the Panthers ahead for good. The Panthers also won the turnover battle 3-0, with Rams star quarterback Matthew Stafford throwing two interceptions -- including one that was returned for a TD by cornerback Mike Jackson -- and fumbling at the Carolina 30-yard line while being sacked by defensive end Derrick Brown with 2:34 to play.\nWhile Thursday night's matchup against the Falcons is not a must-win for the Buccaneers, it would leave them with in the driver's seat in the NFC South. Tampa Bay visits Carolina in Week 16 and, following a meeting with the Dolphins in Miami, hosts the Panthers in the regular-season finale.Atlanta (4-9) was expected to be in the mix for the division crown this season but has been in a free fall since posting a shocking 24-14 victory against the Buffalo Bills in Week 6. The Falcons lost five consecutive contests after the upset and stopped the bleeding with a 24-10 triumph over the Saints before it resumed with setbacks versus the New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks.Despite its struggles, Atlanta is capable of making things difficult for Mayfield and the Buccaneers. The club is ninth in the NFL against the pass, allowing an average of 191.5 yards through the air per game, and faces a Tampa Bay aerial attack that ranks 27th (237.8 yards). The Falcons also rank third with 43 sacks.James Pearce Jr. is tied with defensive tackle Brandon Dorlus for the team lead with six sacks and has registered at least one in each of his last five games, while fellow linebacker Jalon Walker is right behind them with five. However, Dorlus (groin) and Walker (quadriceps) both are questionable for Thursday's showdown.The Buccaneers are strong against the run, ranking eighth in the league with an average of 100.6 yards allowed on the ground. They'll need to come up with a big effort against Atlanta's Bijan Robinson, who is fourth in the NFL in rushing with 1,081 yards. The 23-year-old running back was an integral part of the Falcons' passing game in their first meeting with Tampa Bay this season as he made six catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. SportsLine's Inside the Lines team feels Tampa Bay still has a great chance to continue its reign in the NFC South. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Bucs currently have a 75% chance to capture the division title, and their chances would increase to nearly 83% with a victory against the Falcons but drop to just over 59% with a loss.The best path to the postseason for both Tampa Bay and Carolina is by winning the NFC South. The model says the prospects for the Panthers as they enter their Week 15 road matchup against the Saints are at 25% and would rise to 35% with a victory in \"The Big Easy,\" but dip below 20% with a defeat.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCETampa Bay Buccaneers75.0%82.7%59.1%23.6%Carolina Panthers25.0%35.0%15.6%19.4%The likelihood of Tampa Bay and Carolina both winning this week is high, so a victory by the Bucs in their first matchup of the season in Week 16 figures to give them a massive advantage in the race for the division title as they then visit Miami while the Panthers host Seattle. It would behoove Carolina to win the first meeting with Tampa Bay, as if it does, there's a strong chance both clubs will possess 9-7 records when they square off at Raymond James Stadium in the season finale.But first, the Buccaneers need to right the ship and complete a season sweep of the Falcons on Thursday night. The division rivals opened their campaign with a showdown in Atlanta, and wideout Emeka Egbuka made his second touchdown reception of the game with 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter to help Tampa Bay post a 23-20 victory.Falcons receiver Drake London will miss his fourth consecutive game due to a knee injury, but Buccaneers wideout Mike Evans (collarbone) may make his first appearance since Week 7 as he was activated from injured reserve on Wednesday. Tampa Bay is a 4.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 26-20 victory for the Bucs.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs have never missed the playoffs during Patrick Mahomes' career, but that run is in danger of ending this season and it ",
    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs have never missed the playoffs during Patrick Mahomes' career, but that run is in danger of ending this season and it could happen as soon as Week 15. The 6-7 Chiefs are on the cusp of playoff elimination and there are several scenarios that could see them knocked out on Sunday. The good news for the Chiefs is that a lot would have to happen for them to be eliminated this week and it would start with a loss to the Chargers, a game where Kansas City is currently favored by 4.5 points. Let's take a look at the three most likely elimination scenarios for Kansas City (via Joe Ferraira):  1. Chiefs loss + Jaguars win (over Jets) + Bills win (over Patriots) + Texans win (over Cardinals)Breakdown: The Jaguars (-13.5) and Texans (-9.5) are both huge favorites on Sunday. As for the Bills, they opened as a favorite, but they're now a slight 1.5-point underdog to the Patriots. If the Bills want any shot at winning the AFC East, they have to beat New England, so they'll be extra motivated. If the Chiefs lose to the Chargers, this could certainly be the scenario that ends up knocking them out of playoff contention. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Chiefs loss + Jaguars win (over Jets) + Bills win (over Patriots) + Colts win (over Seahawks)Breakdown: The Colts just lost Daniel Jones for the season and there's a good chance they're going to be starting Philip Rivers on Sunday, who just came out of retirement after four years away. The Colts are a 13-point underdog in Seattle, so for this scenario to happen, Indy would have to pull off a big upset. 3. Chiefs loss + Bills win (over Patriots) + Colts win (over Seahawks) + Texans win (over Cardinals)Breakdown: Like the second scenario, this scenario also involves the Colts pulling off an upset win over the Seahawks.There are also several other more complicated elimination scenarios -- with most of them involving at least one tie -- but these are the three that would probably have the most realistic chance of happening. \nThe Chiefs' have had an unprecedented run of success with Mahomes. Since taking over the starting quarterback job in 2018, Mahomes has led them to seven straight AFC title games, five Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl wins. This year, though, the math definitely isn't working in Kansas City's favor when it comes to making the playoffs and Mahomes is very aware of that. \"We know the chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have every opportunity they get,\" Mahomes said this week. \nAlthough the Chiefs are on the cusp of elimination, they could also still make the playoffs and we mapped out their path here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For more than a century, Michigan football has held itself up as a paragon of morality in a chaotic college athletics world. The Wolverines pride themselves on producing \"Michigan Men,\" people of character who go on and have lifelong success off the field. Through that way, Michigan became the winningest program in the history of the sport and the first to clear 1,000 victories. And through its proud history, the Wolverines have largely avoided major scandal -- a historic contrast to the perceived win-at-all-costs attitudes of the Southeastern Conference. If the past few years have been any indication, that image has been dramatically tarnished. And the next hire at Michigan will be tasked with fixing it. On Wednesday, Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was fired in his second season after an internal investigation found he had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. He went just 15-8 in two years after taking the reins of a national championship team from Jim Harbaugh. \nIf Moore sought employment elsewhere, he would have both an active show-cause and a one-game suspension because of his involvement in another scandal, the Connor Stalions sign-stealing investigation. The former head coach Harbaugh was also implicated in the probe. In a separate case, former co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was dismissed and remains under federal indictment after illegally accessing thousands of student files. And then, there was also the other NCAA investigation into Harbaugh for alleged dead-period recruiting violations during the pandemic. The contacts would have likely received a slap on the wrist, but Harbaugh was defiant with investigators, which landed him in more hot water. \nUltimately, Michigan fought through all this chaos to win the 2023 national championship -- the program's first since 1997 and first outright since 1948. Maybe, shrugging off the reputation of choir boys for scandal was worth it. But for one of the legitimately outstanding public institutions in the country, this malfeasance is beneath them. Now let's be clear, the definition of wrongdoing has changed dramatically in modern history. Paying players is no longer against the rules, so Michigan should have no shame enticing elite players like quarterback Bryce Underwood to Ann Arbor with hefty paychecks. In fact, the sport is leaning far more in the direction of well-monied, metropolitan programs like Michigan. Embrace it. But in the case of Stalions, Michigan called into question the integrity of actual on-field play -- and they didn't even need to. The Wolverines went undefeated after firing him, adding an unnecessary asterisk to their run. Moore now adds personal shortcomings to the list. That has to be a bright red line that Michigan will not tolerate. \nAnd while Michigan's win-at-all-costs approach obviously bore fruit, there's no reason to believe it's necessary for a major blue blood. Ironically, heavy rivals Ohio State and Notre Dame each reached the national championship game last year largely free of off-field controversy. It can be done at Michigan, and will be done, at least with the right hire. There's a lot to like at Michigan. Quarterback Bryce Underwood showed flashes of greatness during an encouraging freshman season. The Wolverines signed the No. 11 high school class, if the next coach can keep them together. The talent level on the roster is trending upwards as recruiting nationalizes. In fact, despite the timing of the move, Michigan could rival LSU as the top opening of the college football cycle. As the only Power Four job still open, the Wolverines have time to catch their breath and identify the new face of the program. And that person must understand how Michigan should do business. \nFrom 1900-1989, Michigan was coached by a College Football Hall of Fame coach every year. Gary Moeller broke the streak after he was forced to resign in 1995 after an arrest for disorderly conduct, but Lloyd Carr made it 10 out of 11 coaches to reach the Hall of Fame. It's an unbelievable run of success, unmatched in the history of the sport. College Football Hall of Famers are one of Ann Arbor's greatest exports. It won't take compromising to find the next one. \n            ",

Moore was terminated for cause by the school after an internal investigation concluded the Wolverines' coach had engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. \"Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. \"Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"Moore was tabbed Michigan's coach at the conclusion of the 2023 season after Jim Harbaugh departed to coach the Los Angeles Chargers. He finished 16-8 (11-6 in Big Ten play) in his two seasons with the program. Moore had been on Michigan's staff since the 2018 campaign, when he was hired as the tight end coach.As of Dec. 1, per USA Today's college football salary database, Moore's buyout was listed at $13.89 million. That number is the second-lowest among all listed coaches from the Big Ten. Of note, USC coach Lincoln Riley and Northwestern coach David Braun did not have a buyout listed on the site. Because Moore was fired for cause, Michigan could be off the hook for some (or all) of his buyout, though cases like this have ended in court battles in the past. \nMoore is the fourth coach from the Big Ten to be fired, joining DeShaun Foster (UCLA), James Franklin (Penn State) and Jonathan Smith (Michigan State).Moore's contract at Michigan was set to pay $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually through the 2029 season -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season. \nThe original buyout was 75% of the base and additional compensation for the remainder of his contract. Moore's contract with Michigan also included the obligation to seek alternative employment, where any amount earned would offset Michigan's buyout payments.\n            \n    ",

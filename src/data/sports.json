    "body": "\n        NBA Hall of Famer and Miami Heat legend Chris Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare. Bosh revealed Wednesday in a video posted to social media that he woke up covered in his own blood. Bosh, who is still recovering from the ordeal, said the incident occurred when he was getting ready for a date with his wife.\"Next thing you know, I was on the ground,\" Bosh said. Bosh doesn't remember anything other than waking up covered in his own blood. He declined to offer specifics about what exactly caused the medical event, but did go into further detail on his Substack, \"The Last Chip.\"\"I was walking from my closet into the bathroom, getting ready for an evening out, when my body turned on me,\" Bosh wrote. \"A numbing sensation shot down my left leg, that sharp, electric feeling you get when you bump your funny bone. Before I knew it, I was on the floor. I slowly came to in a pool of my own blood while my wife frantically spoke with 911. I tried to move my body the way I always had, and it didn't respond.\"\nBosh explained how the \"terrifying\" moment helped change his outlook on life.\n\"After coming back from the darkness, there was no euphoric clarity,\" Bosh wrote. \"... What did change was an immediate outlook on life that was simpler and more honest.\"Bosh retired from the NBA in 2019 after not having played since 2016 due to another health-related issue. Bosh suffered from recurring blood clots that cut his career short. It was first discovered in 2015, when a blood clot that started in his leg and traveled to one of his lungs ended his season after just 44 games. He returned the following season (2015-16), but a second blood clot was found, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season after playing 53 games.After several medical evaluations, Heat team doctors failed Bosh on his physical ahead of the 2016-17 decision despite his desire to play. It was determined that it would be too dangerous for him to continue his basketball career. He retired at 31, having won two championships with the Heat and earning 11 All-Star selections. In 2019, the Heat retired his jersey after playing six of his 13 years with the team. Bosh was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" and plans to use this moment to share his experiences with others.\n\"This experience motivated me to start writing again, to share my experiences and stories in the hope that we can get something out of it and grow together,\" Bosh wrote.\n            ",

    "body": "\nManchester City are hoping to gain ground on English Premier League leaders Arsenal when they visit Elland Road to take on Leeds on Saturday. Man City (17-5-5) are five points behind the Gunners in the Premier League table with a game in hand and come in on a five-game win streak in all competitions. Leeds (7-10-10) are in 15th place but are 1-3-0 in their past four matches. City have won the past five meetings between the teams by a combined score of 19-4.    Kickoff from Elland Road in Leeds is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. Manchester City are -165 favorites on the money line in the latest Leeds vs. Manchester City odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, while the hosts are +400 underdogs. A draw comes in at +350 and the total is set at 2.5 (Over -165, Under +130). Check out the latest SportsLine Projection Model picks for Leeds vs. Manchester City, and make sure you see what expert Martin Green is betting for the contest.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis for Leeds vs. Manchester City on Saturday, Feb. 28.Leeds vs. Manchester City best betsBoth Teams to Score (-140, 1 unit)Erling Haaland to Score (-120, 0.5 units)Leeds will try to extend their unbeaten streak to five games when they host title-chasing Man City at Elland Road on Saturday.Daniel Farke's men are up to 15th in the Premier League table after battling to an impressive 1-1 draw with Aston Villa last weekend. They've picked up three wins, four draws and just one defeat in their last eight matches in all competitions.Leeds lost 4-0 to Arsenal on Jan. 31 but are unbeaten in February, so the players should be full of confidence right now. However, they face a stern test of their mettle against Pep Guardiola's rejuvenated Man City team.Semenyo signing revitalizes Man City's attackMan City are back in the Premier League title race after winning their last three games. They beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield, cruised to a 3-0 victory over Fulham, then beat Newcastle 2-1 at home last weekend.They're now just five points behind league leaders Arsenal, but they have a game in hand. The title race could go down to the wire, so this is a must-win game for Man City. The Citizens have won five games in a row in all competitions. They're unbeaten since losing to Man United in mid-January, so they're building momentum at the perfect time in the season.City's season was faltering, but the club made two shrewd signings in the January transfer window. Antoine Semenyo, the standout attacking player in the Premier League this season, joined from Bournemouth. City then bolstered their defense by snapping up Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi.The results have been immediate. They now look stronger at the back and more dangerous in attack, so they look well-placed to win another Premier League title this season. However, their away form has been their Achilles' heel. Man City have only won six of their 13 away games this season, with 22 goals scored and 16 conceded.They beat Liverpool at Anfield in their last away match, but they were winless in their previous three away games -- a 2-2 draw with Spurs, a 2-0 defeat to Man United, and a 0-0 draw with Sunderland. City also lost 3-1 on the road against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League, so they don't travel well. They'll need big performances from key players like Erling Haaland, Bernardo Silva, and Gianluigi Donnarumma if they're to beat Leeds at Elland Road.Leeds are strong at homeElland Road has been a fortress for Leeds this season. They've picked up 1.69 points per game at home (six wins, four draws, three defeats).By contrast, Leeds have only earned 0.64 points per game on the road (one win, six draws, seven defeats). It shows just how crucial the Elland Road crowd is for this team. The home fans create a raucous, intimidating atmosphere, which the Leeds players feed on in big games. Farke's men have taken four wins, two draws, and just two defeats from their last eight home games.That's why they're now six points clear of the relegation zone. They look capable of avoiding relegation, but they need to keep picking up points at Elland Road.Leeds only have six home matches remaining this season, so this will be another crucial game for the team. Farke is only missing one player, forward Noah Okafor, so he will field a strong starting XI for this game.The likes of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Brendan Aaronson could cause problems for a Man City team that has only kept four clean sheets on the road this season. However, it's hard to see Leeds keeping Haaland, Semenyo, Rayan Cherki, Tijani Reijnders, Nico O'Reilly, Omar Marmoush, and Phil Foden at bay for 90 minutes.It finished 3-2 to Man City when these teams met in Manchester earlier this season, and both teams to score should pay off again at Elland Road this weekend.Haaland has scored three goals in his last two games. He's up to 42 goals in 43 matches for club and country this season, so he looks well-priced to find the back of the net on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The path to Budapest is set. The 16 remaining teams in the Champions League discovered their fate on Friday morning as the bracket for the knockout stages threw up some familiar ties and favorable paths between now and May 30. In the latter category fell yet another meeting between Real Madrid and Manchester City, while there will also be a rematch of the Club World Cup final when Chelsea take on Paris Saint-Germain. With those four, Liverpool and Bayern Munich on one side of the bracket, there certainly appears to be a harder side through which to get to the final.If there is, Arsenal certainly didn't find themselves on it. Drawn with Bayer Leverkusen for the round of 16 and then the winner of Bodo/Glimt vs. Sporting CP if they make it through, it is with Mikel Arteta's Premier League leaders that we begin our assessment of the winners and losers of this draw.Winners: ArsenalYou will hear plenty of cliches around knockout football and Arsenal in the coming weeks. A few of them will probably come from Mikel Arteta. And look, cliches are cliches for a reason. You can only beat who's ahead of you. The best thing to do is concentrate on what you can control. There are no easy games in European football.All well and good, but there are still difficulty levels to the Champions League, and Arsenal's is nowhere near as challenging as it might have been. Even if you assess the sides of the bracket on the most basic terms of European pedigree, it gives you a sense of how kind draw impresario Giorgio Marchetti and Ivan Rakitic were to the Premier League leaders. The side in which Bayern Munich are the top seed share 31 European Cups between them. There are five on the other end. All of them were won by Barcelona, the most recent in 2015.\nIn more analytical terms, eight of the clubs ranked in the top 10 ratings by Club ELO (an estimate of their strength based on past results) are in the last 16 of the Champions League. Six of them are on the other side of the draw from the top side Arsenal. The others, sixth-ranked Barcelona, cannot meet Arteta's men until the semifinals.Between now and then, they will have to face 22nd-ranked Bayer Leverkusen, who currently sit sixth in the Bundesliga and are a shadow of the team that competed for big honors under Arteta's great friend Xabi Alonso. After that, it'll be the best of teams ranked 13th (Sporting) and 41st (Bodo/Glimt) by ELO. There's no draw you'd quite want from the possible semifinalists, but at some stage, you have to beat the very good teams. It is a triumph, however, for Arsenal that they don't have to do so until rather late in the season. Meanwhile, their likeliest rivals for the Champions League crown will be knocking lumps out of each other on the other side of the draw.Losers: Manchester City and Real MadridThe first tie to be played in five consecutive seasons of the Champions League, you could forgive these two clubs, their players and their supporters for getting a bit sick of the sight of each other. If this tie delivers the sort of reliable daftness that it has in recent years -- much of which involves Real Madrid implausibly wriggling out of a bind of their own making -- then there might just about be enough juice in this for the neutral.\n\"For our club, as much [as] you play against the best times in all history in this competition, you learn, you improve, and are better in the future,\" said Pep Guardiola in response to a familiar draw.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            The bigger problem for these two, however, is that getting through this tie really is only the start of the trouble. In all likelihood, Bayern Munich, victorious over Atalanta, will lie in wait for two teams who haven't looked anywhere near their best defensively. Even if they got through that, it would be Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool, Chelsea or a presumably fearless Galatasaray waiting in line. That's a brutal path, all the more challenging for teams with ground to make up in their domestic title races.Suppose, for instance, that City get past Madrid and run into Bayern Munich. This is what their fixture list would look like from March 7 onwards, all games in the Premier League unless stated. Newcastle (a, FA Cup), Real Madrid (a, UCL), West Ham (a), Real Madrid (h), Arsenal (EFL Cup Final), Chelsea (a), Bayern Munich (h), Arsenal (h), Bayern Munich (a). He'll never say it, but surely Guardiola would have preferred a smattering of Bodo/Glimts and Sportings in there.\nWinner: Enzo MarescaIt wouldn't be wise to discount Chelsea entirely against PSG. After all the signs emanating from the Parc des Princes are that the holders look a long way off the team that swept the Premier League's finalists on the way to glory last season. Chelsea too have proven themselves both under current management and their predecessors to be a team that tends to deliver in the big games.\n        \n            \n                PSG survive against Monaco, but Champions League defending champions look a long way from Europe's best\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's the thing, though, no matter how well they deliver, it's really hard to believe that Chelsea could navigate themselves to a two-leg triumph as resounding as the 90-minute win over PSG in the Club World Cup final back in the summer. Watching from afar, Enzo Maresca might be entitled to really enjoy the troubles of his former employer. After all, so much of the pre-match talk will focus on the man-to-man press in the East Rutherford heat, the positioning of Reece James in central midfield to disrupt what seemed to be PSG's all-conquering triumvirate, how Chelsea got Cole Palmer the sort of quick ball that allowed him to rip the final apart in an instant.Maresca doesn't have to adapt to the adaptations that Luis Enrique is sure to make. He doesn't have to coach his way past an opponent who might be pretty keen for revenge against the only team to stop them winning a trophy in 2024-25. His record in European competition remains blemishless. It is up to Liam Rosenior to work out how to improve on Chelsea's finest hour of the last half-decade.\nWinners: Bodo/GlimtNow maybe Kjetil Knutsen and his players have got to the stage of the Champions League where they'd quite like to have a swing at one of the continent's true super teams over two legs. Plenty of underdogs think that way, and that's totally reasonable. What's worth noting right now is that Bodo/Glimt have done plenty of proving themselves against the big boys. That's how they got to the round of 16 in the first place, by beating Manchester City, Atletico Madrid and then stunning Inter twice.It might have been nice to welcome City back to Aspmyra Stadion, to ruin another Erling Haaland homecoming, but not as nice as a spot in the quarterfinals will feel. And while Bodo/Glimt are certainly underdogs, there's a chance for them against Sporting. Not a great one, but Opta, for instance, gives them a 36% chance of overcoming the Portuguese champions. Some of that might be down to the fact that Rui Borges' team might not be the best placed to exploit Bodo/Glimt's weaknesses.The Norwegians have given up a lot of shots this tournament; their 19.9 per game allowed the most by any since the start of the league phase. However, their opponent only averaged 11.1 in the league phase, scoring 2.1 goals per game off 1.4 xG. Sporting have attacking talent, but Luis Suarez (not that one), Trincao, Alisson Santos, and Geovany Quenda are not the most intimidating front four that Sporting have put out in recent years. It might not be enough to expose Bodo/Glimt's weaknesses in defense, and that gives the underdogs the chance to make history at the other end.\nLosers: TottenhamHow can a relatively favorable draw have you in the losers' section? Well, in the very rare set of circumstances where you could probably do with getting out of the Champions League post haste. That's Tottenham this season, with no realistic chance of winning this competition and every reason to focus their attention on matters elsewhere. Igor Tudor probably isn't leading this team to the Championship, but there's a chance, and when there's even the hint of the prospect of relegation from the Premier League (Spurs are four points clear of the drop zone) for an injury-addled squad, you could do with wrapping up your other assignments.Spurs would have been in this situation whatever the outcome of Friday's draw, and it is fair to say that these circumstances would have been even more pronounced if they'd drawn Galatasaray. Atletico Madrid are a better team and one that will be pretty pleased to have drawn Tottenham. They are not however, so good that you would feel certain that Tottenham can quickly wrap up their involvement in the Champions League and get on to the really important business of the season.Champions League round of 16 drawPSG vs. ChelseaGalatasaray vs. LiverpoolReal Madrid vs. Manchester CityAtalanta vs. Bayern MunichNewcastle United vs. BarcelonaAtletico Madrid vs. TottenhamBodo/Glimt vs. SportingBayer Leverkusen vs. Arsenal\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFLPA report cards are out, and although the NFL doesn't want you to see them, they are now available after being leaked to ESPN this week. The grades on the report cards are based on a survey that's handed out to players each year. For the most recent season, the NFLPA had 1,759 players rate their team in 17 different categories. One of the most interesting parts of this survey is that it allows each player to anonymously rate their head coach, so you can get an idea of how well a coach relates to his players. With that in mind, we're going to take a look at how each coach graded out. Remember, these grades are based on the 2025 season, so there are several coaches on this list who ended up getting fired. The highest grade handed out was an A+, which went to two different coaches. On the other hand, the lowest grade handed out was a C-, which went to one coach and not surprisingly, that coach was eventually fired. \n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Which path will Lamar Jackson take for a new Ravens deal? Josh Allen's or Dak Prescott's?\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are the grades for each coach: Grade: A+Coaches: Rams coach Sean McVay, Commanders coach Dan Quinn Notes: Last year, there were a total of six coaches who earned an A+, but this year, that number has been chopped down to two and Quinn is the ONLY coach in the NFL to earn an A+ in both years. Despite the Commanders' struggles in 2025, he clearly never lost the locker room. \nGrade: ACoaches: Bears coach Ben Johnson, Lions coach Dan Campbell, Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni, Seahawks Mike Macdonald, Chiefs coach Andy Reid, Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, Jets coach Aaron Glenn, Steelers coach Mike TomlinNotes: Both Super Bowl coaches landed in this category, which tells you how important it is to have a head coach who can relate to his players. It's also worth noting that eight of the nine coaches in this group have been to the playoffs at least once in the past two seasons and five of the nine have been to at least a conference title game. Mike Tomlin might want to save this grade because it shows that he went out on top. Tomlin was widely viewed as the ultimate player's coach and he was clearly still well-liked after 19 years on the job. The biggest surprise name here is probably Aaron Glenn. Despite a 3-14 record, the Jets first-year coach still graded out highly, which could bode well for his second-year on the job. Grade: A-Coaches: Panthers coach Dave Canales, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans, Saints coach Kellen Moore, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, Bills coach Sean McDermott, Bengals coach Zac Taylor, Colts coach Shane Steichen, Jaguars coach Liam Coen\nNotes: Sean McDermott was a popular guy in Buffalo when he got fired, but he still lost his job. and that's because Bills owner Terry Pegula didn't feel like McDermott could take the team to the \"next level.\" Joe Brady will be replacing McDermott and if you're wondering how the players feel about him, he also was given an A- (Offensive coordinators were also graded out, which is why we know how Brady did). One name that might surprise some people here is Zac Taylor. The Bengals locker room clearly still approves of the job he's doing and that could be something that leads to a rebound in 2026. Grade: B+Coaches: Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon, Falcons coach Raheem Morris Notes: Apparently, this is the grade that no coach should want. Both Morris and Gannon were fired following the 2025 season. Grade: BCoaches: Ravens coach John Harbaugh, Broncos coach Sean Payton, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles \nNotes: This is an interesting group, because you have two coaches who were fired (McDaniel, Harbaugh), one coach who led his team to a conference title game (Payton) and one coach who has won his division in three of the past four years (Bowles). The most surprising name here though, is probably Payton. After turning the Broncos around, you'd think that Payton would have a hire approval rate with the players in Denver, but apparently, that's not the case. Worst gradesWe're going to lump the final six coaches together since they landed the worst grades. B-: Packers coach Matt LaFleur, Titans coach Brian Callahan/Mike McCoy C+: Raiders coach Pete Carroll, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh C: Giants coach Brian Daboll/Mike Kafka C-: Browns coach Kevin Stefanski\nOut of the coaches who landed in this group, four of the six got fired. That means two of them didn't get fired. The first one is Matt LaFleur, who's future in Green Bay was up in the air before he eventually signed an extension in late January. It would be interesting to know how his team feels about the extension considering his grade was so low. The biggest surprise in this group is probably Jim Harbaugh. On one hand, he's an old-school coach and it's possible his coaching philosophy doesn't translate well with younger players, which might explain his low grade. On the other hand, his coaching style works and he has the track record to prove it. In two seasons on the job, he's led the Chargers to two playoff appearances. Harbaugh earned a B+ last year during his first season on the job, but took a tumble this year. The coaches that landed the two worst grades this year both got fired (Daboll, Stefanski). It will be interesting to see if Stefanski's grade goes up at all in Atlanta, because he'll be replacing a coach in Morris who earned an A+ last year and a B+ this year. \nOne interesting thing about the report cards is that they almost didn't come out this year. The NFL filed a grievance against the NFLPA over the report cards back in August and the league actually won. Due to victory, the ruling stated that the results of the report cards would no longer be made public, but they still leaked out anyway. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The clock is ticking for the Baltimore Ravens to reach an agreement with quarterback Lamar Jackson on a contract extension before owner Steve Bisciotti's target date of March 11 when the 2026 league year starts. Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta expressed optimism that a deal could get done during his NFL Scouting Combine press conference on Feb. 24.Jackson, who represents himself and has never had an agent, has two years worth $104 million remaining on the five-year, $260 million contract he signed in 2023 after being designated as a franchise player. The two-time NFL MVP is scheduled to make $52 million in 2026 consisting of a $51.25 million base salary, of which $29 million is fully guaranteed, and a $750,000 workout bonus. Jackson's 2026 salary cap number is $74.5 million. These figures are the same for Jackson in 2027. The $74.5 million is 2026's second biggest cap number.Jackson has a no-trade clause. There's also a provision preventing the Ravens from designating Jackson as a franchise or transition player when his contract expires following the 2027 season.The 2025 season was one for Jackson to forget. After a fast start, Jackson was slowed by injuries (hamstring, ankle, toe, knee and back). He missed four games because of the hamstring and back ailments. The injuries limited Jackson's mobility. He rarely played at an MVP level after the hamstring injury in Week 4 until the fourth quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season finale. The Ravens, who were favorites to win Super Bowl LX before the season started, missed the playoffs with an 8-9 record.\nJackson has significant contract leverage despite an injury-plagued and subpar 2025 season by his standards. It's because of his tremendous ability, those clauses in his contract and the exorbitant cap number.The ball is in Jackson's court on which path he wants to take with a new deal. Jackson could follow in Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen's footsteps and leave some money on the table in an effort to enhance his chances to win a Super Bowl or Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott's where he exploits his leverage. The Bills renegotiated Allen's contract last March although he had four years worth $154,554,595 remaining on the six-year, $258 million extension, averaging $43 million per year (worth a maximum of $288 million through incentives), he signed in 2021. Allen got a new six-year deal for $330 million. The maximum value is $333 million because of a $500,000 annual incentive for winning the Super Bowl. The contract has an NFL-record $250 million in guarantees. The $147 million fully guaranteed at signing is the second most ever in an NFL contract. \nIt's extremely unusual for a team to effectively rip up a contract with four years left like the Bills did. Allen was clearly focused on cash flow as opposed to maximizing the average yearly salary. At $55 million per year, Allen is tied as the NFL's second-highest-paid player with Joe Burrow (Cincinnati Bengals), Trevor Lawrence (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Jordan Love (Green Bay Packers). Allen's $220 million from 2025 through 2028 is the best four-year cash flow ever in an NFL contract. It surpassed the previous high of $219 million (2024 through 2027) in Prescott's four-year, $240 million contract extension signed in 2024 that made him the NFL's first $60 million per player. Being named the 2024 NFL MVP over Jackson should have given Allen enough ammunition to not only become the cash-flow king but also the league's highest-paid player instead being in a tie for second.Jackson focusing on total cash instead of the extension or new money average would be a huge negotiating win for the Ravens. For example, Jackson barely topping Allen's maximum value with $334 million over six years running through the 2031 season would be a four-year, $230 million extension after subtracting out his two remaining contract years worth $104 million. At $57.5 million per year, Jackson would be the NFL's second-highest-paid player behind Prescott.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL free agency: RB market, team fits, projected deals for Breece Hall, Kenneth Walker, Travis Etienne\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson's four-year cash flow from 2026 through 2029 would need to be more than Allen's $220 million. Besting Allen's record $250 million in guarantees and having at least $150 million guaranteed at signing would likely be necessities as well.The most aggressive position Jackson could take in exploiting his leverage, like Prescott did, is insisting that his current contract should be adjusted for salary cap inflation. The salary cap was $224.8 million when Jackson signed in 2023. The NFL recently informed teams that the 2026 salary cap is expected to be between $301.2 million and $305.7 million.That's approximately $70 million per year in a 2026 salary cap environment. The 16.67% increase over Prescott's contract would be the biggest jump in the quarterback market from a single deal since the 2011 lockout ended, outside of Patrick Mahomes' unique 10-year, $450 million extension, averaging $45 million per year, with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020. Jackson could justify the huge increase because the Ravens reset the safety market by 18.12% when signing Kyle Hamilton to a front-loaded four-year, $100.4 million extension, averaging $25.1 million per year, in August.\nJackson should want the first three years fully guaranteed (2026 through 2028) with total guarantees ending after the fourth year (2029) if driving an extremely hard bargain. That would be upward to $225 million fully guaranteed at signing and $275 million in overall guarantees based on Hamilton's structure.The Ravens will surely prefer to repeat history with a Jackson contract extension. His $52 million per year was 1.96% more than the $51 million per year extension Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts received a few weeks earlier. A similar increase over Prescott's $60 million per year would put Jackson at $61.175 million per year.A happy medium could be using Prescott's situation as a guide. Prescott's $60 million per year was 9.09% more than the $55 million per year quarterback salary standard prior to his deal. A comparable increase applied to Prescott's $60 million is $65 million per year.\nRegardless of the road Jackson takes, his new deal will likely include a record signing bonus, which was the case in 2023. His $72.5 million was the most ever in an NFL contract eclipsing Prescott's $66 million in his 2021 deal. Prescott's current contract included an NFL-record $78,453,333 signing bonus.As much as $34 million of 2026 cap space could be created by breaking Prescott's signing bonus record. For example, Jackson getting an $85 million signing bonus prorated at $17 million annually from 2026 through 2030 with his $1.3 million league-minimum base salary and the $750,000 workout bonus remaining a part of the deal would lower his 2026 cap number to $41.55 million, which would free up $32.95 million of 2026 cap room. There is already $22.5 million of 2026 proration from Jackson's signing bonus and the two option bonuses in his current contract.Jackson really should fight to eliminate or reduce his workout bonus in a new deal. He has left $1.5 million on the table because he didn't have the requisite 80% participation in the offseason workouts needed to earn the bonuses in 2024 or 2025.\nThe Ravens have a backup plan if an agreement can't be reached in a timely manner. Bisciotti indicated in a January press conference after John Harbaugh was fired as head coach that Jackson's contract would be restructured rather than carrying his $74.5 million cap hit. The Ravens would free up $37,462,500 of 2026 cap room by converting Jackson's entire 2026 compensation minus his league-minimum salary and the workout bonus into signing bonus. This $49.95 million would be prorated over Jackson's remaining two contract years and the two dummy/voiding years already existing to lower his 2026 cap number to $37,037,500. Jackson's cap number for 2027, the final real year of his contract, would increase from $74.5 million to $86,987,500. Just imagine the type of negotiating leverage Jackson would have in 2027 by having a bounce-back season. The quarterback market could dramatically escalate in 2027, as 2024 draft picks, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye and Caleb Williams will be eligible for contract extensions. At least one of the three should reset the quarterback market. \nJackson could let the market further develop with these quarterbacks before doing a new deal. With Jackson returning to some semblance of his previous form in 2026, he would practically be able to name his own price in a 2027 contract extension since the Ravens would be powerless to prevent him from leaving in 2028 free agency if his contract expired.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State rose from a No. 4 to a No. 3 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology following its 76-74 road win on Thursday over a Purdue team that remains a No. 2 seed. The Spartans' dramatic victory brought a massive jump in their Wins Above Bubble (WAB) ranking, which reflects the value of a road win over a high-end Big Ten foe.WAB is a vital resume metric used by the selection committee to compare the accomplishments of teams that played vastly different schedules. Every outcome results in a score between -1 and 1. Beating the Boilermakers resulted in a huge +0.93 addition to Michigan State's WAB score, suggesting the average bubble team would be expected to lose at Purdue roughly 93% of the time.The win improved Michigan State to 23-5 (13-4 Big Ten) and increased its WAB ranking from 14th to 5th. The Spartans' WAB score of 6.82 reflects nearly seven more victories than the average bubble team would be expected to have against their schedule.Gonzaga slipped from a No. 3 seed to a No. 4 seed as a result of Michigan State's rise. The Zags (28-2, 16-1 WCC) close the regular season at Saint Mary's on Saturday in their final regular-season game as a member of the WCC. It will be a high-end Quad 1 opportunity, which gives the Zags a chance at climbing back onto the No. 3 seed line before their postseason begins.Here's a look at the top seeds from the CBS Sports Bracketology model.

It's the beginning of a tough finishing stretch for the Wolverines (26-2, 16-1 Big Ten), who can clinch the outright Big Ten title with a victory. Slaying the Illini on the road would also help Michigan's aspirations of earning the No. 1 overall seed. That position currently belongs to Duke in CBS Sports Bracketology as the teams are close in most selection metrics, and the Blue Devils own a head-to-head win on a neutral floor. If the Blue Devils suffered a loss down the stretch, it would likely result in the Wolverines rising back to the top spot -- so long as they keep winning. Illinois' slim hope of rising to claim the last No. 1 seed will likely be hanging in the balance. If the Illini beat Michigan and then run the table through the Big Ten Tournament, they could have a case. But if nothing else, this provides the Illini an opportunity to regain some confidence against high-caliber opposition. Their last three losses have come in overtime by a combined six points over the past three weeks. Executing down the stretch and winning a close game against an elite team like Michigan would be a sign that Illinois should be taken seriously as a national title contender.Rematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular-season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.\nWith regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here.\nGood morning and happy Friday! Just like that, the shortest month of the year is almost done. Carter Bahns with you to close out February and look ahead to the start of March in the world of sports. If one thing comes to mind when I think of March, it's the NCAA Tournament. We have an absolutely massive weekend of college basketball ahead of us to help set the stage for the Big Dance, which is right around the corner. The NFL combine is also highly deserving of our attention over the next few days, and the push to the NBA playoffs is really heating up. Let's talk about it.  🏋️ Five things to know Friday The NFL Scouting Combine is underway in Indianapolis. The first batch of players checked into the combine on Thursday with edge rushers, defensive linemen and linebackers taking the stage first. Miami's Rueben Bain Jr. was the talk of the day as arm length once again became a point of concern. Bain's sub-31-inch arms are among the shortest for an edge rusher in recent combine history. It was a good day to be Sonny Styles, though. The Ohio State product ran the fastest 40-yard dash (4.46) of any linebacker and led the position with a 43.50\" vertical jump en route to our only \"A+\" grade of the day. And on the defensive line, we gave Caleb Banks and Lee Hunter \"B+\" grades as top performers.Max Scherzer will spend his 19th MLB season in Toronto. \"Mad Max\" has at least one more year in him, and he will return to the Blue Jays after agreeing to re-sign with the reigning American League champions. The 41-year-old pitcher reportedly agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract that is rich with incentives, and Scherzer is likely to climb into the top 10 in career strikeouts this season.The Jets and Titans pulled off a trade. It's a player-for-player deal as New York will send Jermaine Johnson II to Tennessee in exchange for nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat. The trade will process in March when the new league year begins. We graded the transaction and determined that the Jets came out ahead, but only slightly.More moves could be on the horizon as Anthony Richardson and Kayvon Thibodeaux are on the trade block. The Colts reportedly gave Richardson permission to seek a trade, which opens the door for him to potentially compete for a starting job outside of Indianapolis. The question is which team is willing to take a shot on the oft-injured former first-rounder who has yet to latch on as a starter. In New York, the Giants appear ready to move on from Thibodeaux and are reportedly listening to offers for the edge rusher. Also a former first-round pick, he has struggled over the last two years to replicate his stellar rookie production.Changes to college football's targeting rule could take effect in 2026. The NCAA Rules Subcommittee proposed a one-year trial rule that would no longer force players flagged for targeting in the second half of one game to miss the first half of the next contest. Instead, if the FBS and FCS Oversight Committees approve, players will only be disqualified through the end of their current game. Once rule changes make it this far in the process, they generally pass, so it is fair to assume that targeting will look different during the 2026 season. Numerous coaches have called for this exact adjustment. 😬 Do not miss this: Clippers break the NBA Concern Meter \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The final full month of the NBA season arrives on Sunday, so opportunities to shore up playoff positioning are dwindling. For those in full tank mode, that's not so much of a problem as it is a relief. But for teams actively trying to win, all have at least some sense of desperation as they seek to attain their respective goals. John Gonzalez placed a handful of teams on the Concern Meter and measured the amount of panic warranted for each situation. \nFor the 10th-place Clippers in particular, the Concern Meter doesn't go high enough to measure how dire things are in Los Angeles. Gonzalez: \"They're 13-18 away from the Ballmer Bowl™️, their point differential is minus-0.5, and they're 14-22 against teams .500 or better. They're also 19-29 when opponents score 100 or more. Reader, this is the NBA. Good chance that any given team goes for more than 100 on any given night.\"In the Eastern Conference, the Knicks are in third place and five games clear of the play-in, but a few eyebrow-raising losses of late are not so easy on the nerves. That's why John assigned them a 6.5 out of 10 on the Concern Meter.  🏀 Buckle up for six top 25 men's college basketball showdowns \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            We've reached the penultimate weekend of the men's college basketball regular season, and it is a doozy. There are a whopping six top 25 battles on the slate, and they begin tonight with a top-10 Big Ten clash between No. 3 Michigan and No. 10 Illinois, wherein the Wolverines can clinch sole possession of the conference title. \nIf you only have the bandwidth to watch six games this weekend, these better top your list: No. 3 Michigan at No. 10 IllinoisNo. 11 Virginia at No. 1 DukeNo. 14 Kansas at No. 2 ArizonaNo. 16 Texas Tech at No. 4 Iowa StateNo. 17 Alabama at No. 22 TennesseeNo. 20 Arkansas at No. 7 FloridaOther storylines to note include the fallout of this week's UConn-over-St. John's demolition.

    "body": "\n        LSU has long held the belt as \"Wide Receiver U,\" but Ohio State has been making a push in recent years to take it away from them. The Buckeyes have produced several high-profile wideouts, including Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who just helped lead the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX title after leading the NFL in receiving yards during the regular season. Ohio State has also ushered in the likes of Garrett Wilson, Chris Olave, Terry McLaurin, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka into the NFL over the last few years. Could Carnell Tate be the latest OSU pass catcher to take the NFL by storm? At 21 years old, he is earmarked to be a first-round pick at the 2026 NFL Draft in Pittsburgh later this spring, and could very well be the first wideout to come off the board. While CBS Sports' Mike Renner has Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson as his top receiver entering the NFL Scouting Combine, Tate was a close second and even has him as the first receiver selected in his latest mock draft due to Tyson's injury history. CBS Sports Senior NFL Draft analyst Ryan Wilson has Tate as WR1 in his most recent mock as well. \nTate is an enticing prospect who could prove to be a stellar downfield threat at the NFL level, and his route-running ability could have him ascend quickly into stardom. He possesses good size, standing 6-foot-3 and weighing in at 195 pounds. For the Buckeyes last season, Tate averaged 17.2 yards per reception, hauling in 51 balls for 875 yards and nine touchdowns.The question surrounding Tate is where he'll end up. While the 2026 NFL Draft is still months away, let's dive into a handful of landing spots that could make sense for the Ohio State pass catcher. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants (No. 5)The Giants are stepping into a new era in 2026. After landing Jaxson Dart as its QB of the future last year, the team has since hired John Harbaugh as its head coach, and the future is looking bright. That said, the offense could stand to add more weapons around Dart, especially with fellow wideout Malik Nabers recovering from a torn ACL he suffered in Week 4 and running back Cam Skattebo suffering a season-ending ankle injury in Week 8. It remains to be seen if those two young weapons will be ready to go to begin the 2026 campaign, so an addition like Tate makes sense to provide some immediate artillery for Dart as he begins his sophomore season. Once Nabers and Skattebo return to full strength, New York would suddenly have a dynamic young core at the skill positions with Tate in the fold. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns (No. 6)The Browns still have major questions at quarterback, but there is no viable option for them to take at No. 6 overall. Instead, they should continue building around QB and ride the momentum they struck at the 2025 draft. There, they brought in the likes of running backs Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson, along with tight end Harold Fannin Jr., who led the team with 731 yards receiving last season. This go-around, adding a playmaker like Tate would give Cleveland a much-needed boost at receiver. Currently, the room is made up of Jerry Jeudy, Cedric Tillman, and Isaiah Bond. Jeudy was second on the team with 602 yards receiving, and Bond was third with 338 yards. Whether it's Shedeur Sanders or someone else, bringing in a playmaker like Tate will help Todd Monken's offense get off the ground in 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington Commanders (No. 7)The 2026 season was a disaster for Washington. After reaching the NFC Championship in Jayden Daniels' rookie season, his second year in the league saw him limited to seven games due to injury, and the defense regressed to one of the league's worst units. While there's an argument to be made to add to the defensive side of the ball after surrendering a league-worst 384.0 yards per game, Washington also needs more weapons around Daniels. Deebo Samuel is unlikely to return as he hits unrestricted free agency, leaving Terry McLaurin as still the top option, along with Luke McCaffrey. Even veteran tight end Zach Ertz, 35, is a free agent, so there is a need to get younger and more dynamic at pass catcher for the Commanders. Selecting Tate inside the top 10 accomplishes both. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs (No. 9)It doesn't seem this offseason, but Travis Kelce is going to retire at some point, which means the Chiefs need to begin transitioning the offense around Patrick Mahomes into the next era. Through the first half of Mahomes' career, Kelce has been the linchpin of the offense and his go-to target. The team has brought in the likes of Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice in recent seasons, but they haven't hit as big as the team has hoped both on and off the field. Neither of them feels like a dependable option to lean on in a post-Kelce world, and Rice is entering the final year of his rookie deal in 2026. So, K.C. would be best served to keep hunting for Mahomes' next top-tier weapons, and that could very well be Tate. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams (No. 13)You might look at the Rams and think that wide receiver is one of the last positions they'd look to with this first-round pick, but don't be fooled, this is a sneaky need for the organization. While Puka Nacua is arguably the best wide receiver that the NFL has to offer, Davante Adams is entering his age-33 season and the final year of his contract. Tate could be a solid addition to an already lethal L.A. offense for 2026 and then ascend to a bigger role in 2027 if/when Adams and the team part ways. Because the Rams have two first-rounders in 2026 -- No. 13 and No. 29 overall -- they can add a luxury piece with one of them, which could be Tate. I view this in a somewhat similar light to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- who had Mike Evans and Chris Godwin Jr. -- drafting Emeka Egbuka last offseason. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        I wrote Busts 1.0 back on January 16, and a lot has happened since then! Spring training games have started, I've participated in drafts, and we've done our position preview podcasts on Fantasy Baseball Today. Those last two are especially important. We deep dive into so many players on the position preview pods. It allows me to review all the stats and see if I missed anything the first go around. I also get to hear the opinions of Scott White and Chris Towers. Conversations will either reinforce opinions or force me to expand what I thought about a certain player.Doing drafts has also helped me prep. Most have been slow draft-and-holds, but a few have been fast-paced mock drafts. Nothing tests your rankings and opinions like a draft room. You may think you want a player, but when the time comes, you shy away. With all that said, here are five more names I've found myself avoiding in the drafts I've done, either due to new information, enhanced risk factors, gut feeling, or all of the above.Sleepers 2.0: Scott | Chris | FrankBreakouts 2.0: Scott | Chris | FrankBusts 2.0: Scott | Chris | Frank\nI can already feel the eyes rolling. Nobody wants to doubt a young phenom. What Kurtz did last year was historic. In his Age-22 season, he hit .290 with 36 homers and a 1.002 OPS in just 117 games. His full-season pace was 49 homers, 124 runs, and 119 RBI. His average exit velocity, barrel rate, hard-hit rate, and bat speed all ranked in the 92nd percentile or better last season. I cannot and will not doubt his power, which is 100 percent legit. I will, however, doubt his contact ability and approach against left-handed pitching.Kurtz has a great eye at the plate, but holes in his swing. He struck out 31 percent of the time last season, and the underlying metrics were quite bad. His 35.5 percent whiff rate ranked in the first percentile, while his zone contact was just 72.5 percent. For reference, the league average is 82.5 percent. Kurtz showed signs of improvement in August, lowering his strikeout rate to just 26 percent, but then it shot back up to 35 percent in September. On top of that, he struggled mightily against lefties, hitting just .197 with a .685 OPS and a 35 percent strikeout rate. It's entirely possible that at 23 years old, he improves and builds off a truly impressive rookie season, but I'm not sure his downside is being factored in enough as a second-round pick in drafts. I would take more proven options like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Kyle Schwarber, and Jazz Chisholm over Kurtz in that range.\nBefore I get into it, I need to apologize to Red Sox fans, as three of your team's players are on this list. I don't hate the Red Sox players for Fantasy, I swear! In fact, I'm quite eager to draft Roman Anthony, Ranger Suarez, Willson Contreras, and Caleb Durbin. I am not as eager to draft Jarren Duran. Last year, everything came down from Duran's career 2024 season. It seems as though he was selling out a little more for power, a skillset I don't think he's suited for. But the main reason I worry about Duran as a top-70 pick is his playing time.\nNow that's just one beat writer's opinion, but there is merit behind it. In Duran's career against lefties, he's hitting just .232 with a .620 OPS, 70 wRC+, and a 27 percent strikeout rate. According to the above tweet, that would mean Wilyer Abreu is an everyday player over Duran. While that might sound outlandish to some, Abreu is the much better defender, having won back-to-back Gold Glove awards. Now I don't see Duran bottoming out or anything; I just think he's overvalued in Fantasy if he's not an everyday player, especially in H2H points leagues. His skillset is still useful, with decent power and lots of speed. I would take all of Jackson Merrill, Seiya Suzuki, and George Springer over Duran in that range of drafts. \nAs a general rule in any Fantasy sport, fade the 37-year-old coming off one the best seasons of his career. According to the Fangraphs Player Rater, Chapman was the best reliever in 12-team Roto leagues last season. 1.17 ERA, 0.70 WHIP, and 32 saves is just bonkers! The biggest improvement came in Chapman's control. His 2.2 BB/9 and 6.6 percent walk rate were both the best of his career. He went right after hitters, evidenced by his 70.6 percent first-pitch strike percentage. Prior to last year, his previous high in that particular stat was just 62.5 percent. Chapman had been below 60 percent even of the four years prior!\nI know the Red Sox and Chapman both made adjustments to help him throw strikes last season. I just seriously question if he can replicate that again in 2026. From 2021-2024, Chapman allowed nearly 6 BB/9 with a 15.4 percent walk rate! He ranked bottom three among all qualified relievers during that span. Yes, there is a chance last year was real. He picks up right where he left off and has another top-five closer season for Fantasy. I think the more likely scenario is that his control regresses towards the rest of his career, especially his very recent years before 2025. I'm trying to be more nitpicky about which relievers I'm drafting in Fantasy Baseball this season, and Chapman will not be one of them at his cost.\nNick Pivetta finally did the thing. He put it all together and finished as a top-15 starting pitcher, regardless of format. He was consistent, threw strikes, and really enjoyed the move over to Petco Park. Pivetta posted a 2.36 ERA at home and saw his overall HR/9 drop from 1.7 with the Red Sox in 2024 to just 1.1 last season. Well, he still pitches for the Padres, so what's there to worry about? The underlying skills tell us that Pivetta might have been fortunate last season.Let's start with his declining whiffs. Over the past three years, Pivetta's swinging strike rate has dropped from 13.1 percent to 11.3 down to 10.5 last season. League average was 10.6 percent. Next up is the BABIP. Yes, Pivetta is an extreme fly-ball pitcher, which typically leads to a lower BABIP. Last year, Pivetta had a .235 mark when it was .279 the year prior and .292 for his career. The smart move is to bet on regression in that department. Lastly, the underlying ERA estimators tell us Pivetta might have deserved one full run added to his ERA. While he posted a 2.87 ERA last season, his xFIP was 3.85, and his xERA was 3.97. The xFIP and xERA were both higher last season than in 2024, when Pivetta's ERA is 4.14. Explain that! Pivetta's another one where I don't think he'll bottom out, but I see regression coming, and that makes him overvalued as a top-100 pick. \nI just do not get this one at all. Yes, Sonny Gray still does some nice things. He's thrown at least 166 innings with at least 183 strikeouts in each of the past three seasons. He's also a metrics darling, which I usually love. Gray was seventh among qualified starters with a 21.6 percent K-BB rate. Each of his FIP, xFIP, and SIERA were below 3.40. With all of that said, he's 36 years old and clearly declining. I think some of the things Gray is struggling with aren't captured in the underlying metrics.For example, his fastball velocity has dropped from 92.9 MPH back in 2023 down to 91.7 MPH last season, and that pitch got demolished! It allowed a .376 batting average against with a .594 slugging percentage. I almost think he throws too many strikes at this point in his career, too. Yes, it's nice to avoid walks, but not if you're getting hit hard. When things went wrong for Gray last season, they went really wrong. He had six different starts where he allowed multiple home runs. In five of those, he allowed at least six earned runs. As a result, the ERA has been on the high end two years in a row. On top of all of that, he's back in the AL East, where he'll have to face the Yankees, Blue Jays, and Orioles multiple times per year. No, it's not as often as the past, due to the balanced schedule changes, but still more often than you'd like. Gray is being drafted as a top-30 starting pitcher by ADP, but I have him closer to SP50 in my own personal rankings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants could be preparing to part ways with a former first-round pick. The team is listening to offers for edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux, and the belief among teams at the NFL Scouting Combine is that Thibodeaux will get dealt, according to SNY.Thibodeaux, 25, is coming off a season during which he recorded just 2.5 sacks, five tackles for loss and nine quarterback hits while playing in only 10 of 17 games. He has fallen off precipitously over the last two years after he posted an 11.5-sack season in 2023, his second year in the NFL.But even that 11.5-sack total was not really representative of his level of play that year. Thibodeaux ranked 12th in the NFL in sacks that season but checked in just 67th in pressures and 107th in pressure rate out of the 145 players who rushed the passer 250 times or more. He just happened to have a sack-to-pressure ratio that was an outlier and looks nothing like the one he has posted in the other three seasons of his career. During that 2023 season, 26.7% of Thibodeaux's pressures resulted in sacks. He has otherwise been at 10% (2022), 14.5% (2024) and 7.8% (2025). It's no surprise, then, that he's totaled only 12 sacks in his three non-2023 seasons.\nThat subpar performance could lead to a reduced market for Thibodeau's services. There's also the matter of his fully guaranteed salary of around $14.8 million in 2026, which could even further limit said market. Still, as a 25-year-old former first-round pick, there are teams out there that could be interested. Let's take a look at a few that might make some sense, if the price is right.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersOnly two teams generated pressure at a lower rate during the 2025 regular season than the 49ers, according to Tru Media. (That would be the Jets and the Panthers.) San Francisco losing Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams to injury during the season played a role, but the Niners still need more help on the edge even after you account for getting those guys back. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsThe Bills are seemingly on the hunt for help on the edges every offseason, and this one could be no different. They had a solid pressure rate during the regular season, but in the playoffs it dropped to just 32.5% -- and 28% in the loss to the Broncos in the divisional round. Buffalo has other needs and might be turned off by price, but if it's low enough, it could get interested.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsThe Jets are one of those aforementioned teams that did an even worse job of getting after the quarterback than the 49ers. They could use all they help they can get, so you might as well throw them in the mix here. That's especially true after they traded Jermaine Johnson II to the Titans. They also have plenty of cap space, so they could likely make something happen if they wanted.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersKhalil Mack and Odafe Oweh will hit free agency this offseason, and the Chargers might not be able to bring both of them back. They are scheduled to have over $80 million in cap room, though, so if they wanted to get in on the action for Thibodeaux, they could probably do so at a lower cost than other teams that might want the Giants to absorb some of his cap hit.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts ranked just 23rd in pressure rate during the 2025 season, according to Tru Media. They need someone to rush the passer opposite Laiatu Latu, who collected 8.5 sacks this past year. They've been looking for pass rush help for a while, and they could be interested in buying low here -- especially if the Giants are willing to eat some of the salary.\n            ",

Arsenal, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and PSG are considered as the most likely candidates to lift the trophy this season, as the Champions League final will be played just weeks before the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off across Canada, Mexico and the United States. Napoli, Juventus and Inter have all been eliminated, leaving Atalanta as the lone Italian representative still standing in the Round of 16, which begins on March 10.

Newcastle vs. Barcelona For the second and third time this season, Newcastle will meet Barcelona after the 2-1 win of the side coached by Hansi Flick back in September, when Marcus Rashford scored his first two goals with the Blaugrana. This will definitely be a crucial test for Barcelona as they can potentially meet either Atletico Madrid or Tottenham in the quarterfinals before a semifinal against either Arsenal, Bayer Leverkusen, Bodo/Glimt or Sporting CP. Barcelona will try to repeat their path of the past season, when they were only eliminated by Inter in the semifinals in one of the most incredible matchups of recent years. 2. PSG vs. Chelsea The rematch of the 2025 Club World Cup final will be one of the best matches to watch in March, as Luis Enrique's team will start their path to what would be a back-to-back Champions League win,s and on the other hand, the Blues will start off their knockouts under Liam Rosenior, who took over from Enzo Maresca in January 2026. Chelsea ended up in 6th place in the standings of the league phase, while PSG had to go through the playoffs, where they won against AS Monaco in the French derby. The two sides have faced each other in four previous Champions League campaigns, meeting eight times in total. Three of those games came in the knockout stages, with PSG winning the two most recent ties.\n1. Real Madrid vs. Manchester City This is now a classic of the Champions League. Real Madrid, the 15-time winner of the tournament, will meet Pep Guardiola's side for the sixth time in the last seven editions of the competition, where they featured some of the most memorable games, and lastly this season in the league phase, when City won 2-1 away at the Bernabeu. They've only met once in the Round of 16 back in the 2019-20 edition, won 4-2 by the English side. Get ready for what would be one of the best matchups of the season. QuarterfinalsPSG or Chelsea vs. Galatasaray or LiverpoolReal Madrid or Manchester City vs. Atalanta or Bayern MunichNewcastle or Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid or TottenhamBodo/Glimt or Sporting vs. Bayer Leverkusen or ArsenalSemifinalsWinner of Quarterfinal 1 vs. Winner of Quarterfinal 2Winner of Quarterfinal 3 vs. Winner of Quarterfinal 4\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first round of the Florida Swing produced a little bit of everything. Numerous players attempted shots from water hazards, a worrying withdrawal came from one of the game's more popular figures, and even a bird was clipped by the pre-tournament favorite. Unaffected by all of it was none other than Austin Smotherman, who opened his 2026 Cognizant Classic with a sensational 9-under 62 to command the first-round lead by a single stroke over Nico Echavarria.\"Two weeks off, I come out here today excited to play,\" Smotherman said. \"I'm glad I was an early tee time today, too, not having to wait around and maybe see other guys doing what they're doing. But I just wanted to get on the golf course. Felt like the game was in a good spot. \"To be honest, I didn't play a ton when I was home -- just took the rest when I could, knowing I'm about to play as many weeks as I can until my wife is due with our third child here March 23rd. Figuring things out on the road solo this week, and the game kind of followed. It was a pretty easy round on a golf course that shouldn't be this easy. It felt pretty good.\"Smotherman started his tournament with a couple of birdies in his first five holes before he caught fire around the turn. He made six birdies in a row from Nos. 7-12 to catapult himself into a share of the lead. A birdie on the par-5 finisher made it so his name was the one to finish Thursday alone at the top.\nWhile Smotherman and some of his peers enjoyed calm conditions in the morning, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka and those off in the afternoon faced a different challenge. With wind picking up as the day progressed, players were tasked with navigating a more difficult PGA National, albeit still a relatively tame one historically.Experiencing two frustrating tournaments on the West Coast courtesy of some serious putting woes, Koepka came into the Cognizant Classic with some renewed enthusiasm on the greens. However, continuing to wield the TaylorMade Spider putter, he continued to see the same results.The Florida native turned in a round of 3 over, hindered by both his play on the greens and the manner in which he finished. Koepka's most noteworthy connection came from 36 feet on the par-4 6th for the first of two birdies. Unfortunately, his second-longest putt from 5 feet, 5 inches came on the par-3 17th for a double-bogey five, which was sandwiched in between two other fives on the scorecard.\n\"He shot 3 over, so I don't think he played his best,\" Daniel Berger said of Koepka. \"Obviously had a difficult time on 17, but if there's one thing I know, it's he can turn it around in an instant. I expect him to come out tomorrow and play well.\"\nLeader1. Austin Smotherman (-9): If you're going to shoot 62 at PGA National, you are going to make your fair share of putts, and that is exactly what Smotherman did. The 31-year-old made 132 feet of putts, gained over three strokes with the flat stick in hand and did so while 17 greens in regulation. The latter will be the most important on Friday as he goes off in the afternoon when conditions are expected to freshen.\"I felt like I just wanted to hit good putts on the high line all day and just very freeing,\" Smotherman said. \"I'm using no line on the golf ball this week for the first time in a while, but I felt like it kind of just helps with these greens. There's so much movement and the pace that they are, and then with the wind, not to be adjusting and so conscientious of that line, so I felt like that was pretty freeing. \n\"The length of putts that I was making was nice to see, but I also felt like I hit a lot of good putts. The par save on 15 to kind of keep things going, a par save as well on 6 after a bad lag putt, that kind of kept things going. So having those things happen and then a long putt goes in, you're stealing them, and then you hit one close, and you just keep building those holes. Before you know it, you're finished, and here we are.\"\nContenders2. Nico Echavarria (-8)T3. Taylor Moore, Jackson Suber, Daniel Berger, Kevin Roy, Kristoffer Reitan (-4)T8. Keith Mitchell, Joel Dahmen, Michael Brennan, Aaron Rai and nine others (-3)It was not Smotherman who led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday but rather Echavarria. The two-time PGA Tour winner has missed four cuts in five starts to begin his 2026 season with his lone weekend appearance coming as a top 10 finish at Pebble Beach. Despite the volatility, Echavarria insisted that his game was close, and Thursday was proof of that as he too went around PGA National without a dropped shot.\n\"It wasn't the best start of the year, but I did play very, very well in Pebble, and those signature events give you a lot of points, so I'm happy with that,\" Echavarria said. \"The golf hasn't been that far off, and I could tell today that having patience and just enjoying it out there was going to be the key for the day, and we did that.\"\nHow players are reacting to PGA NationalFrom 2006-23, 11 golfers shot 10 under or better at PGA National. In 2025, 38 players accomplished the feat with Jake Knapp even shooting 59. Now, there were some changes between those two periods, including the golf course being overseeded and the par-4 10th getting changed to a par 5, which adjusts a player's score to par. Still, though, if last year (and Thursday) was any indication of the difficulty of this golf course, it may be fair to say that this is officially not your father's PGA National. So, why is that? Just ask Billy Horschel, a Florida native who has been vocal about what has transpired at the venue.\n\"I talked about it last year. This is a really good golf course. It's a very fair golf course. When it blows hard, it's a challenge, and when it's sort of benign like it is today, it's gettable,\" Horschel explained. \"A few years ago, the rough was longer and then they started cutting it down and then they overseeded the golf course. Listen, I think the Tour gets a bad rap, and it's not anything against the owners of PGA National. I understand where they would want to overseed. …This isn't just PGA National; it goes to a lot of courses that we play throughout the years.\"\nWorrying withdrawal from Will ZalatorisWell, at least it is not his back, but a withdrawal shortly before his Round 1 tee time has some worrying about Zalatoris. According to the PGA Tour, Zalatoris' exit was due to a left ankle injury as the wiry right-hander was on the practice facilities at PGA National, gearing up for first-round action before pulling his name off the tee sheet.Zalatoris opened his season with a top-20 finish at The American Express before he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open. Once a consistent contender in major championships, Zalatoris has dropped to No. 252 in the Official World Golf Rankings and is not qualified for any of the four major championships for the 2026 season.\n2026 Cognizant Classic updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookNico Echavarria: 9/2Austin Smotherman: 5-1Daniel Berger: 12-1Kristoffer Reitan: 12-1Keith Mitchell: 20-1Rasmus Højgaard: 24-1Kevin Roy: 24-1The morning should play easier on Friday once again, which will create an opportunity for someone like Michael Brennan to inch towards the lead. The PGA Tour rookie is listed at 35-1 after an opening 68 during which he hit 12 of 14 fairways to complement his jaw-dropping length off the tee. The short game was a little sloppy, but if he cleans that up, he will have a chance heading into the weekend.\n            ",

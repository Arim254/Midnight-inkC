    "body": "\n        Thursday Night Football returns with Vikings vs. Chargers at 8:15 p.m. ET, and the new NBA season continues with Thunder vs. Pacers and Nuggets vs. Warriors on Thursday, providing new users a perfect opportunity to use the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. According to the latest NFL odds, the Vikings are 3.5-point underdogs. Quarterback Carson Wentz is set to make his fifth start for the Vikings on Thursday Night Football, and the model expects him to help Minnesota remain competitive again, making the Vikings to cover as 3.5-point underdogs as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings when online sports betting.The model's two other Thursday best bets at DraftKings come from the NBA, and NBA fans could quickly take advantage of the latest DraftKings promo code to maximize the offer. On Thursday, the model is backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 7.5-point favorites in a rematch of last year's NBA Finals against the Pacers, and also projects the Nuggets to win as +110 underdogs against the Warriors for its Thursday best bets at DraftKings. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past seven seasons. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. The model is on a sizzling 43-28 run on top-rated NFL picks dating back to 2024.

Los Angeles has allowed at least 27 points in three straight weeks behind a struggling run defense. The Chargers are 28th in the NFL in yards per rush allowed (5.1), and the Vikings could have Aaron Jones (hamstring) back, as the Vikings activated his 21-day window to return from IR this week. Jordan Mason has run well this season with and without Jones in the lineup, so containing the run could be a problem for the Chargers. The model projects the Vikings to cover the spread in 52% of simulations. Back the Vikings at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Thunder (-7.5) vs. Pacers (-105)Oklahoma City had a tough time against the Rockets in its opener, but it was also an emotional evening as the defending champions received their championship rings. There are a lot of distractions that come with being the reigning champions hosting the first game of a new NBA season. But on Thursday, the Thunder will be on the road, and the NBA wasted no time in building the NBA Finals rematch when Oklahoma City travels to Indiana. The Pacers will play their first game without Tyrese Haliburton (Achilles), so that will be a tough adjustment for Indiana. The Thunder were the No. 1 team in the NBA against the spread last season (53-25-4), covering in 68% of games during the regular season, and after failing to cover in their opener, the model doesn't see that happening in back-to-back contests. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 53% of simulations. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Nuggets (+110) to defeat WarriorsThe Nuggets are completely rested as they play their season opener on Thursday, whereas the veteran Warriors team began its season on Tuesday. The Nuggets have dominated the Warriors in recent seasons, winning nine of their last 10 matchups, with Nikola Jokic scoring at least 32 points in five of his last six games against Golden State. The Nuggets finished two games ahead of the Warriors last season, with 50 wins compared to Golden State's 48. Denver has the fourth-best winning percentage (.469) as an underdog last season, which creates a profitable outcome. The model projects the Nuggets to win in 58% of simulations, showcasing strong value as a plus-money underdog on Thursday. Back the Nuggets at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more NFL picks and NBA picks?You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Wings were among the many WNBA franchises to enter the coaching carousel this offseason, firing Chris Koclanes after just one season at the helm as they looked for someone new to take over a team featuring Rookie of the Year Paige Bueckers. On Thursday, word broke that they were hiring USF coach Jose Fernandez to make the leap from the college ranks after 25 years coaching the Bulls, per ESPN's Alexa Philippou. Fernandez went 485-317 in his 25 years in Tampa, leading USF to 10 NCAA Tournaments, including in eight of the last 11 seasons. USF released a statement from CEO of athletics Rob Higgins confirming Fernandez's departure and thanking Fernandez for his 25 years in Tampa, building USF into a consistent contender for the NCAA Tournament. \"Women's basketball head coach Jose Fernandez has informed me of his decision to pursue an opportunity to coach at the next level in the WNBA,\" Higgins said. \"While this is a bittersweet moment for our program, it is a well-deserved opportunity for Jose to realize a professional dream, and we are incredibly proud of him.\" Higgins also announced USF would elevate Michele Woods-Baxter to head coach. \n\n        \n            \n                Tempo to hire Sandy Brondello: Former Liberty coach will lead Toronto's WNBA expansion franchise, per report\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor Fernandez, he'll take over a Wings team that has talent, most notably Bueckers and Arike Ogunbowale, but struggled to a 10-34 record in 2025. His chief task will be building a contender around Bueckers and getting the most out of the talented young star. Helping Fernandez to get quick buy-in from his star player will be his close relationship with UConn coach Geno Auriemma, who coached Bueckers at the college level. \"I think he's a tremendous coach, obviously, as everybody knows, but he cares deeply about the game itself,\" Auriemma said of Fernandez earlier this year. \"He puts in the time and effort.\" \nWhat the exact roster Fernandez will have to work with around Bueckers will be determined this offseason. The Wings, like every other team in the WNBA, have a large number of players hitting free agency, as most players in the league timed up their most recent contracts to end in anticipation of pay bumps under the new CBA. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill had his season come to an abrupt halt in Week 4 when the eight-time Pro Bowl pass-catcher suffered a devastating knee injury in the win over the New York Jets. Hill dislocated his knee, and tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL. When Hill was loaded onto the cart and driven off the field, he was seen clapping his hands and smiling. Hill waved to the crowd and blew kisses to fans as well. It was an odd reaction after a painful, season-ending injury, but there was a reason behind it. During a recent appearance on Terron Armstead's podcast, \"The Set,\" Hill said that after he realized his leg was \"crooked,\" he immediately felt grateful for all the incredible moments football has given him, and thought about the time he would now have to spend with his family. \"So I immediately started laughing man, because I feel like I've been able to play this game my whole entire life, and I've been blessed with great talents and great gifts, and the amount of support that I get from my family is amazing, man,\" Hill said. \"I really wasn't even thinking about the injury. I was just thinking about the great times I've had playing this game and just me being in Miami. It all came full circle. I know this (wasn't) it, but I was just happy bro. Because I'm always trying to find the good in everything. I get time to think about my kids, I get time to travel, I get time to like really sit down and enjoy my life and not always train.\"\nHill said his entire life has been about training, living in the gym, on the track, on the jugs machine. He wasn't sacrificing his time for his family or other things he wanted to do. Now, he has this opportunity to get close to his kids, go to church on Sundays and improve the man he is off the field.Anytime a 31-year-old speedster suffers an injury like the one Hill did, it's fair to wonder if his football career could be over. Armstead asked what Hill's response is to the doubters out there, and he had a pretty surprising yet honest answer.  \"Well, at the end of the day, I feel like that decision is all based upon how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,\" Hill said. \"Like right now, I'm happy. I'm happy with being with my kids, I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football. I love it, but it takes a lot. It takes a lot to be the best and to stay at the top and make a lot of money and help your team win games and stuff like that. It takes a lot. It takes a lot on you mentally, it takes a lot on you physically. I'm at the point now where I need to have a conversation with mom, family, everybody ... I don't want to make any rash decisions, obviously. I just want to be in the moment.\"\nHill says rehab is going well and he's attacking every day. Following the injury, Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said that the goal is to be ready for Week 1 in 2026. When or if Hill returns, it likely won't be with the Dolphins. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported that the Dolphins are expected to release Hill prior to the start of the new league year in March. Hill has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary on the books next year, but $16 million is guaranteed on the third day of the new league year, March 14, 2026. If Hill's football career is over, it was one remarkable ride. \"Cheetah\" was the fastest receiver of his time. He won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs, was named a First Team All-Pro five times and led the NFL in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in 2023. In six of Hill's 10 NFL seasons, he crossed 1,000 yards receiving. In his first two seasons with Miami, Hill became the first player in NFL history to cross 1,700 yards receiving multiple times, and caught 20 total touchdowns. \nAs Hill explained, the time to make a decision on his football future is not right now. It's about living in the moment off the field. \n            ",

You can only see his Thursday Night Football DFS picks and analysis at SportsLine.New users can get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5: Top NFL DFS picks, lineups, stacks for Vikings vs. ChargersOne of Kaylor's top DFS picks for Thursday Night Football is Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. The former Oregon standout has quickly established himself as one of the premier young signal-callers in the NFL. In the 2024 season, he threw for 3,870 yards, completing 65.9% of his passes, tossed 23 touchdowns and only three interceptions, finishing with a 101.7 passer rating. He gets to face a Vikings defense in which its last five offensive touchdowns allowed have come via the passing game.Through the early portion of the 2025 campaign, he has already totaled 1,913 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions in seven games while leading the league in passing yards. Despite his impressive production, Herbert has been selected to the Pro Bowl just once, back in 2021, which many consider an underrepresentation of his talent. His combination of arm strength, pocket awareness, and mobility has made him the centerpiece of the Chargers' offense under coach Jim Harbaugh, and he continues to trend toward the elite tier of NFL quarterbacks. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson. The former LSU standout has rapidly ascended into the elite tier of NFL wide receivers, already earning four Pro Bowl selections by the 2024 season. In 2024, he caught 103 passes for 1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns, continuing his streak of five consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. In the 2025 campaign he's maintained that high standard, posting 34 receptions for 528 yards and one touchdown in limited play so far, with an impressive 15.5 yards per catch. Throughout his career, Jefferson has been a consistent target and game-changer, known for his ability to stretch the field and deliver in big moments. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Chargers vs. VikingsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

It'll be Rodgers' first game against the team he enjoyed a significant amount of success with across 18 seasons. \"Feel so good about my time there because damn near everything great in my life is because of my football career,\" Rodgers said in a Zoom call with Packers reporters. \"And my football career starts, and will end one day, with Green Bay. So got a lot of love for all those memories.\"Rodgers has waxed poetically about the Packers in the lead up to Sunday night's prime time matchup between two first-place teams. He made it clear that he harbors no ill will towards Green Bay while stressing that Sunday \"is not a revenge game for me.\"\n        \n            \n                Aaron Rodgers: Steelers upcoming showdown vs. Packers is 'not a revenge game for me'\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" Rodgers said. \"I have a lot of great memories from my time there. There lot of great interactions with fans over the years. You know, living in Green Bay, living in Suamico, living in Hobart, going to Chives, being out and about, seeing people at the Piggly Wiggly and I'm shopping for groceries.\n\"I grew up there. I spent 18 years there, from (age) 21 to 39. So I'm thankful for my time there.\" In terms of ending his career with the Packers, Rodgers likely means from a ceremonial standpoint. It's become commonplace for accomplished athletes such as Rodgers to sign a one-day contract to retire with the team they enjoyed the bulk of their professional success with. It appears that Rodgers wants to end his career in a similar fashion. \nBefore that can happen, though, Rodgers has more football to play and more records to chase, like possibly becoming only the fifth quarterback in NFL history to defeat each of the NFL's 32 teams. He can do that by defeating his former team on Sunday night. \n            \n    ",

Earlier this week, the team had opened the 21-day practice window for the veteran.Jones only carried the ball for 46 yards on 13 carries in the opening two weeks this season. The running back also caught three passes for 44 yards, including a 27-yard touchdown reception against the Chicago Bears in Week 1.The Vikings signed Jones to a one-year contract during the 2024 offseason and Jones ended up rushing for a career-high 1,138 yards that season. Jones chose to remain with Minnesota as he signed a two-year, $20 million contract extension through the 2026 season.\nWhile Jones was on the shelf, the Vikings turned to former San Francisco 49ers running back Jordan Mason, who was acquired in an offseason trade. Mason has racked up 380 yards (4.5 yards per carry) and four touchdowns as the team's primary back. His best performance came in a 48-10 win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3 when he rushed for 116 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups was arrested on Thursday morning, as a federal grand jury indicted him in connection to his alleged participation in an illegal gambling scheme. This was the result of a wide-ranging gambling investigation that included two separate cases of illegal sports betting and gambling. Billups was one of three prominent NBA figures, along with Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones, to be arrested. More than 30 defendants in all have been charged. Billups is accused of taking part in illegal high-stakes poker games tied to La Cosa Nostra, an organized crime family in New York. According to U.S. attorney Joseph Nocella, these poker games targeted high-net worth individuals, which were lured by Billups and Jones. Rigged shuffle machines, X-ray tables that could read cards face down along with special contact lenses and eyeglasses that could read premarked cards were allegedly used to fix these card games.On Thursday night, Billups' attorney, Chris Heywood, released a statement on behalf of his client, saying that the former point guard will fight these charges with tenacity. \"Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others.To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.Furthermore, Chauncey Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.Chauncey Billups has never backed down. He does not plan to do so now. He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"As alluded to in the statement, Billups may also be tied to sharing inside information with bettors as a coach. He was not named in the Rozier indictment, but a person referred to as \"Co-Conspirator 8\" matches his description.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA gambling scandal, explained: What to know as Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier get arrested, suspended\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n The NBA announced Thursday afternoon that both Billups and Rozier were being placed on \"immediate leave\" from their respective teams.\"We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today,\" the league said in a statement. \"Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.\"\nBillups has served as the coach of the Trail Blazers since 2021. During his playing days, Billups was a five-time All-Star, and won an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He had his No. 1 retired by the franchise, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 8 edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" the Los Angeles Chargers play host to the Minnesota Vikings.L.A. enters this game at 4-3 after dropping a wild game to the Colts last week, in which its defense got absolutely set in flames. The Chargers have now lost three of their last four since starting the season 3-0, and they're still dealing with a rash of injuries as they look to keep pace in the AFC West.You can bet Vikings vs. Chargers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Minnesota came out of its bye with a loss to the Eagles, dropping the Vikings back to .500 on the season. Two of their three wins have come against the Bengals and Browns, so they should be looking to prove that they can compete with actual competitive teams as they move into a considerably tougher stretch of schedule over the next two months.\nWhich of these two teams will bounce back and get into the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Chargers vs. Vikings liveDate: Thursday, Oct. 23 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Stream: Amazon PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -3, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 8 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings' passing game has, somewhat surprisingly, looked better with Carson Wentz under center than it did with J.J. McCarthy. Kevin O'Connell has been willing to pass the ball at a higher rate with Wentz in the lineup, and the backup QB has done a better job of both getting the ball out (his sack rate is less than half of McCarthy's) and getting it down the field to his pass-catchers than did the rookie during his early-season stint. \nWentz has had the advantage of having Jordan Addison in the lineup for three of his starts, while McCarthy didn't have him at all, and that's been of tremendous benefit to the offense. Addison has gone for 4-114-0, 5-41-1 and 9-128-0 in his three appearances, and he'd helped take advantage of the coverage rolled Justin Jefferson's way while also allowing more space for Jefferson himself to operate. Jefferson has gone for 22-328-0 in Addison's three games after totaling 12-200-1 in the three games prior to his return.But while Wentz has gotten the receivers going a bit, he's also unsurprisingly undermined the offense himself at times with ill-timed sacks and incomprehensible turnovers. He barely had to do anything in his first start against the Bengals thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns, and in his other three games, he has three touchdown passes against four interceptions. His pick-six against the Eagles last week was entirely inexplicable. Sometimes, he seemingly just has his processor go offline for a play or two or seven, and it looks like he hasn't played football before. \nAgainst a Chargers pass defense that ranks fourth in the NFL in success rate, that could be dangerous. Then again, we also saw the Chargers get absolutely torn apart by Daniel Jones last week, and part of their high success rate ranking is having played games against the Raiders, Broncos and Dolphins. So perhaps Wentz has more of a chance to get going here than it might appear on the surface. At the very least, O'Connell will scheme him into position for success, and then it's up to him to take advantage of being put in those good situations.\nThe Vikings may have more luck running the ball against a Chargers front that has gotten licked to the tune of 5.1 yards per carry and the league's third-highest rushing success rate. Jordan Mason should probably be expected to lead the backfield whether Aaron Jones returns from his hamstring injury or not (he's listed as questionable), and Mason has averaged 4.5 yards a pop so far this year. If Jones is out, I expect to see a lot of downhill runs for Mason, with the Vikings trying to work the play-action passing game off of that. Pick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.When the Chargers have the ballThe Chargers have been one of the pass-heaviest teams in the NFL all season, dropping back on 64.9% of their plays, according to Tru Media. They also have the league's second-highest pass rate over expectation (PROE), according to Establish the Run, and that holds true for both the entire game and in neutral situations. They've been slightly less pass-happy over their last four games as they have dealt with injuries at tackle and running back, but they're still seventh in PROE during that time.\nThe reason this is particularly relevant for this game is that the Vikings have a pretty wide split between their effectiveness against the pass and against the run. According to Tru Media, they rank fifth so far this season in opponents' passing success rate and just 19th in success rate against the run. Opponents have thus been extremely run-heavy against the Vikes, calling a rush on 49.0% of their plays. \nThe Chargers, of course, may decide to go pass-heavy either way. The strength of their team at the moment is Justin Herbert and the pass-catchers. Even nominal starting running back Kimani Vidal, who is filling in for Omarion Hampton, is a better pass-catcher than a runner. He clocked the Dolphins on the ground two weeks ago, but so does everybody. In his career outside of that game, he's averaging around 3.4 yards per carry on his 56 totes. So, don't be surprised if it's a lot of Herbert dropping back and looking for the likes of Ladd McConkey, Quentin Johnston, Keenan Allen and Orande Gadsden II on Thursday night. If and when he does drop back, the Chargers will be faced with a pass rush that blitzes at one of the highest rates in the NFL. The Vikings have sent extra rushers on 41.9% of dropbacks, via Tru Media, which ranks second-highest in the league behind only the Falcons. Minnesota has killed teams when rushing five or more players, ranking third in the league in EPA per dropback. \nWith L.A.'s issues up front (we still don't know whether the starting tackles will actually suit up; they're each listed as questionable), it'll be important for Herbert to get the ball out quickly, which could lead to more work for the underneath targets like McConkey, Allen and Gadsden than for Johnston, who does more of his work down the field. Around 44% of opponent passes against the Vikings have traveled 0 to 5 air yards, according to Tru Media, which is the third-highest rate in football. They've faced bottom-10 rates of throws in the 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and 20-plus air-yard range.The Chargers should definitely at least try to get the run game off the ground, but it could prove difficult with Vidal and practice-squad passing-down back Nyheim Hines in the backfield. (Hassan Haskins is also out -- not that he was particularly effective rushing the ball anyway.) They're not a particularly good run-blocking unit to begin with, and it's not like the Vikings are slouches against the run; they're just not as good against the run as they are against the pass. Instead, this is likely to be a strength-on-strength matchup, with Herbert facing Brian Flores and his creative schemes. That's one of the most potentially exciting matchups you can draw up in the league. \nPrediction\nIn a game where two teams seem likely to have more success running the ball than throwing due to the respective strengths of the opposing defenses, but also probably still want to rely on their passing game to some extent, I'm going to lean toward the team with the quarterback I trust more. That's pretty clearly the Chargers here.Pick: Chargers 24, Vikings 20\n            ",

Williamson was the crew chief for that game, a 20-10 win for the Bulldogs, which featured a number of questionable calls.CBS Sports' John Talty reached out to the league for comment, but was told the SEC \"does not comment on personnel matters\". CBS Sports can confirm that Williamson did not officiate last week, but the rest of his assigned crew did -- and will not officiate another game for the rest of the season for the league. Williamson and his crew took center stage for all the wrong reasons in the Auburn vs. Georgia game. Late in the first half, with Auburn leading 10-0, quarterback Jackson Arnold appeared to score before the ball was knocked out of his hands on the goal line. However, officials ruled it a fumble on the field, and the call was upheld despite replay appearing to show Arnold breaking the plane with possession.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs led 13-10 when Kirby Smart ran up to the side judge and appeared to call a timeout. Once the clock was blown dead, Smart argued he was telling he official that Auburn defenders were clapping in an attempt to create a false start for the offense. The broadcast replay showed Smart making what looked like a timeout signal with his hands, but he and the Bulldogs were allowed to keep the timeout anyway.\nAuburn coach Hugh Freeze and Arnold both downplayed the controversial calls' effect on the game, but the seven-point swing was an obvious turning point in the contest. \n            \n    ",

The Vikings rank second in third-down defense and fourth in red-zone defense as nearly 70% of their defensive possessions don't end up in them allowing points, which is the second-best mark in the league. A relentless pass rush is a big reason for that as Minnesota is third in hurry percentage and fourth in sack percentage.On offense, Jordan Mason has averaged 70.5 rushing yards over his four starts -- all coming in the last four games -- and he has four touchdowns over this stretch. Out wide, Justin Jefferson continues to produce regardless of who is throwing him passes as he's fourth in the league with 88 receiving yards per game this year. No. 2 wideout, Jordan Addison, has also hit the ground running since coming off his suspension with at least 114 receiving yards or a touchdown in all three of his games in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverLos Angeles has the league's leading passer in Justin Herbert (1,913 yards), who is also on pace for a career-high of 452 rushing yards. Herbert leads the No. 3 passing attack in the NFL, and he has a bevy of options at his disposal. Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston all have at least 380 receiving yards, while L.A. found a steal in the fifth round of the draft in rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The son of a former NFL receiver, Gadsden II had a 7-164-1 stat line on Sunday, with the yardage being the fourth-most by a rookie tight end since 1960.The Chargers defense is getting healthier as nine-time Pro Bowler Khalil Mack returned last week after missing a month and notched his second sack of the season. Even with Mack missing most of the year, only one team has allowed fewer passing touchdowns than Los Angeles, and it's a defense which may not be on the field that often on Thursday. That's because Minnesota's defense has logged lots of snaps as of late as the Vikings haven't forced a turnover in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Chargers vs. Vikings picksFor the NFL Week 8 'Thursday Night Football' game of Vikings vs. Chargers, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 45 total points.

NFL player props figure to center on the passing games, with both teams dealing with injuries to their running backs, and there's no shortage of quality receivers to use in 'Thursday Night Football' props. Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston all had at least 67 yards or a touchdown on Sunday. Justin Herbert, who leads the league with 1,913 passing yards has a passing touchdown prop bar of 1.5, which is the same as Carson Wentz, who continues to start in place of J.J. McCarthy (ankle)The NFL prop odds, however, differ for the quarterbacks in regard to passing touchdowns. Herbert is at -164 to hit the Over, while Wentz having multiple touchdown passes would return a payout of +102 Meanwhile, Aaron Jones is active after missing the last four games and has a rushing bar of 27.5 yards. Your NFL prop bet strategy should take into account multiple factors, including recent performances, the opposing defense and even weather conditions.

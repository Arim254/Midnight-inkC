    "body": "\nThe biggest NFL game of the year is just around the corner, as the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will take the field at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl 60. According to the latest NFL odds, Seattle is favored by 4.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite to win Super Bowl MVP, with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye at +240. Much has been made of the dynamic talents and strong defenses on both sides. However, before the game kicks off, the team captains will meet at midfield for the opening coin toss, providing the most avid of sports bettors their first chance to get a win. Wagering on minutiae like the coin toss is a hallmark of Super Bowl betting, as sportsbooks like DraftKings will offer odds on just about everything, from the coin toss to the color of the Gatorade dumped on the winning coach. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White has been analyzing these betting opportunities for years, in addition to being one of SportsLine's top NFL experts -- he's gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, for instance. Now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 coin toss pick.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl coin toss pickR.J. White's coin toss pick: Heads (+100)White's analysis: This is my sixth year making an official pick on the Super Bowl coin toss, and using my unparalleled analysis of all things football, I've compiled an impressive 3-2 record in that stretch, a 10% improvement on the average coin flip analyst. For four straight years, I've made Tails my pick, and it's had a 50% success rate, but now I'm returning to my roots and backing the side that started it all, Heads.Why? They say \"tails never fails,\" but that is simply not true. \"They\" also said the Chiefs never fail, and there's no way the Ravens miss the playoffs, and Joe Burrow will get the Bengals back on track, and Jayden Daniels has the Commanders going in the right direction, and this might finally be the Lions' year. When all of that proved untrue, \"they\" said this has to be the year for Josh Allen and the Bills -- look at all the great teams that aren't in the playoffs!Instead, we get two teams that were +6000 or longer to win the Super Bowl prior to the season playing for the title. This has been the year of all years for defied expectations. Tails never fails? In the year of our Lord 2026? Give me Heads.(Also, as I say every year, only make this play if you're getting even odds. Despite the impeccable analysis above, there is a 50% chance for each side to win this year's Super Bowl coin toss.)Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

    "body": "\nFrom Super Bowl props like Jaxon Smith-Njigba first touchdown scorer (+500) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl 60 three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+330). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the divisional round and then got a red-zone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC title game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which matches Hunter Henry for the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\nWhether you've made Super Bowl DFS picks before, or this will be your first time playing NFL daily Fantasy for The Big Game, you're aware that someone will come out of nowhere to make a major impact. Thus, NFL DFS lineups should comprise more than just big names like Sam Darnold, Drake Maye, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Hunter Henry. The Championship Round saw Jake Bobo find the end zone for Seattle and Mack Hollins lead New England in receiving, so those could be the type of underrated options for your daily Fantasy football strategy and Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineups.Who should you target from the Super Bowl DFS player pool, and who are the sleepers your NFL DFS strategy should consider to help differentiate your lineups when kickoff comes at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday? Before making any NFL DFS picks or locking in Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Super Bowl LX, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.\nThe DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Super Bowl LX and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.Top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of the optimizer's top Super Bowl DFS value picks is Seahawks receiver Rashid Shaheed. After a slow start to his Seattle tenure, Shaheed has come on strong as of late. Over his last seven games, he has at least 50 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five contests. Also, New England is vulnerable to wide receivers finding the endzone against it as just five teams allowed more wideout touchdowns in the regular season than the Patriots. The Pats also gave up a punt return touchdown in 2025, adding to the DFS value Shaheed, who has three return scores this season. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Shaheed to go Over 22.5 total receiving yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Patriots quarterback Maye. While Seattle has the No. 6 total defense, Maye is the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason. So, he won't be intimidated by Seattle's unit, and it was one which was just shredded by Matthew Stafford. In the NFC Title Game, the Seahawks allowed its most passing touchdowns (3) of the year, it's second-highest passer rating (126.5) and its third-most passing yards (370). Add in that Maye has 65-plus rushing yards in two of three postseason games, and he's poised to produce, Fantasy-wise, on Super Bowl Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Maye to go Over 264.5 passing plus rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers in the 2026 Super Bowl. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Super Bowl Sunday, and which under-the-radar Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday's WBA featherweight championship fight between Nick Ball and Brandon Figueroa delivered on its promise of non-stop action. In the end, Figueroa ripped the title away from Ball by scoring a thrilling 12th-round knockout.Both fighters operated as usual, with the 5-foot-2 Ball bullying his way inside where he could operate with a steady barrage of power punches. That strategy paid off well in the first half of the fight, with Ball finding success with uppercuts and hooks at close range.As is Figueroa's usual style, he dug to the body and let his hands go with combinations in close. Figueroa also managed to throw stiff straight shots at times, tagging Ball with jabs and straight right hands.Figueroa began to come on more and more in the second half of the fight, forcing Ball onto the back foot with more regularity as the scorecards seemed to be tightening up.\nThe fighters came together to touch gloves at the start of the 12th round, and with the scorecards very much in the air, it was clear neither man would look to coast through the final round.This led to the fight's most pivotal moment as Figueroa landed a pinpoint left hook that sent Ball crashing face-first to the canvas. Somehow, Ball managed to beat the count, though he was unsteady on his feet.Smelling blood, Figueroa followed up the knockdown with a sustained flurry that eventually sent Ball spilling through the ropes and led the referee to call off the fight just 32 seconds into the round.\nWith the win, Figueroa is a world champion for the second time in his career, having previously held the WBC junior featherweight title, which he lost in a 2021 Fight of the Year with Stephen Fulton.To date, Fulton is the only fighter to hold a win over Figueroa, with Fulton also winning their 2025 rematch.The loss was the first of Ball's career and came in his fourth defense of the title he won with a split decision victory over Ray Ford in June 2024.\n            ",

I'm looking forward to getting things worked out so George can be a Cowboy [for] a long time.\"Pickens was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. After three productive seasons in Pittsburgh, he was traded to Dallas.\nThis past season, Pickens had the best year of his career, catching 93 passes for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns as the Cowboys went 7-9-1 and missed the playoffs. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.Pickens' counterpart, fellow elite receiver CeeDee Lamb recently said that he would have no problem should Pickens end up with a larger contract than his own.\n\"I don't care about that, I just want my man to get what he deserves,\" Lamb said during Super Bowl radio row. \"As for me, I know I'm good. I'm fine. Me and my family, we're straight, and I just want to compete at the highest level and I want to compete for a ring. \"The money will come if you play good, so just play good and let everything else take care of itself.

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis won't be appearing in another NBA game until the 2026-27 season, as he's expected to be sidelined for the rest of this year to focus on getting healthy from hand and groin issues, per Chris Haynes.Davis was traded by the Dallas Mavericks to the Washington Wizards on Feb. 4 in what was a shocking move given the lackluster return Dallas got for him. However, it was clear the Mavs were selling low on Davis in an effort to fast track the Cooper Flagg era. It closed a chapter where Davis' presence served as a painful reminder of what Dallas gave up -- Luka Doncic -- to get him in the first place.\n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade grades: Mavericks, Wizards both make questionable decisions in deadline puzzler\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDavis will now join another rebuilding team in the Wizards, though we won't see the newly formed duo of him and Trae Young (who Washington also acquired ahead of the deadline) until next season. Davis has been out since Jan. 10 after suffering ligament damage in his left hand, so it was expected that he would continue to miss some time. However, while he was still with the Mavericks, the team's phrasing suggested he could return this season. There were even conflicting reports about Davis needing surgery to repair the ligament damage. Ultimately, after seeking a second opinion, he opted not to, which left the door open for a return at the end of February or March.Now, though, it appears the Wizards aren't chancing any further injury risk to their new star forward. Although we won't see Davis in game action until next season, he's already trying to set the record straight before even taking the court.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the trade, there was some suggestion that Davis wouldn't be happy to be joining the Wizards. Given Washington hasn't made the playoffs in five years and has only made it past the first round four times in the last 26 years, certainly one could assume that an aging 10-time All-Star who still wants to compete for championships wouldn't be enthused by the idea.But Davis is focusing on the positives as he joins a Wizards team that wants to compete next season.\"The visit's been great,\" Davis said of his first visit with the Wizards via The Athletic. \"They definitely welcomed me with open arms, spent some time with [team owner] Ted [Leonsis] and [president] Zach [Leonsis]. It's totally different from what they make it seem. I know it's like, 'Oh, they have the stigma of they're not a good team.' I haven't seen the practice facility yet, but the arena is top notch, world class for sure. Seen the chefs and how they take care of the families. It's been great.\"When asked about the outside assumption that he was unhappy with where he landed in the trade, Davis said, \"They said I said a lot of stuff in the other city, too, that I didn't say.\"But as far as his long-term future with the Wizards, Davis isn't making any sort of commitments or promises just yet.\n\"It's hard to say [I would definitely stay in D.C.] without the proper plan,\" Davis said. \"Obviously, it's tough right now with the team. It shows with their record, but adding certain pieces that can change. It's year by year. They just beat the No. 1 team in the East.\"Davis has two years left on his current contract, including a $62.7 million player option for the 2027-28 season. One of the reasons that the Mavericks traded Davis was because they weren't too keen on extending the oft-injured big man who will be 34 by the time his current contract is up. Davis has been seeking an extension, and reports prior to the trade indicated that his agent, Rich Paul, would've preferred Davis be traded elsewhere, as he believed the Mavericks weren't going to give him one.But now that Davis has been traded to the Wizards, a team not exactly associated with a winning culture, talks about an extension may be put on the back burner. At least until Davis sees Washington is committed to building a contending team.\n\"I need to talk with [general manager] Will Dawkins, Ted, Zach, and kind of figure out what the actual plan is, and then just kind of go from there,\" Davis said. \"I talked briefly [Friday] with Will. Obviously, at this time, every year, you want to compete for championships and stuff like that. That's obviously the main focus, getting to that place. Conversations are going to be held to see about getting to that space. I've been everywhere the last two years. I want to see the plan, hear the plan, see the vision. Bringing Trae [Young] here and other things in store, what they're thinking of doing, I want to have those conversations with them and see what happens. The city is obviously phenomenal.\"On paper, the Wizards will certainly have a better product on the floor next year than they do currently. The pick-and-roll partnership between Davis and Young should create a potent offense, and having Davis to mentor Alex Sarr should do wonders for his continued development. But as it has been for the last few seasons with Davis, all of that will greatly depend on his health. At his peak, Davis is one of the best two-way big men in the league. An All-Defensive forward who can easily give you 20+ points on the other end. But we haven't seen that version of him since he was traded to Dallas. Perhaps another change of scenery will get him back to his All-Star, All-Defensive ways, and he and Young can lead the Wizards to the playoffs next season. \n            ",

It was the decision of Syracuse coach Adrian Autry, who stated that the reason Anthony didn't play was not due to an injury.\"It was my decision,\" Autry said. \"This is a physical team, experienced team and it was just my decision. Nothing else. No injuries or anything like that. No narratives about any of this stuff. Again, I made a decision that was my decision today.\"\nAnthony not playing for the first time this season comes days after he logged just 16 minutes against North Carolina earlier this week. In that game against the Tar Heels during an 87-77 loss, Anthony scored 10 points, which was the fourth-most on the team behind Donnie Freeman, Naithan George and J.J. Starling. Syracuse trailed by as many as 32 points before cutting the deficit to six in the final minute.The elder Anthony likely isn't going to be to happy wit the latest development after he appeared to voice his frustration after his alma mater lost to UNC earlier this week. He commented \"SMFH\" on a post from the official Syracuse basketball account on Instagram after the Orange lost to UNC 87-77 on Monday.\nSyracuse sits at 13-11 overall (4-7 ACC) after the loss to Virginia. The Orange are tracking to miss the NCAA Tournament for the fifth consecutive season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- There have been 59 Super Bowls in NFL history, and in that time, there has been one notable scoring play that has somehow never happened: A punt return for a touchdown. Since the first Super Bowl was played in 1966, the game has seen almost every scoring play possible: Safety? Yup. We've seen that before. Blocked punt returned for a touchdown? Already happened. Pick-six? There have been several of those. Blocked field goal for a touchdown? Ask Garo Yepremian about that. Not only has there never been a punt returned for a touchdown, but the Super Bowl is the one game where there has never really been any long punt returns, period. There have only been two returns longer than 50 yards: Jordan Norwood had a 61-yard return for the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 and Kadarius Toney followed that up seven years later with a record-setting 65-yard return in Super Bowl LVII. Toney got tackled five yards away from the end zone to keep the drought alive. \n        \n            \n                Every Super Bowl halftime performer ever: Full list as Bad Bunny headlines Super Bowl LX in 2026\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou know what, let's check out the longest punt returns in Super Bowl history. \nIf a punt return touchdown is ever going to happen, this feels like the year where we could finally see one. Super Bowl XL will feature two of the most explosive returners in the NFL with New England's Marcus Jones and Seattle's Rashid Shadeed. \nThere were only 15 punt return touchdowns in the NFL during the 2025 season and this duo combined for three of those. If anyone can do it, it's definitely Jones, who tied for the NFL lead with an average of 17.3 yards per return. He had two punt returns of more than 85 yards this season that both ended with a score, including a 94-yarder against the Giants in December. \nIf Jones gets in the open field, he could certainly make Super Bowl history. During Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday, Jones admitted that he had just become aware of the fact that no one had ever returned a punt for a touchdown in the Super Bowl. \"I got educated about that about an hour ago,\" Jones said. \"I would love to be part of history.\"\nIf Jones can't end the punt return drought, then maybe Shaheed can. The Seahawks returner has been just as explosive as his Patriots' counterpart.  Shaheed had arguably the biggest punt return touchdown by any player this season back in Week 16 against the Rams. His 58-yard return helped spark the Seahawks to a 38-37 comeback win, a victory that helped Seattle eventually lock up the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. \nShaheed was the only player in the NFL this year to have both a kick return touchdown and a punt return touchdown. Basically, he knows what to do once he's in the open field, so a punt return touchdown certainly isn't out of the question. \nShaheed was acquired just before the trade deadline in November and he's been a crucial part of Seattle's run to the Super Bowl. In the divisional round of the playoffs, he opened up the game by returning the opening kickoff 95 yards for a score in a 41-6 win over the 49ers. The Seahawks speedster is just the seventh player over the past 50 years to enter the Super Bowl with three return touchdowns under his belt (On top of his returns against Los Angeles and San Francisco, he also had a kickoff return touchdown against the Falcons in Week 14). In the previous six instances where a returner came in to the Super Bowl with three return touchdowns, three of the players ended up scoring on a return in the Super Bowl (Desmond Howard, Devin Hester, Jacoby Jones). All of their touchdowns came on kick returns, but Shaheed is obviously in some good company and he has the talent to possibly score on a punt. Back in Super Bowl 50, Norwood became the first punt returner to take a kick back at least 60 yards and that came at Levi's Stadium. The 60th anniversary of the Super Bowl is being played in the same stadium and with two talented returners like Shaheed and Jones on the field, don't be surprised if we see history made. \nJones once had a walk-off touchdown on a punt return against the Jets in 2022 and he'd be more than happy if Super Bowl XL ends the same way. \"If that was to happen, I would love to have that pressure up on myself and just take advantage of the opportunity,\" Jones said. What this all means is that this is the one year where you won't want to be taking a bathroom break when the punt team comes out on to the field. \n            ",

On Sunday, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough.

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- If you plan on watching the Super Bowl, there are two names you might want to learn right now -- Jason Myers and Andy Borregales -- because one of those two guys could end up deciding the game. Those are the two kickers who will be taking the field on Sunday and if recent NFL history is any indication, one of them could have a shot at NFL immortality on Sunday night. Three of the past four Super Bowls have been decided by exactly three points and if that's the case this year, a late field goal could end up deciding the game. The Super Bowl is the ultimate pressure cooker for kickers: Some of them have been able to handle the pressure (Hello, Adam Vinatieri) and others have melted down (The name Scott Norwood might ring a bell). Although the pressure of the Super Bowl has been known to melt kickers down, that hasn't happened in recent years. Dating back to Super Bowl LVII, kickers have combined to make 14 straight field goals in the Super Bowl. So will that streak continue this year? \n        \n            \n                No Super Bowl has ever seen this scoring play: Why Seahawks-Patriots could be the game where it happens\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe two kickers in Super Bowl LX are total opposites, but they do have one thing in common: They're both kicking in a Super Bowl for the first time. \nBorregales is a rookie who is about to become the first Venezuelan-born player to take the field in a Super Bowl. And then there's Myers, who has been in the NFL since 2015, patiently waiting for a chance to play in the NFL's biggest game. For Borregales, the last time he kicked in a \"bowl\" came in the 2024 Pop Tarts Bowl. It might not be the Super Bowl, but any time you kick in a game that features an edible mascot, there's certainly some pressure involved. Whether it's the Super Bowl or the Pop Tarts Bowl or a regular season game, the 23-year-old tries to treat every game the same way. That's the only way a kicker can stay sane. \"At the end of the day, I try to think of it like any other game,\" Borregales said of playing in the Super Bowl. \"Don't get too high, don't get too low. Just try to be neutral.\"\nStarting a rookie kicker in the Super Bowl sounds like something that could be a recipe for disaster, but as it turns out, that actually hasn't been the case over the course of NFL history. When he takes the field on Sunday, Borregales will become the 13th rookie or first-year player to kick in the Super Bowl, and surprisingly, the rookies who came before him have actually thrived. Instead of melting under the pressure of the Super Bowl, rookie kickers have had ice in their veins for the big game. The 12 rookies who have kicked in a Super Bowl have combined to hit 18 of 20 field goal attempts (90%), which is drastically better than everyone else. Non-rookies have combined to hit 145 of 195 field goals, which is just 75.5%. Over the past 30 years, rookie kickers are a perfect 8 of 8 in the Super Bowl. It defies logic. Although Borregales had a solid rookie year, hitting 27 of 32 field goals, he's hit just 55.5% of his attempts since Christmas and he's missed at least one kick (field goal or extra point) in four of his past five games, but no one in New England will remember that if he has a perfect Super Bowl. \nThe Super Bowl is being played outdoors for the first time in five years, which is something both kickers will have to deal with. Myers might have the upper-hand though, because he's spent plenty of time at Levi's Stadium. That being said, he did struggle during his last trip there with two missed field goals in Week 18 (26, 47). Before those two kicks, Myers had never missed a field goal attempt in the 49ers' home stadium, so he's not too worried about kicking there again. \"It was an off day,\" Myers said of Week 18. \"We've had a bye week and a couple playoff games, worked on some stuff, so yea, it's been good.\"Myers is 10 of 12 in six career games at Levi's Stadium. As for Borregales, one thing every kicker knows is that you have to get the lay of the land in the stadium where you're kicking. In the Super Bowl, some kickers like to check out the a stadium a day or two before the game, but Borregales said he does his best work on the day of the game. \n\"Planning for me is a game day thing,\" Borregales said. \"Just because, I could look at the wind today and be like, 'Oh, it might be like this on Sunday,' but you never know until you're actually there. So I try not to really dwell on it. You get an idea of how strong the wind may be, but wind direction, you get it more off of actually just kicking in it, so that's kind of how I'm planning on it.\"The forecast in Santa Clara for Sunday is calling for almost perfect kicking weather: It's expected to be just above 65 degrees at kickoff with wind speeds at less than 5 mph. With weather like that, we could see the Super Bowl record for longest field goal get broken. The mark belongs to Harrison Butker, who hit a 57-yarder for the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII. Not only does Myers have the range for that, but he once hit a 57-yarder at Levi's, which is tied for the second-longest field goal ever kicked in the stadium. The longest field goal ever at Levi's actually came from a former Patriots kicker: Joey Slye hit a 63-yarder in 2024. \nBorregales' longest field goal in 2025 came from 59 yards, so he certainly has the leg for a long distance kick if the Patriots need it. Both kickers will be spending the night before the Super Bowl getting themselves prepared for the game. For Borregales, that means a private therapy session with himself where he harnesses all of his positive thoughts. \"It's really just looking at my highlights, just seeing, look, 'you can do that,' so whatever comes the next day on game day, you know you can do it,\" Borregales said. \"There's no reason to think you can't.\"\nFor Myers, he focusses more on the physical side of things. \"I eat pasta and then when we get back to the room, stretch a little bit, put the Normatec boots on and just kind of relax,\" the Seahawks kicker said of what he does the night before a game. The Normatec boots are worn by hundreds of athletes across multiple sports and they've grown in popularity with kickers. As you can imagine, kickers are very protective about their feet, which might explain why Borregales wore Uggs to Super Bowl Opening Night while every other teammate work Nikes.\nEvery kicker fantasizes about hitting a game-winning field goal in the Super Bowl, and come this Sunday, Myers or Borregales could get their shot at NFL immortality. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's No. 4 Duke against No. 14 North Carolina. Do you need anything else?! Every scouting report starts with the same question: Who are you guarding?For North Carolina, it could look something like this:Freshman guard Derek Dixon will take Duke sharpshooter Isaiah Evans. Running him off the stripe will be essential. Best shooter on the floor, and you can't forget about his drives anymore.Veteran guard Seth Trimble will take Caleb Foster. Keeping him from getting downhill is paramount.Junior guard Jaydon Young will take Dame Sarr. Under-control closeouts will be key because Sarr is shooting just 28% on catch-and-shoot treys.Future lottery pick forward Caleb Wilson will take future lottery pick forward Cameron Boozer. Keeping Boozer off the glass will be crucial.Big man Henri Veesaar will take Duke sophomore center Patrick Ngongba. Pressure him to eliminate easy passing windows and maybe coax a turnover.Vice versa, here's what it could be for Duke:Sarr will take Dixon, who is UNC's primary ball handler. Blow up his pick-and-rolls and don't let him get comfortable because he's a dangerous shooter.Evans will take Young. Don't let him get anything easy early or he could start hunting his own offense.Foster will take Trimble. Find him in transition and don't let him get a head of steam. Don't bite on the pump fakes and wall up on his slippery drives.Boozer will handle Wilson. Box him out and don't let him have more energy than you. If he wants to take a ton of fadeaways, whatever. We'll live.Ngongba will guard Veesaar. Don't lose him on pick-and-pops because he's shooting over 45% from 3-point range. Don't let him go over his left shoulder.Let's dive into the rest of this rivalry showdown.Duke vs. UNC: Need to knowCaleb Wilson vs. Cameron Boozer: The two best players (and NBA Draft prospects) will very likely be matched up. That's glorious theatre. Boozer is stronger and a better shooter than Wilson. Wilson is faster and more vertically explosive than Boozer. Boozer does his work in the halfcourt. Wilson is a monster in transition. Both play incredibly hard and are wired exactly the right way. The winner of this one-on-one matchup could very well decide Duke-UNC.\nCan UNC guard Duke's layered sets without leaking oil? Duke is the best cutting team in the country. The Blue Devils average 12.7 points a night directly off cuts. No high-major team tops that gigantic number. Jon Scheyer's offense is gorgeous because it has so many competent decision-makers on the floor at one time. Duke's top three bigs (Boozer, Patrick Ngongba and Maliq Brown) are all phenomenal passers, and Duke's spacing is usually outstanding. Can this UNC defense find its form again and guard multiple actions effectively? It lost its way with a barrage of coverage busts in early January. If UNC is not connected and communicating, it will get shredded by this Duke war machine. Glass battle: Duke has been the best offensive-rebounding team in ACC play, corralling north of 38% of its misses. It's also been the second-best defensive-rebounding team in league play. Offensive rebounding is often the lifeblood of this UNC team. The Tar Heels average 13 second-chance points per game. That ranks in the 84th percentile nationally, via CBB Analytics. Wilson is a relentless offensive rebounder. Veesaar will stick his face in the fan every single time. That duo is one of the best offensive-rebounding groups in the ACC. Oh, and Jarin Stevenson has at least one offensive rebound in seven of the last nine games. I don't know how UNC wins this game without getting second-chance points. Duke's first-shot defense will be dialed in, but the battle for the boards could flip this in UNC's favor.Where to watch Duke vs. UNC liveDate: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Dean E. Smith Center -- Chapel Hill, NCTV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Duke vs. UNC prediction, pick\nOne extra layer is North Carolina's potent, quick-strike transition attack against a Duke transition defense that has been shaky multiple times this year. Duke's halfcourt defense can force UNC into some hiccups, but if the Tar Heels can get out in the open floor, there are buckets to be had. Ultimately, these frontcourts look close to a draw. Is Duke's backcourt this much better than UNC's? I can't quite get there. Pick: North Carolina +6\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            Duke -6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

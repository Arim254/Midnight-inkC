    "body": "\n        Teams hoping to finally put together a winning streak will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers. San Fran (7-4) has alternated wins and losses over its last nine games and is coming off a 41-22 victory over Arizona in Week 11. Carolina (6-5) has alternated wins and losses over its last five contests, most recently knocking off Atlanta, 30-27 in overtime, on Sunday. The Niners have gotten several key pieces back in the lineup in recent weeks with quarterback Brock Purdy, receivers Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings, tight end George Kittle and offensive tackle Trent Williams all available despite dealing with injuries earlier this season. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. San Francisco is the 7-point favorite in the latest Panthers vs. 49ers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 49.5 up two points from the opening 'MNF' line.

Carolina has covered in five of six games versus NFC opponents in 2025, and its MNF opponent has major defensive holes. The Niners can neither get to the quarterback nor take the ball away as they rank last in defensive sacks and also have the second-fewest picks. That should bring comfort to Young in the pocket, while he also has the league's No. 4 rusher in Rico Dowdle to lean on. Finally, there doesn't appear to be much of a home-field advantage for the 49ers who have eight giveaways versus just one takeaway at Levi's Stadium this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the 49ers can coverA finally healthy Purdy showed what San Francisco is capable of last week as the Niners scored a season-high of 41 points after averaging just 22 on the season. The offense, however, runs through Christian McCaffrey, who leads the NFL in scrimmage yards and is on pace for 1,000-yard seasons both on the ground and through the air. Kittle has also made an impact since coming off IR, with four scores over his last four games, and San won't see the most threatening of offenses come Monday.

The 49ers are 7.5-point favorites after a 19-point win over the Cardinals last week, and with that, the SportsLine Projection Model has San Francisco covering the 7.5-point spread as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings. The 49ers are 3-2 over their last five games, and each of the three wins came by at least 10 points. The over/under for 49ers vs. Panthers is 49.5 points, up two from the opening line. The model is also backing the Phoenix Suns as 6.5-point underdogs to cover against the Houston Rockets in NBA action, and one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on No. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 Alabama at the Players Era Festival in college basketball action to include in Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Last week, with Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings all on the field together, San Francisco put up 41 points against the Cardinals. Purdy had three touchdown passes, and McCaffrey scored three times (twice rushing). Although the Panthers are 6-5 this season, they rank 28th in scoring at 18.8 points per game. Their limited offensive upside may struggle to keep pace with the 49ers, as the model projects San Francisco to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Back the 49ers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (+6.5) vs. Rockets (-108)The Rockets travel to Phoenix on Monday, and they'll be without Kevin Durant, who is out for personal reasons, for what was supposed to be the future Hall of Famer's return to Phoenix. While the Rockets won't have the star they received in that trade, the Suns will have one of the key returns with Dillon Brooks getting the chance at some revenge against his former team. Brooks is averaging 21.4 ppg, forming a strong duo with Devin Booker, who is averaging 26.9 ppg this season. The Suns enter on a three-game winning streak and are 8-1 over their last nine games. Given their recent play and Durant being out, the model views 6.5 as too many points to give Phoenix, projecting the Suns to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. Back the Suns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Alabama (+4.5) vs. Gonzaga (-115)Alabama takes on Gonzaga at the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas, with the Crimson Tide coming off a 90-86 win over No. 8 Illinois on Wednesday at a neutral site. \"I actually make Alabama the small favorite here,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"I'll take the 4.5 in a run-and-gun game that the Tide love to play.

    "body": "\n        Teams on the fringe of the NFC playoffs will wrap up Week 12 as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. The over/under in this matchup is 49.5, up two points from the opening line. San Fran's offense runs through former Panthers standout Christian McCaffrey as daily Fantasy managers always have him top-of-mind when making NFL DFS picks. But the Niners also have the No. 2 passing offense, which makes Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle, all back in the lineup after recent injuries, desirable for NFL DFS lineups, despite their injury-plagued seasons. As for Carolina, its top-10 rushing attack makes the backfield tandem of Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard an intriguing MNF DFS stack.Any NFL daily strategy must include affordable options to balance out the big names with big price tags. Can Bryce Young, coming off a 448-yard, 3-TD game, be one of those options amongst the NFL DFS player pool? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Buccaneers vs. Rams, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Panthers vs. 49ersPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering Niners tight end George Kittle, who has an over/under of 56.5 receiving yards. Since coming off IR in October, Kittle has looked every bit like the six-time Pro Bowler he is. He has four touchdowns over his last four games, also averaging 5.8 receptions and 56.5 yards over this span. He's been the TE2 in Fantasy during this stretch and has at least five catches in all three career games versus Carolina. This year's Panthers have struggled defending tight ends, as just six teams have allowed more receiving yards to tight ends than Carolina, while only seven teams have allowed more touchdowns to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Panthers RB Rico Dowdle, who is averaging over 100 scrimmage yards with three total touchdowns over his last three games. He's clearly unseated Chuba Hubbard as Carolina's No. 1 RB, as the latter hasn't had more than five carries over this three-game stretch. Dowdle entered Week 12 ranking fourth in rushing yards (833) and eighth in scrimmage yards (1,030), and one shouldn't overlook the impact he could have out of the backfield. He tied a career high with five catches last week, going for 55 yards, and only one team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than San Fran. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

This means that Tampa Bay could get Mayfield back as early as Sunday's game against the Cardinals.The Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2 overall, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was the league's leading MVP candidate through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks as they turn to Teddy Bridgewater if Mayfield is sidelined. Mayfield experienced pain in his non-throwing shoulder before in his career after tearing his labrum during the 2021 season.\nA shoulder sprain usually takes a few weeks to heal, but quarterbacks have returned in short order with rest as well.\"You never want to see guys injured, especially your leader,\" Bridgewater said. \"But Baker's a tough guy, man. He tried to come back out there and tough it out for the guys. That says a lot about him.\"Now in his third seasons with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022 when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

Chase, who initially denied spitting on Ramsey, will play in Cincinnati's Thanksgiving Day game against the Ravens after he served his suspension for a Week 12 loss to the New England Patriots. \"What I did was wrong,\" Chase said in a statement he posted on Instagram. \"The circumstances don't matter. My passion for the game is no excuse. There's zero place in our sport -- or life -- for that level of disrespect.\" Chase apologized \"to everyone within the Pittsburgh Steelers organization.\" He also extended an apology to his coaches, teammates, the Bengals' organization and his fans while vowing that he \"won't let it happen again.\" \n\"I do not take anyone who wears my jersey for granted,\" he said. \"I do not take my position as a role model lightly. As someone who strives to lead with character and authenticity, I should have taken immediate accountability for what happened. I am committed to earning back your respect -- not just with words, but with my actions, day after day, on and off the field.\" \nWith his suspension behind him, Chase will now resume the task of helping the 3-8 Bengals get back on track, staring with Thursday night's road game against the Ravens. Helping his cause will be the return of Joe Burrow, who is slated to play for the first time since he suffered turf toe back in Week 2. \nThe Bengals will not, however, have fellow wideout Tee Higgins against the Ravens after he sustained a concussion during this past Sunday's loss to the Patriots. \n            \n    ",

Daniels suffered a dislocated elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks and has not played or practiced since. Daniels, 24, has battled a bevy of injuries this season. He also sprained his knee late in the Commanders' Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed two games due to a hamstring injury. In total, Daniels appeared in just six of Washington's 11 games this season and emerged healthy from just three of them. Overall, he has thrown for 1,184 yards, eight touchdowns and two interceptions and run for 262 yards and two touchdowns, though most of his numbers are down from his Offensive Rookie of the Year-winning 2024 campaign.Quinn said the team had not had internal discussions about shutting Daniels down for the year, even given the team's record. He also did not have an exact timetable for Daniels' return. The Commanders face the Vikings in Week 14 and the Giants in Week 15.\nQuinn said getting Daniels reps down the stretch was important as he's \"learning to play the position at the highest level,\" though he later said the team will be smart with his return.\"You just gotta try to do what's best,\" Quinn said. \"By no means are we careless about that. It's important, not just for Jayden, but for the entire team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels' elbow injury is latest cruel knife twist in Commanders' season gone awry\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMarcus Mariota has played in Daniels' stead. Injuries have been a major issue for Washington this season, with wide receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) having played in just four games and fellow starting wide receiver Noah Brown having played in just two games. Starting running back Austin Ekeler, top pass rusher Dorance Armstrong and a plethora of other players are out for the season, and Washington has lost six straight games to fall to 3-8 one year after going 12-5 and reaching its first NFC Championship game in over 30 years.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Colorado coach Deion Sanders arrived in Las Vegas early Sunday to see his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, make his first career start against the Las Vegas Raiders.Grinning ear to ear, Sanders was the first to greet his son in the tunnel after earning the win and shared his immediate thoughts on his 209-yard, one touchdown performance.\"The check down was right there, when you get that right, it's over,\" Sanders said told Shedeur before they embraced in a video posted by Well Off Media. \"You played good. You gotta just look at the film and evaluate yourself on what went wrong. You did good, though. I'm proud of you. You're holding it down for the family.\"Cleveland's 24-10 win sparked remarks from President Donald Trump and ignited buzz throughout social media centered around the former Colorado star's outing, which included a 66-yard touchdown pass to Dylan Sampson midway through the fourth quarter.\nSanders didn't showed any nervousness during his first start and even shook off a first-half interception to lead the Browns to a win.\"I think I showed a couple of great pieces, and there's some things I wish I could get back,\" Sanders said in an interview with CBS Sports' Tiffany Blackmon after the game. \"But man, a win is crazy. It's amazing. You know? Off of one week of practice. This is one week of practice! So imagine what a full offseason look like! It get dangerous!\"Last week prior to Colorado's loss to Arizona State, Deion said he was encouraged to attend Sunday's game.\n\"You don't want to be his distraction, but not that I would ever would be,\" Sanders said on the \"Colorado Football Coaches Show\" on Nov. 20. \"But then you think, 'You know, he came all the way up here to see you?' So that's even (a) shorter trip to see him. You start thinking that as a dad, you know. Because you know what it means to him if he just catch a glimpse of him before he walks out.\"Shedeur Sanders' mother, Pilar, was also in attendance. Deion Sanders and Pilar separated in 2011, but have been by their son's side for several of the highlight moments of his career, including April's NFL Draft.\"Being able to see my family, that was important,\" Shedeur said after the game. \"I'm happy they was here to be able to witness it.\"\nDonning a cowboy hat and a brown sweatsuit, Deion met with his son briefly met with his before kickoff and the two went on their traditional pre-game walk together.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Carolina Panthers In the Week 12 edition of \"Monday Night Football'' with San Francisco coming off a blowout victory over the division rival Arizona Cardinals, having improved to 7-4 with the win. The Niners have alternated wins and losses every week since starting the season 3-0, and they'll be looking to break that streak and keep pace in the NFC West division race with a victory over Carolina on Monday night.Carolina secured an overtime victory over the division rival Atlanta Falcons last week to improve to 6-5. After the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost on Sunday night, the Panthers now have a chance to take over sole possession of first place in the NFC South, which they can capture with a win on Monday.Which of these two teams will make it back-to-back victories? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the 49ers battle the Panthers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Panthers liveDate: Monday, Nov. 14 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -7.5, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings SportsbookWhen the Panthers have the ballCarolina is coming off an unusual offensive game wherein it did not run the ball particularly well but absolutely exploded in the passing game. The Panthers ran for just 67 yards last week against the Falcons, but Bryce Young went an incredible 31 of 45 for 448 yards and three touchdowns. The 49ers, meanwhile, played a very similar game against the Arizona offense to the one Carolina played against Atlanta's defense: San Francisco held the Cardinals to just 36 yards rushing (on 14 carries) but allowed 452 passing yards as Jacoby Brissett set the NFL record for completions in a game. So, the question here is whether we are treated to a repeat performance on either end of the field. It's worth noting that the Falcons game alone accounts for 22.8% of Young's passing yards for the season -- and he's played in 10 of the team's 11 games. The Panthers want the run game to be the center of their attack, and they're probably not going to go overly pass-heavy unless they're forced into it. \nThe San Francisco defense is banged up all over the place, with Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Mykel Williams and Yetur Gross-Matos all on injured reserve and even guys like Tatum Bethune and Robert Beal Jr. either doubtful (Beal) or out (Bethune). Even Luke Gifford, who could be asked to fill in for Bethune at linebacker, is listed as questionable. And they'll be counting on guys like Keion White, Sam Okuayinonu and Clelin Ferrell on the edge alongside Bryce Huff.The Niners have been slightly better against the run (22nd in success rate) than they have been against the pass (26th), but they haven't been particularly good against either. Obviously, a lot of that is owed to their various injuries; but those guys won't be back for this game. The Panthers should be able to find some success running the ball downhill with Rico Dowdle, and take the pressure off Young to carry the offense. If and when Young does drop back, it would be surprising if Deommodore Lenoir follows Tetairoa McMillan around the field. Lenoir has lined up at left cornerback on all 624 snaps that he's played on the perimeter, according to Pro Football Focus, so the Panthers can generate a better matchup by having T-Mac line up across from Renardo Green if they want. Green's no slouch, but Lenoir is the team's best corner. Young's other weapons aren't much to write home about.\nWhen the 49ers have the ballBrock Purdy returned last week for San Francisco and immediately showed why there was never any controversy about who was going to be the team's starting quarterback, despite Mac Jones having had some success when under center in his place. Purdy went 19 of 26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns, beautifully layering the ball all over the field and spreading it around to the likes of Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and Jauan Jennings. McCaffrey even had one of his more successful games of the season on the ground, rushing 13 times for 81 yards and two touchdowns, and you could see how much more open space he had to run with a greater threat of the downfield passing attack available to San Francisco.The Niners are still going to build the plane around a lot of touches for CMC, who is averaging 24.3 rushes plus receptions per game so far this year. There will be a ton of pressure on Carolina's linebackers and safeties to deal with him in space, and honestly, there just aren't many players at those positions who are equipped to do so -- especially when the players at those same positions also have to worry about getting beaten by Kittle over the middle or up the seam. \nIt doesn't help that Carolina will be without both Trevin Wallace and Christian Rozeboom, robbing the Panthers of both of their starting inside linebackers. Guys like Claudin Cherelus, Maema Njongmeta and possibly Bam Martin-Scott will have to play bigger roles, while there will be even more pressure on the likes of Trevon Moehrig Nick Scott and potential slot corner Corey Thornton to deal with those two demons as well.It'll be interesting to see if the Panthers use Jaycee Horn to shadow a receiver, and if so, whether it's Jennings or Ricky Pearsall, who looked like the top perimeter option earlier in the year before getting injured and missing extended time. The Niners don't have a true No. 1 wideout, so there's not necessarily an obvious man to Horn to follow. If he does travel, I'd bet on it being with Jennings, who aligns on the line of scrimmage more often than does Pearsall, who goes into motion more often.The Panthers' best bet here is to plug up the run game and turn the 49ers into a one-dimensional passing offense and then generate considerably pressure on Purdy. That's easier said than done, obviously, and even if you can do it, you still have to worry about all the various weapons the Niners can throw at you through the air. \nPrediction\nThe Niners looked great in Brock Purdy's return to the field last week, and that was against a better defense than the one they'll face on Monday night. I know the Panthers finally figured out a way to throw the ball all over the yard themselves last week, but that's still an aberration when it comes to their season-long performance. If San Francisco can hold Rico Dowdle in check, I think the Niners should roll.Prediction: 49ers 27, Panthers 16\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK – Three hours of sleep before a Monday morning report time of 10:00 a.m. is usually a recipe for disaster, but for Gotham FC, the hard work was already done. While New Yorkers quite literally scurried to work and school, Gotham players and staff boarded an open top bus near City Hall less than 48 hours after winning their second NWSL Championship, the signs of their triumph clear to see. Trophy and winners' medals? Open top bus? Check. Sunglasses to mask the sight of fatigue and the fireball shots that, at the very least, Championship MVP Rose Lavelle and general manager Yael Averbuch West had taken in that morning? Check.It was a fitting return to New York for Gotham, who had won the title in likely \"the toughest way to get there,\" according to midfielder Jaelin Howell. They entered the playoffs as the lowest-ranked team and knocked off the Kansas City Current, who won the NWSL Shield in record-setting fashion this season, reigning champions Orlando Pride and perennial favorites Washington Spirit to claim the title. Gotham were an atypical No. 8 seed – Jaedyn Shaw's famous \"Underdog my ass\" quote was repeated twice on Monday, including by the player herself, and referenced by outgoing mayor Eric Adams. The team's tangible quality stood out during their playoff run, anchored by a rigid defense that limited the Spirit to zero shots on target on Saturday in San Jose and the individual brilliance of both Shaw and Lavelle. At City Hall, though, the intangibles were celebrated.This year's NWSL Championship is Gotham's first since transitioning from a plucky underdog to a super team, boasting the accolades to back up the label. They have reached the NWSL playoff semifinals in each of the last three seasons and Saturday's trophy lift was not their first this season – they won the inaugural edition of the Concacaf W Champions Cup in May, securing their spot in January's first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup. It comes as little surprise that a star-studded team would reach these heights on skill alone but as Gotahm's players looked back at a successful campaign, the immeasurable aspects of their talents stood out.\"I think we talked about just our grit and our never say die mentality,\" Howell said, recalling that each of Gotham's four postseason goals were scored in the 68th minute or later. \"I think we have a lot of experienced players that have played in very big games and know how to manage games and credit to everybody just for sticking to it and our coaching staff for coming up with the game plans to keep us in the game until we have our star show up and show out, and so I'm just really happy for them and for the whole team.\"\nUnity was a running theme of Gotham's celebratory remarks especially for minority investor Carolyn Tisch Blodget, who joined the ownership group in late 2022 and has taken a more hands-on role after their 2023 NWSL Championship.\"From my perspective, the biggest thing that I felt like was missing last year was I, as an owner, never really defined our culture.\" Tisch Blodget said. \"We went really deep and built out what our mission was, what our vision was, what our values were and we quite literally spray-painted them all over the office and now we know any time somebody is joining Gotham, whether it's a new ticketing person, whether it's a new player, they know what they're joining in Gotham.\"The word \"family\" continued to pop up, Lavelle poignantly remarking at City Hall that \"when you get to do what you love with people you love, it makes the journey that much sweeter.\" True to form, Gotham have a weird family tradition in their embrace of \"Feliz Navidad\" – the Christmas song blared out as confetti poured on the players on Monday morning, an anthem they adopted back in late summer.\n\"Honestly, we played in the locker room because the Spanish girls always want Spanish music and I think that's the only one they could come up with that has English in it, too,\" Howell said, \"so then we would just play every time we won and then it just became this thing so now we go crazy every time it comes on.\"Gotham's trip to City Hall, though, is the result of several different successful journeys all coming together in the same place at the same time. The victory lap in New York is well-earned on both a collective and individual basis, this year's triumph serving as a catalyst for growth in multiple forms.Jaelin Howell's big weekFor Howell, her first NWSL Championship was sandwiched between a call-up to the U.S. women's national team and her flight to Orlando following the City Hall celebrations. The midfielder could earn her first international cap since 2022 in the USWNT's year-end friendlies with Italy, a fitting reward for a strong first season with Gotham.\n\"It's honestly surreal, but I'm just so blessed,\" Howell said. \"I think it's been, I would say a lot of trials the past couple years and so honestly this year, everything coming together, like I said, it's just amazing. All the hard work behind the scenes, coming out on top and so just really grateful and all of them and the club to take a chance on me, where I feel like home and for all to come together.\"The 26-year-old Howell, a prospect with the USWNT when she last played for the team, has found an ideal landing spot after spending the early years of her career with Racing Louisville and embarking on a brief stint with the Seattle Reign last year.\"I think [head coach] Juan [Carlos Amoros] has had this undenying belief in me and I feel like I honestly haven't really had that,\" she said. \"He's helped with my confidence. All the coaches just doing little extra things for me bringing me in. I think also just the world-class players I get to play with every day and learn from -- [Emily] Sonnett and Rose [Lavelle], getting to play with them, Jess [Carter] and Ann[-Katrin Berger] and Esther [Gonzalez], being able to play with that caliber of player has really excelled my game and I've just tried to soak up every moment and learn from them and so I think it's just a combination of all of that but I think it's also the most joy I've had playing soccer in a very long time and so I think that's honestly what a lot of people close to me see when I play is just the joy that I have right now.\"\nNWSL 'building something great'Gotham may be a two-time NWSL champion but they were first-time visitors to City Hall on Monday, the club correcting course after a missed opportunity in 2023 to host any large celebration after a surprise title-winning run.\"Being able to celebrate like this was the single most important thing to me, personally,\" Tisch Blodget said. \"When we came in, obviously we had just come in as new owners, but that was a complete failure of the organization to not be able to celebrate like the team deserved. Our chief business officer who has worked with me for many years, we started planning this on November 24th of 2023. … Our marketing team, our business team, pulled literal heroics to make this day happen, but it was critical to us that our fans got to celebrate. It was critical to us that every single one of our players got to be here and so we pulled it off.\"Tisch Blodget said she also received the congratulations of other owners around the league in being able to pull off the trip to City Hall, describing them as colleagues that further validates her decision to invest in Gotham three years ago.\n\"I think the thing that I have been impressed by the most, that I think has given me the most assurance that we are building something great, is the group of owners sitting around the board table.\" she said. \"Every single owner believes in what we are building, knows that it's going to be a long, hard journey to get there and this is not an overnight success, but that we are building something special, that when we all look back in 10, 15 years, we will all say, 'Wow, remember we know and knew what the NWSL was?' And that's a really shared belief so obviously we're competitors on the field but we are all business partners at the end of the day.\"Tisch Blodget also expressed her confidence in commissioner Jessica Berman, acting as one of the owners who recently gave the green light to extend Berman's deal by three years.\"Jessica brought tremendous stability to this league,\" she said. \"Everything that happened, we were not owners in the league when everything happened, but Jessica has brought real stability. I think she's built incredible relationships with our media partners, with our brand partners and as I said before, I think really helped bring in a group of owners that were like-minded in their belief, willing to invest and willing to really build something together. I think she listens, she is honest and really hears all sides and is so committed to building this league into what we all believe it can be.\"\nThe executive, who is a member of the Tisch family that has a stake in the NFL's New York Giants, said a busy offseason is ahead for her and Gotham's fellow investors, who generally work harder during the NWSL's break than on matchdays. A busy period awaits for the league as a whole – the NWSL faces an existential question about the salary cap, which is reportedly hindering the league's ability to keep its biggest star in Trinity Rodman.\"I can only speak for myself,\" Tisch Blodget said. \"We are currently, I think, the best league in the world. We want to continue to be the best league in the world. That requires having the best stars and it's a competitive global game, which is great. I think competition makes us all better, but we all need to recognize what that's going to take to continue to be the best.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The race for the knockout stages begins to heat up on Matchday 5 of the UEFA Champions League, with just three teams boasting perfect records as the second half of the league phase begins.Two of those standout teams – Arsenal and Bayern Munich – headline the week's action with a meeting in North London, each of them eager to bolster their argument as Champions League title contenders with top spot up for grabs. Elsewhere in the English capital, Barcelona travel to Chelsea for a meeting of two title hopefuls, each of them in need of a big result after hitting stumbling blocks on Matchday 4. Both sides have just two wins in their opening four European matches and though they are still very much in the mix for a top eight berth that takes them straight to the quarterfinals, they will have to meet the moment in order to get there, which is no sure thing for either team.Meanwhile in Paris, reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain will host Tottenham Hotspur in a rematch of August's thrilling UEFA Super Cup. Though Spurs went toe-to-toe with PSG, taking a 2-0 lead before relinquishing it in the final minutes of the game, they have been inconsistent since and were downright drab in a 4-1 loss at Arsenal on Sunday. PSG, though, will be without Achraf Hakimi and could also miss Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue.Here's how the CBS Sports team thinks this week's action will shake out.Don't miss any of the Champions League.

Hansi Flick is using his veteran striker quite shrewdly and will doubtless have games like this one in mind. No wonder given that Lewandowski's previous meeting with Chelsea in the last 16 of the 2019-20 Champions League saw him deliver three goals and four assists across both legs. -- James Benge  Man of the match: Lamine Yamal, Barcelona: We don't want to be repetitive, but when Barcelona are playing all the eyes are always on the Spanish wonderkid who already scored six goals so far this season despite some groin issues that affected his game time in the recent weeks. Lamine Yamal's match on Tuesday will be his first ever game played in England as he missed the match against Newcastle earlier this year. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Chelsea 2, Barcelona 3 - These two may have been inconsistent to start the Champions League season but they have rarely been boring, even on days where things have not tipped in their direction. As the 3-3 draw at Club Brugge on Matchday 4 demonstrates, Barcelona have defensive frailties that are easy to exploit, so count on Chelsea's offense – which has been average in Europe so far this season – to have a go or two at goal. The thing about the visitors, though, is that they can score in just about equal measure and have held up fine without Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Lewandowski is returning to fitness, though, which could give Hansi Flick's the necessary boost to take all three points out of Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.  --  Pardeep CattryBest bet:  Chelsea to win the first half (+175): It's likely that this match ends in a draw, but Barcelona's defense will give Chelsea every chance possible to win if the Blues can hit the back of the net. Even without Cole Palmer, the Blues have found ways to score as of late, and it'll continue facing Barcelona. Hansi Flick's men have been slow starters to matches, and that will come back to bite them yet again as they'll need to fight back in the second half. -- Chuck Booth \nMan City vs. Leverkusen, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Phil Foden, Manchester City: Is Foden fully back? Is he a bit back? Is this all going to translate in an England shirt? It feels like so few questions around Manchester City's homegrown star have satisfying answers on which everyone can agree. The abiding memory of his last outing, Saturday's defeat at Newcastle, was a chance he should have scored. Too often of late even Foden's best games feel more like embellishments on the excellence of others, he could do with a game where he rules the roost. -- James BengeMan of the match: Erling Haaland, Manchester City: We can definitely expect some action from the Norwegian star that recently achieved a historic World Cup qualification next summer in the United States, Canada and Mexico. His numbers are already impressing so far, as he scored 19 goals in 16 matches, including 14 Premier League goals in 12 games and the five scored in the opening four Champions League matches. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Manchester City 3, Bayer Leverkusen 0 - Manchester City are still experiencing growing pains as manager Pep Guardiola leads another rebuild but they have not hit too many stumbling blocks in Europe, entering Matchday 5 in fourth place of the league phase table. They have a favorable game against Bayer Leverkusen, who may have turned the page on the quick but abysmal Erik ten Hag stint, but are still one of the punching bags of the Champions League this season. Leverkusen have conceded 10 goals in four games and there's really no reason to doubt that serial goal-scorer Haaland will add a few more to that count by week's end. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Claudio Echeverri to have 1+ shots on target (+100): This game is a weird one, Leverkusen have won three straight in all competitions, but going away to face City is a tough proposition. The odds expect City to win, and they will, but that doesn't mean that Leverkusen also won't have their chances. In the Premier League, City allow around 14 shots per game, with five of those being on target, so if Leverkusen can get into space, they'll create a bit. When looking into how they'd do that, it's a good time to look at an on-loan City man in Echeverri who is finding his footing and will want to impress. -- Chuck Booth\n Champions League matches on Wednesday Matchup\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    James Benge\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Francesco Porzio\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pardeep Cattry\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chuck Booth\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Roger Gonzalez\n                            \n            Pafos vs. Monaco0-30-00-20-21-1Copenhagen vs. Kairat2-01-02-01-02-1Olympiacos vs. Real Madrid0-11-20-20-30-2Sporting Lisbon vs. Club Brugge2-11-11-22-11-1Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Atalanta3-31-23-22-31-2Liverpool vs. PSV2-02-02-02-03-0Atletico Madrid vs. Inter1-12-22-21-21-1Arsenal vs. Bayern Munich1-12-31-11-11-1PSG vs. Tottenham2-03-12-02-23-0 Game of the day: Arsenal vs. Bayern Munich, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Riccardo Calafiori, Arsenal: If the Gunners are going to extend their clean sheet streak in the league phase they are going to need their star defenders to win their individual duels. You would fancy Jurrien Timber to do the business especially with Luis Diaz suspended for Bayern. Calafiori is eminently capable of going toe to toe with Michael Olise as well, but it is surely on that flank, against one of the best forwards in the world right now, that Bayern will back themselves to have the greatest joy. If Calafiori can hold that side down and make his regular darts up field, Arsenal could emerge victorious in this massive tie. -- James BengeMan of the match: Michael Olise, Bayern Munich: On one side the Colombian striker Luis Diaz has been the best player on the German team this season so far, and had a huge impact on the excellent performances of the side coached by Vincent Kompany. But he, and his three goals scored in the opening four games in the league phase, are suspended. On the other side of the pitch, however, Frenchman Michael Olise has been equally impressive and he returns to London where he played for Crystal Palace aiming to show he's among the best in the world this season. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction:  Arsenal 1, Bayern Munich 1 - Arsenal's defense is as stingy as any, but if there is any goal scorer who can break it down, it is Harry Kane – even without the added incentive of facing the Gunners as a boyhood Tottenham Hotspur fan and academy product. Mikel Arteta's side have a wide range of scorers to count upon to break down Bayern Munich's defense, too, but expect a closely contested game between two of the competition's most consistent teams. Bayern, too, are turning into a defensive juggernaut in Vincent Kompany's second season and might be able to give the Gunners a taste of their own medicine in the process. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Draw (+240): Two of the best defenses in the world will meet and try to push each other to their limits, but these are also situations where there isn't a huge incentive for either team to actually win. Two undefeated teams atop the league phase who are all but guaranteed spots in the top eight of the table, I expect to see a couple of goals but defense will win out here as the points are shared.-- Chuck Booth\n PSG vs. Tottenham, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Micky van de Ven, Tottenham: One of the most impressive performers in Spurs' near miss against PSG in the Super Cup, Van de Ven has only grown in importance since. Not only a defensive stalwart, the Dutch center back is proving himself to be a dynamic progressor of the ball and a legitimate attacking threat, the latter being something Thomas Frank's side are altogether too short on. -- James BengeMan of the match: Nuno Mendes, PSG: With the injury of Achraf Hakimi a lot of the attacking strategies of the French giants will come from the left wing where Nuno Mendes will play and he has a lot of potential to make some problems to Tottenham. The Portuguese winger already scored twice this season outside the French league and we can expect more starting from Wednesday's match. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Paris Saint-Germain 2, Tottenham Hotspur 0 - Paris Saint-Germain may be missing some of their stars but Khvicha Kvaratskhelia can probably hold down the fort in the meantime, especially against a Tottenham Hotspur team for whom few things are going right currently. Manager Thomas Frank maybe should take inspiration from his own gameplan during the Super Cup in August, especially after Sunday's 0.07 expected goals showing at Arsenal, but he has yet to demonstrate an ability to shake his conservative tendencies. Never say never – after all, the pressure's on – but do not hold your breath. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Mickey Van De Ven 1+ shots on target (+410): Tottenham's leading scorer in all competitions, Van De Ven will have an impact on this game. Even if it's not coming from a set play, Van De Ven has the license to get forward, and he does it well. It's still strange that what Tottenham have done is mostly working, but the Dutchman is a key reason why. -- Chuck Booth\n            ",

The Chiefs, who have won nine straight AFC West titles, are in third in their own division, but after beating the Colts in overtime, they reminded us they can't be counted out yet. The Bills, meanwhile, have won the AFC East five years running but are three games behind the Patriots in the win column and already down in the head-to-head tiebreaker. Buffalo, like Kansas City, just needs to focus on making the playoffs at this point, especially after a \"Thursday Night Football\" loss to the Texans exposed real problems on both sides of the ball.Want unlikely stories? How about the Broncos, Patriots, Colts and Bears leading their respective divisions and the Panthers contending for theirs? At the beginning of the season, the Broncos were +300 to win the AFC West, Patriots were +550 to win the AFC East, the Colts were +350 to win the AFC South and the Bears were +600 to win the NFC North, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. None of those four teams earned a single vote in our preseason divisional picks, and I certainly don't think CBS Sports was alone in that.I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The NFL always delivers. There's a huge tripleheader on Thanksgiving, with Chiefs-Cowboys on CBS/Paramount+ being the perfect complement to your Thanksgiving feast. There's another huge game Friday. There are zero byes this week. Beautiful.\nBut before we get there, we have to review a thrilling and, in some cases, surprising Week 12.5 things we liked in Week 12The Chiefs look like themselves again\nFor the past half-decade or so, there was an inevitability around the Chiefs. They'd find a way. Last year's depleted offense made the Super Bowl. Kansas City won the two Super Bowls before that, also made the Super Bowl five seasons ago and won it six years ago. From 2020-24, the Chiefs went 21-7 in one-score games, the best mark in the NFL.And then this year came. The Chiefs entered this weekend 0-5 in one-score games, the worst mark in the NFL. Call it overdue regression or bad luck or life in the NFL, but it was very un-Chiefs-like. When Kansas City entered the fourth quarter down 20-9 to the Colts and Kareem Hunt fumbled inside Indianapolis territory, the game -- and the season -- were in dire straits.\nThen the Chiefs became the Chiefs. The defense got a three-and-out, and the Chiefs scored and got the two-point conversion on the ensuing drive. The teams traded scoreless possessions. Then Kansas City did what they had so often done -- but had failed to do this season -- and converted when they had to have it: a 15-play, 87-yard drive. Unsurprisingly, it was Patrick Mahomes getting it started.\nThen the defense got another three-and-out to start overtime, and Mahomes led another one of those lengthy, agonizing-for-the-defense drives: 12 plays, 81 yards and a game-winning Harrison Butker kick.\nMahomes making big plays late? Check. The defense taking away what the opponent does best (Jonathan Taylor had just 58 rushing yards.)? Check. The Chiefs looked like themselves again, and just in the nick of time.\nJahmyr Gibbs is a superstar\nThere were lots of huge individual performances in huge wins in Week 12. I wish I could shout them all out. Myles Garrett, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and George Pickens are among the ones that would earn top billing if Jahmyr Gibbs didn't do what he did: 219 rushing yards, 45 receiving yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning 69-yarder on the first play of overtime.\nThe Lions needed every bit of it. Detroit's defense was a mess, getting picked apart by Jameis Winston. Jared Goff was up and down, once again looking shaky behind a shaky offensive line. Detroit trailed by 10 in the fourth quarter and was in danger of losing for the third time in four games.Gibbs wouldn't let it happen. His 49-yard scamper to start the rally was even more impressive than the game winner.\nCredit Dan Campbell for not abandoning the run when down. Credit the Lions for making Gibbs the clear feature back; he is playing over 62% of Detroit's offensive snaps this season, a career high, and played nearly 74% of the snaps against the Giants, his third-highest rate this season. He now has three plays hitting 22-plus mph as a ball-carrier this season; the entire rest of the NFL has three combined.They say speed kills, but Sunday, it helped the Lions survive.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Week 12 winners and losers: Jahmyr Gibbs, Patrick Mahomes come up clutch; Bengals, Vikings spiraling\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCowboys don't give upThis play has been making the rounds on social media, but if you haven't seen it yet, you should.\nThat play embodied the Cowboys' remarkable 21-point comeback in an eventual 24-21 win over the Eagles.\nWe've seen plenty of Cowboys teams go down and go out with a whimper. In fact, entering Sunday, the Cowboys were 1-16-1 in their previous 18 games when they trailed by double digits at any point. Twelve of those losses were by double digits. And Sunday, it looked like it would go that way again. The Eagles scored touchdowns on each of their first three drives. Dallas' first four drives? Turnover on downs, punt, fumble, interception.But they hung in there. They got contributions from everyone, not just the stars. Kavontae Turpin's big catch jumpstarted the first scoring drive. Sam Williams forced a Saquon Barkley fumble. Alijah Clark and Markquese Bell helped force the above fumble, and long snapper Trent Sieg recovered it.And then, of course, there are the stars. Dak Prescott was excellent after an awful start. Pickens is a star finally fulfilling his vast potential. At this point in the season, we're understanding a team's strengths and weaknesses, and sometimes, intangibles like toughness and persistence qualify. Dallas showed plenty of both.\n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys overcome self-inflicted wounds vs. Eagles for future-altering win, keep playoff hopes alive\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSilver lining for Bengals defenseIt's shaping up to be another lost year for the Bengals, in large part to a defense that remains a mess. But DJ Turner shouldn't be included in that. The third-year cornerback has been one of the game's best this season, and Sunday, he was targeted just once and was a big reason Stefon Diggs had just two catches for 20 yards.Turner is Pro Football Focus' third highest-graded cornerback in coverage this season, and his 15 passes defensed are tied for the league lead. His 44% completion percentage allowed is fourth-best in the NFL among all players who have been the primary defender at least 40 times.\nOnly one player has more than two catches in a game with Turner as the primary defender this season. Only one player has had 50 yards in a game with Turner as the primary defender this year. Simply put, Turner has been a shutdown corner in every sense of the word.\nMike Kafka gets aggressiveI have been impressed with Kafka, whose Giants have played two strong teams down to the wire since he took over as coach following the Brian Daboll firing.On Sunday, the Giants scored not one but two circus touchdowns, one thrown by Jameis Winston and one caught by Jameis Winston. I'd like to see Kafka get serious consideration for the Giants' full-time gig -- he has interviewed for head coaching jobs in the past -- but if he doesn't, he's certainly emptying the playbook.\nThe decision that drew plenty of questions, though, was going for it on fourth-and-6 from the Giants 6-yard line, leading 27-24 with under two minutes left. Winston threw incomplete for Theo Johnson, the Lions got a Jake Bates field goal at the buzzer, and to overtime they went.\nI like the idea to go for it. Here's why:By being up three instead of six, the Lions don't have to go for it on fourth down. Essentially, the offense may have one fewer down to use.The Lions took over at their own 6-yard line. Had the Giants opted for a field goal and kicked off, the Lions likely would have started at their own 30-yard line or better.Most importantly ... the Giants had a chance to seal the game right there! \"My pass to the right to Theo Johnson, if it is four inches to the left, that's a touchdown, and we finish the game,\" Winston said postgame.If the Giants had kicked a field goal and given up a touchdown to lose by one in regulation, would that have been a better coaching job by Kafka? The result obviously didn't go his way, but I was more than OK with the process.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 12 overreactions: Chiefs save season? Browns should stick with Shedeur Sanders? Steelers collapsing?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n5 things we didn't like in Week 12The Bills have WR problemsOne of the aspects Josh Allen receives so much credit for is his ability to lift those around him -- the fact that he can lift an offense to elite heights despite not having a true No. 1 wide receiver.But wouldn't it be nicer if he, you know, had a No. 1 wide receiver?In the Bills' 23-19 loss to the Texans, Allen was sacked a career-high eight times. His average completion to a wide receiver was thrown a minuscule 3.9 yards downfield on average, and that number would have been even smaller without a miracle fourth-and-27 lateral-aided conversion.\nThis is nothing new. Allen's average completion to a wide receiver this year is traveling just 6.3 yards downfield on average, the lowest number in the NFL. In fact, Allen and Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel are the only players under 6.5. That's inexcusable company for arguably the league's most physically gifted quarterback.Josh Allen air yards per completion to WRsNFL rank20189.75th20198.025th20208.118th20218.316th202210.03rd20238.219th20246.731st20256.334thAllen was always going to have to rein it in from his uber-aggressive early-career tendencies, but this current offense has nerfed him of one of his greatest strengths. Five of his 12 completions to wide receivers on Thursday were thrown behind the line of scrimmage. The Bills were without Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) and Keon Coleman (healthy scratch), their two best downfield threats. But even that designation is not a great sign. Kincaid is a tight end, not a wide receiver. Coleman is a contested-catch guy, not someone who creates separation downfield.Buffalo has made several measures (mostly half-measures) at wide receiver since trading away Diggs after the 2023 season. Allen needs a full-fledged downfield threat to restore him to his best and most dangerous level of play.Jaguars keep making major mistakesEvery time you want to believe in the Jaguars, they give you the biggest possible reason not to: They simply are not trustworthy. On Sunday, Jacksonville eked out a 27-24 win over the lowly Cardinals, and I fully believe all wins are good wins. Jacksonville would be a playoff team if the postseason started today.But wouldn't it be nice if they could just win in a little more straightforward fashion? Trevor Lawrence threw three interceptions and had a fumble that Walter Nolen caught in midair and returned for a touchdown. (Note: We here at \"Five Things\" are huge fans of big-man touchdowns.)\nAgain, good for the Jaguars for winning despite four turnovers. Travis Etienne has been awesome. Devin Lloyd is a star. Lawrence shows flashes, which makes his bad plays all the more frustrating. It just seems like every step forward has a step back with this team. The Jaguars will be playing meaningful late-season football, and even though it didn't happen Sunday, these errors will come back to bite them if they continue.Everyone feels the need to have a Shedeur Sanders take\nShedeur Sanders' first start was fine. Not great. Not awful. Not even particularly good or bad. His best throw was a beautiful 52-yarder rolling to his right. His first career touchdown pass was a swing pass behind the line of scrimmage that Dylan Sampson took 66 yards to the house. He also threw a bad interception. The overall numbers -- 11 for 20 for 209 yards, one touchdown, one interception and one sack -- are meh.And guess what? It's fine to leave it at that. The Browns led almost the entire way thanks to the Raiders being completely hopeless offensively. The game plan was among the more conservative you'll see in modern football. I mean, the Browns had 11 first downs all game long, tied for the second-fewest by any team in a win this year.And, again, that's fine. This was a fifth-round rookie making his first NFL start. He wasn't a disaster, like many in that position have been. He wasn't a star. If anything, feel good for Sanders the human being, who has been under intense scrutiny unlike any fifth-round pick ever. He's the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since 1995, and he was genuinely ecstatic. Good for him!The Browns are going to keep him as their starter, which, as my colleague Ryan Wilson explained, is absolutely the right idea -- not because he was awesome or is destined to solve Cleveland's quarterback woes, but simply because they need to learn more about him. We can leave it at that.\n        \n            \n                What are the Browns doing if Shedeur Sanders isn't starting the rest of the season?\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Raiders are a messAs for the team Sanders beat, the Raiders are in a wretched position. They hired a 74-year-old coach (Pete Carroll), traded for a soon-to-be-35-year-old quarterback (Geno Smith) and spent $6 million on an offensive coordinator they just fired (Chip Kelly). Carroll's son Brennan is the team's run game coordinator/offensive line coach. Raiders ball carriers are averaging 0.40 yards per carry before contact, on pace to be the lowest on record, and Smith just got sacked 10 times.Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?The Raiders could use a significant upgrade -- and in some cases multiple significant upgrades -- at every spot on the roster that isn't tight end or running back. Is Carroll willing to see that out? Is Tom Brady, who has become more involved in the football operations and helped his former teammate as general manager, the right guy to do that while he also handles his broadcasting duties? What even is Brady's role, really?Being directionless is even worse than being very bad. Both apply to Las Vegas.Derrick Henry's struggles\nHenry scored two touchdowns in a 23-10 Ravens win over the Jets but had just 64 yards on 21 carries. He's down to 4.7 yards per carry on the season, and while that number is fine, he simply hasn't been the explosive force we saw him be as recently as Week 1 of this season.Some notes to consider ...Henry has forced 16 missed tackles this season per PFF. Last year he forced 87. The year before, 69. Since becoming a full-time starter, his career low is 36, and that came in 2021, when he only played in eight games.His 8.6% tackle avoidance rate ranks 61st out of 65 players who have at least 50 carries this year.His tackle avoidance rate prior has never been below 18.8% in a season he was healthy.The Ravens have won five straight, but they know the offense isn't where it needs to be in order to be a contender. Perhaps Henry can have a Thanksgiving feast against the Bengals' struggling run defense, and the Ravens hope that will spark a late-season surge.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Everyone wants to be in business with Caitlin Clark, even NBA superstars like Stephen Curry. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Under Armour's inability to sign Clark played a role in Curry's long-term relationship with the brand deteriorating before ultimately ending earlier this month. Curry had been with Under Armour since 2013, prior to his ascension to the top of the sport, but the two sides parted ways earlier this month. Curry's standalone venture, \"Curry Brand,\" will continue independently, and, as a sneaker free agent, he is free to wear other brands. \"Under Armour believed in me early in my career and gave me the space to build something much bigger and more impactful than a shoe,\" Curry said in a press release. \"I'll always be grateful for that.\"While Under Armour believed in Curry earlier than most, the Warriors star and his camp had grown \"frustrated\" with the company in recent years. Via Bloomberg:\nCurry and his advisers became frustrated by what they viewed as underinvestment in the brand, according to people familiar with the situation who asked to not be identified because details of the relationship are private. Meanwhile, the division's sales weren't meeting the company's or Curry's expectations, the people said.Part of Curry's frustration reportedly stemmed from Under Armour's failed attempt to sign Clark when the women's basketball phenom was on the market early last year. Clark ultimately signed an eight-year, $28 million deal with Nike, which included a signature shoe. Here's Bloomberg again:One sore point for Curry was the attempt last year to recruit Caitlin Clark to join his brand, according to people familiar with the matter. He and the company pursued the phenom, but Under Armour's offer trailed the total value of Nike's pitch, the people said. Clark, now a star in the WNBA, opted to sign with Nike.After Clark signed with Nike, The Wall Street Journal reported the respective offers she received at the time. While Under Armour's offer was better on a per-year basis, it was significantly shorter than Nike's offer. Caitlin Clark's reported shoe deal offersCompanyOfferNike8 years, $28 millionUnder Armour4 years, $16 million Adidas4 years, $6 millionPumaWalked awayIn August, Nike made Clark a \"Signature Athlete,\" introduced her unique logo and confirmed that her first signature shoe will be released in 2026. Sneaker insider and expert Nick DePaula told Front Office Sports that the shoe could be worth over $100 million to Nike. However much Nike ends up making on Clark's shoe, it will be far more than the $28 million they gave her -- nevermind what they make on merchandise and Clark's \"Player Edition\" shoes. \nUnder Armour's decision to not do whatever it took to sign Clark -- one of the most popular athletes in America with a rabid fanbase -- seemed short-sighted at the time. It only looks worse now that Curry has walked as well. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The third AP Top 25 poll of the 2025-26 season was released Monday, and despite a push from Arizona, Purdue remains the No. 1-ranked team. The Boilermakers leapfrogged Houston last week for the top spot in the poll after recording a statement win over Alabama and received 46 first-place votes this week to remain No. 1.Arizona comes off a statement 71-67 win on the road over UConn. The Wildcats jumped two spots to No. 2 and received 11 first-place votes in the poll. Houston also received first-place votes.The Wildcats boast arguably the nation's best résumé so far. Arizona already has wins over Florida, UCLA and, most recently, UConn. The Wildcats face Auburn and Alabama before the calendar turns to the new year.Speaking of Alabama, Nate Oats' team jumped back into the top 10 after a 90-86 win over Illinois. The Crimson Tide jumped three spots to No. 8 after picking up their second top-10 win.\nAnother winner from last week was Michigan State. The Spartans made a statement with an 83-66 win over Kentucky in the Champions Classic behind the stellar play of Jaxon Kohler, who has finished as the leading scorer in three of MSU's first five games. MSU jumped six spots to No. 11.AP Top 251. Purdue (46)2. Arizona (11)3. Houston (4)4. Duke5. UConn6. Louisville7. Michigan8. Alabama9. BYU10. Florida11. Michigan State12. Gonzaga13. Illinois14.

The voters already showed willingness to move teams out of the No. 1 spot (see Houston and Purdue the last few weeks) despite either of those teams not losing. One can certainly make the case that Purdue should remain No. 1 until it sustains a loss, but Arizona should be the top-ranked team in the poll. No team in the country has a better résumé. The Wildcats recorded three ranked wins, including one against UConn. It was also surprising that the Wildcats only received 11 first-place votes.Indiana enters the pollFor the first time this season, Indiana gets ranked in the AP poll. The Hoosiers are off to a 5-0 start in Year 1 of the Darian Devries era and have a 23-point win on the résumé over Marquette. Indiana faces a tough stretch coming up, with nonconference games against Kansas State, Louisville and Kentucky. Tucker DeVries, the son of the coach, is also off to a strong start. He averages19.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists after injury cut last season short. Kansas drops outKansas is out of the AP Top 25. Kansas is off to a 3-2 start with losses against North Carolina and Duke so far. The Jayhawks have been without star guard Darryn Peterson, the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, for the last three games. It's unclear when he will return to the lineup. Kansas embarks upon upcoming stretch against Syracuse, UConn, Missouri and NC State before Big 12 play begins. \n            ",

    "body": "\nIf Thursday's sports schedule is the main course of the Thanksgiving week sports-viewing feast, then Monday's is the pass-around appetizer. It's just satisfying enough to whet your appetite but not too much to ruin what's to come. Today's action centers around a Monday Night Football game with playoff implications: the San Francisco 49ers and Carolina Panthers battling at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The 49ers (7-4) sit in third place in the NFC West and are clinging onto the third and final wild card spot in the NFC. Meanwhile, the Panthers (6-5) have been one biggest surprises in the NFL this season and can overtake the struggling Buccaneers (6-5) for the lead in the NFC South with a victory on Monday.The matchup will pit San Francisco running back Christian McCaffrey against his former team for the first time. The all-around star played his first 5½ seasons in Carolina before he was traded to the 49ers midway through the 2022 season for a package of picks. This year, he leads the NFL in scrimmage yards (1,439) and is just the third player in NFL history with 700-plus rushing yards and 700-plus receiving yards through 11 games, joining Marshall Faulk (1998) and Roger Craig ('85).On Monday, McCaffrey will face a Panthers defense that ranks 18th in the league in yards per game allowed (325.9). San Francisco is a 7.5-point favorite against Carolina.While 49ers vs. Panthers is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes and a 10-game NBA slate and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Nov. 24. All times Eastern.NFL best bets, where to watchPanthers at 49ersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Santa Clara, Calif . | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: 49ers -7.5 | Expert: Panthers +7 (Larry Hartstein)\nAfter missing the previous six games with a turf toe injury, quarterback Brock Purdy returned for San Francisco last week and played well, completing 19-of-26 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns and zero interceptions in a 41-22 victory against the Cardinals. On Monday, he will line up against a Carolina defense that ranks 16th in the NFL in pass defense (212.8 yards per game). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says the 49ers have a 56% chance to cover and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to San Francisco -7.5. However, Panthers quarterback Bryce Young is coming off the best game of his career: 31-of-45 passing for a franchise-record 448 passing yards and three touchdowns against what was the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL (Atlanta). \"Over the past four games, San Francisco ranks 30th in success rate allowed,\" Hartstein says. \"Since Week 4, the 49ers are last with a 27% pressure rate.\"More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for 49ers-PanthersModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's Bryce Young and Brock Purdy player propsModel's Christian McCaffrey, Rico Dowdle player propsSportsLine AI's same-game parlay picksWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at RaptorsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers -2.5\nTwo of the top teams in the Eastern Conference standings collide when the streaking Toronto Raptors host the Cleveland Cavaliers at Scotiabank Arena. After starting the season 1-4, the Raptors (12-5) have won 11 of their last 12 and sit in second place in the East, 2.5 games behind the red-hot Pistons. Toronto also has won its last five home games. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers (12-6) are in third place in the East. They will be playing the second game of a back-to-back after beating the Clippers in Cleveland 120-105 on Sunday. The Cavaliers rank sixth in the NBA in defensive efficiency (111.9 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says Cleveland has a 58% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Cavaliers -2.5.Rockets at SunsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Phoenix | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Suns +6.5 | Expert: Alperen Sengun Over 16.5 total rebounds + assists -114 (Mike Barner)\nThis was supposed to be Kevin Durant's first game back in Phoenix after the organization traded him to the Houston Rockets in the offseason. But Durant will miss Monday's game (as well as Wednesday's at Golden State) due to a family matter. The 37-year-old Durant leads the team in scoring (24.6 points per game) while shooting 48.5% from the field, so multiple Houston players will have to take on a bigger offensive load on Monday. That's one of the reasons why Barner is backing Sengun. \"For the season, he is averaging 10.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists,\" Barner says. In addition the SportsLine Projection Model says the Suns, who have won eight of their last nine, have a 68.0% chance to cover and assigns a moderate \"B\" grade to Phoenix +6.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 AlabamaTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Las Vegas | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Alabama +4.5 | Expert: Alabama +4.5 (Thomas Casale)\nThe four-day Players Era tournament tips off on Monday with nine games. None arguably is bigger than the Alabama Crimson Tide (3-1) taking on the Gonzaga Bulldogs (5-0) in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Crimson Tide already have played a murderous schedule this season, beating No. 5 St. John's, losing to No. 2 Purdue and knocking off No. 8 Illinois. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs have faced only one ranked team, No. 23 Creighton. Monday's game may come down to Alabama's backcourt against Gonzaga's frontcourt. The Tide are led by guards Labaron Philon Jr. (20.5 points per game) and Aden Holloway (17.7), while the Bulldogs rely on forwards Graham Ike (17.0) and Braden Huff (14.8). The SportsLine Projection Model says Alabama has a 51% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Crimson Tide +4.5. Meanwhile, Casale actually makes Alabama a small favorite. \"I'll take the 4.5 in a run-and-gun game that the Tide love to play,\" he says.\n            ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        If you bet favorites over the Christmas Day slate, you essentially received coal in your stocking. Every underdog was able to hang around for the NFL's holiday tripleheader despite backup quarterbacks taking over the slate. Is that a sign of things to come as we continue forward through Week 17? We sure hope so, considering that handful of our best bets for the week include a couple of underdogs not just covering but pulling off the outright upset. Given that it's the holiday season, you've likely been neck deep in parties, gifts, and various other non-NFL related activities. If that has you feeling like you've taken your eye too much off the ball to make confident wagers this weekend, allow this to be your belated Christmas present. Below, you can find our best bets of the week along with picks for every other game remaining on the slate. All odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo BillsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThe Bills defense has me worried about its ability to go far in the postseason. They haven't paid for it yet, as they are 4-0 when they give up 31 points or more this season, but that's not sustainable, especially against a team like Philadelphia. This could specifically be a game where Saquon Barkley explodes, continuing his late-season resurgence that includes rushing for at least 120 yards in two of his past three games. Buffalo is giving up 5.4 yards per carry this season, which ranks as the second-highest mark in the NFL and trails only the Giants (5.5 yards per carry). For reference, the last time Barkley faced New York, he posted 150 yards on just 13 carries in Week 8. \nWhen you pair that mismatch with an improved Jalen Hurts (five touchdowns and zero interceptions over his last two games), Philly should have little problem moving the football. While Josh Allen and James Cook form one of the best one-two punches in the league, the Eagles defense allows just 5.0 yards per play this season, which ties for the fifth-lowest mark in the NFL. This smells like an upset.Projected score: Eagles 27, Bills 24The pick: Eagles +1.5Arizona Cardinals at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThe Bengals offense is finally looking like the unit we expected now that it is fully healthy, and it is coming off a Week 16 win over the Dolphins, where it dropped a season-high 45 points. Now, they take on an Arizona team that has lost seven straight entering Week 17 and is allowing 31.8 points per game since Week 6, the highest mark in the NFL over that span. This sets the stage for another high-flying day of offense for Joe Burrow's unit. Even when you account for the shutout loss to the Ravens in Week 15, Cincinnati is averaging 27.7 points per game since Burrow returned from injury in Week 13. \nAs always with the Bengals, the concern isn't whether they can score; it's whether the defense can fend off the opponent enough to pull out the win. Against this Cardinals team, I expect it to hold up its end of the bargain. Over the last three games, the Cardinals offense has averaged just 18.7 points per game. Even if Cincinnati's defense gives up a tick more than that average, the offense is potent enough to pull out the win and cover the spread.Projected score: Bengals 33, Cardinals 23The pick: Bengals -7.5Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis ColtsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nHand up, I did not think the Jaguars were capable of going into Denver and beating the Broncos. Throughout the season, I've been skeptical about how high Jacksonville's ceiling really is, but it has proven me wrong time and time again. No more. I'm looking at them as a serious player in the AFC and treating them like one of the conference's elite clubs. If they can go to Mile High and win, they are more than capable of pulling out a victory at Lucas Oil Stadium by more than a touchdown. Over his past six games, Trevor Lawrence is averaging 8.4 yards per attempt, has 19 total touchdowns and a passer rating of 108.7. All of those are the highest marks in the NFL over that stretch. Lawrence should be able to outduel Philip Rivers, who will be playing on a short week.\nProjected score: Jaguars 27, Colts 20The pick: Jaguars -5.5New Orleans Saints at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)\nI wrote about it on Monday in my weekly Cover 32 column, but it's worth pointing out again: Cam Ward is enjoying a full-fledged breakout. Over his last three games, he's 2-1 and has Tennessee averaging 27 points per game, while he's totaled six touchdowns and just one turnover, giving him a 97.9 passer rating. While Tyler Shough has been good himself, I think Ward will have a more balanced point of attack in this game. New Orleans' backfield is so banged up that Taysom Hill led the team with 12 rushing attempts last week, and the team as a whole dropped back to pass 50 times. That's too lopsided and creates a one-dimensional offense that is much easier to slow down. On the Tennessee side, Tony Pollard has rushed for at least 100 yards in three straight games, and Ward is getting serviceable contributions from his pass catchers like Chig Okonkwo, Tyjae Spears, and Elic Ayomannor. The Titans are live dogs.Projected score: Titans 23, Saints 21The pick: Titans +2.5Rest of the bunchTexans at Chargers (Saturday)Projected score: Texans 23, Chargers 21The pick: Texans +1.5\nRavens at Packers (Saturday)Projected score: Packers 24, Ravens 17The pick: Packers -4.5Patriots at JetsProjected score: Patriots 30, Jets 16The pick: Patriots -13.5Steelers at BrownsProjected score: Steelers 21, Browns 20The pick: Browns +3Seahawks at PanthersProjected score: Seahawks 27, Panthers 21The pick: Panthers +7Buccaneers at DolphinsProjected score: Buccaneers 27, Dolphins 20The pick: Buccaneers -5.5\nGiants at RaidersProjected score: Raiders 23, Giants 17The pick: Raiders +1.5Bears at 49ers Projected score: 49ers 30, Bears 24The pick: 49ers -3Rams at Falcons (Monday)Projected score: Rams 30, Falcons 20The pick: Rams -7.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Florida International Panthers face the UTSA Roadrunners in the 2025 First Responder Bowl on Friday night. FIU is coming off a 56-16 win at Sam Houston  State on Nov. 29, while UTSA dropped a 27-24 decision to Army that same day. FIU (7-5), who finished tied for fourth in Conference USA at 5-3, have won four in a row. UTSA (6-6), who tied for sixth in the American Conference, have won two of three. Both sides are expected to be down multiple key players due to injuries and the transfer portal, with FIU particularly decimated in the secondary. FIU's quarterback situation is a bit unclear as well after Keyone Jenkins and Joe Pesansky both dealt with injuries late in the season. Both could play in some capacity on Friday. Kickoff from Gerald J. Ford Stadium in Dallas is at 8 p.m. ET. The Roadrunners are 7-point favorites in the latest FIU vs. UTSA odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 61.5, up four from the opening line.

But if I wait on Adebayo, then this ML probably isn't playable. Since it's the front end of a back-to-back for Miami, I tend to think the team gives him that extra day off, and he plays Saturday back at home.

    "body": "\n        Michigan has hired former longtime Utah coach Kyle Whittingham as the 22nd coach in program history, the school announced on Friday. Whttingham, 66, stepped down in December after 21 seasons leading the Utes, and he left the door open to continuing his legendary coaching career elsewhere. He'll do just that under a five-year deal through the 2030 season with the Wolverines. CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz first reported Whittingham's impending hire on Friday. Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck is expected to follow Whittingham to Michigan to assume the same position, while BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill is expected to be one of the names of interest to fill that role for the Wolverines under the new regime, sources confirmed to Zenitz. \"We are honored to lead the outstanding student-athletes, coaches, and staff who represent Michigan Football each day,\" Whittingham said in a statement. \"Michigan is synonymous with tradition and excellence -- both on the field and beyond -- and our entire program is committed to upholding those values while striving for greatness together. My family and I are thrilled to join the University of Michigan community, and we look forward to helping our players grow, develop, and reach their highest potential -- on the gridiron, in the classroom, and as leaders. It's a privilege to be part of something that inspires pride in every Wolverine fan. Go Blue!\"Over more than three decades with the Utes, first as an assistant and then as head coach since 2005, Whittingham cultivated a clean image and a winning program. Both factors would make him attractive to the Wolverines, who are seeking to turn the page from a scandal-ridden era without taking a step back on the field.\nMichigan is in the midst of an external review focused on its handling of Sherrone Moore, who was fired with cause on Dec. 10 after evidence surfaced that he had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Moore, who had been the program's offensive coordinator during Jim Harbaugh's scandal-marred tenure, was subsequently charged with felony home invasion and stalking.\n        \n            \n                Kyle Whittingham may be short-term solution for Michigan, but he's perfect hire for this turbulent moment\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhittingham's final Utah team finished 10-2 (7-2 Big 12) this past season before the school announced on Dec. 13 that he would be stepping down to make way for head coach-in-waiting Morgan Scalley to begin his tenure. However, Whittingham is still slated to coach the Utes in the Las Vegas Bowl against Nebraska on New Year's Eve.Utah reached the Rose Bowl in both 2021 and 2022 under Whittingham after winning 11 games in 2019. Arguably his best season with the Utes came in 2008, however, when Utah went 13-0, beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl and finished No. 2 in the AP poll.\"Kyle Whittingham is a well-respected and highly successful head coach who is widely recognized as a leader of exceptional character and principled leadership,\" Michigan AD Warde Manuel said. \"Throughout our search, he consistently demonstrated the qualities we value at Michigan: vision, resilience, and the ability to build and sustain championship-caliber teams. Kyle brings not only a proven track record of success, but also a commitment to creating a program rooted in toughness, physicality, discipline and respect -- where student-athletes and coaches represent the university with distinction both on and off the field. We are excited to welcome Kyle to the University of Michigan family as he takes the helm of our football program.\"\nWhittingham was in line to coach the Utes against Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on New Year's Eve in his final game with the program; however, Utah AD Mark Harlan confirmed in a statement that Whittingham will not be on the sideline for the postseason game and will join Michigan right away. \"The University of Utah is grateful for Coach Whittingham's incredible contributions over his long tenure at the university, and we wish him and his family all the best with this next step in his career,\" Harlan said. \"After discussions with Coach Whittingham, his representatives and the University of Michigan, we have granted their request to allow him to join the Michigan program immediately.\"Michigan's search processMoore's firing came after the early signing period for high school prospects and well before the transfer portal opens on Jan. 2, which eliminated any need for the Wolverines to rush the hiring process.\nThough Michigan was a late entrant to what's been a busy coaching carousel, the Wolverines have been the only Power Four school on the market for the past couple of weeks. Given the job's allure as one of the nation's best, the list of names connected to the opening in some capacity was strong.Among them have been Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham and Louisville's Jeff Brohm. The elevation of interim coach Biff Poggi also loomed as a potential option if the Wolverines struggled to find a suitable candidate. Poggi has been leading Michigan as it prepares to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Eve.Stabilizing forceHiring Whittingham instead of elevating Poggi, who is also 66, signals that Michigan is OK with a relatively short-term hire but that it wants to accomplish a couple of things in the meantime. First, landing one of the longest-tenured and most successful sitting head coaches at the Power Four level shows the Wolverines are serious about contending in the Big Ten and have no interest in taking a step back competitively as they sort their way through the wreckage of what Harbaugh and Moore left behind.\nElevating Poggi could have been interpreted as a gesture of surrender for the 2026 season after he went 6-16 as head coach at Charlotte in 2023 and 2024. Secondly, hiring Whittingham would show the university is intent on moving forward from its past. Poggi served two stints under Harbaugh at Michigan, including one as the program's associate head coach in 2021 and 2022. Fair or not, he is viewed as a product of that era.So while Whittingham may not be a long-term solution, he's more than a stopgap interim. He's a proven winner who can help the program turn the page from the turmoil of the Harbaugh and Moore eras. As he wipes the slate clean, the program can begin preparing to make a run at a huge name at some point in the relatively near future.Utah dynamicHiring Whittingham might set up an interesting tug of war for both staffers and players between Michigan and Utah. What's certain is that Whittingham will be without Scalley as his defensive coordinator for the first time since the 2015 season.\nAs Scalley launches his Utah tenure and puts his own spin on things there, will he be able to fend off a well-resourced Michigan program led by Whittingham? One of the top storylines to monitor will be Whittingham's appetite to recruit from Utah's roster and coaching staff. It was always assumed that when the Whittingham to Scalley transition occurred at Utah, Whittingham would be retiring.Instead, he has landed an even better job. If he attempts to build the Wolverines program with Utah talent, it could make for an awkward dynamic that would have been difficult to imagine just a few weeks ago.Kyle Whittingham's career success by the numbers Via CBS Sports Research177-88 record (.668) in 21 seasons as full-time Utah coach (2005-25)Most wins (177) by head coach in Utah program historyTied for second-longest tenured active head coach in FBS (behind Kirk Ferentz, 27 seasons)Eight seasons with 10+ winsThree conference titles (2008 Mountain West; 2021-22 Pac-12)Three-time conference Coach of the Year (2008 Mountain West; 2019 and 2021 Pac-12) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers star guard Austin Reaves will miss at least the next four weeks after being diagnosed with a grade 2 left gastrocnemius (calf) strain, ESPN reported on Friday. Reaves exited in the first half during the Lakers' 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day and did not return.\"Austin clearly felt something,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame. \"We did our normal halftime, and then as we were walking out of the locker room, [Lakers director of player performance and health] Dr. [LeRoy] Sims told me he was out.\"Reaves finished the game by scoring 12 points on 5 of 8 shooting in 15 minutes of action. With Reaves out of the lineup for the second half against Houston, veteran Marcus Smart started in his place.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick blasts Lakers after Christmas loss to Rockets: 'We don't care enough right now'\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nReaves, 27, is in the midst of a career year with Los Angeles. The former undrafted free agent out of Oklahoma is averaging 26.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points earlier this season against the Sacramento Kings and nearly finished with a triple-double by adding 11 rebounds and nine assists.\nDespite being the second-leading scorer on his own team -- behind league-leading scorer Luka Dončić -- Reaves has filled the void while other Lakers players have been out of the lineup. Notably, LeBron James missed the first few weeks of the season due to sciatica and didn't make his season debut until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz.Reaves injury comes amid the Lakers' losing streakWith the loss to the Rockets on Christmas, the Lakers dropped to 19-10. Los Angeles has lost three consecutive games by double digits (Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers and Rockets). After the latest setback to Houston, Redick went on a long rant about the way his team has playing, saying that the Lakers \"don't care enough right now.\"\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\"\nThe Lakers began the 2025-26 campaign 15-4. Since that hot start, Los Angeles is 4-6 in its last 10 games. The Lakers trailed by double digits the entire second half against Houston.\n        \n            \n                JJ Redick torched Lakers' players after Christmas loss, but the real blame lies with the GM who acquired them\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"The two words of the day were effort and execution,\" Redick said. \"And I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven't, we're a terrible basketball team. And tonight we were a terrible basketball team. And that started legitimately right away.\"The four-week timeline for Reaves would likely result in him missing a majority of January. The Lakers face the Kings on Sunday and the Pistons on Tuesday before the calendar flips to 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-4.5) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (56.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1.5) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7.5, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\nWe've reached the penultimate week of the 2025 NFL season, and as some teams are trying to improve their playoff positioning, others are trying to just get across the finish line after disappointing campaigns. Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Texans at Chargers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)LAC RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)\nThe Chargers got rookie Omarion Hampton back three weeks ago, and he and Kimani Vidal have largely split touches over that time. That may not be the case this week, with Vidal questionable to suit up against the Texans' elite defense. The Chargers are 1.5-point favorites. The total is 39.5.Ravens at Packers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, doubtful)GB QB Jordan Love (left shoulder and concussion, questionable)GB QB Malik Willis (right shoulder and illness, questionable)GB WR Christian Watson (shoulder and illness, questionable)\nThe Ravens have the slightest of hopes of making the playoffs, but their uphill battle got even harder this week with Lamar Jackson doubtful to play in a must-win game against the Packers. Jackson is far and away the most notable injury for Baltimore, but Green Bay has listed both starting quarterback Jordan Love and his backup Malik Willis as questionable, and it appears Love will not play. Standout receiver Christian Watson is also questionable for Green Bay. The Packers are favored by 4.5, and the total is 39.5.Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nBoth teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title. Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nBoth teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes. The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, questionable)NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out) NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)\nThe biggest injuries here are with rookies, with New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson needing to clear concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Additionally, explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion. The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, questionable)CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, questionable)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)\nThe Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is in line to be the team's RB1 this week, though he's questionable with a hand injury that kept him out of the team's last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is questionable to play, though it appears he will suit up. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest. Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.  Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, questionable)\nThe Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who is hoping to return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. He's questionable for this AFC South clash. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday. Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)NO WR Chris Olave (back, questionable)\nThe Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is officially questionable but is aiming to suit up. The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, questionable)\nBoth teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week, but he's questionable again with a nagging heel injury.  The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)\nStar Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)\nBuffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again. Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)\nThis potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year. San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, TBD)\nAll eyes are on the status of Davante Adams, who missed last week's epic clash with the Seahawks. Adams is the NFL's receiving touchdowns leader, and he can help the Rams two-fold Sunday, as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's marquee Christmas Day slate was a doozy. From the Knicks' big comeback to an overtime battle between the Timberwolves and Nuggets, the day was filled with excitement. As we turn our attention towards the final few days of 2025, there are still some players on the waiver wire who can help fantasy managers. Here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Peyton Watson, Denver Nuggets (47% rostered)Depth has become a problem for the Nuggets. Aaron Gordon (hamstring) and Christian Braun (ankle) have been dealing with long-term absences. Now, Cameron Johnson (knee) is expected to miss at least four weeks. While Johnson's overall production has been a disappointment, he has averaged 31 minutes a game. His injury leaves Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray as the Nuggets' only healthy starters from the beginning of the season.Watson started each of his last 17 games with the Nuggets being so short-handed. While his numbers don't jump off the page, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals, one block, and 1.6 3-pointers during that span. He also shot 53.5% from the field. Watson can do enough across the board to be worth rostering in most leagues. Brook Lopez, Los Angeles Clippers (18% rostered)The injury to Ivica Zubac (ankle) has complicated what has already been a disappointing season for the Clippers. He will be out at least three weeks, leaving increased opportunities for both Lopez and John Collins. In their first full game without Zubac, Collins played 29 minutes against the Rockets and produced 13 points, five rebounds, five assists, two steals, two blocks, and three 3-pointers.\nLopez also started versus the Rockets, posting five points, six rebounds, four assists, two blocks, and one 3-pointer over 27 minutes. Even with him playing just 15 minutes per game this season, Lopez has averaged one block and 1.3 3-pointers. While he's not likely to play over 30 minutes on a nightly basis, he could certainly play 22-25 minutes a game moving forward. That's enough to consider adding him if you need blocks and 3-pointers.Sandro Mamukelashvili, Toronto Raptors (18% rostered)It has been an injury-filled season for Jakob Poeltl, who has already missed 10 games. He is currently sidelined by a back issue and has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Wizards. When he has been on the floor, he has only averaged 25 minutes. That's his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season.Mamukelashvili has started each of the last three games that Poeltl has missed. Across five total starts this season, he has averaged 16.2 points, six rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 3.4 3-pointers. Last season, he shot 37.3% from behind the arc, and he has followed that up by shooting 41.2% from deep this season. Back injuries can be tricky, so picking up Mamukelashvili now could prove to be a wise move if Poeltl ends up being out long-term.\nTim Hardaway Jr., Denver Nuggets (17% rostered)Hardaway was a bright spot for the Nuggets in their Christmas win over the Timberwolves, scoring 19 points over 41 minutes. He shot 3-for-11 from behind the arc, marking his sixth straight game with multiple made 3-pointers. Over his last three games, he has drained 16 total triples. In his first season with the Nuggets, the veteran has shot 41.9% on his 3-point attempts.It's not a huge surprise that Hardaway is having the most efficient season of his career from behind the arc. With opposing defenses giving so much attention to Jokic and Murray, Hardaway receives a lot of quality looks. Don't look for Hardaway to provide much in terms of rebounds, assists, or defense stats, but fantasy managers specifically hunting for points and 3-pointers should consider adding him.Tyler Kolek, New York Knicks (12% rostered)Kolek had a breakout performance when the Knicks defeated the Spurs in the NBA Cup championship game. While that didn't count for fantasy, he has carried over his success since then. Over the last five games, he has posted at least 16 points and eight assists in a game three times. Over the entire five-game span, he averaged 12 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.6 3-pointers.\nKolek is receiving additional opportunities to contribute because Miles McBride (ankle) is out. McBride has been labeled as week-to-week, and there haven't been any positive updates regarding his status. For as long as McBride remains sidelined, Kolek can provide value in deeper formats. Just be aware that it likely won't be smooth sailing for him. In one game during his recent hot streak, he had just two points and two assists over 15 minutes against the 76ers. Like many bench players, his role could fluctuate a bit on a nightly basis.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. Unfortunately for the Steelers, they will be without their best player as they try to clinch the division on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.Pittsburgh announced Friday that star pass rusher T.J. Watt will miss the game despite returning to practice this week. Watt has been trending in the right direction after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling mishap. On Wednesday, he attended practice for the first time since undergoing surgery, though he was listed as a limited participant.The Steelers will now target a Week 18 return for Watt as they gear up for a playoff run. Just having Watt back on the practice field provided a boost to his teammates.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \"TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"  He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt has 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

Love did not clear protocol to return for his team's important Week 17 home game and was officially downgraded to out on Friday. Malik Willis is expected to start in Love's absence.Love was injured when he was sacked by Chicago defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter last week. Love sustained helmet-to-helmet contact from Booker, who was flagged for roughing the passer while Love remained on the turf for several minutes. After being evaluated, Love was ruled out for the remainder of the game and the Bears went on to stun the Packers 22-16 in overtime, grabbing control of the NFC North lead in the process.Significant injuries are piling up for Green Bay in recent weeks, with star pass rusher Micah Parsons out for the season after suffering a torn ACL. Now, Love is sidelined for at least the week as Green Bay pushes for playoff positioning in the NFC.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Packers earn berth after Vikings eliminate Lions; Broncos chasing AFC's top seed\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Packers have already clinched a spot in the playoffs thanks to the Detroit Lions' loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, and there is still some hope they can catch the Bears to win the division. A Green Bay loss or Chicago win on Saturday would shut down any hopes of a division win, however, and Green Bay will now be without key players on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball.Willis is expected to be under center for Green Bay on Saturday, though Willis was also listed as questionable on the injury report after suffering a shoulder injury at the end of regulation against the Bears. Willis has also been battling an illness this week.\nThe Ravens will also likely be starting a backup quarterback as Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful due to a back contusion as Baltimore is playing to remain in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs. Even with a Baltimore win on Saturday, the Ravens would miss the playoffs if the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. If Jackson cannot play, Tyler Huntley would start for Baltimore.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        JJ Redick's frustrations with his Los Angeles Lakers team have been evident for some time now. You see it in some of his angry timeouts, in the shots some of his players take and the defensive miscues many of them make. The Lakers have stayed near the top of the Western Conference largely because of their stellar work in close games, winning all 10 of their games that have reached clutch time. That was never sustainable. Whenever they encounter a team that's bigger and more athletic than they are, their flaws are laid bare for the whole world to see.That's what happened on Christmas, when the Lakers were blown out and bullied by the Houston Rockets. Just as they were by the San Antonio Spurs in the quarterfinals of the NBA Cup, the slower Lakers were exposed on a marquee stage. And Redick has had enough of it.\"We don't care enough right now,\" Redick said. \"And that's the part that bothers you a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be a professional.\" He went on to blast his team's \"effort and execution,\" and he promised that the team would have an \"uncomfortable\" practice on Saturday, ahead of their game against the Sacramento Kings.Maybe there's a short-term burst coming, but the notion that effort is a choice in the modern NBA is pretty outdated. In today's ultra-fast, ultra-deep league, it's a skill, and it was one that quietly carried the Lakers through long stretches of the regular season last year. Remember the banshees, Redick's term for his energetic role players? Well, Jarred Vanderbilt and Gabe Vincent have been nonfactors offensively, making them tough to play consistently. Dorian Finney-Smith, acquired last December, is gone now. He signed with Houston for the mid-level exception. Given his age and the injury he was dealing with, that might have been a defensible loss for the Lakers at the price Houston paid.\nBut why on Earth is Jordan Goodwin thriving on Phoenix's bench instead of their own right now? Goodwin was an essential reserve last season. The Lakers waived him to make room under their first-apron hard cap for Marcus Smart. They could have attempted to use draft capital or cash to clear any of a number of less valuable players off of their roster to accommodate Goodwin, with Bronny James being the most notable. Instead, they let go of a younger, healthier player to add an older, injury-prone one. Smart has been effective when he's played, but health has predictably been an issue.There was never much of a question that the Lakers would prioritize someone like Smart over someone like Goodwin. Smart is a name brand, a Defensive Player of the Year with high-level playoff experience. The Lakers have a habit of prioritizing such players. Deandre Ayton was their most notable example of that this offseason. Rob Pelinka loves his former high draft picks. Since the disastrous Russell Westbrook trade cost the Lakers most of their depth, he's been trying to replace it with down-on-their-luck lottery picks. In the five seasons since that deal, they've acquired 10 former first-round picks with five or fewer years of experience as buy-low swings: Malik Monk, Lonnie Walker, Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura, Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish and now, Ayton, Nick Smith and Jake LaRavia. Meanwhile, smart teams are consistently plucking high-energy former second-round picks and undrafted free agents off of the Lakers and watching them blossom into exactly the sort of players the Lakers need right now. Goodwin in Phoenix. Scotty Pippen Jr. in Memphis. Jay Huff in Indiana. And, most notably, Alex Caruso in Chicago and Oklahoma City.\nAyton is a good player. Hachimura is a good player. Neither of them have ever been high-effort players, and that's frankly because the Lakers have never really valued high-effort players. The scouting department finds gems for them on the margin, but Pelinka would rather have skill and draft pedigree, which is valuable in context, but exactly what isn't needed on a team led by Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves and a 41-year-old LeBron James. And nearly a year after getting Dončić and changing the course of their franchise for the next 5-10 years, he still seemingly hasn't adjusted to his franchise player's needs. Or his coach's for that matter.Fans have had all sorts of complaints for Redick lately. They think Hachimura should come off the bench. They think Vincent shouldn't play at all and that two-way guard Nick Smith has to play more. There are grains of truth in these complaints. It's possible that the Lakers haven't fully optimized their rotation yet. But at a certain point, you're just shuffling deck chairs. Redick can potentially make lemonade out of these lemons, but he can't make the champagne these fans expect every June. He just doesn't have the ingredients.We've been having versions of these same conversations for years now, and at a certain point, attention needs to turn to the person shopping for the groceries. The Lakers have a new owner in Mark Walter whose track record with the Dodgers suggests he has nearly limitless resources to spend in building a first-class organization. When he took over the Dodgers, he quickly replaced incumbent general manager Ned Colleti with Andrew Friedman and has won three World Series since.\nPelinka is now in Colleti's position. His coach is stating outright that this team needs energy and effort. The league as a whole is shifting toward energy and effort. When the Lakers lose on big stages, it's usually to teams that play with, you guessed it, energy and effort. The trade deadline is a bit more than a month away. If this team is going to have any hope of genuinely contending for a championship, it will have to add energy and effort. If they can't do that, well, it would be hard to justify keeping the general manager who's spent the past half-decade or so ignoring it almost completely.\n            ",

The Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants have each lost nine straight games, but one of those teams will end its streak on Sunday.Both of these teams are limping to the finish line, but that's especially the case for the Giants. They lost star tackle Andrew Thomas in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings -- and it seemed like interim coach Mike Kafka had no interest in letting quarterback Jaxson Dart drop back and throw. Dart threw all of 13 times despite it being a competitive game in which the Giants trailed late. New York seems like a franchise looking ahead to the offseason and a new regime.The Raiders, on the other hand, were at least competitive against the Houston Texans. Rookie running back Ashton Jeanty had the best game of his career, which had to be a terrific sign for Las Vegas. Houston's defense is among the best units in the NFL, and Jeanty carved them up. Jeanty should have no issue repeating that effort against a porous Giants run defense. The Las Vegas defense has had its share of issues -- outside of Maxx Crosby -- but that may not matter based on how the New York offense has looked recently.Here is everything you need to know about this matchup of teams battling for the No. 1 overall pick.\nWhere to watch Giants vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, NevadaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports App Odds: Giants -1.5, O/U 41.5 (via DraftKings)Giants vs. Raiders: Need to knowDart off-target as of late. Dart's career got off to a promising star, but he has slowed down a bit since returning from his concussion. Dart hasn't been running the ball as much, and the Giants were reticent to put the ball in his hands against an aggressive Vikings defense last week. That led to Dart throwing for 33 yards and an interception while adding just seven rushing yards. At least the Raiders defense provides a soft landing spot after that outing.Dream matchup for Jeanty. Last weekend, Jeanty went off against one of the league's best rushing defenses for 128 yards and a score. He even added a 60-yard receiving touchdown for good measure. Now, he gets a much more favorable matchup as the Giants come to town. New York's rush defense has been putrid all season as it allows an average of 150.9 yards per game. Only the Cincinnati Bengals are worse in that department. Jeanty could be in for a monster outing.Tank-a-thon matchup of the week. The Giants and Raiders are both 2-13 with the former holding a tiebreaker for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. That tiebreaker won't matter on Sunday morning since one team has to win this game (barring a tie). That means the loser of this game may wind up a winner (and vice versa). How many fans will be rooting for the opposing team to win this weekend?Giants vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nBetting on a team in the midst of a nine-game losing streak doesn't feel good, but that's the reality of this matchup. Because of how poor the Giants run defense has been all season -- and how shaky Dart has looked since returning from injury -- I do lean toward the Raiders at home. Luckily, they don't have to cover a big number. Pick: Raiders +1.5, Over 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The question is whether the Jets have enough firepower to make that happen.The Patriots are coming off a thrilling win over the Baltimore Ravens in which Drake Maye topped 300 passing yards for the first time in his career -- and did so with ease as he cruised to 380 yards. Stefon Diggs also broke out of a minor funk with 10 receptions and 138 yards. New England has asserted itself as a true Super Bowl contender, but after a win like that one, it has to avoid a letdown against a vastly inferior opponent.New York enters this matchup on a three-game losing streak, and the latest loss was a 29-6 drubbing at the hands of the New Orleans Saints. The sad part is that was the closest game the Jets have played over the last few weeks. With third-string quarterback Brady Cook leading the way, the offense has struggled, and the defense has been a major issue for a while now. If the Jets are going to deliver some coal to their division rival, they need to find a level they haven't reached in a couple months.Here is everything you need to know about this clash of AFC East rivals.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Jets liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium -- East Rutherford, New JerseyTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -13.5, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Patriots vs. Jets: Need to knowKings of the East again. The Patriots can clinch their first AFC East title since 2019 with a win and a loss by the Buffalo Bills. Even if the Bills win, the Patriots still control their fate. If New England wins its last two games, it will be division champion. Considering where this team was at this time last year, first-year coach Mike Vrabel has orchestrated quite the turnaround.Maye can't miss. There was a lot of hullabaloo about Maye's first 300-yard game last week, but what he's lack in yardage totals he's made up for in pinpoint accuracy. Maye leads the league in completion percentage at 70.9%, and he would be the youngest player in NFL history to do that in a full season if he can keep this up for two more weeks. His 8.7 yards per attempt rank second in the league and would be a franchise record. The Patriots haven't had any all-time great quarterbacks before, have they?Hall going for 1,000. If the Jets are searching for positives -- and I'm sure they are these days -- they can look at Breece Hall. Their star running back is just 46 yards away from being the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since Chris Ivory in 2015. That's the longest active drought for any team in the NFL. Hitting that benchmark might be tough for Hall this week because the Patriots are one of the best run defenses in the league, allowing an average of just 100.1 yards per game.Patriots vs. Jets prediction, pick\nI tend to like the underdog when there's a massive spread in a game featuring division opponents, but not in this case. The quarterback matchup is so lopsided in the Patriots' favor that it breaks the scale, and New England has a lot to play for. I expect the Patriots will be ready to roll in this one, and if they play at their best, they can beat this Jets team by a few scores. Pick: Patriots -13.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        AFC playoff hopefuls will look to improve their postseason chances on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Houston Texans visit the Kansas City Chiefs. Entering NFL Week 14, Kansas City (6-6) is the 10th seed in the conference after losing three of its last four, including a Thanksgiving Day defeat to Dallas, 31-28. Houston (7-5) is the No. 8 seed but has won four in a row, including a 20-16 victory over Indianapolis last Sunday. This will be the first Chiefs game since Missouri sports betting launched on Dec. 1, and there are a number of Missouri sportsbook promos available to residents of the state.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. The Chiefs have won each of the last five meetings, including a Jan. 2025 playoff victory.

Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

    "body": "\n        A spot in the College Football Playoff bracket is on the line for the No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers when they meet the Duke Blue Devils in the 2025 ACC Championship Game on Saturday. The Cavaliers finished the regular season 10-2 overall with a 7-1 ACC record. They now have an inside track for an automatic CFP bid as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions if they can get by the Blue Devils. A Duke win would create some chaos that very well could put James Madison in the field. Kickoff from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is at 8 p.m. ET. The Cavaliers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Virginia vs. Duke odds, while the over/under is 58.5. Before making any Duke vs. Virginia picks, check out the college football predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5+ bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line and over/under picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Now they are small favorites a few weeks later on the neutral field. The Cavaliers also have more to play for as they are in line to head to the playoffs with a win. A Duke win guarantees the unranked Blue Devils very little since there's a good chance they would not be one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Virginia is a well-rounded squad that ranks second in the ACC in total defense and and fourth in total offense, so the Cavaliers are well-positioned to control this game and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Duke can cover Duke's defense has struggled at times, but the Blue Devils have an extremely explosive offense that can keep this game within the number. Duke ranks second in the ACC in scoring offense, and that's largely thanks to quarterback Darian Mensah, who has completed 67.5% of his passes this season for 3,450 yards, 28 touchdowns and just four interceptions. The running back duo of Nate Sheppard and Anderson Castle is one of the ACC's best, combining for 1,300 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground. Cooper Barkate is one of the ACC's top receivers with a 63-978-6 line on the season. The Blue Devils appear to be the healthier team as well with Virginia ruling out 15 players and listing third-leading receiver Cam Ross among four players who are questionable. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Duke vs. Virginia picksSportsLine's model is going Under on the total.

Indiana is coming off a 56-3 win at Purdue on Nov. 28, while Ohio State defeated Michigan 27-9 on Nov. 29. The Hoosiers (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten), who are appearing in their first Big Ten title game, are 2-0 against ranked opponents this season. The Buckeyes (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten), the defending national champions, are playing in their seventh conference championship game. A win virtually locks up the top seed in the College Football Playoff field for either side.

The lofty achievement all but guarantees Dvalishvili as the 2025 Fighter of the Year and the greatest bantamweight of all time. Before that, he must prove that his first win over former champion Yan wasn't an aberration. Yan is rejuvenated with three consecutive wins under his belt and confidence that he's more physically fit for the rematch.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 323, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson.

On Saturday, the two sides announced that The Ultimate Fighter and Dana White's Contender Series will both stream on Paramount+ beginning in 2026.In August, it was announced that Paramount had struck a media rights deal to be the streaming home of UFC events with a historic seven-year partnership. The first event of that partnership is UFC 324 on Jan. 24, which is headlined by Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett battling for the interim lightweight championship.Dana White's Contender Series has become a staple of UFC programming, featuring a series of bouts between fighters not currently signed to UFC contracts. Those who impress enough in their opportunities are signed to UFC deals. The show has become the primary pipeline for talent to end up plying their trade in the Octagon.Several fighters have made good on the opportunity provided by their involvement in the show, including Jamahal Hill, Sean O'Malley and Jack Della Maddalena, who have all held UFC gold.\nThe Ultimate Fighter is commonly viewed as the show that saved the UFC. The reality series debuted in 2005, and the first season culminated in an iconic fight between Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin to crown the season's winner. That fight was a massive success and resulted in increased popularity for UFC and an expansion of the promotion's television presence.In the 20 years since the show's premiere, The Ultimate Fighter has produced more than 10 UFC champions and many high-level fighters.\nParamount+ will become the exclusive home for all episodes of both series in the U.S., Latin America and Australia.\n            \n    ",

Dvlashvili can set a new mark on Saturday if he takes out Yan a second time. They previously met in 2023 in a non-title bout where Dvalishvili set the record for most takedown attempts in a fight. \"The Machine\" has defeated Umar Nurmagomedov by decision, Sean O'Malley by submission and Cory Sandhagen by decision so far this year.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Winter Olympics are just a couple months away, and NHL players will participate for the first time since 2014. That means that Canada will be even more loaded than usual with superstars at nearly every position on the ice.Hockey Canada general manager Doug Armstrong has a lot of tough decisions to make as he finalizes his roster over the next month, but it's a good problem to have. Some of the easier calls have already been made as Canada announced its first six players back in June.Connor McDavid (Oilers), Nathan MacKinnon (Avalanche), Sam Reinhart (Panthers), Brayden Point (Lightning), Sidney Crosby (Penguins) and Cale Makar (Avalanche) will all make the trip to Italy. The question is what other 19 players will be joining them?That's what I'll attempt to answer today as I project Canada's full roster for the 2026 Olympics. This projection is based on how players have performed over the last year, with recent play being weighted a bit more heavily. I did the same with a look at Team USA if you want to check that out.\nHere's how Canada's Olympic roster decisions should shake out, using the 4 Nations Face-Off roster as something of a base:*denotes player already announced on rosterForwardsConnor Bedard, BlackhawksMacklin Celebrini, SharksSidney Crosby, Penguins*Brandon Hagel, LightningSeth Jarvis, HurricanesWyatt Johnston, StarsNathan MacKinnon, Avalanche*Brad Marchand, PanthersMitch Marner, Golden KnightsConnor McDavid, Oilers*Brayden Point, Lightning*Sam Reinhart, Panthers*Mark Scheifele, JetsNick Suzuki, CanadiensCanada's biggest advantage is up front. No other country can match the Canadians' star power at the top or their absurd depth. Of course, that means some great players will get left off the roster.With five forwards already locked in, that left nine spots up for grabs. The headliners there are young stars Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini. Maybe Armstrong doesn't want to take both, but at this point it's hard to deny them. Celebrini is tied for second in the NHL with 40 points and Bedard is fourth with 39. Look at what those two do on a nightly basis and tell me they don't deserved an Olympic nod.\nMark Scheifele is another player who wasn't on the 4 Nations roster, but he has carried the Winnipeg Jets' offense this season. He's producing at a 107-point pace, and Canada wouldn't ask him to play a huge role, but Scheifele would be an excellent bottom-six scorer for the Canadians.Beyond those decisions, Wyatt Johnston has more than earned his spot. He's second on the Stars in goals (16) and third in points (31). Over the last couple years, he's proven to be a rising star in the NHL. The same can be said for Nick Suzuki and Seth Jarvis.DefensemenEvan Bouchard, OilersJakob Chychrun, CapitalsCale Makar, Avalanche*Josh Morrissey, JetsColton Parayko, BluesMatthew Schaefer, IslandersShea Theodore, Golden KnightsDevon Toews, AvalancheLet's start with the controversial call here. I think Evan Bouchard should be on this roster. Yes, when he makes a defensive error, it's usually of the catastrophic variety. That said, Bouchard brings immense upside to this roster. Put his puck-moving ability on the ice with that collection of forwards, and you have a dangerous mix.\nNo. 1 overall pick Matthew Schaefer has played his way onto this roster, and you can't tell me otherwise. Schaefer is tied for the rookie scoring lead with 20 points, and the Islanders own a plus-10 goal differential with him on the ice at five-on-five. There might be some concern Schaefer could be overwhelmed by the moment, but that certainly hasn't been an issue at the NHL level yet.The other surprise -- even to me when putting together this projection -- was Jakob Chychrun. He's produced on the offensive end with 24 points, and he's been driving play for the Capitals. Given the choice between young Stars defenseman Thomas Harley and Chychrun, I would have to go with the latter right now, and that's coming from someone who was on the Harley hype train last year.GoaliesJet Greaves, Blue JacketsLogan Thompson, CapitalsScott Wedgewood, AvalancheIf the above list didn't make it obvious enough, Canada has a goaltending issue. It used to produce superstars at the position, but that just hasn't been the case lately. As such, all three spots are very much up for grabs.\nThe easiest projection here has to be Logan Thompson, who has been great for the Capitals dating back to last season. His 21.8 goals saved above average over that span rank sixth in the league, per Natural Stat Trick.Given the options at Canada's disposal, it cannot ignore what Scott Wedgewood is doing right now. He's third in the league with 10.6 goals saved above average are third in the NHL, and his .833 high-danger save percentage is terrific. He should get the not over a struggling Jordan Binnington with ease.The third goalie spot is really tough to read because there aren't many good options at all. Greaves, however, has shown that he can be a steady presence for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Because of the roster in front of the crease, steady is all Canada really needs out of its goaltender.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With less than 24 hours remaining until the 12-team College Football Playoff bracket is revealed, oddsmakers have it clear who may be receiving the final at-large spots. Notre Dame (-1050) is heavily favored to reach the CFP via an at-large bid, while Alabama (-320) and Miami (+164) are right behind.Texas is also being offered long-shot odds (+2500) to reach the CFP, but the Longhorns will more than likely be on the outside looking in on Sunday afternoon. Those odds are current at FanDuel Sportsbook as of 9:50 p.m. ET on Saturday.Entering the weekend, up to two at-large spots were likely up for grabs. With most teams idle during conference championship week, only a few had one final opportunity to present their respective case to the committee.

The Cougars' lone two losses this season have both come against Texas Tech.\nIn the penultimate CFP rankings released earlier this week, Alabama jumped to No. 9 -- ahead of Notre Dame, BYU and Miami. One of the biggest talking points throughout the last several weeks was Miami's 27-24 win over Notre Dame in Week 1. However, Notre Dame has stayed ahead of Miami in the CFP rankings and has won 10 consecutive games.The contenders vying for an at-large bid to the CFPMiami (10-2) began the season 5-0 before suffering its first loss at home to Louisville. Two weeks later, the Hurricanes lost to SMU 26-20 in overtime, which dropped Miami to 6-2 overall and 2-2 in ACC play. Despite winning their last four games, Miami was left out of the ACC title game due to tiebreakers.Notre Dame (10-2) began the season with losses to Miami and Texas A&M before finishing the regular season with a 10-game win streak. The Fighting Irish own wins over Mountain West champion Boise State, USC and Pitt. Notre Dame is seeking its second consecutive CFP appearance after reaching the semifinals last season.\nAlabama (10-3) could become the first team in the CFP era to receive an at-large bid with three losses on its résume after losing to Georgia 28-7 in the SEC title game. Last season, Clemson reached the CFP by winning the ACC title despite having three losses on its résumé. Alabama is seeking its first CFP appearance in the post-Nick Saban era.\n            ",

That result dropped the Cougars, who were on the playoff bubble entering this weekend's title game slate, to a respectable 11-2 on the year. Both of those defeats came against the Red Raiders. BYU failed to look competitive in either result, as the Cougars were outscored 63-14 in their two games against Texas Tech. With plenty of firsthand experience to draw upon, BYU coach Kalani Sitake referred to Texas Tech as the \"best team in the country\" multiple times while addressing reporters after his team got dressed down. Sitake wasn't entirely optimistic about the Cougars' CFP chances moving forward, but he still called for a fair selection process from the committee. \"They're (Texas Tech) the No. 1 team in the country,\" Sitake said. \"I don't know what the other rankings are. This team is really good. So you go play the No. 1 team in the country twice, one in Lubbock and then one at a neutral site which is the same state (Texas). I thought our fans showed up and made a lot of noise. I would love another crack at it... I like who we are and I like what we've been able to do. I think we have a great résumé. But I've got to watch the other games too.\n\"I just know that when they're doing comparisons, hopefully they put it out there and make it fair. At least put us in the graphic. That would be nice.\"        Sitake's last sentence was a not-so-veiled shot at coverage of the College Football Playoff. A graphic was shown comparing teams nine through 12 in the latest CFP Rankings reveal show. No. 11 BYU was excluded, as all the focus went to No. 9 Alabama, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 12 Miami. At least Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire is on BYU's side after his squad likely secured a top-four seed and first-round bye. \n\"Whenever the selection committee starts looking at teams, I truly the Big 12 deserves two teams in the playoffs,\" McGuire said. \"Whenever you look at BYU, they're 11-2 and their two losses are to the No. 4 team in the nation. I have so much respect for Kalani. That's a really good football team and I hope the committee looks at it. Cause there's gonna be two loss teams out there, but there's not going to be an 11-2 loss team. They did a great job throughout the season getting here.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the Philadelphia Eagles' offense sputtering in recent weeks, coach Nick Sirianni has reportedly gotten more involved on that side of the ball in the lead up to Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Sirianni has been \"more vocal\" in offensive meetings and \"addressing the group for longer than usual,\" according to ESPN.Through 13 games, the Eagles (8-4) rank 19th in the league in points per game (19.5), 22nd in rushing yards per game (108.5),  23rd in passing yards per game (196.3) and 24th in total yards per game (304.8).With his team struggling to find the end zone consistently, Sirianni has been more assertive in offensive meetings this week, per ESPN, before turning things over to embattled offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. Despite Sirianni's increased role in preparation, Patullo is still running things on that side of the ball.The Eagles have now dropped two straight games, scoring a combined 36 points in those losses. Before that, they totaled 26 points in close wins over the Green Bay Packers (10-7) and Detroit Lions (16-9). The frustration stemming from that lack of production has had an affect off the field as well.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 14 odds, predictions, expert picks: Do Colts continue to tumble?

Brown described the situation as a \"shit show\" on a Twitch stream. Sirianni was forced to address those comments, but Brown didn't back down publicly.\"I think that's fair, I think if you got eyes you can see that,\" Brown said. \"The same things I've been saying like all season. So me, making light of my situation on Twitch with my friend, that's something I'm not apologizing for. You know? Because like I said, if you got eyes, you could see that. Shoot, that's me trying to like laugh through my situation.\"More recently, Patullo's home was pelted with eggs by fans after the Eagles put up just 15 points in a Black Friday loss to the Chicago Bears. Patullo said that he understands the frustration, but he also said targeting homes and families \"crosses the line.\"\nThe Eagles are hoping Sirianni's heightened involvement will spark something against a Chargers defense that has been one of the best units in the league this season. Los Angeles ranks third in total yards allowed per game (275.3) and 11th in points allowed per game (21.1).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The last time Texas Tech won an outright conference championship was in 1955. The Red Raiders were a member of the Border Conference, because the Southwest Conference refused to offer an invite. One year later, they begrudgingly let them in. The Red Raiders have long been an afterthought in major college football, scratching and clawing for every moment. In the 2000s, it was the revolutionary Air Raid offenses under Mike Leach. Then, the emergence of Patrick Mahomes presented a glimmer of hope. So when the opportunity to go all-in with a stacked transfer class came, Texas Tech sprung into action. They perfectly identified line talent and pitched for many of college football's best players to come to Lubbock. Critics complained that Texas Tech bought their roster. In the locker room? No one cared. \"If we are gonna buy a team, why not be the best?\" linebacker Jacob Rodriguez said. \nOn Saturday in front of a record crowd, it all came to fruition. No. 4 Texas Tech stunned No. 11 BYU 34-7 to capture its first Big 12 championship in program history. The Red Raiders scored 34 unanswered points, including 13 in the fourth quarter to clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Red Raiders' defense was dominant, forcing four turnovers, including two interceptions by linebacker Ben Roberts. Quarterback Behren Morton hit deep shots to Reggie Virgil and Coy Eakin as part of a balanced two-touchdown day and Texas Tech cruised to one of its best efforts of the season. BYU had a strong season, winning four of its last six games by an average of 19.3 points per game. In 10 FBS wins, the Cougars averaged 33.2 points per game. But against Texas Tech, BYU has had nothing. The Cougars combined for just 14 total points in the two matchups. But really, this is just who Texas Tech has been all year. Outside of a road trip with their backup quarterback against Arizona State, the Red Raiders have been untouchable. \n\"I've said it before, I think they're the best team in the country,\" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. \"And I'm confirming it, they're the best team in the country.\" Across the season, Texas Tech has outscored teams by an average of 34.2 points per game. They've hit another level over their past four, holding teams to 23 total points. They end the season ranking No. 1 in the Big 12 in total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. It will go down as one of the greatest seasons in Big 12 history. And fittingly, their big moment against BYU came with many of their homegrown stars leading the way. Eakin started his career as a walk-on, but caught two touchdowns in the stadium where he won a state title at Stephenville High School. Roberts was McGuire's first recruit at Texas Tech. West Texan quarterback Behren Morton waited five years to play on a championship-caliber team. \nThere was no good reason this story should take place in Lubbock, Texas, where championship dreams have gone to die. \"When [Joey McGuire] got hired four years ago, he told me, just trust me,\" Morton said. \"Stick with me. Let's build this culture, let's build the standard for Texas Tech. We all did. Romello [Height] trusted him, Brice Pollock trusted him. There was no selfishness.\" Texas Tech now awaits its place in the College Football Playoff. The win should clinch a first-round bye, and likely set up a second-round game with either No. 6 Ole Miss or No. 7 Texas A&M. If they're lucky, their quarterfinal game could take place in the Cotton Bowl at AT&T Stadium, the same place where they just won. \nBut in an era where conference championships are becoming secondary, no one in Lubbock is taking it for granted. Texas Tech won the Big 12. For the first time in generations, a major conference trophy is coming home to Lubbock. \"I've waited 20 years for this,\" linebacker John Curry said. \"I know a bunch of Red Raiders fans have been waiting forever, for their whole lives. The amount of texts I've gotten is just amazing. It's amazing to be part of the team that finally brings it back to Lubbock.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Winter Olympics are just a couple months away, and NHL players will be participating for the first time since 2014. Team USA should have a great shot to end its 46-year gold medal drought as the talent pool has never been deeper for the Americans.Team USA general manager Bill Guerin has some tough decisions ahead of him over the next month, but that's a very good problem to have. And some of the work has already been done.Back in June, Team USA announced the first six members of its Olympic roster with Jack Eichel (Golden Knights), Auston Matthews (Maple Leafs), Brady Tkachuk (Senators), Matthew Tkachuk (Panthers), Quinn Hughes (Canucks) and Charlie McAvoy (Bruins) going to Italy. Which 19 players will be joining them?\n        \n            \n                Projecting Canada's 2026 Olympic hockey roster: Connor Bedard playing his way onto loaded team\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's the question I tried to answer by projecting Team USA's final Olympic roster, which will be unveiled in early January. It's a great time for American hockey, and Team USA will be able to field a squad capable of winning gold.\nHere's how Team USA's Olympic roster decisions should shake out:*denotes player already announcedForwardsMatt Boldy, WildCole Caufield, CanadiensKyle Connor, JetsAlex DeBrincat, Red WingsJack Eichel, Golden Knights*Jake Guentzel, LightningJack Hughes, DevilsClayton Keller, MammothDylan Larkin, Red WingsAuston Matthews, Maple Leafs*Jason Robertson, StarsTage Thompson, SabresBrady Tkachuk, Senators*Matthew Tkachuk, Panthers*I have a sinking feeling that Guerin will overthink his forward group, snubbing more skilled players for size and tenacity. Those traits have their place in hockey -- no doubt -- but the the skill level in Italy will be off the charts. The Americans need to bring their 14 best forwards, and they will still have plenty of grit in the form of the Tkachuk brothers, Eichel and defensemen like Jaccob Slavin.With the above list, I think they do that. Players like Cole Caufield and Alex DeBrincat don't offer much in the brawn department, but they make up for it with their ability to put the puck in the net. Those two have combined for 28 goals on the season, and I don't think their presence leaves the Americans lacking in the size and strength department.That brings me to Jason Robertson, who was inexplicably left off the 4 Nations Face-Off roster. The 6-foot-3 winger is one of the best scorers in the NHL, totaling 168 goals since the start of the 2021-22 season. Only 12 other players have more in that span. If Robertson is left off the Olympic roster, Guerin will be doing his team a disservice.\nThe battle for the 14th and final forward spot was a tough one. I felt like J.T. Miller, Chris Kreider and Vincent Trocheck were in the mix. However, I think Tage Thompson has a higher ceiling (and he's one of the 12 players with more goals than Robertson since 2021-22).DefenseAdam Fox, RangersQuinn Hughes, Canucks*Lane Hutson, CanadiensSeth Jones, PanthersCharlie McAvoy, Bruins*Jake Sanderson, SenatorsJaccob Slavin, HurricanesZach Werenski, Blue JacketsThe Americans didn't have Quinn Hughes for the 4 Nations Face-Off due to injury, so his presence alone represents a big upgrade. Beyond that, I do think Team USA has a nice blend of offensive skill and shutdown options on its blue line.Lane Hutson falls on the skilled end of that spectrum, and I think the 2025 Calder Trophy winner deserves to make the trip to Italy. Again, there may be bigger and more defensively responsible players available, but the Olympics will  be a battle of star power. Hutson has that in spades.\nJake Sanderson was an injury replacement at the 4 Nations, but he has earned a full-time spot on the Olympic roster. He's evolved into a great two-way defenseman, and he has some nice size at 6-foot-2. I know Adam Fox got some criticism for his play in the 4 Nations tournament, but there's no reason to leave him home for the Olympics. Since the start of last season, the New York Rangers have a plus-28 goal differential with him on the ice at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick.Finally, a quick note on Seth Jones. If you told me at the start of last season that I would be projecting him on the Olympic team, I would have looked at you cross-eyed. Instead, Jones has been excellent since joining the Florida Panthers. His size and puck-moving ability make him a great fit for this blue line.GoaliesConnor Hellebuyck, JetsSpencer Knight, BlackhawksJake Oettinger, StarsTeam USA's biggest advantage is in the net, where it boasts an embarrassment of riches. Several good goaltenders will be left off the roster with competition as stiff as it's ever been.\nLet's start with the easy one. Three-time Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck is the No. 1 goaltender for the Americans. If Team USA reaches the gold medal game, Hellebuyck will be in the crease.From there, I feel like Jake Oettinger has done enough to maintain his spot on the roster from the 4 Nations Face-Off. He hasn't had the best start to the 2025-26 season, but goaltending is extremely volatile, and Oettinger has built up a great body of work in his young NHL career.The third spot was the toughest, but Spencer Knight has played his way into the Olympics. With 12.7 goals saved above average and a .919 save percentage, Knight is a legitimate Vezina Trophy candidate on a Chicago Blackhawks team with some defensive holes. Give this man his flowers with an Olympic nod.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to December football in the NFL! The 2025 campaign is in its final full month, and the Week 14 slate is loaded with high-stakes matchups. With the season in the final stretch, one wrong move could set your season up in flames. For instance, the Cowboys had their playoff hopes dented dramatically with their loss to the Lions on Thursday. As we look towards Sunday's action, the Chiefs and Texans are playing for their postseason lives in prime time, and the Steelers and Ravens are going toe-to-toe in a pivotal matchup that'll put the AFC North crown in clearer focus. The only thing that'll make these contests even more interesting if having our own stakes hanging in the balance as well. To get you situated for Week 14, check out our best bets below as well as picks for every other game on the slate. Note: New England, New York (Giants), San Francisco, and Carolina are on the bye in Week 14.NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook. Bet NFL at FanDuel and get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.\nIndianapolis Colts at Jacksonville Jaguars Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)\nIndy is on the decline at the moment, owning a 1-3 record over its last four games. That has seen them fall out of first place in the AFC South and looking up to these Jaguars. Part of the reason for the Colts' struggles has been Daniel Jones being less than 100% as he is playing through a fractured fibula. With him expected to scramble less, this could leave him as a sitting duck for Jaguars pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen, who has been on a tear in recent weeks. Over his last five games, Hines-Allen has totaled 5.5 sacks. That sets the stage for Jacksonville to wreak havoc on the Colts' passing attack. Meanwhile, if Indy decides to lean on Jonathan Taylor, that also doesn't match up well with a Jaguars defense that is surrendering the fewest rushing yards per game (82.4) in the NFL this season. The Colts are at risk of tumbling out of the playoff picture by the time Week 14 is done.\nProjected score: Jaguars 24, Colts 23The pick: Jaguars +1.5Tennessee Titans at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThis is a play strictly backing the Browns' All-World defense. The unit ranks second in the NFL in total yards per game allowed (271.3) and in sacks per game (3.6). They are also top 10 in the NFL in red-zone efficiency. That is a massive mismatch against a Tennessee offense that has been at the bottom of the NFL across the board. The Titans are last in points per game (14.2) and total yards per game (242.4).That sets the Browns up for utter domination on defense, which means Shedeur Sanders and the offense won't have to do too much heavy lifting to pull off the win.Projected score: Browns 23, Titans 14The pick: Browns -3.5Houston Texans at Kansas City ChiefsSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC | Fubo, try for free)\nI wrote about it coming out of Week 13 that it feels like the nails are starting to hit Kansas City's coffin. While the events of last week were the initial blows, Sunday night's matchup against Houston could be the critical hit. Watching the Chiefs this season, they just feel tired. Yes, they've been better at Arrowhead than they've been on the road, but the Texans are a different beast due to their defense.\nWe know Houston is the No. 1 scoring defense and in total yards allowed, which will give K.C. headaches. What you might not know is that the Texans are an ideal matchup to nullify Patrick Mahomes' improvisation. Mahomes leads the NFL in passing yards outside of the pocket (73.4 per game), while the Texans are giving up the fewest passing yards per game (11.0) on throws outside of the pocket. For reference, this Houston defense held the Josh Allen-led Bills offense to just three total yards on his nine plays outside the pocket back in Week 11.With C.J. Stroud back under center, the Texans have the capabilities to put enough points on the board offensively, as the defense bottles up the Chiefs' offense en route to an upset.Projected score: Texans 24, Chiefs 20The pick: Texans +3.5Philadelphia Eagles at Los Angeles ChargersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC, ESPN | Fubo, try for free)\nThe vibes surrounding the Eagles are terrible. They've lost back-to-back games, and the entire organization feels miserable. That said, this is an interesting bounce-back spot for them in Los Angeles. \nOn top of Philadelphia having the rest advantage after playing Friday, the Chargers are looking for Justin Herbert to respond well after undergoing a procedure on his fractured non-throwing hand on Monday. Even if he does, he may not be 100%. Meanwhile, I think this game has the potential to be a Saquon Barkley showcase. The Chargers can be run on, as we saw back in Week 11 when the Jaguars posted 192 yards and four touchdowns against them on the ground. The combination of Barkley and Jalen Hurts can do just as much damage if they make it a priority.Projected score: Eagles 26, Chargers 21The pick: Eagles -2.5Rest of the bunchBengals at BillsProjected score: Bills 27, Bengals 24The pick: Bengals +5.5Dolphins at JetsProjected score: Dolphins 24, Jets 20The pick: Dolphins -3Saints at BuccaneersProjected score: Buccaneers 27, Saints 17The pick: Buccaneers -8.5Steelers at RavensProjected score: Ravens 24, Steelers 20The pick: Steelers +5.5\nSeahawks at FalconsProjected score: Seahawks 30, Falcons 20The pick: Seahawks -6.5Commanders at VikingsProjected score: Commanders 24, Vikings 17The pick: Commanders -1.5Broncos at RaidersProjected score: Broncos 26, Raiders 16The pick: Broncos -7.5\nBears at PackersProjected score: Packers 27, Bears 20The pick: Packers -6.5Rams at CardinalsProjected score: Rams 27, Cardinals 21The pick: Cardinals +8.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anytime touchdown bets have become very popular these days. Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know, and I'm here to offer some insight for your parlays.Last week, I predicted Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Brenton Strange would score his first touchdown of the season at +340, and also got Denver Broncos wideout Courtland Sutton at +170. Previously, he had caught just one touchdown in the last seven games, so I knew he was due against a spotty Washington Commanders secondary. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 14. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long-shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with a wide receiver who is getting his quarterback back. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:1. WR Terry McLaurin, Washington Commanders (+200)\nJayden Daniels is back in the lineup for this Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, which is a good thing for Terry McLaurin. Washington's WR1 has finally arrived, as he had his best performance of the season in the overtime loss to the Broncos last week, catching 7 of 14 targets from Marcus Mariota for 96 yards and a touchdown. McLaurin isn't just a big-play threat, but a weapon targeted in the red zone as well. Last season, he set a franchise record with 13 touchdown receptions. \n2. TE Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens (+170)\nLamar Jackson hasn't registered a touchdown in three straight starts for the first time in his career, but that's going to change this Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ravens tight end Mark Andrews signed a three-year, $39.3 million extension this past week that reportedly includes $26 million guaranteed, which shows you how much the franchise values him. I'll take Andrews to find pay dirt on Sunday.3. TE Darren Waller. Miami Dolphins (+240)\nHere's an interesting flier. Remember when Darren Waller made his Dolphins debut in Week 4 and caught two touchdowns? Then caught touchdowns in each of the next two games as well? Waller made his return to the lineup last week against the New Orleans Saints after a stint on injured reserve, and caught two passes for 47 yards. This week, he will score vs. the New York Jets. 4. RB D'Andre Swift, Chicago Bears (+190)\nThe Bears' running backs were a major reason why Chicago upset the Philadelphia Eagles last week, as Kyle Monangai and D'Andre Swift became the first teammates in franchise history to rush for 125 yards and a touchdown in the same game. Monangai rushed 22 times for 130 yards and a score, while Swift rushed 18 times for 125 yards and a touchdown against his former team. Monangai is dealing with an ankle injury, but will play. So give me Swift to score in this important NFC North showdown. \n5. RB Kyren Williams, Los Angeles Rams (-105)\nThe Rams are looking to avenge their shocking upset loss to the Carolina Panthers this week, and get a rival that was just eliminated from playoff contention in the Arizona Cardinals. I think points are coming. Kyren Williams has scored touchdowns in eight of 12 games played this season, so he's a good pick for your parlay. This line was plus money on Friday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Best player, best résumé.That's what No. 4 Duke claims ownership of after its latest high-profile victory, a 66-60 win Saturday at No. 7 Michigan State.The Blue Devils may also be the best team ... but we've got a long way to go and a lot of competition at the top of the sport to determine that. As things stand now, Jon Scheyer's 10-0 Blue Devils are most certainly among the three or four best college basketball has to offer, particularly after Purdue's debatable grasp on No. 1 disappeared with its baffling home rout at the hands of No. 10 Iowa State. No. 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherever you want to slot Duke in terms of team prowess, I don't think there's an argument against Duke's case to have the best body of work through the first five weeks of the season. Arizona had that claim in mid-November (I wrote about it here) after winning at shorthanded UConn, and then Michigan held a rightful entitlement to it following its historic three-game romp through the Players Era Championship. (I covered that, too.) Now it's Duke's turn.If I were to build an NCAA Tournament bracket coming out of this weekend, the Blue Devils would be my No. 1 overall seed. (After Friday's CBS Sports Bracketology had the Blue Devils at No. 2 overall behind Michigan.)\nHalf of the Blue Devils' wins have come against power-conference competition. No other school can match that. Duke is 4-0 in Quad 1 games. No other team has a record that good; Michigan is the only 3-0 team in Quad 1 results. Here's a surprise: Saturday marked Duke's first win over a top-10 opponent on the road since February 2019, when Zion Williamson and Co. beat Virginia. (Hey, I was at that one.) Here are the five big Ws, four of which came against ranked competition. Numbers in parentheses are where the teams currently rank at KenPom.com:75-60 over Texas (55) in Charlotte on the opening night of the season78-66 over Kansas (18) in the Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden80-71 over Arkansas (30) in the Thanksgiving Classic at the United Center67-66 over Florida (12) on Tuesday at Cameron Indoor66-60 over Michigan State at Breslin Center on SaturdayNotice how four of Duke's five best wins have come away from home, and with the four most recent wins also transpiring against coaches with national championships to their name: Self, Calipari, Golden, Izzo. And the margin of victory in those five games? A fluffy 8.6 points.\nDuke also just won three consecutive games against ranked teams in the regular season for just the second time in program history. (February of 2016 being the other.)At BartTorvik.com, Duke has leapfrogged Michigan in Wins Above Bubble, a résumé metric that doesn't factor in predictive data and now also has a proxy that the selection committee uses. (Iowa State is now third in résumé strength following its historic takedown of Purdue.)What does it all mean? More than you might think. Duke will inevitably take losses this season, yes, but the fact it's gotten to 10-0 and still hasn't played a well-rounded game is an unnerving thought for the rest of the sport. Go look at the past five weeks worth of results around college hoops. We've seen Michigan at the near-peak of its powers, and I'd say the same case could be made for Gonzaga, Iowa State, Arizona, even Michigan State. But Duke (and I think UConn fits in this as well) is yet to put it all together. \nI'm not sure the team even really knows how to full-on win yet as much as it's adapted to learning how not to lose. After all, six of its top seven minutes-getters are freshmen and sophomores. And it's still this good right away? Hooooo, boy.It would have been entirely understandable for NPOY frontrunner Cameron Boozer and his teammates to simply come up short in the toughest environment they've seen this season. They trailed at the half, Breslin was boppin' and Michigan State looked well on the scent. Didn't happen. To date, it has yet to happen to this team that, despite its super-strong start and influential brand name, wasn't even ranked in the top five in the preseason. \nScheyer has been able to lose five NBA Draft picks and somehow pick up where Duke left off a season ago, when Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Blue Devils made the Final Four as a 35-4 team and ranked No. 1 at year's end at KenPom. If you think just bringing in elite prospects and/or prime transfer portal targets and paying them huge money equates to large-scale winning because you're at a blue blood, go ask Mark Pope how that's working out this season. Duke's proving it can win in a variety of ways, too. On Saturday, it needed to find its ugliest victory yet. Having Boozer on the team solves a lot of problems, but he can't do it alone. In fact, Boozer had the worst half of his young career vs. Sparty when he managed just two points. He picked up a third foul — a completely avoidable third foul, at that — early in the second half. At that point, it seemed like Michigan State was going to keep its undefeated season going. Then Boozer went beast mode again: 16 points and eight rebounds in the second half, finishing with 18 points, 15 boards, five assists and fouling out late in the second half. That fifth assist was the most crucial. When Duke needed a play to secure the win, the option was for Boozer to make it happened. Then he found himself mauled and double-teamed, so he passed to a wide-open Caleb Foster, whose 3 rolled in and clinched the game.\nMSU ran out of options down the stretch. For as brilliant of a distributor as Jeremy Fears Jr. has been this season (he leads the country in assists, now averaging more than 10 per game), he didn't make a field goal on Saturday (0-of-10). Tom Izzo is now a hapless 3-15 all time vs. the Blue Devils, and 1-10 in his last 11 games against top-five opponents. It's the one big bugaboo of his Hall of Fame career.And even with Michigan State playing its style of choice against such a huge team — slow-tempo ball, keeping the game in the 60s — Duke was comfortable in the fight for all 40 minutes. That's in part because, even though Michigan State was holding opponents to 60.4 points heading into Saturday, Duke was a tick better at 59.6. It was a second straight win with a battle into the final minute; Duke held off Florida at home on Tuesday with a big 3-pointer from Isiah Evans with 19.7 seconds remaining. Now Duke is 10-0 for the first time since starting 11-0 in 2017-18. And while Duke probably won't leap to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 — I'd expect Arizona or Michigan to take the top spot — it's going to have the strongest dossier for two weeks, minimum. The next game of note comes at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 22, a meetup with Texas Tech. \nBest team? We'll see. But no other squad has proven more against better competition literally from Game 1 until now than Duke. It's starting to make me wonder if, somehow, this team can actually match the historic dominance of last year's group. That team had games lost on last-second shots and botched plays. That's not happening here, which doubles as the best news for Duke. It's not only off to a terrific start, these Devils looks like they might have the one thing last year's elite team lacked: a closer's mentality.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Forever Young will try to become the first horse to win the world's richest horse race twice when he leaves the starting gate in the 2026 Saudi Cup on Saturday at King Abdulaziz Racecourse in Riyadh. Last year, Forever Young outdueled Romantic Warrior in a stirring stretch drive to capture the $20 million race. Forever Young would end the year by winning the $7 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Del Mar, North America's richest horse race.The 5-year-old Japan bred has amassed more than $19.3 million in earnings in his career. With a victory on Saturday, he would move into second place in all-time career earnings, behind only Romantic Warrior ($31.8 million).For Saturday, Forever Young has been installed as the 8-11 morning-line favorite in the 2026 Saudi Cup odds at TwinSpires. Nysos (7-2), Bishops Bay (11-1), Nevada Beach (11-1) and Luxor Cafe (16-1) round out the top five choices among the 14 Saudi Cup horses. Post time for the race is 12:40 p.m. ET.Sign up with TwinSpires and get a bonus up to $400:SportsLine racing insider Michelle Yu, who correctly picked Forever Young to win last year's Saudi Cup, is in Riyadh again this year to cover the race. She has identified her top picks for this year's running. \nHere is Yu's horse-by-horse analysis for the 2026 Saudi Cup, listed by program number:1 Banishing (33-1)The Charles Town Classic winner has been winless since August, and his best race since has been a sprint. He has twice attempted Grade 1 company and has been bested by double-digit lengths both times. This former claimer's claim to fame is a dead heat with Nysos in the Churchill Downs Stakes last May, but I would be surprised to see him turn in that sort of effort on Saturday.2 Bishops Bay (11-1)The Cigar Mile winner has been purchased by local connections to take a swing at this one-turn race, and that is a configuration we know this horse loves. He has a nice cruising speed, and past form says he should handle the added ground. Saturday will be a class test for him, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him take home a big check.\n3 Forever Young (8-11)The returning champ just doesn't run dud races. He is coming in without the benefit of a prep, which would normally be my one concern. But he obviously loves this course, and there will be pace to run at. While he might prefer a bit more ground, this track plays to a horse who can go longer. He gave us the race of the year last year when beating Romantic Warrior, and I think he does it again.4 Haqeet (100-1)This son of Arrogate is on a pattern for a good race after a loss last time out. He has been running farther, but that seems to be beneficial in the Saudi Cup. He has yet to face graded company, and this could be a shock to him.5 Luxor Cafe (16-1)This Japanese invader was well backed in the Kentucky Derby when he was a well beaten 12th to Sovereignty. His lone win after the Derby was a Group 3 so his form is nowhere near as good as the form he brought to Louisville. The decision to bring him to Saudi off the very disappointing effort in the Champions Cup in his last start is a bold move. Maybe that is a signal that he is on the upswing and has made good progression from age 3 to 4.\n6 Mhally (40-1)The local winner of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques prep, this gelding has been in fine form and brings in solid efforts at this track. He previously finished third in the Saudi Derby, which was far from embarrassing. He looked brave holding off the filly in the prep which was his first effort at nine furlongs. He could give the locals some hope, but I find him hard to put him on top given the headliners in this race.7 Nevada Beach (11-1)The Native Diver winner looked like he made the trip overseas well and was taking to the sandy surface in the mornings. Both of trainer Bob Baffert's runners got a little breeze here, which is a positive in my eyes. He was narrowly bested by Nysos in the Laffit Pincay in his last start when he got an A-plus ride. Forever Young had 11-plus lengths on him in the Breeders' Cup Classic, but this distance should suit him much better. Baffert is 0-fer in the Saudi Cup, and the more likely winner of his two runners is Nysos. Nevada Beach is a grinder though, and you can't discount Baffert anytime there is big money on the line. I do feel like horses that want more ground fare better on this strip, and that could play out with Nevada Beach. Based on his appearance this week, he seems to be thriving on this track.Bet on the Saudi Cup at 1/ST BET and get up to $500 in wagering credits:8 Nysos (7-2)This dazzling son of Nyquist has the right mentality for a $20 million score. He has been plagued by layoff lines but has never failed to return with the same prior form. His lone defeat was to the excellent Mindframe when coming off a 15-month layoff and racing in the slop, neither of which I will hold against him. He threw down against Citizen Bull to come away a Breeders' Cup champion in 2025 and returned to the races this year a winner. I love that Baffert got the racing recency into him for a peak effort in this spot. Can Nysos hold off Forever Young? I don't know, but I do think he's the most talented horse Baffert has brought to Saudi. On the flip side, Nysos is not covering the surface as well as his stablemate Nevada Beach. I wouldn't be surprised if he struggles a bit with the one-turn configuration.\n9 Rattle N Roll (33-1)Trainer Kenny McPeek is back with Rattle N Roll after a relatively disappointing run in last year's edition in which he was pretty fancied off a big win in the local prep. This year he prepped at Oaklawn Park in a less prestigious race and comes to Saudi fresh off the plane. I didn't love him last year, and I'll continue that sentiment this year.10 Star Of Wonder (66-1)An allowance type stateside, this son of Uncle Mo has found the company to his liking locally with back-to-back wins in his two Saudi Arabia appearances. I'm not sure if he will be able to traverse the 1,800 meters of this race -- he has seemed better at seven furlongs -- but configuration could be key. I don't think he has the closing kick of Forever Young or the tactical speed of Nysos.11 Sunrise Zipangu (20-1)Kyoko Maekawa is the first female trainer licensed in two countries and steps onto racing's biggest stage with a horse who gave her her first win as a trainer. However, Sunrise Zipangu has been winless since that initial score. Maekawa is confident in her charge though as she thinks turf horses have faired very well on this track. Still, he's not on the same level as the top contenders.\n12 Thundersquall (66-1)He earned a nice win in his last start here locally, but he'll be facing a different caliber of horse and already has been bested in the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. I don't see how he can improve that result.13 Tumbarumba (20-1)A decent fourth behind Nysos in the Breeders' Cup Mile was his last stateside appearance. He has had a pair of starts at Meydan in Dubai, neither of which was a victory. While he has been in the Middle East, he has not been training locally. He typical runs close to the pace, and that is his best chance to get a jump on the best horses in the world. I could see him nibbling a piece.14 Ameerat Alzamaan (33-1)This filly takes on the boys, but this is no Midnight Bisou.  A dominating Group 2 winner at the end of last year versus fillies, she took on the boys in the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques prep and finished a solid second in a field of 19.  Her conditioner said that she has shown improvement since.  Still, I can't imagine her coming out on top against horses like Forever Young and Nysos.\nPicks3-7-8-13Wagers$10 Win 3 ($10)Total: $10**Based on a $100 budget\n            ",

Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson hopes to parlay his upcoming fight into a shot in the sport's top promotion.Steveson (2-0) fights 11-year veteran Hugo Lezama (11-3) on Feb. 19 in Mexico. Steveson says he's in touch with the UFC and believes a big knockout could propel him to the next level. Ideally, the 2020 Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling wants to debut at the UFC White House card set for June 14.\"We've been in a lot of contact [with the UFC],\" Steveson told ESPN.   \"Most definitely, I'll call [for the White House]. I think it's   rightfully so, especially if a big knockout happens next Thursday. It   would be my fourth one: three in MMA and one in boxing.\"  Steveson is currently training with former two-division UFC champion Jon Jones, whom many deem the all-time best. Jones once predicted that Steveson would be a UFC heavyweight champion by early 2027. Steveson, who isn't even signed by the promotion, agrees that he'll be champion roughly this time next year.\n\"Yeah, I  believe it,\" Steveson said. \"I've got full  confidence in myself. With a guy like Jon, I feel like my confidence  goes through the roof, and the best thing about it is that he sees me  firsthand, training with him and hitting the pads, going through all the  motions. \"His word is gold with that. If it's not next year, it'll be  soon after that. It just depends on how the cards fall.\"\nSteveson won two NCAA Division I national wrestling championships with the University of Minnesota. He embarked on an unsuccessful professional wrestling career with the WWE before signing with the Buffalo Bills in 2024. The Bills released Steveson three months after signing him. He subsequently started his MMA journey, which has thus far been a success.\n            \n    ",

Action kicks off Friday, and one of the first events of the weekend sees some notable stars take the court -- just not basketball stars. The All-Star Celebrity Game is set Friday night in Los Angeles, and the rosters were unveiled earlier this month.One of the teams will be coached by the Giannis Antetokounmpo, his brothers and Dodgers star Mookie Betts). The other team will be coached by Anthony Anderson, Chris Brickley and Lethal Shooter. Among the biggest stars playing in the games are NFL receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown of the Detroit Lions and Keenan Allen of the Los Angeles Chargers. Former NBA players Jeremy Lin, Tacko Fall and Jason Williams will also play -- Lin and Fall are on the same team, which feels like it could be a significant advantage.Current NBA owners Mat Ishbia (Phoenix Suns) and Rick Schnall (Charlotte Hornets) will go head-to-head, with Ishbia, a former player at Michigan State, getting to relive the glory days. From the music world, GloRilla and Mustard will take the court alongside TV and movie stars Simu Liu and Keegan-Michael Key. \nWhere to watch NBA All-Star Celebrity GameTime: 7 p.m. ET | Date: Friday, Feb. 13TV channel: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)The full rosters for both teams in the 2026 All-Star Celebrity Game can be found below.Team AntetokounmpoCoaches: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo, Mookie Betts\nKeegan-Michael KeyRome FlynnDylan WangShams CharaniaJenna BandyRick SchnallTacko FallJeremy LinGloRillaCafuAmon-Ra St. BrownTeam AndersonCoaches: Anthony Anderson, Lethal Shooter, Chris BrickleySimu LiuCody JonesBadshahAndre De GrasseTaylor Frankie PaulMat IshbiaJason WilliamsNicolas VansteenbergheMustardAdrien NunezKeenan Allen\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lindsey Vonn's incredible comeback to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympics came to a sudden end on Sunday when she crashed in the women's downhill event and suffered a gruesome leg injury that required her to be airlifted off of the course. Vonn, in her first public statement following the crash, insisted she had no regrets about pushing to compete on a torn ACL and revealed she suffered a complex tibia fracture that would require multiple surgeries to repair. On Friday, Vonn posted a video thanking fans for all of the support, including the flowers and stuffed animals she's been sent, as she prepares for surgery on Saturday -- her fourth since the crash. She said she hopes that will be her last procedure in Italy, allowing her to return home to the U.S. to continue her recovery and have a fifth surgery. \"It has been quite a hard few days in the hospital here. I'm finally feeling more like myself. I have a long, long way to go,\" Vonn said. \"Tomorrow I'll have another surgery and hopefully that goes well and then I can potentially leave and go back home, at which point I will need another surgery. Still don't know exactly what that entails yet until I get some better imaging, but it's kind of where I am right now.\"\n\nFollowing her third surgery on Wednesday, Vonn posted an update with a photo from her hospital bed. \nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn has continued to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. Vonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. She explained that she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            ",

The showcase, designed to give the best young players in the league the chance to take center stage, will have more juice than normal because this year's rookie class has been one of the best in recent memory.However, the leading candidate for rookie of the year won't be playing. Mavericks star Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick in last summer's NBA Draft, will miss the Rising Stars Challenge due to a foot injury. Before suffering the injury, Flagg was on an offensive tear. He became the first teenager in NBA history to record back-to-back 30-point double-doubles last month. He also scored 49 points against the Hornets, which was the most by a teenager in NBA history.\n        \n            \n                NBA Rookie Rankings: Kon Knueppel stays on Cooper Flagg's heels in ROY race\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite Flagg being out, there are plenty of others worth keeping an eye on. Flagg's college teammate at Duke, Kon Knueppel, has knocked down 183 3-pointers this season. He is on pace to shatter the rookie record held by Keegan Murray for the 3-pointers made. Murray knocked down 206 during the 2022-23 campaign.Flagg and Knueppel were selected No. 1 and 2 overall in the Rising Stars draft by Carmelo Anthony and Tracy McGrady, respectively. Anthony, McGrady, Vince Carter and Austin Rivers will be the four coaches for the event. Rivers will be coaching the best players from the G League.While there have been plenty of stars from the rookie class, there will also be some notable second-year players participating. One of them is San Antonio Spurs guard Stephon Castle, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year. Castle will join forces with Dylan Harper and Reed Sheppard -- the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft -- on Team Melo.The headliner on Team Vince is 76ers guard VJ Edgecombe, the No. 3 overall pick from last summer's draft. Edgecombe ranks third (14.9 points) among all rookies in scoring.Where to watch 2026 NBA Rising StarsDate: Friday, Feb. 13 | Time: 9 p.m. ETLocation: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: N/A | Streaming: PeacockFirst roundGame 1: Team Melo vs. Team AustinGame 2: Team Vince vs. Team T-MacChampionship\nWinner of Game 1 vs. Winner of Game 2Team Melo rosterCoach: Carmelo AnthonyReed Sheppard, Houston RocketsStephon Castle, San Antonio SpursDylan Harper, San Antonio SpursJeremiah Fears, New Orleans PelicansCollin Murray-Boyles, Toronto RaptorsAce Bailey, Utah JazzDonovan Clingan, Portland Trail Blazers*Injury replacement for Cooper Flagg (Dallas Mavericks)Team T-Mac rosterCoach: Tracy McGradyKon Knueppel, Charlotte HornetsKel'el Ware, Miami HeatTre Johnson, Washington WizardsBub Carrington, Washington Wizards**Jaylon Tyson, Cleveland CavaliersZaccharie Risacher, Atlanta Hawks*Cam Spencer, Memphis Grizzlies *Injury replacement for Ajay Mitchell (Oklahoma City Thunder)**Injury replacement for Alex Sarr (Washington Wizards)Team Vince rosterCoach: Vince CarterVJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ersDerik Queen, New Orleans PelicansKyshawn George, Washington WizardsMatas Buzelis, Chicago BullsEgor Dёmin, Brooklyn NetsCarter Bryant, San Antonio SpursJaylen Wells, Memphis Grizzlies*Injury replacement for Cedric Coward (Memphis Grizzlies)Team Austin rosterCoach: Austin Rivers\nSean East II, Salt Lake City StarsRon Harper Jr., Maine CelticsYanic Konan Niederhäuser, San Diego ClippersAlijah Martin, Raptors 905Tristen Newton, Rio Grande Valley VipersYang Hansen, Rip City Remix*Jahmir Young, Sioux Falls Skyforce*Injury replacement for David Jones García (Austin Spurs) and Mac McClung (Windy City Bulls)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout Adam Silver's tenure as commissioner, the NBA has repeatedly sought to solve problems that don't have a well-defined solution. Look no further than this weekend's brand-new Team USA vs. Team World All-Star Game, the fourth different format for the annual showcase in the last four years. Now, the league has its sights set squarely on tanking. On Thursday, the NBA fined the Utah Jazz $500,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league\" after the team removed Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. before the fourth quarter of two games on Feb. 7 and Feb. 9. The Indiana Pacers were fined $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy\" by sitting Pascal Siakam (a designated \"star\" player) and two other starters on Feb. 3, coincidentally a loss to the Jazz.  \n        \n            \n                NBA fines Jazz $500,000 and Pacers $100,000 over roster management\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt the bottom of the press release announcing the penalties was a scathing quote from Silver. \"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" Silver stated. \"Additionally, we are working with our Competition Committee and Board of Governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\nGood luck. The impact that one elite player can have in basketball is unique among team sports. As long as the draft exists and remains the most reliable way to acquire that type of talent, teams, especially those in small markets, are going to do what it takes to position themselves for a top pick. That's no secret, and it's not as if the NBA has ever been pro-tanking. But if the last few years have taught the league anything, it should be that technocratic tweaks do nothing to affect root causes, and often lead to unintended consequences. Flattening the lottery odds was designed to stop strategies like the Process Sixers. Instead, it has often prevented the worst teams from getting the best picks, leaving them stuck in no-man's land with good, but not great prospects. The team with the worst record has received the No. 5 pick in each of the last three lotteries, and hasn't gotten the No. 1 pick since 2018. \nCreating the Play-In Tournament was supposed to give more teams a pathway to the postseason. Instead, it's derided by some fans and might have created more tanking from the middle. Why would a team fight to get the No. 8 seed and lose in the first round when it could sink into the lottery and win the No. 1 pick with the 11th-best odds, or jump up to No. 2 with the seventh-best odds (as the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs did last season)?The last few days have been filled with endless commentary about tanking and how it could be fixed: a postseason tournament to determine the lottery spots; the lottery wheel; freezing the lottery odds at a certain point in the season; preventing teams from drafting in the top-four in consecutive seasons; limiting the protections on draft picks. But much like the flattened lottery odds and Play-In Tournament, all of those ideas would have obvious drawbacks, as my colleague Sam Quinn explained in-depth a few months ago.\n\n        \n            \n                Tanking is a necessary NBA evil, but the league is once again trying to solve an unfixable problem\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe consternation and desire to do something is understandable. No one wants to watch teams that are trying to lose, and the jockeying for position has started earlier than ever this season because multiple franchises have protected picks they're desperate to keep and this could be an all-time draft class. But what might be bad for the league, for fans and for players is not bad for teams. The chance to draft an Anthony Edwards or Victor Wembanyama or Cooper Flagg or Darryn Peterson is worth a few months (or maybe even years) of misery or bad press or fines. Short of eliminating the draft, which isn't going to happen any time soon, and likely never will, there's nothing the NBA can do to eliminate tanking. It can only determine how difficult it is for the worst teams to get the best picks. \nThe league should accept that reality rather than rolling out a new layer of red tape. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training opened for all 30 MLB teams this week with the annual pitchers and catchers reporting dates coming and going. Most of the free agents are settled in either new homes or back with their same team. Still, a few notable names remain and especially with the litany of early injuries, there will continue to be trades. Let's gather the news and rumors of the day here. Cubs, Miller close to dealThe Cubs and free agent reliever Shelby Miller are \"nearing a multi-year deal,\" according to Fansided.Miller, 35, was a first-round pick all the way back in 2009. His career as a starter was finished a while back, but he pitched to a 2.74 ERA and 1.04 WHIP with 54 strikeouts in 46 innings in relief last season for the Diamondbacks and Brewers. He was a trade deadline acquisition for the Brewers and was roughed up a few times in his month for the ballclub before an elbow injury ended his season. He's expected to miss all of the 2026 season, which is why this is a multi-year deal. The Cubs are going to have him rehabbing in house with eyes on the 2027 season.\nBlue Jays, Astros swing dealThe Blue Jays have traded for outfielder Jesús Sánchez with the Astros getting outfielder Joey Loperfido, both teams announced. Sánchez, 28, hit .237/.304/.395 with 1.3 WAR in 134 games last season for the Marlins and Astros. Loperfido, 26, returns to the Astros organization, where he was drafted and developed until heading to the Blue Jays in the Yusei Kikuchi trade at the 2024 deadline. In 41 games for the Jays last season, he hit .333/.379/.500 with 0.6 WAR.Reds add first base depthFree agent first baseman Nathaniel Lowe has signed with the Reds, reports MLB.com. The 30 year old is coming off a down 2025 season in which he hit .228/.307/.381 with 18 homers and 84 RBI. In the previous three seasons he hit .277/.360/.438 (126 OPS+), so the Reds will be hoping for a bounce-back. \nAngels bringing Taylor backThe Angels and veteran utility man Chris Taylor have agreed to a minor-league deal, per the New York Post. Taylor, 35, started last season with the Dodgers -- where he'd spent the overwhelming majority of his MLB career -- but finished with the Angels after the Dodgers released him. In 58 games between the two stops, he slashed .186/.256/.301.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Opening Day and the start of a new Major League Baseball season is roughly six weeks off, but teams are already announcing plans for who'll take the ball for their maiden voyage in 2026. Traditional MLB Opening Day is set for Thursday, March 26 in the 2026 season, though the Yankees and Giants will get the season started a day earlier with a matchup in San Francisco on March 25.With that in mind, CBS Sports will use the space below to log every team's Opening Day starting pitcher decision. These things are always subject to change at a later date, be it because of injury or further roster move, but we'll keep this as current as the news cycle allows.Before we meet this year's crop of Opening Day starters, here's a look at the pitchers who've made the most of these starts in MLB history:Tom Seaver: 16Steve Carlton: 14Jack Morris: 14Randy Johnson: 14Walter Johnson: 14\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Red Sox: Garrett CrochetCrochet will be entering his second season with the Red Sox, and he'll be making his third consecutive (and third overall) Opening Day start. Crochet finished second in American League Cy Young Award voting after compiling a 2.59 ERA (159 ERA+) and a 5.54 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Tigers: Tarik SkubalSkubal, winner of two consecutive AL Cy Young awards, will make his third consecutive Opening Day start for the Tigers, tying him for eighth most in franchise history. It's possible this could be Skubal's final Opening Day assignment for Detroit. He's entering his walk year and is expected to receive a massive payday after accumulating a 3.08 ERA (135 ERA+) and a 5.17 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 137 big-league appearances.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Astros: Hunter BrownThe Astros will start someone other than Framber Valdez (now a member of the Tigers) on Opening Day for the first time since 2021. Brown will receive the honors after managing a 2.43 ERA (172 ERA+) and a 3.61 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 31 starts in 2025. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Marlins: Sandy AlcantaraIt was Friday, Feb. 13 when the Marlins announced that Sandy Alcantara would again get the ball on Opening Day. This will be the sixth time in the last seven seasons that he opens the season for the Marlins with 2024 -- when he was recovering from Tommy John surgery -- being the exception. The 2022 Cy Young winner was 11-12 with a 5.36 ERA last season, but he seemed to finally pitch back to form late in the season. He was 5-1 with a 2.68 ERA in the last eight outings.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFor the first time since July 17, there will not be a NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL or college football game on Friday. That means all eyes should be on the game of the night: the No. 10 Michigan State Spartans taking on the Wisconsin Badgers at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc.The Spartans (20-4, 10-3 in Big Ten) are tied for third in the conference. They are coming off a much-needed 85-82 overtime win over No. 5 Illinois, which ended a two-game skid for Michigan State.The Badgers (17-7, 9-4) also are coming off an overtime victory over Illinois, a 92-90 decision in Champaign on Tuesday. Wisconsin is tied for sixth in the Big Ten. The Spartans are 2.5-point favorites over the Badgers.While Michigan State vs. Wisconsin is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule and the NBA's Rising Stars. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 13. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 10 Michigan State at WisconsinTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Wisconsin +2.5 | Expert: Over 145.5 -110 (Chip Patterson)\nFor whatever reason, the Badgers are getting no love nationally. Even though they have two road wins (Michigan and Illinois) better than any other team's, Greg Gard's men aren't even among the 10 teams also \"receiving votes\" in the AP Top 25 poll. The Badgers feature a very good back-court in Nick Boyd (20.2 points per game) and John Blackwell (18,7) that would be the envy of many teams. Led by those two, Wisconsin averages 121.7 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom, which ranks 28th in the country. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says the Badgers have a 59.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Wisconsin +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"If the Badgers are a step faster on offense and Jeremy Fears can cut through the Wisconsin defense like Keaton Wagler did, there's a real bucket-for-bucket game script that could take us Over this total,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchRising StarsTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Expert: Team Melo +230 (Mike Barner)The NBA will showcase its best young talent on Friday when the Rising Stars competition takes place at the Intuit Dome. The mini-tournament will feature three teams of the league's rookies and sophomores and one team comprised by G-Leaguers. In the first semifinal, Team Austin will face Team Melo. Team Vince will take on Team T-Mac in the second semifinal, with the two winning teams squaring off in the final. Star rookie Cooper Flagg, who was originally set to play for Team Melo, will miss the game because of an ankle sprain, but Barner still likes the team to win the competition. \"(Ace) Bailey replaces Flagg, and he has been playing well heading into the break, averaging 15.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.6 three-pointers over his last 17 games,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa StateTime: 1 p.m. Saturday | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa State -6.5\nWill he play or won't he? That the question surrounding Kansas Jayhawks star and potential No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson every game now since he has been in and out of the lineup for much of the season, sometimes mysteriously, with various ailments (cramps, hamstring and flu, among other things). When he has played, he has been great (20.5 points per game in 13 starts). And when he hasn't played, the Jayhawks (19-5, 9-2 in Big 12) still have been very good, knocking off No. 1 Arizona on Monday. But on Saturday, Kansas goes on the road to face the fifth-ranked Iowa State Cyclones (21-3, 8-3), who rank sixth in the country in defensive efficiency (92.0 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Cyclones have a 60.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Iowa State -6.5.No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 FloridaTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kentucky +11.5\nThe lead in the SEC will be on the line when the Florida Gators and Kentucky Wildcats collide on Saturday at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (18-6, 9-2 in SEC) lead the conference by one game over the Wildcats (17-7, 8-3) and Arkansas Razorbacks (18-6, 8-3). Florida has emerged once again as the best team in the SEC. Over their last four games, the Gators have outscored opponents by an average score of 92-65. But on Saturday, they face a Kentucky team that is on its own roll, having won eight of its last nine. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance the Wildcats cover this large spread and assigns a C grade to Kentucky +11.5.No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 ArizonaTime: 6:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas Tech +9.5\nThe top-ranked Arizona Wildcats will look to bounce back from their first loss of the season when they host the Texas Tech Red Raiders on Saturday at the McKale Center. On Monday the Wildcats (23-1, 10-1 in Big 12) failed to execute in the second half and lost at Kansas. Meanwhile the Red Raiders (18-6, 8-3) are coming off a 34-point victory against Colorado, which prompted Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle to rip into his team. While the Wildcats figure to have the advantage on the glass, Texas Tech leads the conference and ranks seventh in the nation in 3-point makes per game (11.5), while Arizona ranks 336th (5.9) in that category. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 56.0% chance the Red Raiders cover and gives a C grade to Texas Tech +9.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a pretty wide disparity between the perception and reality of \"clutch\" basketball. We tend to believe it's almost genetic: some players and teams have a clutch instinct, while others don't. The truth is more nuanced than that. Really, clutch performance encompasses such a tiny sample that it can look almost random. Last year's Bulls had a higher clutch net rating than last year's Celtics. The 2022-23 Mavericks who missed the playoffs went 26-29 in the clutch. The 2023-24 team that made the NBA Finals with a pretty similar group of players went 23-9. It may not be fully random, but clutch performance is rarely consistent.Unless, for the past few decades, you've had Chris Paul. The 2016-17 Houston Rockets finished 18th in clutch net rating. Then they got Chris Paul and finished first in the 2017-18 season, outscoring opponents by 27.1 points per 100 possessions in those minutes. The 2018-19 Oklahoma City Thunder finished 11th in clutch net rating. Then they got Paul and finished first in the 2019-20 season, outscoring opponents by 24.4 points per 100 possessions in those minutes. The 2019-20 Phoenix Suns finished 21st in the NBA in clutch net rating. If you're sensing a trend here, you'll be disappointed. It actually took Paul two whole years to lead them to the NBA's best clutch net rating, a staggering +33.4 in the 2021-22 season. All he managed in his first season in Phoenix was a meager trip to the NBA Finals. Between his first All-Star season in 2008 and his last in 2022, Paul won 65% of the NBA-defined clutch games he played in. During that same window, LeBron James won 64.2%. Apply the same criteria of first All-Star selection to last to other contemporaries like Kevin Durant (59.6%) and Stephen Curry (60.5%), Paul still comes out on top. In the 21st-century NBA, there was no easier path to winning close, regular-season games than having Paul on your team.That dreaded, \"regular-season\" qualifier is what will stick with Paul, who officially ended his 21-season NBA career on Friday. You don't really get credit for doing it in the regular season if you can't match it in the playoffs. Paul, whose last game came in December before he was unceremoniously dumped by the Clippers, never won a championship. He now officially joins that ignominious list of the greatest players in NBA history never to win a championship.\nAnd he's an exceedingly frustrating addition to it. He isn't James Harden, with a lengthy track record of elimination game disappearing acts. His effort and conditioning never waxed and waned like Charles Barkley's. There's no great flaw here, no defect that deprived him of glory. Paul was great at just about everything. He's tied for the seventh-most All-Defense selections in NBA history... as a guard listed at 6 feet tall (and probably an inch or two shorter). He's flirted with 50-40-90 shooting seasons, led the NBA in assists five times while practically never turning the ball over and even rebounded exceptionally for a guard. He's a basketball genius, so aggressive in seeking advantages that he once convinced an official to call a technical foul on an opponent because his jersey wasn't tucked in. He is the very definition of a winning player. He just never actually got to win.He bears some responsibility for that, of course. The Clippers' 2014 collapse against Oklahoma City, for instance, was an absolute debacle. Paul turned the ball over twice in 17 seconds and fouled Russell Westbrook on a 3-pointer while up by two, leading to the worst loss of his playoff career. But James has the 2011 Finals. Kobe Bryant had 2004. Every legend has a stain somewhere on their playoff résumé. They tend to clean it off with their victories. And the stars just never quite aligned for Paul, often for reasons outside of his control.How many stars have had a trade voided by the league? If David Stern hadn't killed his trade to the Lakers, he likely would have gotten at least one ring in purple and gold because, well, everyone does. It might've come alongside Bryant in the twilight of his career, or it might've come in the next iteration of the team. Instead, he was traded to the cursed Clippers. Blake Griffin couldn't stay healthy and Donald Sterling was forced to sell the team.\nEven still, he had a real chance at the 2015 title in Los Angeles. He'd just slain the defending champion Spurs and led the Rockets by 19 near the end of the third quarter of an elimination game of the second round before Josh Smith and Corey Brewer had the best shooting quarter of their lives to steal the game and ultimately the series. The Warriors were vulnerable at that point. The Grizzlies had just pushed them to six, and the Cavaliers would ultimately do the same without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. But Paul, hobbled by an injury, couldn't prevent one of the most infamous examples of bad shooting luck in playoff history.Golden State ascended from there and would become the most persistent thorn in Paul's side, along with injuries. Imagine if the Warriors had won it all in 2016. Might Durant have chosen to play in Los Angeles with Paul, rather than with Curry and the Warriors? We'll never know. Paul had his share of star teammates, but he never had what Curry and Durant did together, an unimpeachable and nearly unstoppable title favorite.\"Nearly\" unstoppable because Paul almost stopped them alongside Harden. Houston led Golden State 3-2 after five games in the 2018 Western Conference finals. But Paul injured his hamstring at the end of Game 5. The Warriors took Game 6 easily on their home court. And then, in yet another example of miserable shooting variance, Houston infamously lost Game 7 at home thanks to a 0-for-27 shooting stretch from deep. A year later, Paul's relationship with Harden soured, and he got shipped to the Thunder.\nNobody will or should question what happened next. Sam Presti flipped Paul to Phoenix a year later and now he has a budding dynasty on his hands. But it's hard not to wonder if things could have been different had the Thunder elected not to tank. What could Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander have been doing together for the next few years? Could Presti have used his mountain of draft picks to build a champion around him? We'll never know. Paul went to Phoenix. He came closer than he ever had before. And then Giannis Antetokounmpo had his superhero moment. The team got COVID and collapsed against Dallas in 2022. And the Paul championship window seemingly closed. Maybe he could have reopened it as a 2024 free agent. He elected to pursue a real role with the Spurs over a backup job with a better team. \"I love nothing more than the opportunity to play and contribute and hoop,\" Paul said at the time.He did it as well as almost anyone who's ever played the game. He's called the \"Point God\" for a reason, after all. But as we covered up top, there's a lot of randomness inherent in clutch performance, and winning championships means winning in the clutch. Paul did as much as humanly possible to put himself in a situation to do that, but even he couldn't control everything. He wound up being among the unluckier players in recent NBA memory. Play his career 100 times and he's a champion in 90 of them. Tweak even a single factor -- injuries, shooting variance, team circumstance -- and he hoists a trophy at some point.Instead, he joins that frustrating list of all-time greats who never had the chance. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL MVP race resembled that of many memorable Kentucky Derby finishes in which a cluster of viable competitors rounded the final turn, only to see two thoroughbreds break away toward a photo finish. Rams QB Matthew Stafford crossed the finish line by a length – in this case, exactly one first-place vote – ahead of Patriots second-year sensation Drake Maye after the two traded the lead in the sportsbook MVP odds numerous times down the stretch. Heading into Week 18, Maye was the odds-on favorite with a price of around -400 at most betting outlets, suggesting his receipt of the accolade was all but a foregone conclusion. But those who backed Stafford were rewarded after the veteran signal-caller threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns in a 37-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals to finish the regular season. Although the regular-season finale was far from his most prolific stat line, it is widely believed Stafford received credit among voters for notching 457 yards and three scores in a wild 38-37 Week 16 overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks, who would go on to allow just one offensive touchdown combined across their final two games.  The intrigue surrounding the air-tight finish makes it easy to forget that neither finalist was even on the radar of football analysts and oddsmakers ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Maye, who was heading into his second season on a Patriots club that went 4-13 in his rookie campaign, could be found with odds of +6000 or better at most sportsbooks. Stafford, on the other hand, literally wasn't even on the betting menu. He was an afterthought amid widespread speculation that lingering injuries could keep him out part or all of the 2025 NFL season. He first emerged in the NFL MVP odds about four weeks into the season and could still be backed at odds of +2200 or better midway through the schedule.So the obvious question is, are any such viable longshots in the 2026 NFL MVP odds worth a sprinkle right now? Similar to the Stafford plight that basically nobody saw coming, such a position would require an imaginative narrative that at least has some potential merit. For instance, imagine pending free agent Kirk Cousins (+20000) were to return to the Vikings, win the starting job over erratic prospect J.J. McCarthy, and put up massive numbers with Justin Jefferson and friends while leading the Vikings back to the NFC North title. Keep in mind Cousins is ultra popular with the NFL media and such a  feel-good storyline would captivate the voters and fans alike. It would take this type of a redemption or comeback journey to give a super longshot a legitimate chance. One thing you can do for sure is eliminate all non-quarterbacks. Although 16 running backs have won the award in NFL history, Adrian Peterson was the last to do so in 2012 and it appears award voters have decided that Offensive Player of the Year is the ceiling accolade that non-quarterbacks can attain in the modern era. This is illustrated by the fact that 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley of the Eagles have produced record-breaking numbers in each of the past two years and neither received a single MVP vote.

Here are some intial leans: Burrow/Mahomes (+1000): We are grouping these AFC signal-callers together because of their overlapping criteria and the principle that either at +1000 could easily provide some equity. Mahomes is a two-time MVP winner who will be coming off a torn ACL that ended his 2025 season. If he is ready in Week 1 and leads the Chiefs back into the AFC title picture while remaining healthy, there's little doubt he will be in MVP consideration. Burrow's late-season return from a toe injury reminded football observers what the Bengals are capable of with him at the helm. Burrow is extremely popular with the NFL media and, should the Bengals return to playoff contention, he will have the accompanying massive numbers to support an MVP bid.  Lawrence (+2000): The first overall pick of the 2021 draft played the best football of his career in 2025, throwing for 4,007 yards and 29 touchdowns against 12 interceptions as the Jaguars reached the postseason in their first year under head coach Liam Cohen. During an eight-game winning streak to close out the regular season, Lawrence was arguably playing as well or better than any quarterback in the league and had just two interceptions in that span. Should the Clemson product maintain this level of production while keeping turnovers limited, he could win over voters who might have some fatigue of familiar candidates. He might also receive some sentiment on the comeback narrative considering many analysts, prior to last season, were prepared to label him a complete bust. Dart (+4500): Hat tip to SportsLine lead NFL analyst R.J. White for this suggestion. He believes the second-year dual-threat quarterback will be a popular choice among MVP longshot bettors given his chance to excel under new coach John Harbaugh and the potential for big numbers as the Giants attempt to make a major step forward in a vulnerable NFC East. Sign up with DraftKings and start earning bonus bets today:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- For better or worse, tanking and the draft lottery are hot topics in the NBA as we enter All-Star Weekend. Less than 24 hours before the NBA Rising Stars Challenge, the Utah Jazz and the Indiana Pacers were fined by the NBA on Thursday night.The Jazz were hit with a $500,000 fine, while Indiana was fined $100,000 related to the management of their respective rosters in recent games. If you thought the tank last year for Cooper Flagg was worth monitoring, this year will be an even bigger story because of the blue-chip talent at the top. Duke's Cameron Boozer, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Kansas' Darryn Peterson project as the top three picks in this summer's draft, and each of them can represent a foundational building block for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Mock Draft: Where college stars like Cameron Boozer, Caleb Wilson figure to go\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, this year's NBA rookie class, headlined by names like Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, VJ Edgecombe and Kon Knueppel, makes it one of the strongest classes in years. The term \"Capture the Flagg\" took over social media in the months leading up to the lottery, which was won by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas entered the draft lottery with just a 1.8% chance of landing the top pick.With the draft lottery and the race to the bottom of the standings being such a hot topic among NBA fans, some players admitted to keeping tabs on what was happening toward the bottom of the NBA standings before they were drafted. Others, when asked, said they blocked it out.\n\"I ain't going to lie, I did,\" Edgecombe said when asked if he followed the NBA standings. \"Early in the season, I wasn't really hooping. They had me in the honorable mention for Freshman of the Year and stuff like that. ... I did, not going to lie. I was looking.\"Coming out of Baylor, Edgecombe was a projected top-five pick, but it was unclear exactly where he would land on draft night. After the 76ers moved into the top three and passed on the chance to select Ace Bailey, who reportedly canceled his pre-draft workout with the 76ers, Philadelphia landed on Edgecombe.That's part of the reason why this topic has extended to the All-Star Game. A team like Jazz dropped all the way to pick No. 5 last year after finishing with the worst record in the league. Utah selected Bailey at No. 5. Utah owes its 2026 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it finishes outside of the top eight in this year's lottery.\n\"My head was just down, focusing on the main thing, being in the NBA,\" Bailey said on whether he paid attention to the standings. \"That was my main goal. Had my circle around me blocking out the outside noise.\"A player like Brooklyn's Egor Dёmin, who had a wide range of where he might get picked in the months leading up to the draft, also paid attention to what was going on in the NBA before he entered.\"I was really trying to stay present,\" Dёmin said. \"As big as the NBA is, standings and other stuff, it's just popping out. Even if you're trying not to see it, you're going to still see (the standings).\"\nSince the draft odds were flattened in 2019, the team that finished the season with the worst record in the association has never landed the No. 1 pick. In 2024, the Hawks had just a 3% chance of landing No. 1. That draft was more of a mystery than last year and 2026. There wasn't a clear-cut top prospect that teams were necessarily tanking for, which led to drama on draft night.The biggest college star leading up to the 2024 NBA Draft was Reed Sheppard, who was selected by the Houston Rockets at No. 3. Houston held the Brooklyn Nets pick and moved up from having the ninth-best odds at No. 1 to inside the top three on lottery night. The NBA standings and the tank race that year were \"hard to not ignore\" for Sheppard.\n\"It's definitely hard to not ignore,\" Sheppard said. \"I was trying to focus on the season and not trying to get caught up in everything. Social media, you're going to see things. Your friends, they're going to send you stuff.\"With this year's race to the bottom of the NBA standings being one of the most competitive and interesting in quite some time, it's safe to say some of the best (future) draft picks of tomorrow will be following along, too.\n            ",

He claimed the NFL is \"rife with racism,\" specifically in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.\"The court's decision recognizes that an arbitration forum in which the defendant's own chief executive gets to decide the case would strip employees of their rights under the law,\" said attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and David E. Gottlieb in a statement. \"It is long overdue for the NFL to recognize this and finally provide a fair, neutral and transparent forum for these issues to be addressed.\"  \nAs a result of the ruling, the case will now move to trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Friday, April 3 in New York. \n            \n    ",

Goaltender Jeremy Swayman turned in a shaky performance, but the team in front of him got better as the game progressed and pulled away in the third period,Trailing 2-1 after the first period, the U.S. needed a spark, and Brady Tkachuk found one. He ripped home the tying goal off an offensive zone faceoff midway through the second period, and just 57 seconds later, Jack Eichel gave the Americans the lead on a similar play.\nTeam USA needed that boost because it started slowly for the second game in a row. Mistake-filled hockey from the Americans was magnified by Swayman, who got the start in goal while Connor Hellebuyck rested. Swayman allowed three goals, and the blame for two of them rested on his shoulders. The most egregious goal against came on a shot that was floated in from the center red line.Noah Hanifin scored what would ultimately become the game-winner when he followed up his own blocked shot and snuck the rebound through the legs of Sogaard. Jake Guentzel and Jack Hughers were able to provide some insurance in the third period.Team USA is now in position to take a top-two seed into the knockout round, and it can finish off a perfect 3-0-0-0 run in preliminary play with a win over Leon Draisaitl and Germany on Sunday afternoon.U.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3USA vs. Germany | Sunday, Feb. 15 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Unrivaled 1-on-1 tournament delivered again. Three nights of exciting action came to a close on Saturday in Miami, when Chelsea Gray outlasted Allisha Gray in a three-game war in the finals to claim the 2026 title and a $200,000 payday. As the runner-up, Allisha will take home $50,000. Chelsea Gray, a.k.a. the Point Gawd, is a serial winner, and it's little surprise that she was able to add another trophy to her collection, which also includes four WNBA titles, a WNBA Finals MVP, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup title, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup MVP and an Unrivaled Finals MVP. \"First I want to shout out Lish, man. A round of applause for Lish. Something about that last name, man, I swear. Man, we were exhausted,\" Chelsea Gray said. I was just telling [Jackie Young], I'm done with the sprints. But man, just a testament to the hard work that I put in all the time.\"The $200,000 payday is more than Gray made in the WNBA last season, when she earned $196,267 with the Las Vegas Aces. \n\"You just gotta take care of the moment and the rest will happen,\" Gray said. \"You dig deep when there's $200K on the line. We were both battling. We'll spend that money wisely.\"After the work she put in on Saturday night, Gray only had one thing on her mind. \"A vacation,\" she said, when asked how she'll spend the money. \"My wife said that she'll handle it.\"\nBreaking down the finalsGame 1There wasn't much drama in the first game. Allisha started with the ball and immediately hit a 3-pointer to jump in front, then got to the free throw line for a 2-point free throw, and finally closed the game with a tough fadeaway after an offensive rebound. \nGame 2Both players looked exhausted in the second game and traded a number of misses early on. Allisha hit a 3-pointer to go in front, but Chelsea responded with back-to-back 3s of her own to jump in front and earn game point. After a timeout, the former Finals MVP closed the show with a fadeaway jumper. Game 3Allisha started with the ball again in Game 3, and the long break after Game 2 seemed to give her a second wind. She got right to the rim at will and scored six quick points to put Chelsea on the brink. A miss gave Chelsea life, however, and she bounced back with four quick points of her own. At that point, the game turned into an extremely physical slog. Both players were pushing and holding, and neither could buy a bucket, while the refs were reluctant to decide the game with their whistles. After dozens of misses, Chelsea caught a break when Allisha lost her footing, which opened up the space for Chelsea to drain a tournament-winning 3. \nSemifinals deliverGray and Gray reached the finals in thrilling fashion. In the first semifinal, Chelsea Gray fell behind 8-0 to her former Las Vegas Aces teammate Kelsey Plum, then ripped off 12 consecutive points by using her size advantage to get into the paint and finish. It seemed as though the second contest would follow the same script, as Allisha Gray took a 9-0 lead on Aliyah Boston, who immediately responded by bullying the smaller Gray in the post to score 10 points of her own. Boston couldn't complete the comeback, however, and Gray drained a 3-pointer to advance. Boston and Plum, losers of the semifinals, will take home $25,000 each. \n            ",

With the squad returning to health, Club America are climbing up the table with two consecutive wins, but they're chasing a Chivas squad who are the lone Liga MX side with five wins from five matches played.How to watch Chivas Guadalajara vs. Club America, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 10:07 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio AKRON -- Zapopan, MexicoTV: TelemundoOdds: Chivas +120; Draw +240; Club America +220The creativity from Richy Ledezema has paced the attack with six assists, and being joined by former Chicago Fire man Brian Gutierrez in midfield, there has been enough firepower to push Chivas up the table. But with America returning to health, American Alex Zendejas and striker Henry Martin will look to change things in a heated rivalry match.On Sunday, you can also catch quite a clash on the CBS Sports Golazo Network with Cuz Azul hosting Tigres. Both sides had big midweek wins in Conacaf Champions Cup play and are also sitting level on 10 points in the table. The teams with the third most goals scored in the Clausura portion of the season.

    "body": "\n        After a 2024 season in which Scottie Scheffler claimed half of the PGA Tour's signature events, all eight were won by different players in 2025. Parity was the name of the game as winner's checks worth $3.6 million and $4 million for the player invitationals were doled out to a variety of names, including not only Scheffler but Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, among others.This week, the 2026 signature events get underway as the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am takes center stage. McIlroy enters as the reigning champion after kicking off a memorable spring in California last year, not only winning at Pebble Beach but adding The Players Championship and his first Masters green jacket to three early season wins. He will be playing his first PGA Tour event of 2026, as will Tommy Fleetwood, who won the FedEx Cup a year ago.The stakes are elevated when a signature event falls on the calendar, which means the payouts are raised, too. Not only will $3.6 million of the $20 million purse be awarded to the winner, every player inside the top 10 will clear $500,000 and those inside the top 20 will each earn north of $250,000.Let's take a look at how the payouts for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am will be divided among the 80 players at Pebble Beach Golf Links.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prize money, purseTotal Purse: $20 million\n1st: $3,600,0002nd: $2,160,0003rd: $1,360,0004th: $960,0005th: $795,0006th: $715,0007th: $665,0008th: $615,0009th: $575,00010th: $535,00011th: $495,00012th: $455,00013th: $415,00014th: $375,00015th: $352,00016th: $332,00017th: $312,00018th: $292,00019th: $272,00020th: $252,00021st: $232,00022nd: $217,00023rd: $202,00024th: $187,00025th: $172,00026th: $158,00027th: $150,00028th: $143,00029th: $137,00030th: $131,00031st: $125,00032nd: $119,00033rd: $114,00034th: $109,00035th: $104,00036th: $99,00037th: $94,00038th: $89,00039th: $84,00040th: $80,00041st: $76,00042nd: $72,00043rd: $68,00044th: $64,00045th: $60,00046th: $57,00047th: $54,00048th: $52,00049th: $50,00050th: $48,00051st: $47,00052nd: $46,00053rd: $45,00054th: $44,00055th: $43,00056th: $42,00057th: $41,00058th: $40,00059th: $39,50060th: $39,00061st: $38,50062nd: $38,00063rd: $37,50064th: $37,00065th: $36,50066th: $36,00067th: $35,50068th: $35,00069th: $34,75070th: $34,50071st: $34,25072nd: $34,00073rd: $33,75074th: $33,50075th: $33,25076th: $33,00077th: $32,75078th: $32,50079th: $32,25080th: $32,000\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour's first signature event of the 2026 season enters the weekend with a stacked leaderboard at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Reigning champion Rory McIlroy is making his season debut stateside, but he appears to have ejected in Round 3, while a par in the first round from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has him fighting from far behind at Pebble Beach Golf Links in California.Joining them among the top names in the field is last week's winner, Chris Gotterup, who has a pair of victories already in 2026 looked poised to surge again at Pebble Beach only to fall back in the second round. Like McIlroy, Pebble Beach is our first look at Tour Championship winner Tommy Fleetwood, as he enters 2026 with lofty expectations after finally breaking through at East Lake last August.Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune, Sam Burns, Rickie Fowler, Xander Schauffele and Jordan Spieth are among the biggest names in contention after 36 holes. Each will aim to utilize Moving Day to its fullest extent, putting himself in position for a final-round run Sunday for a significant $3.6 million winner's payout.Here's how you'll be able to follow all the action on the picturesque California coast this week in the biggest event of the season thus far. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am TV schedule All times EasternRound 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 11:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 11:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports App\nLive TV coverage: 3-7 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-7 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppRadio: 2-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 11:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 11:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

In the semifinals, which also took place Saturday, she fell behind Kelsey Plum 8-0, before going on a 12-0 run to end the game. Gray then lost the first game of the finals, and trailed in each of the last two games. Notably, she was down 6-0 in Game 3, but dug deep and closed on a 7-0 run to claim victory.  Plum and Aliyah Boston, who lost to Allisha Gray in another semifinal thriller, will each take home $25,000. \nFinals results (best-of-three)No. 2 Chelsea Gray def.

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas Tech roared back to stun No. 1 Arizona 78-75 in overtime on Saturday in a Big 12 thriller with wide-ranging ramifications. The loss caps an 0-2 week for the Wildcats, who were the last unbeaten high-major team until Monday night's loss at Kansas.Arizona led 64-57 with just over three minutes left in regulation before going cold down the stretch while playing shorthanded. Star freshman forward Koa Peat did not play in the second half due to a lower body injury, effectively leaving Arizona with a six-man rotation.The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) were also without freshman forward Dwayne Aristode due to illness. Texas Tech (19-6, 9-3 Big 12) is not a deep team, either, but the Red Raiders have grown accustomed to playing long minutes this season, and they rose to the occasion late.JT Toppin led the way with 31 points and 13 rebounds in 44 minutes for the Red Raiders and scored eight in the overtime period. His offensive rebound with six seconds left also helped cement the outcome.\nChristian Anderson added 19 points and eight assists. He played all 45 minutes.\nThe outcome solidifies the chances that No. 2 Michigan jumps to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday. It also means No. 3 Houston (23-2, 11-1 Big 12) is now alone atop the Big 12 standings.Texas Tech has now defeated three of the No. 1 seeds in CBS Sports Bracketology, as the Red Raiders also own wins over Duke and Houston.Why Arizona will remain a No. 1 seedIt's just Arizona's second loss, and it's not a bad loss. Therefore, the Wildcats are expected to remain on the No. 1 seed line in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. \nHowever, this will create some separation between Michigan and Arizona for the time being. The model already favored Michigan as the No. 1 overall seed due to its No. 1 ranking in WAB (Wins Above Bubble) and No. 1 ranking at KenPom. But it was harder to draw a distinction between the teams when they both had just one loss. The call for No. 1 overall is certainly more obvious now.What about Texas Tech?Texas Tech is projected by the CBS Sports Bracketology model to stay a No. 4 seed but to move up within the No. 4 seed hierarchy. Over the long run, a metric-moving result like beating the nation's No. 1 team on the road will help tremendously in making a push back toward the No. 3 line practical for the Red Raiders, who reached the Elite Eight as a No. 3 seed last season. Beating the NET's No. 2 team on the road is worth a whopping 0.93 in WAB, which could result in a 3-4 spot jump for the Red Raiders, who entered the day at No. 15 in the important resume metric. Texas Tech's six losses are all of the Quad 1 variety, and it now has six Quad 1 wins to match them.\n            ",

Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC. The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama. Sac State is also scheduled to face Fresno State in Week 2, as outlined in the Pac-12 schedule release. \n        \n            \n                Longtime FCS standard bearer North Dakota State seeks fresh challenge with leap to FBS\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSac State moved all non-football sports to from the Big Sky to the Big West last summer and applied for a waiver to join the FBS as an independent. After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. \nThe school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. Carter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"\nThe Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            \n    ",

Parker embodied everything we look for in a UNI football Panther. His talent and potential excited us on a daily basis, but it failed to compare to the type of person and teammate he was. His character, humility, toughness and genuine love of others are what champions are made of. While I'm saddened that our time together was short, we will celebrate the bright light that he brought to our football team for the rest of our lives.\"\nSutherland was a second-team all-state selection as a senior at Iowa City High School in 2024. He also played basketball and baseball.\"It is a heartbreaking day for our Panther Athletics family with the passing of our Parker Sutherland,\" UNI athletics director Megan Franklin said in a release. \"We are devastated -- just devastated.

    "body": "\n        Six months into a season, it is not unusual to know what to expect from any given team on any given day and that was certainly the case for anyone who cared to check on Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday as they faced Newcastle United. A sluggish team who seemed a step or two behind the opponent in terms of intensity levels? Check. A porous defense that seems to lack chemistry? Check. An attack that has very few ideas? Check. Few redeeming qualities as the team slouched to yet another Premier League defeat? Check again.Thomas Frank, whose months-long spell in charge of the team finally came to an end after their latest drab performance, did not create all of Spurs' issues. He is right to point to the fact that he, like his predecessor Ange Postecoglou last season, had to contend with an injury crisis of epic proportions, all while captain Cristian Romero serves a suspension for a red card in their 2-0 defeat at Manchester United on Saturday. He was not wrong to note that this very team finished 17th in the Premier League last season, an admission that the ceiling is only so high for the current iteration of Spurs. Frank, though, did not do himself a single favor during his brief stint in north London, emerging as a rare example of a coach who truly earned a promotion to the big leagues but failed to prove his worth for the most part.Frank's tenure with Spurs is remarkable for all the wrong reasons, the Denmark native unable to live up to the billing in any real sense. He was supposed to be a practical alternative to Postecoglou, who spent much more time ensuring his team had a functioning attack than a competent defense. It was not the only issue the next coach should have theoretically fixed – his Brentford side were organized when defending set pieces and impactful on the flip side, a signal that Frank's Spurs would be efficient on both ends of the pitch.His perceived pragmatism, though, was mistaken for ability. Frank inherited a mess but he also failed to improve the issues that were fully in his control. There were very few categories in which Frank made a noticeable positive impact, an underperformance that is easy to spot regardless of how one chooses to define success. Averaging 0.1 more point per match compared to Postecoglou's Spurs last season is not much of a flex, and neither is making an improvement of 0.3 goals against per game when the team ranks 13th in the Premier League when sorting for expected goals against. If Postecoglou was reckless for allowing a porous back line to take shape despite boasting brilliant defenders in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Frank is guilty of the same crime despite having the upper hand of a fit first-choice center back duo for much of the season.\nTottenham (2025-26)Tottenham  (2024-25) Brentford (2024-25)Points per game1.11.01.5Goals per game1.41.71.7Expected goals per game1.11.61.6Goals against per game1.41.71.4Expected goals against per game1.51.71.5Spurs' defensive shortcomings were hard to ignore even in a superficial watch on any given matchday. The defenders at his disposal had years of experience alongside one another and yet appeared completely disjointed, the natural result of Frank failing to lock in tactical foundations and going back to the drawing board more often than a coach of his caliber usually does. His defenders seemed unsure of their next move, unable to rely upon their instincts and mistake-prone as a result. Frustration and despair oozed out of the players each time a goal was conceded, no matter how predictable it was; contempt grew amongst the fanbase, who were more prone to booing than cheering quickly enough in Frank's tenure.Frank's Spurs underperformed in equal measure in front of goal. The coach had the bare bones of an attacking idea from the start of the season, one that seemed to go hand-in-hand with Spurs' odd squad construction. He would bypass midfield for the most part and instead prioritize play on the wings to generate attacking opportunities, a solution of sorts for a team that lacked any real passers after James Maddison tore his ACL in preseason, all while nicking a few goals off of set pieces. That plan did not pan out all that much – Spurs' attacking statistics this season are buoyed by an early season blitz in which they outperformed their expected goals tally, a run of beginner's luck that is generally hard to sustain.In no time at all, Spurs were out of ideas. Completing simple attacking plays was a difficult task, while their game was never built around earning more set pieces even though it was the rare area of the game they actually excelled in. At times, Frank sucked the life out of games instead, hoping his disinterest in scoring goals would grind opponents' attacks into dust. The coach gave an overly conservative approach the runout a handful of times last fall in matches that could have served as statement-making performances and at this point, it should come as no surprise that it did not work. Spurs tallied three shots and 0.12 xG in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea in which the Blues were unlucky not to have scored more as they racked up 15 attempts and 3.68 xG. Days later, Arsenal made sure not to waste their chances – they cruised to a 4-1 win as they tallied 17 shots and 1.93 xG, all while Spurs had three shots and 0.07 xG to speak of. It was evidently worse than Postecoglou's figures, but even Frank's own in his final season at Brentford.The inability to defend and attack properly was visible even at the end of Frank's tenure, perfectly encapsulated in the final goal Spurs conceded before his firing. His side could not complete a simple breakaway minutes after notching an equalizer against Newcastle, instead letting Anthony Gordon dance around a still Spurs defense before Jacob Ramsey popped the ball into the back fo the net.\nFrank's Spurs were lifeless, a whiplash-inducing exercise for anyone who remembers watching Postecoglou's version of the team. It was strange to watch Frank's Spurs give attacking a try for 45 minutes at a time every third or fourth game and then settle into a defensive structure that they could not maintain, inviting opponents into the match rather than killing the game entirely. Almost singlehandedly, he demonstrated that the belief that pragmatism is inherently efficient is a trope rather than a tried and tested philosophy for success in this sport. There is nothing practical about taking the foot off the gas when things are trending in the right direction. It is not effective to keep taking a stab at a losing strategy, hoping it will finally turn good. It is painfully unrealistic not to find a way to lean on your strengths, even if they are few and far between. There is nothing sensible about failing to lay down tactical foundations, rendering your team unable to execute a stylistic vision that seems like a prerequisite to being an elite coach.With Frank at the helm, Spurs merely dragged their feet through matches as if they were simply there to collect an attendance award rather than play. No one wins trophies with style points but Frank proved one can certainly lose without them, his team always hitting the pitch with a sense of aimlessness. It is no wonder, then, that he drew the ire of the Spurs faithful, who, unlike his team in attack, wasted no chance to lambast him for spearheading a \"boring, boring Tottenham\" – in every sense, he sucked the entertainment value and the inherent joy out of the game. In a landscape where the sport's next great managers increasingly prefer tactical rigidity, Frank's Spurs will act as a prime example in the downside of straying too far down that path. Being cautious does not inherently come with rewards, nor does it necessarily come with stability and in this case, it can slowly contribute to the erosion of an already decaying product. It forces existential questions, too, of what exactly the point of this particular exercise was for a team in desperate need of a course correction.Spurs' squad may not be up to the task of finishing even remotely close to a UEFA Champions League spot, but neither is Frank. In an age where clubs are quick to dispose of managers, he was given a chance but threw it away completely, the glimmer of hope that came in the UEFA Super Cup outing against Paris Saint-Germain an outlier rather than the start of a promising trend. Frank's firing will require a serious rethink by Spurs' leaders, many of whom are brand new to their roles after longtime chairman Daniel Levy's exit in September, because their current woes are the result of years of mismanagement and remarkably poor squad building, their trip to the Champions League final seven years ago now a distant memory of a long-gone era.\n            ",

The Friars' Duncan Powell sparked the scuffle between Big East rivals when he committed a hard foul early in the second half   on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at Providence from 2022-25 before transferring to the Red Storm. \nPowell, who was assessed a Flagrant-2 for the foul, and Hopkins immediately went after each other, which caused players from both benches to spill out onto the court. It took officials and security guards almost a minute to break up the ensuing scrum. Officials also paused play for 19 minutes so that they could review footage and issue appropriate punishment. St. John's coach Rick Pitino, who coached at Providence from 1985-87, also entered the play area in an attempt to remove his players from the situation. Powell was one of two Providence players ejected alongside leading scorer Jaylin Sellers, who immediately joined Powell in shoving St. John's players. Officials ejected St. John's forward Dillon Mitchell for his initial involvement in the scrap. Red Storm bench players Kelvin Odih, Ruben Prey and Lefteris Liotopoulos were all tossed for leaving the St. John's bench area. Hopkins shot two free throws for the initial foul and St. John's guard Oziyah Sellers shot free throws for the technical foul assessed on Providence's Sellers. Oziyah Sellers then scored to expand the St. John's lead to 44-40 with just over 14 minutes to play in the second half. \nPowell will also be suspended for Providence's next game against DePaul since he was ejected for fighting after the Flagrant-2.   The end of the fight caused further tempers to flare. Later in the second half, Providence forward Jameir Jones was immediately ejected after he pushed Hopkins while Hopkins was driving to the basket. Jones did not attempt to play the ball. Players from both sides jawed at each other following Jones' shove and subsequent ejection, but another scuffle was avoided. \nAfter the game Pitino avoided comment on the incident.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Another year, another alteration to the NBA All-Star Game. Kevin Durant was asked about the new USA vs. the World format on Saturday during media day at the Intuit Dome and whether it would solve the league's perceived problems with the event. He mostly shrugged it off. Durant said he felt like \"fans and the media need something to complain about.\" KD wasn't the only player who was pressed on the topic. Luka Dončić. Nikola Jokić. Anthony Edwards. They all got asked various versions of the question. Adam Silver wasn't so lucky.The commissioner spoke for roughly half an hour and didn't get a single question about the All-Star festivities and having to tweak the proceedings yet again to try to juice fan interest and compel the players to actually compete. Most years, that would have been top of mind for the media and the commissioner. This is not most years for Silver or the NBA. As Silver's annual press conference predictably revealed, the league is facing any number of pressing issues that come complete with significant PR problems. Tanking. A star player partnering with a prediction market. The investigation into the alleged cap circumvention by the Clippers (who are hosting this weekend's events in an all-time well this is awkward everyone just act normal situation.) When those are the main subjects things have gone sideways. \nThis is Silver's 12th full season as commissioner. It is shaping up to be his most challenging, which is saying an awful lot considering one of the very first issues he was tasked with handling was hitting the eject button on former Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught on tape making racist remarks. Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Jazz $500,000 and the Pacers $100,000 for tanking measures that the league took umbrage with. On Saturday, Silver conceded that tanking has been part of the league for a long time and even allowed that it can create a certain amount of interest at times because \"fans are rooting for their teams to be bad\" in order to potentially improve their draft position. But he also said that it's clear \"the incentives are misaligned.\"\"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\nThe problem with figuring out how to punish or discourage tanking, as Silver admitted, is that \"there's a bit of a know it when you see it quality to this.\" In other words, it's subjective and the league has essentially announced that it will be operating in a gray area with regard to disciplinary measures on that front. \"That,\" Silver said, \"is not necessarily a position we want to be in.\"There is no shortage of positions they would rather not be in these days. Holding All-Star weekend at the Inuit Dome while also looking at the Clippers for potential cap circumvention and tampering violations can't be comfortable for anyone. Silver reminded the assembly that the league office is not directly leading the investigation and instead that responsibility has been taken over by an outside law firm. He said from everything he's been told \"the Clippers have been fully cooperative, but as I said I'm not involved in the day to day.\" He called the matter \"enormously complex\" and added that he's reached no conclusions yet. The whole thing came off like Silver's version of the This is Fine meme. He employed the same approach when asked about Giannis Antetokounmpo announcing he had joined the prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder. The commish said \"it's an issue that I'm paying enormous amount of attention to.\" But he also downplayed Antetokounmpo's involvement, noting that the league has a rule for sports betting where players can make small investments in gambling companies. That same rule now applies to prediction markets. \n\"That means their investment cannot amount to over one percent,\" Silver explained. \"In the case of Giannis, from what I understand, it's a minuscule investment, much smaller than one percent. So that does not violate the rules.\"And yet, while not violating the rules, it's obviously not a great look for the league -- which is something Silver seemed to grasp as he tried to spin that topic into something closer to a net neutral for the NBA. \"It concerns me,\" Silver continued, \"in the totality of all this betting that we need a better handle, no pun intended, on all the different activity that's happening out there.\"Concerns over tanking. Concerns about the Clippers. Concerns about sports gambling and prediction markets. But they're looking into all of it -- or a law firm is in the case of the Clippers. And hey as far as prediction market investments and Giannis go, it's a small thing. Nothing to worry about.\nAs damage control goes, I'm not sure how effective any of Silver's efforts were. I sat through the entire press conference and read the transcript several times and mostly it came off as attempted deflection. As one reporter said to me afterward, Silver is really good at saying a lot of things without saying much at all. Maybe that's because all these issues swirling around the league don't come with quick or clear fixes. I don't envy him. But then no one said being in charge would be easy, either.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When discussing Real Madrid's play this season, balance, specifically the lack thereof in attack, is a word that often comes up. But in stopping a surging Real Sociedad side and running their own unbeaten streak in LaLiga play to eight straight victories with a 4-1 win, the balance that Trent Alexander-Arnold can bring was on display. And they did it without Kylian Mbappe.It only took five minutes for Real Madrid to open the scoring via a lovely pass from Alexander-Arnold to Gonzalo Garcia. It's only the second assist for the English right back this season, as injuries have limited him to only 12 appearances in all competitions. But with Benfica looming in Champions League play on Tuesday in the playoffs (which you can watch on Paramount+), this performance comes at a more important time than ever.One of the best creative right backs in the world, Alexander-Arnold joined from Liverpool ahead of the Club World Cup during the summer, and it was an exciting acquisition expected to take the Real Madrid attack to the next level. Rightfully so, as well, look at this pass map from last season at Liverpool.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            With a player spraying the ball forward like that, every attacker is able to focus on getting into good position, and there's the additional benefit of Federico Valverde being able to return to the midfield. That was also an important shift with Valverde switching from open play to join Vinicius Junior, who scored two penalties during the match.\nDespite the result, it wasn't all smiles for Real Madrid, with young defender Dean Huijsen conceding a penalty from a rash challenge that Mikel Oyarzabal scored. Los Blancos also will have felt as if they could've scored more goals, but strong finishing and penalties made sure that Real Madrid made the most of their chances. They struggled to create much from open play after the first half of action, but considering that this was without Mbappe's 38 goals in all competitions, Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa won't be too concerned.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            The leadership of American manager Pellegrino Matarazzo has turned Real Sociedad around in the league, and they're only 90 minutes from an appearance in the Copa Del Rey final, so losing in the Santiago Bernabeau it nothing to hang your head over. Arbeloa's Madrid are moving in the right direction, but all eyes will be on their Champions League fixture this week. Losing to Benfica on the final day of the league phase is what got them in this scenario; instead of the stars getting to rest during the week, Los Blancos need to find their way into the round of 16 in the Champions League.\nAlready being knocked out of the Copa Del Rey in shocking fashion to Albacete last month, catching Barcelona in LaLiga and winning the Champions League are the top priorities, and a lopsided victory over Benfica on Tuesday will be a step in the right direction as they continue to look to find balance.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida's bid for a national title repeat is nearing full stride after Saturday's 92-83 win over No. 25 Kentucky, and the No. 14 Gators have a new piece of hardware firmly in their sights as well.A year after Auburn edged the Gators by a game for the SEC regular-season crown, Florida is in the driver's seat of the league standings with six games left. Since starting league play 0-1 with a 76-74 loss at Missouri on Jan. 3, the Gators are 10-1. In that span, they've rated as the second-most efficient team in college basketball behind only Houston, according to barttorvik.com.That efficiency was on display again against a Kentucky (17-7, 8-4) team that had won eight of its past nine games. Florida employed its typical crush of offensive rebounding to establish the tone and then used some perimeter marksmanship to keep the resilient Wildcats at arm's length.\nUrban Klavzar hit 5-of-11 attempts from beyond the arc, tying a season-high for makes and marking his eighth game of 3+ makes from 3-point range this season. The only thing standing between Kentucky and a potential 13-0 run late in the second half was a pair of Klavzar triples at 5:18 and 3:07 marks that subdued Kentucky's effort to rally from a 16-point deficit.\nKlavzar's perimeter acumen as the team's top guard option off the bench has rarely been in question. The Gators have simply needed more of that firepower from within their starting lineup.Xaivian Lee provided it against Kentucky. The Princeton transfer led all scorers with 22 points, shooting a refreshing 4 of 7 from deep in a demonstration of the potential the Gators saw when they recruited the former two-time all-Ivy League performer.\nFlorida's 3-point shooting is improvingFlorida entered ranked 354th nationally in 3-point percentage at 29.2% and making just 7.4 long-range shots per game. Last year, the Gators made 9.8 per game while shooting 35.6%, which was 87th nationally. That's a big difference.While some downtick in 3-point shooting was likely unavoidable amid the departures of star guards Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard, the slide has been more intense than expected.Lee entered shooting just 25.5% from deep on six attempts per game after shooting 36.6% from deep for Princeton last season. Florida's other starting guard, Boogie Fland, entered with one 3-point make in his last seven games and went 0 for 3 against Kentucky.\nHow a team this bad at shooting has managed to be so good anyway is a remarkable testament to Florida's convoy of quality bigs and the rising stardom of versatile forward Thomas Haugh, who has been flexed down to the small forward position this season. That move hasn't helped Florida's perimeter shooting, but it has only made them meaner defensively and tougher to handle on the glass.\nWhen the Gators do get hot from deep like they did against Kentucky? Watch out. That's when a great team starts to like an elite team that can win it all. Florida is now 9-0 when making nine or more 3-pointers after finishing 10 of 28 against Kentucky.Florida in good position in SEC raceThe Gators now have at least a two-game edge in the loss column on everyone in the SEC standings except for Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered their Saturday game with Auburn at 8-3 in the league. Florida will host Arkansas on Feb. 28 in a game that could have SEC title ramifications.\nIt's also possible that the Gators will have separated even further from the pack by then. Their next two games are against lower-tier foes South Carolina and Ole Miss before a manageable trip to Texas on Feb. 25.A return trip to face Kentucky inside Rupp Arena on March 7 also looms at the end of the schedule. But at this rate, Florida may have the league title locked up by the time it returns to the scene of last year's thrilling 106-100 loss to the Wildcats.\n            ",

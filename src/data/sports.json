    "body": "\nChampions will be crowned on Sunday, Feb. 8, when the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks meet in Super Bowl 60. The game will be defined by the two quarterbacks -- New England's Drake Maye and Seattle's Sam Darnold. Both were picked early in the first round in their respective drafts, but the signal-callers took vastly different paths to the sport's biggest game. Maye became an MVP candidate in just his second season, while Darnold went from blue-chip prospect to bust to grizzled veteran. Darnold is +115 (risk $100 to win $115) to win Super Bowl MVP, while Maye is +240. Both teams have strong defenses and robust rushing attacks. Critics will say the Patriots took advantage of an easy schedule to get here, but New England had to overcome two of the NFL's best defenses -- Houston and Denver -- in the playoffs. The Seahawks, meanwhile, won a brutal NFC West with a bruising defense of their own and the NFL's leader in receiving yards, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kickoff from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara is set for 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The over/under for total points scored is 45.5.

    "body": "\n        It's finally here. The 2025 NFL season comes to a conclusion this Sunday as the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots battle for the Lombardi Trophy. This is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX, when Seattle decided to pass from the 1-yard line instead of running with Marshawn Lynch. Russell Wilson's pass ended up in the arms of Malcolm Butler, and the Patriots won their fourth Super Bowl.Not many people expected this Super Bowl matchup in September. After all, this is the first Super Bowl since 1981 to feature teams with preseason odds of 50-1 or longer. The signing of Sam Darnold wasn't viewed as a home run for the Seahawks, while Mike Vrabel's Patriots were a total question mark coming off a 4-13 season. However, this is the only Super Bowl since the 1970 merger to feature two teams that both ranked in the top four in scoring offense and scoring defense.Which team should you trust on Super Bowl Sunday? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break it down.Super Bowl LX: Where to watch Seahawks vs. PatriotsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyTV: NBC (stream on Peacock)Follow: CBS Sports AppBetting odds: Seahawks -4.5 | O/U 45.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook)\nSuper Bowl LX picks, predictionsJordan DajaniI'm excited for this Super Bowl for several reasons. It's the first matchup since 1981 to feature two teams with preseason odds of 50-1 or longer. No one expected these teams to be on this stage. We have a quarterback in Sam Darnold who could become the first to win a Super Bowl after playing for five different teams, while the other quarterback, Drake Maye, could become the youngest ever to win one. Then there's the storyline of whether the Patriots could be a dynasty reborn under Mike Vrabel. Regardless of what happens Sunday, I think New England is here to stay.While I'm excited for this game, there's a possibility it ends up being a low-scoring affair that isn't particularly close. The main matchup to watch is the Seahawks defense vs. the Patriots offense. Seattle has arguably the best defense in the NFL, while the Patriots have averaged just 18 points per game this postseason -- the fewest by a Super Bowl team since the 1979 Rams. This is the seventh Super Bowl since 1970 between an All-Pro quarterback (Maye) and the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (Seattle). The No. 1 scoring defense is 5-1 in the previous six matchups. Furthermore, Mike Macdonald's defenses are 6-0 vs. first- or second-year quarterbacks, allowing two passing touchdowns compared to nine interceptions in those games. A few of the quarterbacks held in check include Bo Nix, Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels.\nThey say defense wins championships, and I think that will be proven Sunday. As for the spread, only seven Super Bowl underdogs have lost outright and still covered. So I'll lay the points with Seattle.Prediction: Seahawks 20, Patriots 13Jared DubinSeattle's defense is just too good. New England has already struggled offensively through its first three playoff games, failing to produce representative performances against the Chargers, Texans or Broncos. Now, the Patriots face what may be their toughest test yet in this Seahawks group. They can generate pressure and are sticky on the back end. They typically don't allow the type of big plays the Patriots' passing offense relied on during the regular season before it backslid in the playoffs.The Pats will have to run the ball well and probably dink and dunk their way down the field, and I'm not sure they can do it well enough to put up a ton of points. Strangely, I might trust Seattle's offense more than New England's at the moment, given the way Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and even Kenneth Walker III are playing. If the Seahawks can stay in a neutral or positive game script and avoid a pure dropback game for an extended stretch, I like them to come away with the win.\nPrediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III is -195 (risk $195 to win $100) to score a touchdown, while Patriots RB Rhamondre Stevenson is +145. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

The Americans certainly have the team to compete for another gold medal thanks to a collection of proven Olympic veterans and rising stars.Along with Canada, Team USA is one of just two countries that have won gold in women's ice hockey since the event was added to the Olympics in 1998. The Americans won that inaugural year in Nagano, then endured four straight Canadian victories until 2018, when Team USA struck back with a dramatic overtime win to capture gold in Pyeongchang.Team USA is poised to retake its place atop the international hockey hierarchy, and it enters the Olympics as the favorite to win gold. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, it's another two-horse race between the U.S. (-115) and Canada (+115), at least on paper. The next closest gold medal contenders are Czechia (+5000) and Finland (+6000).As is typically the case, the Americans have put together a roster that's loaded at every position, and there's a good mix of experience and youth. Captain Hilary Knight is making her fifth Olympic appearance, and star Kendall Coyne Schofield will make her fourth Olympic appearance. Defenders Megan Keller and Lee Stecklein are also familiar with the Olympic stage. Meanwhile, rising stars Taylor Heise, Carlone Harvey and Laila Edwards are getting their first taste of Olympic action.The Americans' begin this Olympic journey with a matchup against Czechia on Thursday, and we'll keep you up to date with each result along the way.U.S. women's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundUSA vs. Czechia | Thursday, Feb. 5 | 10:40 a.m. | USA Network USA vs. Finland | Saturday, Feb. 7 | 10:40 a.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Switzerland | Monday, Feb. 9 | 2:40 p.m. | USA NetworkUSA vs. Canada | Tuesday, Feb. 10 | 2:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 13 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati Bengals veteran quarterback Joe Flacco wants fewer penalties called against defensive players next season and mentioned two specifically this week he would like to see taken out of the NFL's rulebook completely.There are various iterations of roughing the passer flags, which are reviewed by a replay assistant who has the power to overturn. Quarterbacks have been protected by rule variations in recent years during a crackdown of sorts against late hits or ones the NFL deems \"unwarranted by the circumstances of the play.\"\"I don't think it should be roughing the passer when they land on us,\" Flacco said this week ahead of the Super Bowl. \"I don't think being slapped in the head should be roughing the passer. It honestly annoys me because it affects games in a negative way at random times. They can call it or not call it. It needs to get out of the game. I know CTE is a thing these days and all that, but it's football, we signed up to play it.\"To Flacco's point, there's a subjective note within the NFL's rulebook that states, \"when in doubt about a roughness call or potentially dangerous tactic against the quarterback, the referee should always call roughing the passer.\"\nSpecifically under Rule 12, Section 2, Article 11, here's what the league quantifies as roughing outside of hitting a quarterback after a pass is thrown:A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as \"stuffing\" a passer into the ground or unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact with the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture (e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on top of him with all or most of the defender's weight. Instead, the defensive player must strive to wrap up the passer with the defensive player's arms and not land on the passer with all or most of his body weight.From a broader sense, Flacco says football has changed considerably over the last decade primarily due to rules protecting players.\"I don't think anybody coming into the league these days is quite as battle-tested as the guys who came in the league 15 years ago,\" Flacco said. \"If you're a good high school recruit, you can kind of ride your way through college and they're going to pick you because you have potential. I think there was less of that 15 years ago.\n\"I think our generation does benefit from dealing with a little bit of tougher times, just like the generation 20 years before me benefited over us.\"If he chooses to play in 2026, Flacco will be entering his 19th season in the NFL. He was traded by the Cleveland Browns to the Bengals in October along with a sixth-round pick for a future fifth-round selection.The former Super Bowl MVP has thrown for 48,176 yards passing, 272 touchdowns and 172 interceptions over his career. Flacco remains undecided on his plans for next season, saying this week he would evaluate every opportunity that comes his way.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Seton Hall's 72-60 loss at Villanova on Wednesday night shifted it back to the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble and underscored an increasingly bleak reality facing the Big East. If the Pirates don't right their ship over the next five weeks, the league will likely send just three teams to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in the past three seasons.The loss dropped Seton Hall to 16-7 (6-6 Big East) from \"Last Four In\" status in CBS Sports Bracketology to the First Four Out. It marked the Pirates' fifth loss in their past seven games since a 14-2 start. The stretch features three Quad 1 losses — including the Villanova defeat — but also includes lower-tier Quad 2 defeats vs. Butler and at DePaul.Even at its peak following a 4-1 start to league play, Seton Hall never rose above No. 43 in KenPom's ratings, which suggested a regression on its win-loss ledger was likely. It has come with a vengeance over the last three weeks and contributed to the Big East's floundering overall profile.All is not lost for the Pirates, who get second cracks at No. 3 UConn (Feb. 28) and No. 22 St. John's (March 6) before the Big East Tournament. But as we take a look at the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest field, you won't find the Pirates included and you won't find much Big East representation.\n  Bracketology top seeds       \t \t \t \t \tSeedWestEastMidwestSouthNo. 1                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    No. 2                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    Check out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub.Notable Bracketology movementAt first glance, Wednesday night's slate appeared relatively light. It ended up packing a punch. With Seton Hall sliding out of the projected field, Oklahoma State rose up from the \"First Four Out\" to become a projected No. 11 seed following its 99-92 upset win over No. 16 BYU. It was the first Quad 1 win of the season for the Cowboys (16-6, 4-5 Big 12), who also have high-end Quad 2 wins against projected NCAA Tournament teams Texas A&M and UCF.The night's most shocking result concluded after midnight ET, when No. 6 Gonzaga fell 87-80 at Portland for a Quad 3 loss. The Bulldogs narrowly retained their spot as a No. 3 seed, although they are now the final No. 3 seed. Part of the explanation for why the Zags didn't drop to a No. 4 seed can be found in Minneapolis, where Michigan State fell 76-73 at Minnesota. The Spartans might have been equipped to rise and take Gonzaga's place until suffering a Quad 2 defeat.Oddly enough, Gonzaga actually gained a Quad 1 victory when Thursday's metrics updated to reflect Wednesday's results. That's because Arizona State rose from 80th in the NET to 73rd following its 71-63 win at Utah. As a result, Gonzaga's Nov. 14 road win over the Sun Devils changed from a Quad 2 victory to a Quad 1 victory to give the Zags a 5-1 mark in Quad 1 instead of a 4-1 mark. In total, Gonzaga fell just one spot (from 13th to 12th) in wins above bubble (WAB).\nRevolving door for final No. 1 seedOur model's revolving door at the final No. 1 seed took another twist, as UConn replaced Iowa State on the No. 1 seed line. Though the Huskies rate behind teams like Iowa State and Illinois in performance-based metrics -- UConn is No. 8 at KenPom -- they are squarely ahead of both in resume-based metrics. At No. 3 in WAB and No. 2 in strength of record, the Huskies are a deserving No. 1 seed. Whether they can retain the spot will depend largely on Friday night's showdown with No. 22 St. John's inside Madison Square Garden.Big East bluesUConn, St. John's and Villanova are each in great shape heading into the final month of the regular season. But outside of a Seton Hall revival, the Big East's chances of finding another at-large candidate are getting slimmer by the day. Butler's 97-87 double-overtime loss at Providence on Wednesday marked the Bulldogs' third straight loss and pushed them further to the wrong side of the bubble.Creighton is also on a three-game slide after a 6-3 start to league play briefly resurrected the Bluejays' bleak at-large hopes. No one else from the Big East ranks inside the top 80 of the NET. A year ago, the conference sent five of its 11 teams to the Big Dance. Two years ago, it produced just three tournament teams but had three more in the top 60 of the NET that were excluded.\nThis year, it rates as the worst high-major conference at KenPom. It's the first time since 2021 the Big East has held that distinction.Rematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular-season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.\nWith regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

Broadcast camera caught Oklahoma State fans chanting either \"f--- the Mormons\" or \"Ref's a Mormon\" after a foul was assessed against the Cowboys late in the second half. \"The Big 12 Conference is aware of and is investigating reports of inappropriate chants that occurred during last night's BYU-Oklahoma State men's basketball game,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said in a statement. \"All parties have been notified. The Conference has zero tolerance for behavior of this nature and will address the matter in accordance with Big 12 sportsmanship policies.\"   The Big 12 fined Colorado $50,000 and publicly reprimanded it in September after its student section reportedly chanted \"f--- BYU\" and \"f--- the Mormons\" during a football game between Colorado and BYU. BYU, founded and supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has previously been the target of similar religiously charged chants at other schools.  \nBYU coach Kevin Young asserts that Oklahoma State's student section chanted \"f--- the Mormons.\" \"It's a great win for Oklahoma State University. Their fans should be proud,\" Young said. \"But it would be great if some class was in there as well. I got four small kids at home, you know. I'm a Mormon. When I go home, they're going to ask me about it, same way they asked me about it last year at Arizona. There's just too much hate in the world to be saying stuff like that. We've got enough problems in our world without going after peoples' religion and beliefs.\" \nOklahoma State fans stormed the court following the Cowboys' upset win against the Cougars, which is likely to incur a fine from the Big 12.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It's Super Bowl week in the Bay Area, which means it's also awards week in the NFL. The NFL Honors show is Thursday night, when MVP, Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year, Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, Comeback Player of the Year, Coach of the Year and other award winners will be announced.As with every season, this one was full of twists and turns on both the team and individual level. Halfway through the season, Daniel Jones and Jonathan Taylor were potential MVP or Offensive Player of the Year candidates. Then Jones got hurt, and the Indianapolis Colts didn't make the playoffs. Through six games, Myles Garrett \"only\" had four sacks, on pace for another outstanding year, but not a historically dominant one. Then he finished with 23 sacks, setting the single-season record.Long story short, things change in the blink of an eye. With the regular season long in the rearview mirror, though, CBS Sports' NFL experts have submitted their votes for top individual accolades.Voters (12): Garrett Podell, Joel Corry, JP Acosta, John Breech, Kevin Steimle, Bryan DeArdo, Douglas Clawson, Tyler Sullivan, Jared Dubin, Jordan Dajani, Mike Renner, Zach Pereles\nMVPDrake Maye, Patriots (7votes)Matthew Stafford, Rams (5)In -- spoiler alert -- the closest vote of all of the major awards, Maye edges out Stafford. Stafford was the first-team All-Pro selection, which, historically, points to him winning MVP. But it's not an absolute. In fact, just last year, Lamar Jackson was the first-team All-Pro quarterback, but Josh Allen won MVP. Maye led the NFL in completion percentage (72%), yards per attempt (8.9), passer rating (113.5) and expected points added per dropback (0.28) this season.Defensive Player of the YearMyles Garrett, Browns (12 votes)The only unanimous pick from our experts, Garrett was an easy choice after his record-setting campaign. Perhaps the race for second place will be more intriguing, with four other superstar edge defenders -- Will Anderson Jr., Nik Bonitto, Aidan Hutchinson and Micah Parsons -- named as finalists alongside Garrett.Offensive Player of the YearJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks, (9 votes)Puka Nacua, Rams (2)Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (1)Smith-Njigba led the NFL in receiving yards (1,793), Nacua led the NFL in receptions (129) and receiving yards per game (107.2), and McCaffrey led the NFL in touches (413) and was second in yards from scrimmage (2.126). But Smith-Njigba, with his remarkable consistency, gets the nod. His 16 games with at least 70 receiving yards were tied for the most in a single season in league history.\nDefensive Rookie of the YearCarson Schwesinger, Browns (9 votes)Nick Emmanwori, Seahawks (2)James Pearce Jr., Falcons (1)Schwesinger racked up 156 tackles in a strong rookie season, and he added 11 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks and two interceptions for good measure, too. The last rookie with at least 150 tackles, double-digit tackles for loss, two sacks and two interceptions was Shaquille Leonard in 2018; he won Defensive Rookie of the Year.Offensive Rookie of the YearTetairoa McMillan, Panthers (10 votes)TIE: Jaxson Dart, Giants; Grey Zabel, Seahawks (1)McMillan is the easy choice in the eyes of most of our voters after a 70-catch, 1,014-yard, seven-touchdown debut campaign, but Dart and Zabel also earned a vote. Dart threw for 15 touchdowns and ran for nine more despite only playing in 12 games; Zabel has been a key addition along the interior of the offensive line for Super Bowl-bound Seattle.Comeback Player of the YearChristian McCaffrey, 49ers (8 votes)Aidan Hutchinson, Lions (2)TIE: Stefon Diggs, Patriots; Dak Prescott, Cowboys (1)After playing in just four games last year due to Achilles tendinitis and a PCL sprain, McCaffrey played in 17 games for the second time in his career and was seemingly the only healthy 49ers offensive skill player all year. As Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings and others all missed time, McCaffrey just kept going. He recorded his second season with at least 1,000 rushing yards and 900 receiving yards, tying Marshall Faulk for most all time.\nCoach of the YearMike Vrabel, Patriots (6 votes)Mike Macdonald, Seahawks (4)Kyle Shanahan, 49ers (3)The Patriots are the first team to make the Super Bowl after losing 13 or more games the previous season, and Vrabel's role in that turnaround earns him his second Coach of the Year award (he also won it in 2021 with the Titans). Macdonald, who will stand opposite Vrabel in Super Bowl LX, and Shanahan were close behind.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, CBS Sports published our annual list of Major League Baseball's top prospects. Unlike in years past, when we capped our rankings to 50 names, this year we stretched all the way to 100 players. A piece like that takes a lot of time and effort to put together. That's why, naturally, the moment we wrapped up the list we asked ourselves a question: who will be ranked No. 1 next year?\n        \n            \n                Ranking the top 100 MLB prospects: Kevin McGonigle, Jesús Made, Konnor Griffin lead top young talent\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow, you'll find 10 prospects, arranged in tiers, who seem to have some of the best odds.Do note that this particular exercise isn't just about evaluating the players in question. It's also about making educated guesses as to who will or will not be spend enough time in the majors to burn their rookie (and therefore their prospect) eligbility. If you don't see your favorite prospect's name, it's likely because we anticipate he'll graduate from prospect status this season -- think Cardinals infielder JJ Wetherholt or Orioles slugger Samuel Basallo. Got it? Good. Let's roll.Tier 1: The favorites -- if they're still in the minorsAgain, a key component of this exercise is correctly guessing who will (and will not) retain their prospect eligibility after the upcoming season.\nConsider Pirates infielder Konnor Griffin. He's 19 years old and has just over 120 professional appearances to his credit. Normally, you would feel safe predicting he'll be on next spring's list. Yet the Pirates have already signaled that they're willing to give Griffin a chance at winning a job on the Opening Day roster. Once you crack the door, it's only a matter of time before the player steps through. Griffin, in turn, is not part of this article because we anticipate him losing his rookie eligibility.Instead, here are three top talents we feel will be in contention next spring. 1. Jesús Made, SS, BrewersMade is an explosive shortstop with the chance to develop into a plus contributor on both sides. He's a switch-hitter who batted .285/.379/.413 across three levels in 2025, including a small cameo in Double-A to close out the year. We're conservatively predicting his debut will occur next year, however, because he won't celebrate his 19th birthday until May. The Brewers have no reason to rush Made, not when the dream outcome here is him serving as the long-term face of the franchise. (For those wondering, outfielder Jackson Chourio debuted a little more than two weeks after turning 20.) 2. Sebastian Walcott, SS/3B, RangersAs with Made, Walcott is a teenage shortstop with an impressive track record. He spent last season in Double-A, where he hit .255/.355/.386 with 13 home runs and 32 stolen bases. Walcott has massive strength, but he needs to work on elevating the ball more often. He also needs to either improve his shortstop defense or move over to third base on a permanent basis. Walcott will turn 20 in March, meaning the Rangers can afford to give him time to fully flesh out his game.\n3. Colt Emerson, SS/3B, MarinersEmerson is someone we've been higher on than other publications over the last few years. The elevator pitch is that he's a talented left-handed hitter with a chance to stick at shortstop. Split between three levels in 2025, he batted .285/.383/.458 with 16 home runs and 14 stolen bases. In most situations, he would be a shoo-in to debut this season. He might still, but we're playing it safe because the Mariners have J.P. Crawford and Cole Young ahead of him on the depth chart and are reportedly still looking to upgrade at the position this offseason.Tier 2: The next groupThis group consists of players who are ranked a little lower than the aforementioned three, but who can (and will) ascend over the coming months -- potentially all the way to the top of the list.4. Max Clark, CF, TigersClark is a quality center fielder who has long drawn comparisons to Cubs star Pete Crow-Armstrong. That said, the two have diverged at the plate. Whereas Crow-Armstrong is a grip-and-rip specialist, Clark's approach remains more contact-orientated. He hit .271/.403/.432 with 14 home runs and 19 stolen bases across two levels last year. It's possible the Tigers could push him to the majors this season, but we're being conservative here because he only just celebrated his 21st birthday and he has fewer than 50 Double-A games to his name.\n5. Josue De Paula, OF, Dodgers6. Eduardo Quintero, OF, DodgersWe're pairing the Dodgers entrants for obvious reasons. De Paula is a big lefty hitter with massive strength and a patient approach. He still needs to work on lifting the ball more frequently if he's going to live up to the Yordan Alvarez comparisons that often get thrown his way. Quintero, meanwhile, has power and strength as well. He might be a touch too passive at the plate and he's slightly overshadowed by playing in the same system as De Paula and Zyhir Hope. 7. Edward Florentino, OF, PiratesLikewise, the hype machine isn't fully behind Florentino because he's part of the same Pirates system that counts Konnor Griffin and Bubba Chandler among its members. Don't sleep on him, though, because he's a promising lefty hitter who batted .262/.380/.503 as a teenager in the Florida State League. All the underlying data is pointing in the right direction too, suggesting that if he progresses as expected he could turn into a middle-of-the-order force.8. Luis Peña, INF, BrewersPeña gets overshadowed by Made in the Brewers system, but he's a promising young infielder himself. He batted .270/.335/.422 with nine home runs and 44 stolen bases in his first 96 games outside of the complex league. Not bad for someone who played the entire season as an 18 year old. Peña has impressive tools, particularly his power and speed, though it's to be seen where he ends up defensively. \nTier 3: The top of the draftWe're including the top prospect in this summer's draft as a dark horse candidate. Realistically, it's tough to see any player establishing themselves as the game's best minor-league prospect that quickly -- seeing consistency over longer durations is part of the evaluative process. Nonetheless, this exercise is for entertainment purposes only, so why not have a little fun?9. Roch Cholowsky, SS, UCLACholowsky is the odds-on favorite to go No. 1 at this point because of a well-rounded game and demonstrated track record of success. He's a career .333/.446/.618 hitter with 31 home runs and 13 stolen bases in 118 collegiate games. Cholowsky ought to stick at shortstop, in part because of his athletic gifts and in part because of his feel for the game, giving him multiple ways to help a club. The chances of him ascending the minor-league prospect list in less than a year's time are slim, but he's a quality player and he deserves a nod here.\nTier 4: Any pitchers?You may have noticed that each of the nine players mentioned thus far are position players. That's not a coincidence. All of the pitchers ranked highly on our list are nearing their graduation and, as a general rule of thumb, we tend to be conservative when it comes to forecasting younger arms. There's just too much that can go wrong. Still, we feel obligated to mention at least one pitcher. Here goes nothing.10. Thomas White, LHP, MarlinsWhite is a physical left-hander who made a number of tweaks to his arsenal last season, speaking to his coachability and drive to improve. He now complements his mid-90s rising fastball and sweeping slider with a new-look changeup and cutter/slider that bridges his offerings. White still needs to reduce his walk rate if he wants to develop into a front-of-the-rotation starter. There's a catch-22 at play, then, because if he starts throwing more strikes he'll soar up prospects rankings … but he'd probably find himself in the majors at that point, too, eliminating his chances of topping this list next year. Oh well. We'll find out which way his stock and his season goes soon enough.\n            ",

However, both Michigan and Maryland are strong opponents so the Spartans only dropped down three spots to No. 17.The top five teams remained intact, but all eyes will be on No. 3 Texas and No. 5 LSU as the Longhorns host the Tigers for a Thursday night SEC battle. This will be an important game because sweeping the series against Texas could potentially help LSU make a case for a No. 1 seed for the NCAA Tournament.The Tigers are fresh of their 12th 100-plus-point game of the season with a 103-63 win over No. 22 Alabama on Sunday. That same day, the Longhorns got a quality 78-70 win against Oklahoma, our No. 9 team this week.\nAnother intriguing SEC matchup on Thursday will be between No. 7 Vanderbilt and No. 19 Kentucky. Before a 20-point win against Arkansas, the Wildcats had lost consecutive games against Mississippi State, Tennessee and Georgia. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt lost games against South Carolina and Ole Miss before a win over Florida on Sunday. This game will be an opportunity for both teams to get another quality win in the conference.In the ACC, Duke has been trending in the right direction with the Blue Devils up to No. 15 this week. They have a big test on Thursday as the take on No. 6 Louisville on the road. The Cardinals are on a 14-game winning streak, while Duke has won 13 straight games. The momentum both teams have made this matchup one of the top five February games to watch.Here are the latest CBS Sports women's college basketball Power Rankings.\nWomen's college basketball Power

The Under has also hit in four of the last eight Washington games, while the Under has hit in six of the last 10 Detroit games. The Wizards are 4-2 against the spread in their last six games, while the Pistons are 6-4 ATS in their last 10.The SportsLine model is projecting Washington's Alex Sarr to score 19 points on average and be one of four Wizards players to score 11.1 or more points. Detroit, meanwhile, could be shorthanded with Cunningham and Harris both questionable. Additionally, the team just traded away Jaden Ivey, while new acquisition, Kevin Huerter (trade pending) is also questionable. Thus, the model calls for 221 combined points as the Under hits in 59.8% of simulations.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits nearly 70% in simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Pistons vs. Wizards, and which side of the spread hits nearly 70% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Wizards vs. Pistons spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

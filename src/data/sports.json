    "body": "\n        The No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers will begin their College Football Playoff journey when they face the No. 9 Alabama Crimson Tide on Thursday. This 2026 Rose Bowl matchup is the second of the CFP quarterfinals, as the two programs will face off for the first time ever. Indiana (13-0) is the only undefeated team left standing, is coming off a 13-10 victory over Ohio State in the Big Ten title game and boasts the Heisman winner in Fernando Mendoza. Alabama (11-3) knocked off Oklahoma, 34-24, in the CFP First Round after dropping the SEC Championship Game to Georgia.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. This will be IU's first game in program history as the AP No. 1 team. The Hoosiers are 7-point favorites in the latest Indiana vs. Alabama odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 47.5.

The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner. With two prolific offenses, 51 combined points are projected as the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Alabama vs. Indiana, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Indiana vs. Alabama spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        New Year's Day has traditionally been one of the biggest days in college football, and it's no different during the College Football Playoff era, with a trio of quarterfinal games on Thursday's slate. The January 1 CFP schedule begins with No. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl at noon ET, followed by No. 9 Alabama vs. No. 1 Indiana in the Rose Bowl at 4 p.m. ET, and finally No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.The SportsLine projection model and SportsLine's team of experts have you covered on the incredible CFP slate. The model is backing a pair of underdogs later in the day, projecting Alabama to cover as 7-point underdogs and Ole Miss to cover as 6.5-point underdogs in its College Football Playoff best bets. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson is backing Oregon to cover as 2.5-point favorites for Thursday's college football best bets. Before locking in your college football picks, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model and team of college football experts. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. College Football Playoff quarterfinal best bets for New Year's Day (odds subject to change): Oregon (-2.5) vs. Texas TechAlabama (+7) vs. IndianaOle Miss (+6.5) vs. GeorgiaCombining the model's three picks into a Thursday College Football Playoff parlay would result in a payout of +567 (risk $100 to win $567). Bet it now at BetMGM: Oregon (-2.5) vs. Texas Tech\"This game sets up to be a chess match throughout the afternoon, with both Oregon and Texas Tech looking to set up and eventually execute explosive plays against elite defenses,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"It's a chess match that will be fascinating to watch play out and likely set up a close game deep into the second half. It's just at some point, we're going to need a quarterback to make a game-saving or game-winning play, and right now, I'd rather side with Dante Moore in that discussion. He's made some huge throws late in games this season, and I like his odds more to be able to do so again.\" Back Oregon at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Alabama (+7) vs. Indiana Indiana defeating Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game left no doubt that the Hoosiers are capable of winning a national championship. However, defeating Alabama by more than a touchdown is a tough task for any program. Alabama had a shocking opening-week loss to Florida State, but has since won 11 of 13 games, and its only loss by more than a touchdown came in a 28-7 final against Georgia in the SEC championship game. Indiana is 13-0 in a historic season, and the deserved favorite led by Heisman Trophy winner and possible No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft in quarterback Fernando Mendoza. However, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson is sixth in the nation with 3,500 passing yards, and the model views seven points just too many to give a program like Alabama. The model projects the Crimson Tide to cover in 63% of simulations. Back Alabama at Caesars, where new users get their first bet matched up to $250 in bonus bets:Ole Miss (+6.5) vs. GeorgiaGeorgia needed a furious fourth-quarter comeback to defeat Ole Miss despite being the home team in their regular-season matchup this year. Ole Miss led, 35-26, in Athens entering the fourth quarter before Georgia scored the game's final 17 points to win, 43-35. Although that means Georgia over this number, that was at home, and on Thursday, they'll meet at a neutral site. Ole Miss will be without head coach Lane Kiffin, who is now with LSU, but many of the assistants from their regular-season meeting will be on the sideline. Ole Miss went 12-1 this season and had no issue in a 41-10 win over Tulane in the first round of the College Football Playoff. The model projects Ole Miss to cover in 57% of simulations. Bet Ole Miss at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's College Football Playoff best bets for Thursday's quarterfinals.

    "body": "\n        San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama left Wednesday's 134-132 win over the New York Knicks with a slight hyperextension in his left knee. Initial tests came back negative and ruled out a major injury, according to ESPN.Webanyama jumped for a rebound and landed awkwardly with 10:32 left in the fourth quarter. His left foot moved forward as he approached the ground, which caused his knee to bend inward. He fell to the floor and grabbed his knee in pain, and after he returned to his feet, he limped off the court and into the locker room for examination.While he returned to the bench after a short stay in the locker room, the Spurs determined Wembanyama's night over after 24 minutes of action. He scored 31 points and racked up 13 rebounds before his premature exit.\"Have not been able to talk to the medical staff yet, but I saw what everybody else saw,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said postgame. \"There's a visual there, but obviously he finished the game on the bench with his teammates, so that made me feel good. I have no idea what to say, but it was good to see him walk back out and be able to finish the game on the bench with his teammates.\"\nWembanyama said he expects to be back for the Spurs' next game, a Friday road contest versus the Indiana Pacers.\"Feeling good, just sore,\" Wembanyama said. \"I was 'this' close to coming back in the game. They had to hold me back.\"The Spurs trailed the Knicks, 102-96, when Wembanyama left the game but rallied to eliminate the deficit as part of a 71-point second half. Both teams entered the day in second place in their respective conferences, and the contest was a critical one as they remain locked in chases with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Detroit Pistons for the top spots.\nWembanyama, a reigning All-Star and former Rookie of the Year, has been instrumental in the Spurs' rise toward the top of the Western Conference this season. He averaged 24 points per game over the first 20 games of the year and is on pace to average a double-double for the third consecutive season to open his career. He has become an even more potent offensive weapon this season with a career-high 51.4% shooting clip.Wembanyama's injury is reminiscent of the one Nikola Jokić sustained on Monday. The Denver Nuggets superstar was diagnosed with a hyperextended knee -- which will sideline him for at least four weeks -- after he also had his leg bend awkwardly in the middle of game action.The Spurs already spent a month this season without Wembanyama due to a separate injury. The third-year star sustained a calf strain against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 14 and did not return until Dec. 13 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He eased back into the lineup, coming off the bench for six games before returning to the starting five on Dec. 27. Wednesday's contest was just his third start since the calf injury.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is no guarantee that Aaron Rodgers will suit up for the 2026 NFL season. His contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers is up at the end of the present campaign, and given his increasing age and that his production has tailed off in the latter stages of his career, retirement may be on the table this offseason. But if Rodgers does desire to play another year, he said he thinks he will have a couple of options.The path of least resistance would be to re-sign with the Steelers. That would hinge on Pittsburgh being content with fielding a 43-year-old rather than seeking a younger, potential franchise quarterback. It would also be a change of plans of sorts, as Rodgers said last offseason that the reason he and the Steelers agreed to a one-year deal was because he was \"pretty sure\" this would be his final season in the NFL.\"I'm thinking about this week, but obviously I'm 42-years-old and I'm on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,\" Rodgers said on Wednesday. \"Whenever this season ends, I'll be a free agent. That would give me a lot of options if I still want to play. Not a lot of options, but options. I would think maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.\"How many teams would be interested in bringing Rodgers aboard as a starter in 2026 is a grand uncertainty. He could serve as a bridge and a mentor to a younger quarterback, but asking for anything beyond that is putting a lot of faith in the future Hall of Famer returning to his old elite form.Rodgers is in danger of logging the lowest QBR of his career this season, and the last three years have been his least efficient to date.\nPerhaps joining a more refined roster would help Rodgers rekindle some of his old magic, though. He did not exactly have the most prolific supporting casts over his lone full season with the New York Jets and 2025 run with the Steelers.Rodgers is on pace to record his fewest passing yards over a 16- or 17-game season, and by a significant margin. A loss in Week 18 would eliminate him and the Steelers from playoff contention. But while his first and potentially lone season in Pittsburgh has been far from his best, Rodgers said it has been a worthwhile campaign.\"I've enjoyed this experience,\" Rodgers said. \"Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It's really what I was hoping for from this experience. It's been even better than what I was hoping.\"\nRegardless of when he hangs up his cleats, Rodgers previously said he wishes to finish his career with the Green Bay Packers. Whether that means spending a full season with the franchise that drafted him or inking a ceremonial contract remains to be seen.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the Indianapolis Colts opened Anthony Richardson's 21-day practice window on Dec. 18, it appeared that help could be on the way in a quarterback group decimated by injuries this season. Instead, 2023's fourth overall pick continues to battle vision problems due to the orbital fracture he sustained earlier in the year, and the Colts will not activate him from injured reserve for the regular-season finale.Instead, coach Shane Steichen announced Wednesday that Riley Leonard will start in what is now a meaningless Week 18 game for the Colts, who have been eliminated from playoff contention. Seth Henigan, who signed with the Colts' practice squad, has a chance of serving as the backup. If he is not up to speed, Philip Rivers will handle the backup duties.\"Had a conversation in my office yesterday with him,\" Steichen said of Richardson. \"It was great. He's still got the vision limitations. It's just a smart thing. Obviously, you put him out there with vision limitations and something happens, not a good idea. So we won't activate him.\"Richardson sustained his injury in Week 6 when an elastic band in the Colts' locker room snapped and hit him in the face. The backup quarterback experienced severe swelling around the broken orbital bone, though he avoided damage to his eyeball. More than two months later, he still does not have all of his vision back.With the Colts tumbling all the way out of the postseason picture despite opening the year at 8-2, they have no incentive to rush Richardson back at less than 100% -- even as they lack experienced options behind injured starter Daniel Jones, who tore his Achilles tendon earlier this month.\n\"It was a freak accident that happened,\" Steichen said. \"I feel for him, because it is a terrible thing that happened. You never want it to happen. You don't know why things happen. But he's been in good spirits, and he's battling like crazy and hopefully everything comes back good.\"The 2025 season goes down as a lost year for a once-promising prospect who just two years ago was a first-round talent. Richardson remains under contract with Indianapolis through 2027, but if Jones returns to full strength in time for next year's opener, there is no clear path to the starting lineup for the Florida product.It could take a trade for Richardson to get another shot at a starting job in the next two years. His outlook with the Colts is as cloudy as ever. But returning to full health is a bigger priority at this point than determining his long-term role, according to Steichen.\n\"I think the biggest thing for him is just to make sure that vision comes back fully, and then we go from there,\" Steichen said. \"He's a talented player. Very talented. Can make all the throws and run around and make plays. So really just praying for his health right now.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ryan Williams isn't going anywhere -- at least not right now.Ahead of No. 9 Alabama's College Football Playoff quarterfinal against No. 1 Indiana at the Rose Bowl on Thursday at 4 p.m. ET, the Crimson Tide wide receiver said Tuesday he plans to return to Tuscaloosa and will not enter the transfer portal. The decision reaffirms his commitment as his on-field production -- and national standing -- have taken a noticeable step back.\"Of course,\" Williams told AL.com when asked if he'd be back at Alabama for his junior season in 2026. \"I'm Alabama through and through. I have no intentions of being anywhere else.\"In an era when high-profile players routinely explore options after uneven seasons, Williams' stance is notable. Sources told CBS Sports there was significantly more smoke last year around the possibility of Williams transferring after his phenomenal true freshman season. This winter, there has been no comparable behind-the-scenes buzz -- not the kind typically associated with players reassessing value, role or opportunity in the portal.Williams saying he will stand pat comes at a moment when the conversation around him has shifted sharply.\nAs a 17-year-old freshman in 2024, Williams burst onto the scene with 865 yards and eight touchdowns on 48 receptions. Over Alabama's first five games, he caught 19 passes for 544 yards and six touchdowns, including a six-catch, 177-yard performance against Georgia that instantly placed him among the sport's breakout stars.Since then, consistency -- particularly at the catch point -- has been elusive. Williams' 12.7% drop rate ranked 47th-worst among 347 FBS wide receivers with at least 40 targets last season, according to Pro Football Focus. Over the final eight games of 2024, his production dipped sharply as defenses adjusted and opportunities narrowed.In 2025, Williams has 636 yards and four touchdowns on 43 receptions, down from his freshman totals despite a similar workload. His 18.9% drop rate ranks fourth-worst among 352 qualifying FBS receivers, per PFF -- a stark contrast for a player once viewed as a future focal point of Alabama's offense.\nRyan Williams receiving statsYearGamesTargetsReceptionsYardsTouchdownsDrop Rate2025136943636418.9%2024138748865812.7%Williams has acknowledged the frustration without deflecting responsibility.\"It's not always going to be sunshine and rainbows,\" Williams told AL.com. \"So whether you call it a 'sophomore slump' or whatever you call it, I know who I am and I know when the time is right my performance will be what's best for the team.\"Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has remained publicly supportive, focusing less on production and more on process.\"He had such a big year last year as a freshman,\" DeBoer said Tuesday. \"I know you can always have more, but there's just been a non-stop level of work that he puts in. His attitude, people can always say stuff, but you don't know. When you're there with him, and you see the smile, the work, the team-first attitude that he has, you can't help but root for him.\"DeBoer acknowledged the uneven production but emphasized patience -- and belief.\"He's going to have a game like he's had at different times where he goes off, and I'm just waiting for that moment because when it is, it's going to be awesome,\" DeBoer said. \"And we're all going to be super happy for him. And I know it's coming sooner than later.\"Williams, a five-star prospect from Saraland (Alabama) ranked as the No. 3 wide receiver and No. 8 overall recruit in the 2024 class. He also reclassified, meaning under a traditional timeline he would only now be in his freshman season. Instead, his early explosion reset expectations almost overnight.As Alabama prepares for Indiana on college football's biggest postseason stage, Williams remains part of the plan. For now, staying put appears to be the clearest path forward, even as the standard he set early continues to loom.\n            ",

The Eagles want to keep Hurts healthy as they aim to repeat as Super Bowl champs.There are still some seeding implications for the Eagles, but the No. 1 seed in the NFC is out of reach. Philadelphia could finish as high as No. 2 or as low as No. 3. With the top seed out of play, the Eagles have chosen to rest their starting quarterback for the regular season finale.Eagles coach Nick Sirianni has shown a willingness to rest his stars before with McKee starting against the New York Giants in Week 18 last season. In that game, McKee completed 27 of his 41 passes for 269 yards and two touchdowns en route to a 20-13 win.This season, McKee has only seen action in three games, completing all three of his passes for 33 yards. A sixth-round pick out of Stanford in 2023, McKee has connected on 68.8% of his throws at the NFL level for 356 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.\nIn the wake of the Eagles securing the NFC East crown, going back-to-back for the first time since 2001, Hurts said it's a special time for the franchise. Still, Hurts knows the team can't lose focus of the ultimate goal.\"I've said it multiple times: These times, they're rare times,\" Hurts said. \"So something that we all need to soak in and relish in this moment right now and take it a day at a time as we always have. But keep the main thing the main thing. Keep the main thing the main thing. That's what we've done for five years since everybody's collectively been here. That's been my approach since I've been an Eagle.\"\nThe Eagles will close out the 2025 regular season on Sunday afternoon when they kick off against the Commanders at 4:25 p.m. ET. The game will air on CBS.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Steve Sarkisian took a not-so-subtle shot at the College Football Playoff selection process earlier this week when he proclaimed Texas' Citrus Bowl win over Michigan might outrate some playoff games with TV viewership. He's right. Brands like the Longhorns and Wolverines are like catnip on New Year's Eve afternoon. The ratings probably will beat several of the games from the playoff's opening round, especially those that featured Tulane and James Madison. By making that statement, Sarkisian is digging at the selection process that left a 9-3 Texas out of the field. The reality is Texas missed the playoff despite earning the preseason No. 1 ranking for the first time in program history following back-to-back semifinal appearances. \nThere are schedule-based excuses to be made for Texas' absence in the 12-team field. But the Longhorns finished behind four other teams in the SEC standings and came up short during a year the playoff was the expectation. This leads to the question: What's next? Portal season has already been chaotic for Texas with most of the running back room choosing to exit en masse in addition to starting linebacker Liona Lefau and wide receiver DeAndre Moore. NFL decisions will soon stress Texas, too. Those like star left tackle Trevor Goosby and defensive tackle Hero Kanu could choose to leave and open gaping holes on Texas' depth chart. Those like All-American safety Michael Taaffe are also set to graduate. \nStill, if I were a betting man, I'd put money on Texas being next season's preseason No. 1. There are only five seniors who were part of Texas' regular starting 22 this season. Arch Manning, who torched Michigan for 376 yards of offense and four touchdowns on Wednesday, is back. So is superstar edge rusher Colin Simmons. With a title window open in Austin, expect the Longhorns to go all-in with the transfer portal to build a legitimate contender for what projects to be Manning's last season. \nAhead of a critical offseason on the Forty Acres, this is a look back at what went wrong and what worked in 2025 and what that means for the Longhorns' offseason. \nExpect Manning to be a preseason Heisman favorite Yes, we did this already. Yes, Manning had some real stinkers during the 2025 season. But what you may have missed down the stretch of the season was Manning emerging as an elite college quarterback. After being called the \"first college football flop\" by The Athletic, Manning threw for 13 touchdowns against just two interceptions in the regular season while completing 62% of his passes. Despite the slow start, he finished the year as a top 20 QB for PFF in terms of his season-long grade. \nGiven the strides Manning made in Year 1 as a starter and the overwhelming optimism of sources in the building about his future, you should expect a leap by Manning in 2026. And given his last name and the attention around him … expect that to generate plenty of Heisman chatter this summer. Changes around Manning are coming Steve Sarkisian produced a 1,000-yard rusher in every stop he made between 2008 and 2024 as a play-caller or a head coach. That came to a hault this year when no Texas back cleared the 600-yard barrier. \nPart of that was due to injury. But a lot of it had to do with a struggling offensive line and disappointing backfield production outside of Quintrevion Wisner, who is now the No. 3 running back in the 247Sports Portal rankings. The running back room will need to undergo a complete overhaul in the portal. The only remaining scholarship players in the room are freshmen Christian Clark and James Simon, a pair that will soon be joined by four-star freshman Derrek Cooper. Given the youth of the room, expect Texas to grab at least one high-profile back out of the portal, maybe even two. The Longhorns are expected to be active at the top of that market. \nThe same could be said for the offensive line, where the only real guarantee to return is right tackle Brandon Baker and potentially center Connor Robertson. Texas will be aggressive adding offensive line pieces in the portal to help bolster a unit that finished 112th nationally in pressure rate allowed in the regular season. Oh yeah, don't be shocked if Texas goes after a high-level wide receiver in the portal. A player like Auburn transfer Cam Coleman could change the tenor of the Longhorns' offense. Texas will also likely at least grab a blocking-focused tight end. \nA surprising defensive changeDefense wasn't the issue for Texas this year. The Longhorns ranked 26th nationally in yards allowed per play, 25th in scoring defense and allowed only 26 points per game in Texas' three losses. \nDespite that, Sarkisian made the surprising change to move on from defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski -- who authored the nation's No. 3 defense in 2024 -- and hire Georgia analyst Will Muschamp. It's a reunion for Muschamp in Austin. A former head-coach-in-waiting for the Longhorns, Muschamp returns after 15 years away and stints as Florida and South Carolina's head coach. Does Muschamp still have his fastball as a defensive play-caller? We'll see. But Sarkisian is clearly banking on Muschamp to be the CEO of that unit and make it an annual top 10 group. \nAs for what returns for Texas, the Longhorns will have arguably the best defensive player in the country next year in EDGE Colin Simmons, who posted 13.5 TFLs and 11 sacks in the regular season. There are also building blocks with players like Kanu (if he returns), freshman safety Graceson Littleton and sophomore DT Alex January. Expect Texas to add to a couple of spots on defense via the portal. The Longhorns are aggressively pursuing linebackers and cornerbacks in the portal thus far, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see them take a defensive lineman or an edge rusher as well. Looking aheadIn retrospect the No. 1 ranking for Texas in the preseason was shortsighted. The Longhorns had holes across their offense and lacked the elite secondary play to be a truly dominant defense. Manning also struggled for stretches of his debut, and a suspect O-line and run game didn't help matters. \nStill, Texas finished with 10 wins, including over playoff teams -- and arch rivals -- Oklahoma and Texas A&M. Ahead of next year with Manning and Simmons returning and an expected push in the portal, the Longhorns should once again be in the mix for preseason No. 1. The title window is open in Austin. There's an awareness of that for the staff. Expect them to make a push this offseason to reach that goal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff quarterfinals open on New Year's Eve with what should be among the most tantalizing defensive battles of the entire postseason. No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Miami are in for a showdown in the Cotton Bowl that promises to be physical, low-scoring and high on elite talent at the point of attack.The Hurricanes already put on display this month their ability to win a game with such a formula. Their 10-3 win over No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round featured the only scoreless first half in CFP history and was a masterclass in dominance on the defensive front. Ohio State followed the same blueprint in the regular season to secure the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye, which gave the Buckeyes time to recharge in their hunt for a second straight national championship.A spot in the semifinals against either No. 3 Georgia or No. 6 Ole Miss is on the line.Follow along with live updates and analysis as Ohio State takes on Miami in the 2025 Cotton Bowl. \nWhere to watch Ohio State vs. Miami liveDate: Wednesday, Dec. 31 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ohio State vs. Miami: Players to watchJeremiah Smith, WR, Ohio State: If Miami has any chance of pulling off the upset, it has to contain Ohio State's elite stable with wide receivers, which starts with Jeremiah Smith. Many have tried, but few have even come close to stopping the sixth-place finisher in Heisman Trophy voting. Smith is the Big Ten leader with 80 catches and crossed the 1,000-yard threshold for the second time in as many years to open his career. He will be the most talented player on the field in the Cotton Bowl.Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State: If the campaign ended today, Sayin would hold the NCAA single-season completion percentage record with his sparkling 78.4% mark. His debut as the Ohio State quarterback in 2025 has been nothing short of tremendous. Sayin benefits greatly from the best receiving corps in college football, but he is a premier talent in his own right and proved in the regular season that he can and will make every throw asked of him.\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State: The Buckeyes feature five All-Americans on their defense. Caleb Downs is the most highly regarded of the bunch and even finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting. The nation's top safety covers the entire field with ease and, boasting an impeccable football IQ, is a leader in more ways than one for a defense that is statistically among the stingiest groups in modern college football history.Malachi Toney, WR, Miami: Miami may have to go punch-for-punch with Ohio State through the air in order to hang with the Buckeyes, and it might just be capable of doing so because of Malachi Toney. The most electrifying freshman in the country racked up 89 catches for 992 yards and an ACC-best eight touchdowns through his first 13 games. That does not even cover what he does on the ground and on special teams as a special all-around contributor.Rueben Bain Jr., DL, Miami: All-American pass rusher Rueben Bain Jr. enjoyed the best game of his career with three sacks in the first-round matchup with Texas A&M. He was integral in the Hurricanes' defensive masterclass, in which it limited the Aggies to just three points. And that performance came as no surprise given his multi-year track record as an unstoppable force on a formidable defensive front.\nCarson Beck, QB, Miami: Carson Beck is quietly playing his best football of the season at the perfect time. While his 10 interceptions are the most among ACC quarterbacks, he threw just one in his last five games and completed no fewer than 70% of his passes in any of those contests. Beck's bounce-back year is a transfer portal success story that reconstructed his NFL Draft stock and may not be done just yet.Ohio State vs. Miami prediction, pick\nOhio State has not allowed more than 16 points in a game all season. Miami has not surrendered more than 24 points in regulation. It would take an outlier performance from one or both teams for the over of 42.5 to hit. A look at how these teams have fared against elite competition reinforces that point. Miami is coming off a 10-3 win over a playoff team, and one of Ohio State's games against top-15 opponents was the only instance in which more than 36 total points were scored. The numbers back up what is evident on film: these are two dominant defenses built to thrive on the biggest stage. Pick: Under 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- To those on the outside looking in, the Dallas Cowboys' decision to release two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday may appear abrupt. However, this dissention between Diggs and the organization has been brewing for some time.  Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer acknowledged as much on Wednesday. \"It was really an accumulation of multiple factors. Performance, other elements. He's been an incredible player for this organization and ... I like Trevon a lot,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I wish him nothing but the best. I'm excited to see where he lands and continue his career.\"The divorce between Diggs and Dallas has been brewing since the offseason, He skipped out on OTAs to rehab from a knee procedure, publicly clashed with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus over the rate of zone coverage versus man coverage and had an awkward, extended stay on injured reserve after he and the team disagreed about his health regarding his knee and a home accident that resulted in a concussion. The final straw or cherry on top of the disconnection sundae was Diggs' request to fly back from the Cowboys Christmas Day win over the Washington Commanders by himself since he has family in the DC metro area. Schottenheimer's and the team's protocol is that everyone flies back on the team plane after every game outside of exceptions for family emergencies. Diggs chose to stay back anyway after Schottenheimer denied his request. \"Yeah, it was one of many factors, it was not the only factor. I'm not the Grinch that stole Christmas, okay. I love Christmas. I love my family,\" Schottenheimer said. \"But at the end of the day, we got a protocol we go through and the process was not followed. The first time I heard about it, Trevon grabbed me after the game and I'm celebrating a big win and I explained to him the protocol, which it's always been the protocol of we go up as a team, we come back as a team. He decided to make a different decision. It was not the only reason that this decision was made. ... But at the end of the day, I want to make this very clear. That was not the only reason that this happened. This happened for multiple factors, performance and other elements over the course of time. And I truly do wish him nothing but the best. I told him that yesterday when I talked to him.\"  \n\n        \n            \n                Trevon Diggs joins Packers: Green Bay claims former Cowboys cornerback off waivers to bolster playoff depth\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Cowboys have moved on from the Diggs decision quickly. Schottenheimer addressed his locker room about Dallas' decision to move on from All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, but he didn't feel the need to do so with the move off of Diggs. \"I think the biggest one that we probably addressed was the Micah [Parsons] trade, and that was the start of the season and all of that. I've had conversations with a couple of players, but I didn't feel like I had to stand up in front of the room,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Guys can come talk to me. I talk to you guys every day. They know my door is always open, and if they have questions or concerns, I would love to talk about it, but I'm going to say this again, this decision that was made was very difficult. ... To me, this team and what we're building, this culture that we're building is about the 53 strongest, most connected group of people. I believe that, and that's why the team element to me is so important.\"Dallas terminated Diggs' five-year, $97 million extension with three seasons remaining, but they'll now only be responsible for a $5.9 million cap charge in 2026 while not owing the 27-year-old a cent in terms of actual cash going forward. The 2021 NFL interceptions leader posted a goodbye statement on Instagram shortly after his release. \n\"I want to thank the Dallas Cowboys organization for the opportunity they gave me and for changing my life, both on and off the field. I'll always be grateful for what my time here meant for me and my family,\" Diggs posted. \"I want to thank all the coaches and staff who believed in me, pushed me, and helped me grow as a player and as a man. I'm thankful for the relationships and brotherhood I built in that locker room—those bonds will always mean a lot to me. With that said, I'm excited for a new journey and a fresh start. I'm motivated, focused, and ready for what's next. To the fans who supported me throughout this journey, you are truly appreciated. Thank you for the love and support along the way. God is great.\"What's next for both Dallas and DiggsThe Cowboys cornerback room is obviously guaranteed to look different in 2026, but there are a few key contributors who will return. Pro Bowler DaRon Bland, who re-signed with the Cowboys on a four-year, $90 million extension shortly after the Micah Parsons trade, will be back. He did reaggravate the foot he suffered a stress fracture in at the end of training camp in 2024, and he'll be working closely with the Cowboys training staff to get right in the offseason. Rookie third-round pick Shavon Revel is someone Dallas sees as a high potential player the further removed he is from the torn ACL injury he suffered his last season at East Carolina in 2024. Any further upgrades the team would like to do to the position in the offseason will likely be veteran bargain bin signings in free agency. The Cowboys do have two first-round picks in 2026, the extra one from the Green Bay Packers because of the Parsons trade, but Dallas doesn't have a second round pick (Quinnen Williams trade) or a third round pick (George Pickens trade) in the upcoming draft. Other defensive needs at edge rusher and linebacker could be seen as more glaring than their cornerback position. \n\"It's certainly an area we'll look at. We got a guy in Shavon Revel that we like. We like Caelen Carson. Trikweze Bridges is a talented young player that needs development and seasoning. You guys get it,\" Schottenheimer said. \"You guys have been around this business. Personnel changes fast. I told the guys today, today is the last Wednesday of the 2025 Dallas Cowboys. So be grateful for that. Enjoy that. Celebrate that. Because this team will never be back together for another Wednesday. And that's the life of an NFL employee. There's gonna be change. I like some of the pieces that we have. And we'll always be looking to add and keep putting the puzzle together.\"  Diggs already found a new home in a reunion with Parsons as a Green Bay Packer. Green Bay claimed him off of waivers on Wednesday with the playoff-bound Packers picking up the $472,000 he's due for his base salary in Week 18. Green Bay is 9-6-1 and locked into the NFC's No. 7 seed. He'll have a chance to become a part of a cornerback rotation with Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine and Nate Hobbs. Green Bay has allowed a 92.8 passer rating this season, which ranks 18th in the NFL in 2025. The Packers needed bodies with Kamal Hadden (leg) out for the season and Hobbs currently sidelined with a knee injury he suffered in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens. Diggs played in eight games for the Cowboys this season, starting six, and had 25 tackles in 2025 for Dallas.   Parsons is already celebrating his BFF following him up north to Green Bay for the postseason while he recovers from a torn ACL.\nDiggs' on-field fit with the Packers in defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's scheme will be an interesting storyline to follow. Hafley's Green Bay defense runs zone on 79.3% of plays per TruMedia, the eighth-highest rate in the NFL. Diggs and Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus clashed on Dallas' zone vs. man coverage mix. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Free throws are often an overlooked edge in fantasy basketball, but players who consistently get to the line — or convert at elite rates — can quietly swing weekly matchups and season-long value. This article highlights 10 standouts at the foul line, separating volume drivers from efficiency specialists. Whether you're tracking trends for fantasy basketball rankings, monitoring changes tied to the NBA injury report, or refining roster decisions with help from fantasy basketball news, understanding where points are coming from matters. From superstars forcing contact to sharpshooters maximizing limited chances, these profiles offer actionable insight for managers across all formats.Leaders in Free-Throw Attempts Per GameLuka Doncic ranks first in the league with a whopping 11.8 free throws per game, which is 1.1 more than the next-highest average. His 79.8 percent shooting is not outstanding, but it is good enough to make him the league leader in free-throw makes per game, with 9.4. Doncic is also the league's leading scorer, averaging 33.5 points per game on 45.9 percent shooting. His ability to score from anywhere makes him nearly impossible to guard, but his exceptional size at the point-guard position is a great advantage when it comes to creating contact on drives to the basket. Deni Avdija averages 9.7 free throws per game, which ranks second in the league, while his relatively unimpressive 79.6 percent shooting from the line has him limited to 7.7 made free throws per game. His success in this category is largely a reflection of his continuous drives to the paint, while his 6.5 three-point attempts at 36.1 percent efficiency prevents defenders from being able to overcommit to keeping him out of the lane. He is averaging career highs of 25.6 points and 6.9 assists per game, both of which are significant jumps from previous highs and should have him on the radar for the Most Improved Player award.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ranks third in the league with 9.1 free-throw attempts and second with 8.0 makes per game. As the reigning MVP and MVP favorite this season, it is a facet of his skillset that certainly draws criticism from opposing fans. However, it also represents his ability to stay a step ahead of the competition and take advantage of the resulting fouls. He also ranks second in points per game with 32.2, which is barely below his career high of 32.7 points per game from last season. \nJames Harden remains one of the league's most proficient players when it comes to baffling defenders and earning trips to the line. He ranks fourth this season with 8.7 free-throw attempts per game and is converting 88.8 percent at the line, resulting in 7.7 made free throws per game, which ranks third-most in the league. He continues to get the job done both as a scorer and distributor on the offensive end, averaging an impressive 26.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game despite a rough start to the season for his squad. Austin Reaves ranks fifth in the league with 7.5 free-throw attempts per game, while his 87.3 percent shooting from the line is good enough for him to maintain the fifth rank in free-throw makes per game, with 7.5. Reaves was off to a fantastic start to the season, averaging 28.4 points on 50.9 percent shooting through the first 20 games, but he has since slowed down, averaging 14.7 points across three appearances since December 10, as he has also been dealing with injury trouble. Nonetheless, he is one of the league's most crafty scorers in the backcourt and should return to the top of his game before long. Leaders in Free-Throw EfficiencyDesmond Bane took a bit of time to bring his production up to speed in his new surroundings, but his free-throw shooting is one aspect of his game that has not lagged this season. He shot 15-for-16 from the line over the first five games and is shooting a career-best and league-best 92.9 free-throw percentage on the season. He is averaging 19.1 points per game as a feared long-range shooter, but he also does a great job using the pump fake to open up drives to the basket, where he draws many of his 3.8 free throws per game, which is tied for his career high. \nStephen Curry is shooting 92.1 percent from the line on 5.8 attempts per game, with this being the sixth time in his career that he is averaging at least five free throws per game. As much as he is known for his three-point shooting, Curry also remains a master of swerving his way to the basket and drawing in defenders for fouls in the process. At 37 years old, it is more important than ever for him to continue to carve out advantageous scoring opportunities, and getting to the line is the ideal choice. Cam Spencer has caught a lot of attention this season with his incredibly efficient scoring, as he is averaging 12.2 points on 49.8 percent shooting, including 48.5 percent from deep with 5.1 threes attempted per game. His lights-out ability also translates to the foul line, where he is hitting 92.1 percent of his 2.0 attempts per game. In his second season, Spencer has shown a great upside and is on track to become known as one of the league's best shooters. Trey Murphy ranks fourth in the league, shooting 91.0 percent from the line, which is a career high for the fifth-year forward. Murphy is also working on his second consecutive season averaging over 20 points per game and is shooting a career-best 49.5 percent from the field in the process. With 3.8 free-throw attempts per game, he is certainly not making his career at the line. However, making the most of the trips only contributes to him continuing to emerge as one of the league's most effective offensive players at his position. \nKeyonte George is having a phenomenal start to his third season, averaging career highs of 24.6 points, 4.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 0.9 steals per game. His impressive play is made even more remarkable thanks to his efficient 45.5 percent shooting from the field and 90.3 percent shooting from the foul line, resulting in 6.7 made free throws on 7.4 attempts per game. Although the Jazz continue to work to find their rhythm and identity, George is turning out to be a key factor in accelerating the process, proving to be one of the best young offensive guards in the league. \n            ",

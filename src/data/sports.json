    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title, but the big question looms -- will Trinity Rodman play?The pair took contrasting roads to the NWSL Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruict Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear, but the latest is that she was not on the official injury report and her coach Adrian Gonzalez says she is 'available.' If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8:19 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Live updates: Spirit vs. GothamProjected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In an effort to solidify its College Football Playoff case -- and continue to dominate the increasingly important game-control metric -- ninth-ranked Notre Dame left little doubt in Saturday's record-setting 70–7 rout of Syracuse.It's precisely why, for three straight weeks, the selection committee has beat the drum for the Fighting Irish (9–2) as one of the nation's most complete at-large hopefuls.The Irish scored 21 points before taking its first offensive snap and has now won 19 straight regular-season games when facing elimination from the playoff discussion -- many in blowout fashion. If there were lingering questions about why the committee ranked Notre Dame as the second-highest two-loss team this week, those were answered in South Bend.This looked like a Bowl Championship Series-era games, back when margin of victory was incentivized by the computers. Notre Dame's starters retreated to the sideline after the first series of the third quarter, shortly after Jeremiyah Love's 68-yard touchdown run -- his third of the afternoon -- stretched the lead to 56–0.\nThe win adds another common-opponent data point for the committee when comparing Notre Dame and No. 13 Miami, which beat Syracuse 38–10 earlier this season. For now, Miami's head-to-head win over Notre Dame in the opener doesn't come into play because the teams haven't been rated in the same tier in recent rankings.How does the committee distinguish between the Fighting Irish and Hurricanes? New committee chair Hunter Yurachek explained earlier this week, before Miami's 34–17 win at Virginia Tech.\"I think there's some other factors where you have Utah, BYU and Alabama in between Notre Dame and Miami,\" Yurachek said. \"As we set up the pools to do our selection process, Miami and Notre Dame have not been grouped in the same pools to have that direct head-to-head comparison, where you would really use that metric to separate one team from the next.\n\"So I think it's the separation you have between those teams, similar to the separation you have right now between a Vanderbilt and Texas, where you have a head-to-head metric as well.\"Miami led throughout its win over the Hokies, though it was only a 10-point game in the final minute before quarterback Carson Beck hit Malachi Toney on a fourth-and-2 touchdown pass from the 20-yard line with 20 seconds left.Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal was asked afterward whether the score was an attempt at style points.\n\"If people are going to play man coverage and load the box, it's not fair to our players to just sit there and run it in there,\" Cristobal said. \"We're going to stay aggressive. We feel like we almost didn't get to play an entire game. When you have eight possessions, you take advantage of them. We only had eight possessions. I think we scored on six of eight.\"Playoff metrics lead discussionBYU and Utah are the teams sandwiched between Alabama and Miami in the rankings and behind Notre Dame. Utah doesn't appear to have a path with Saturday's matchup with Kansas State and next week's with Kansas remaining and one-loss BYU may have to win the Big 12 to secure a spot when considering the metrics.While the committee does not reveal their preferred metrics system, we know game control, strength of record and strength of schedule are weighted factors in the discussion. A new metric called \"record strength\" was also adopted this season to further emphasize strength of schedule in the selection process. \nThe following numbers were from ESPN's Football Power Index heading into Saturday's games:Game controlStrength of recordSchedule strengthNo. 9 Notre DameNo. 5No. 12No. 27No. 10 AlabamaNo. 10No. 8No. 4No. 11 BYUNo. 14No. 6No. 26No. 12 UtahNo. 8No. 18No. 46No. 13 MiamiNo. 9No. 16No. 43Game control remains Notre Dame's strongest metric and is a primary reason the Fighting Irish are still in the first-round home-game discussion despite two losses. A win in next weekend's finale against Stanford all but locks in a playoff appearance, but they'll still need help from Mississippi State (against Ole Miss), Washington (against Oregon) or LSU (against Oklahoma) during rivalry weekend to move up.No. 8 Oklahoma's win over No. 22 Missouri in Week 13 will keep the Sooners ahead of Notre Dame on Tuesday night. And No. 10 Alabama could have a chance to jump the Irish during conference championship weekend if the Crimson Tide beat Auburn next weekend and reach Atlanta on Dec. 6.The committee no longer has to justify Notre Dame's ranking or dance around the head-to-head dilemma with Miami. Heading into the final weekend of the regular season, the Fighting Irish look like an elite football team at this juncture, and they've caught fire at the right time.\n            ",

The 16-man field includes both day-to-day superstars from Raw and SmackDown, popular NXT wrestlers like Je'Von Evans, and classic rivals like The Miz.Two surprise entrants from Cena's past also competed in the tournament. Zack Ryder returned for a one-off match on SmackDown, and Dolph Ziggler received a warm ovation for his match on Raw.\nRusev and Sheamus, each with a longstanding history of fighting Cena, were the first to advance to the quarterfinals. However, Sheamus pulled out before the quarterfinals with a shoulder injury. Jey Uso overcame The Miz, while LA Knight spoiled Ryder's WWE return to advance. A returning GUNTHER and Solo Sikoa have also progressed.Now, the quarterfinals are set with some interesting matchups. GUNTHER will take on Hayes on Raw, while Sikoa will face Penta. Then on SmackDown, Rusev will face Jey Uso while LA Knight will await an opponent to be named after Sheamus' injury.\nTake a look below at the tournament schedule, results, and upcoming match dates.

    "body": "\n        The Week 12 NFL odds feature four games with a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) listed as questionable, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets include Seattle (-12.5) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-12.5) versus the Giants. A team that isn't even over .500, however, is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule. Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 12 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which five teams should you lock in now?

Those matchups comprise what is considered the main slate for NFL DFS sites like FanDuel and DraftKings. Two games -- Lions vs. Giants and Chiefs vs. Colts -- have an over/under of 50 or higher, meaning they'll be a focus for NFL daily Fantasy players with big names like Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Daniel Jones, Jonathan Taylor and Amon-Ra St. Brown in action. Some big names will be missing, however, as Joe Burrow (toe) won't return yet and Cincinnati's top receiver, Ja'Marr Chase, is serving a one-game suspension. How should all that NFL news factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups?

Maye is in the MVP conversation this season thanks to him leading the NFL with 2,836 passing yards and ranking fifth in touchdowns (20). He's also added value as a runner with 285 yards and two scores. Patriots vs. Bengals has an over/under of 49.5, and the Bengals have given up the second-most Fantasy points to opposing QBs, making this a dream matchup for Maye. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Falcons running back Bijan Robinson at $8,500 on DraftKings and $9,600 on FanDuel. Robinson had 143 scrimmage yards and two scores last week. Now he takes on a New Orleans defense that ranks 20th in the league in both yards and Fantasy points given up to opposing running backs. With quarterback Michael Penix Jr. (knee) out for the year, top receiver Drake London (knee) ruled out this week, Robinson should be an even bigger focal points for this offense. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 12 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "description": "\n        As the National Women's Soccer League prepares for its biggest game of the year, the NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+), it ",
    "body": "\n        As the National Women's Soccer League prepares for its biggest game of the year, the NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+), it finds itself in the midst of another high-stakes moment -- whether its biggest star can be retained. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman is navigating a pivotal moment in her young career. Her 2025 season has been a balancing act of persistent back injury, with an epic comeback, only for a new injury to hamper her playoff status. She's managed all the highs and lows while operating under the unknown of where she could play next, and now, whether or not this is her last game with the Spirit.\"No, I'm not there at all. And genuinely speaking, like I've made no decisions,\" Rodman told the media on if she's thought about this being her last Spirit game.\"Yeah, there could be conversations being had, but right now, like, I am so excited to be representing the Spirit. I'm not even thinking of when my last game will be. But, yeah, I just want to win it [the championship], and we'll see.\"\nShe's currently on the last year of her contract, a record-setting deal she signed out of her rookie year that was the first-ever million-dollar deal in NWSL at the time. There's been plenty of reporting around the increased interest she's receiving both overseas and even through other competing leagues within the United States.Along with interest from teams in England, DC Power of the USL Super League is interested and has a contract \"significantly larger\" than anything the NWSL can currently offer, according to The Athletic. The league is another division one women's league operating in the U.S., currently in its second year of operation, and operates without a salary cap. On Thursday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in response to offers from competitors that the league \"will fight\" to keep Rodman in the league, and the player was moved by the sentiment but was trying to retain her focus on the championship final. \n\"I'm honored to have her say that ... Really happy about that, but at the same time, like, I don't want to put that pressure on myself, of like, because she said that now I'm like, 'Oh shoot. Like, I'm trapped.' But at the same time, I'm focused on this weekend, and that's really all I can focus on, and then moving forward, that's when I really have those conversations and tough calls that I need to have,\" Rodman said. The salary cap has rapidly become a point of contention in a year where multiple players have opted to go play overseas. U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma kicked off the transfer flow of players in January, while winger Alyssa Thompson followed during the summer. Defender Emily Fox has played with Arsenal since 2024, and midfielder Catarina Macario turned pro out of Stanford and began her career in France and is now with Chelsea.The league is bullish on the salary cap as its main mechanism to keep its world-renowned parity. That, to keep a league competitive, means there's talent across clubs, and not just one or two teams. \n\"I'm not, like, a vet in the league, like, there's only so much I can say,\" Rodman shared about retaining talent across the league. \"It's grown so much year to year, so I'm grateful for that. And even a position that I'm in, and the pay that I'm getting already is more than a lot of players, so there's only so much I can speak to, and those are conversations my agents are having. So for me, my focus is on the field. There's only so much I can speak on. Obviously, players want to get paid as much money as they possibly can. So, if that can grow, that'd be amazing. But at the same time, the league is slowly but surely growing every single year.\"Whether or not the salary cap is an appropriate mechanism for the league, its clubs, and players to navigate retention and talent, for Rodman, it's a complex balance with the league she's been with since she was 18 years old.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS   | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190\"I mean, I think it's hard to say. In women's sports, there's always this fight for equal pay to get paid more for the work that we do. But again, like, I'm 23 years old, I'm not going to try to completely change the league and fix that, but at the same time, yeah, we're always going to push and strive for more,\" she said. \nIn the weeks leading up to the end of the season, Rodman has been trying to work her way back from an MCL sprain and be a presence for her team in her limited minutes. She featured off the bench for the Spirit in the semifinal and was a threat on goal even in a brief time on the field. As she looks ahead to the final, she's just trying to find ways to shut out the noise about her contract status and focus on herself and her teammates.\"I think prioritizing just a little bit of alone time, because I think it's important, if that's just listening to music, reading a book, or, I don't know, just hanging out, taking a nap, just having that time for yourself, I think is important,\" Rodman told CBS Sports about managing the chaos around her. \"Being on a team sport, you're always around them, as much as you love them. Sometimes it's like, 'Okay, I need to breathe. I need to just live in the moment and be present.' So that's important. And then also, managing time with family, boyfriend, whatever, and then also coming back. Being able to have Ben [Shelton] here this week has been amazing for me.\"\nRodman leaning on her pro tennis boyfriend isn't new; the two have split time supporting each other at their respective sporting events. Sharing the spotlight has been helpful, especially with decisions looming on the horizon. \"He's just telling me that I'm the driver in this situation, and in life, and that I control whatever I want, and yeah, God is great,\" she said.The Washington Spirit will face Gotham FC on Saturday for the 2025 NWSL Championship. Rodman last won the championship with the Spirit in 2021 during her rookie season. All eyes will be on her whether she starts or features off the bench, as it could be her final game in the NWSL if she decides to leave.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All Elite Wrestling returns with its penultimate pay-per-view of the year, AEW Full Gear. \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Samoa Joe run back their world championship match from WrestleDream, but this time, inside a steel cage. \"Hangman\" beat Joe for the first time last month after multiple failed attempts of the year. Their hostilities only escalated after Joe and his faction, The Opps, attacked \"Hangman\" post-match. On Saturday, Page gets Joe to himself in a steel cage.Full Gear will also crown the inaugural National champion, a title intended to be defended in promotions beyond just AEW. Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin, Hurt Syndicate teammates, will be the first participants in the Casino Gauntlet match. The innovative match starts with two participants. New entrants join the fray at timed intervals; however, the match can end by pinfall or submission at any time. In theory, the match could end with two or 21 participants in the ring. Other notable stars wrestling at Full Gear include TBS champion Mercedes Mone, former world champions Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega, and AEW stalwart Darby Allin. Omega, considered one of the best wrestlers in the world who never competed in WWE, admits he has been thinking about when he will retire.\n\"I've been thinking a lot about when that timing would be. Another important thing for me is, when I finally do leave, whenever that may be, and this might sound odd, I don't want people to be sad,\" Omega told CBS Sports. \"In fact, the best-case scenario for me is that they don't realize I'm gone at all. I'd love to have the peace of mind that the company has built enough stars so that their star is shining bright enough to distract from me stepping away from the scene. That would make me most happy.\"Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWatch 2025 AEW Full GearDate: Nov. 22Location: Prudential Center -- Newark, New JerseyStart time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: HBO Max, Prime Video, PPV.com, YouTube, and Fubo | Price: $49.992025 AEW Full Gear match cardAEW World Championship -- \"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. Samoa Joe (Steel cage match)Jox Moxley vs. Kyle O'Reilly (No Holds Barred match)AEW Women's World Championship -- Kris Statlander (c) vs. Mercedes Mone Kenny Omega & Jurassic Express (\"Jungle\" Jack Perry &  Luchasaurus) vs. The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson) &  Josh Alexander  AEW Women's Tag Team Championship -- Babes of Wrath (Willow & Harley Cameron) vs. Sisters of Sin (Julia Hart & Skye Blue) vs. Timeless Love Bombs (\"Timeless\" Toni Storm & Mina Shirakawa) vs. Megan Bayne & Marina ShafirDarby Allin vs. PacTNT Championship -- Kyle Fletcher (c) vs. Mark Briscoe (No Disqualification match)*National Championship -- Bobby Lashley vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Ricochet vs. Kevin Knight vs. \"Speedball\" Mike Bailey vs. More TBA (Casino Gauntlet match)AEW Tag Team Championships -- Brodido (Bandido & Brody King) (c) vs. FTR (Cash Wheeler & Dax Harwood)Hook & Eddie Kingston vs. WorkHorsemen (Anthony Henry vs. JD Drake)CMLL World Trios Championships -- El Sky Team (Mistico, Mascara Dorada & Neon) (c) vs. The Don Callis Family (Kazuchika Okada, Konosuke Takeshita & Hechicero)The Acclaimed (Max Caster & Anthony Bowens) vs. Bang Bang Gang (Austin Gunn & Juice Robinson) vs. Big Bill & Bryan Keith vs. The Outrunners (Truth Magnum & Turbo Floyd)Boom & Doom (\"Big Boom\" A.J. & Q.T.

    "body": "\n        Teams desperate to get in the win column meet on Sunday when the Las Vegas Raiders (1-8) face the Cleveland Browns (2-7) in NFL Week 12 action on CBS and Paramount+. Cleveland has lost three straight, but did cover as a 7.5-point underdog last week against the Ravens. Las Vegas, meanwhile, has dropped four straight overall, but has covered in two of its last three. Despite struggling this season, the Raiders are expected to stick with Geno Smith at quarterback, while the Browns plan to start rookie Shedeur Sanders for the first time with Dillon Gabriel in concussion protocol. Kickoff from Allegiant Stadium is set for 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Las Vegas is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Raiders vs. Browns odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 36.5.

It starts with quarterback concerns for both teams, but these sides also lack many game-breaking skill players to help them. Running back Ashton Jeanty was supposed to be just that for Las Vegas, but has averaged just 3.7 yards per carry this season. Quinshon Judkins has been a bit more effective for Cleveland, but only one player for either side -- Raiders receiver Tre Tucker (502 yards) -- has more than 500 receiving yards on the season. These teams, however, both have a game-wrecker coming off the edge. Cleveland's Myles Garrett leads the NFL with 15 sacks, while Maxx Crosby of the Raiders has six sacks and ranks third in the NFL in tackles for loss with 14. How these offensive lines contain those players could be an x-factor in who wins what is expected to be a low-scoring battle. Click here to bet Raiders vs. Browns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Raiders vs. Browns score prediction, picksBoth teams are 4-6 against the spread, and Cleveland has been especially poor on the road with an 0-4 ATS mark.

    "body": "\n        Week 12 has arrived for NFL DFS players, and there are three matchups on the Sunday 'main slate' that feature an over/under of 50 points or higher. Lions vs. Giants, Colts vs. Chiefs and Patriots vs. Bengals will all be potential sources of major offense. NFL DFS lineups won't feature Ja'Marr Chase (suspension), Joe Burrow (toe) or Jaxson Dart (concussion) this week, but big names like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Drake Maye and Patrick Mahomes are all in play. Which NFL DFS picks from those matchups should you target, and are there players from potentially lower-scoring games like Seahawks vs. Titans or Raiders vs. Browns who should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 12, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to Week 12's Sunday main slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 12Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for the Week 12 main slate is rostering Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce at $5,000 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. Generally the most expensive tight end in the player pool in recent years, Kelce is now the third-most expensive TE option on the main slate for both sites as his overall production has slipped. McClure, however, is encouraged by his massive numbers last week that included season highs in targets (13), receptions (9) and yards (91). The Colts rank 30th in the league in points given up to opposing Fantasy tight ends, opening the door for a massive day for Kelce in what could be a high-scoring game. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers running back Emanuel Wilson ($6,500 on FanDuel, $5,300 on DraftKings), who could see a big workload with Josh Jacobs (knee) listed as questionable. Wilson, a third-year pro out of Fort Valley State, did a nice job in relief last week with 49 scrimmage yards and a score. He was also effective against the Steelers last month in the other game he saw extensive action, piling up 87 scrimmage yards.

    "body": "\n        Former NBA standout and Wake Forest star Rodney Rogers died on Friday at the age of 54, his family announced. Rogers played 12 NBA seasons, averaging 10.9 points and 4.5 rebounds per game over his career, and earned the league's Sixth Man of the Year honor in 2000 as a member of the Phoenix Suns. Rogers died from \"natural causes related to the spinal cord injury\" he sustained in a 2008 ATV accident, his wife, Faye, said in a statement. Rogers was a two-time All-ACC player at Wake Forest, was the league's player of the year in 1993 and has his No. 54 retired by the Demon Deacons. The ninth overall pick of the Denver Nuggets in the 1993 NBA Draft, the former McDonald's All-American played two seasons with Denver bringing his best years came over stretch with the Los Angeles Clippers from 1995-99. He later spent parts of three seasons with the Suns and had stints with the New Jersey Nets, New Orleans Hornets and Philadelphia 76ers,On Nov. 28, 2008, a few years after he retired from the NBA, Rogers was injured in an ATV accident in his native North Carolina and was paralyzed from the shoulders down.\n\"The last 18 years have been both challenging and profoundly blessed. Through every moment, Rodney remained a light -- positive, motivated and full of the quiet strength that inspired everyone around him,\" Faye Rogers said. The NBA's official statement on Rogers' death touched on his perseverance off the court.\"The NBA family is deeply saddened by the passing of Rodney Rogers,\" the statement read. \"Rodney earned the Sixth Man of the Year Award while playing for the Phoenix Suns and was a beloved teammate during his 12-year NBA career. He will be remembered not only for his achievements on the court but also for the extraordinary resilience, courage and generosity that he demonstrated throughout his life -- qualities that inspired so many. We send our heartfelt condolences to Rodney's wife, Faye, and their family.\"\nWake Forest athletic director John Currie said Rogers was instrumental in bringing Wake Forest basketball to national prominence.\"His generational combination of power and grace as a player was exceeded only by the size of his heart,\" Currie said. \"His perseverance and spirit following his accident inspired thousands and embodied the true meaning of Pro Humanitate. Rodney showed us what strength looks like in every chapter of life. Our hearts are with Faye, Roddreka, Rodney II, Rydiah and the entire Rogers family.\" Former Demon Deacons coach Dave Odom said Rogers was \"without reservation\" one of the best players in ACC history. He's one of only seven players in ACC history -- and the only Demon Deacon -- to earn both ACC Freshman of the Year and ACC Player of the Year honors.\nRogers led Wake Forest to its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1984 and later helped the Demon Deacons reach the Sweet 16. Rogers' daughters, Roddreka and Rydiah, played collegiately at Georgia Tech and NC State, respectively.\"Rodney Rogers made a tremendous impact on Demon Deacon basketball,\" Demon Deacons coach Steve Forbes said. \"I remember watching him play in college and in the NBA and always had an immense respect for him. Since I came to Wake Forest, I have heard so many stories about Rodney and his family. The impact he had in this community and the basketball world went way beyond his on-court accomplishments. Everyone associated with our program is saddened by his passing and our thoughts are with his family.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU is preparing one of the richest contracts in college football history in an attempt to lure Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge, a person familiar with the discussions tells CBS Sports.The deal is believed to be for seven years and worth as much as $98 million, the source said, and includes a significant promise that would make LSU competitive in revenue sharing and NIL, the source said. A formal offer has not yet been made. Kiffin is expected to make a decision on his future after next Friday's Egg Bowl against rival Mississippi State, Ole Miss athletics director Keith Carter said Friday.A seven-year deal averaging $14 million per year would make Kiffin the highest-paid coach in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart entered the 2025 season with an annual salary of $13.3 million. Brian Kelly, the former LSU coach, was fired during the fourth year of a 10-year, $95 million contract. State laws in Louisiana complicate high-paying contracts for university employees, so LSU's contract is expected to include \"easy-to-achieve\" incentive bonuses, a source said. LSU's base salary will probably be capped at just north of $3 million with additional money coming from outside sources and incentives. Additional bonuses could push the lifetime value of the current offer above the $98 million threshold. \nKiffin's current $9 million salary at Ole Miss was tied for No. 6 in the SEC in 2025. Kiffin is the hottest candidate on the coaching carousel this year, garnering attention from two blue-blood suitors in the SEC: Florida and LSU. It's believed LSU has the momentum to land the Rebels head coach, CBS Sports' John Talty and Matt Zenitz reported Friday.  Yahoo! Sports reported Friday that LSU is promising NIL and revenue sharing investments exceeding $25 million.\n        \n            \n                Where will Lane Kiffin land post-Egg Bowl? Momentum for LSU, Florida falls back in race for Ole Miss coach\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe No. 6 Rebels (10-1) are on the edge of reaching the College Football Playoff for the first time in school history with one game remaining in the regular season. Kiffin has led the program to three straight 10-win seasons for the first time ever. Kiffin and his athletics director met Friday to discuss his future. Ole Miss began contract discussions with Kiffin earlier this month. The program is expected to make him one of the highest-paid coaches in the country should he choose to remain at Ole Miss. Sources described the negotiations in late October as \"positive,\" though no resolution has been reached in the weeks since.\nKiffin deflected questions about his future during a teleconference with reporters Wednesday, just days after a plane carrying his family members traveled to Gainesville and Baton Rouge on consecutive days, sources told CBS Sports. Kiffin's ex-wife, Layla Kiffin, was among those on the flights.\"I'm saying the same thing for six years,\" Kiffin said on an SEC teleconference. \"I'm not talking about speaking on other jobs. I'm focused on this one.\"Ole Miss travels to Mississippi State on Nov. 28.\"Despite the outside noise, Coach Kiffin is focused on preparing our team for the Egg Bowl, and together, we want to ensure that our players and coaches can concentrate fully on next Friday's game,\" Carter said in a statement Friday. \"The team is on the cusp of an unprecedented season, and it's imperative they feel the support of the Ole Miss family in the week ahead.\" \nKiffin is 54-19 in nearly six full seasons, which includes four 10-win seasons, while leading the Rebels.\n            ",

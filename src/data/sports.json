    "body": "\n        U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi will stay at PSV for the rest of the season, with a proposed move to Fulham failing to come together despite the two clubs agreeing a deal before Monday's transfer deadline, per reports.Fulham agreed to pay a transfer fee of roughly $44 million, according to Fabrizio Romano, while Pepi had agreed to personal terms with the London-based club. The Cottagers reportedly improved upon previous bids for Pepi's services, the most recent of which came in at $38 million, according to ESPN. The Pepi deal, though, was always contingent upon PSV's ability to line up a replacement for the 23-year-old, who has 11 goals and two assists in 22 matches across all competitions for the Dutch side, and they were unable to do that before the end of the transfer window on Monday.For Fulham, Pepi could have pitched in with their attacking operation in the short-term after losing forward Rodrigo Muniz to a hamstring injury in November and selling Adama Traore to West Ham United in January. In the long-term, Pepi could become a central figure of their attack if Raul Jimenez leaves on a free transfer next summer.In the meantime, the player will focus on his return from injury. Pepi broke his arm while scoring in January during a 5-1 win against Excelsior and is expected to be out for roughly two months. He could miss the USMNT's final international window in March before head coach Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup roster in late May, with Pochettino admitting that it is too early to say when exactly Pepi will return to the pitch.\n\"We'll see with Ricardo,\" Pochettino said in a press conference last week. \"I think we'll see how he's going to come back and start to play and to perform and of course, he's a player that is on our radar, Ricardo. Hope that he can be fit and I think we have time to assess and of course, we are going to make the best decision for him and for us.\"How risky is a move before the World Cup?Though Pepi will no longer make the jump from the Netherlands to England, he would not have been the only USMNT player to change clubs this winter if his transfer to Fulham went through. Defender Alex Freeman recently transferred from MLS' Orlando City to Spain's Villarreal, making a major move in the months before the World Cup, something that comes with inherent risks. Pepi is already familiar with the downsides -- his pre–2022 World Cup move from FC Dallas to Augsburg proved disastrous, contributing to his absence from the U.S. World Cup roster. Over two seasons with Augsburg, he appeared in just 16 matches and failed to score. A 2022–23 loan to Groningen revived his career, as he scored 13 goals in 31 games, earning a move to PSV ahead of the 2023–24 season, where he has since produced double-digit goals each year.Regular minutes at the club level are a prerequisite for cracking one of Pochettino's rosters and will likely be taken into extremely serious conversation as he makes his picks for next summer's tournament, which means any players on the move may have to hit the ground running to ensure they isarein the best possible position to perform at the World Cup. That is especially true for Pepi, who could theoretically carve out an important spot in the USMNT's attack.\nMonaco's Folarin Balogun seems like Pochettino's preferred starter in the No. 9 position but the head coach has a few options to pick from, a list headlined by Coventry City's Haji Wright and Ricardo Pepi. They are not alone in the depth chart, though – Derby County's Patrick Agyemang has become a contender despite only earning his first cap a year ago, while Josh Sargent will hope to be in the mix. (Sargent himself may also be on the move before the window closes on Monday, attempting to force a move from Norwich City to Toronto FC, though playing time is not the reason for his push to join the MLS club.)Pochettino, though, has a more positive perspective on transfers during the winter window.\"For me, always, it's positive,\" Pochettino said. \"When you change, it's because you are convinced you are going to be in a better place than the place that you are, no? And I think that is why, always, I am very optimistic, I'm very positive in all the moves … All the coaching staff, we need to support our players and always because it's too many things that can happen around. It's always being supportive and [to] give the confidence that the decisions they are going to make are the best decisions. That is why I am not worried, I am not concerned about if some players are going to move in that transfer window because always, what I expect [is] the best thing.\"\n            ",

Al-Nassr have made no new signings in the January transfer window but sources say they are working to strengthen their squad before the transfer window closes Monday.It is understood that Ronaldo's actions have the backing of some senior figures at Al-Nassr as the complications that come with one organisation owning four of Saudi Arabia's leading clubs. CBS Sports has previously revealed the tension that hovers over relations between some of the biggest teams in the country, which burst to the surface in the summer when Al-Hilal attempted to secure the services of Ronaldo for the Club World Cup.Al-Hilal's interest in taking Karim Benzema from Al-Ittihad to their club could also have served as a rupture point for Al-Nassr. Al-Hilal lead the Pro League by three points and such a high profile move, though now viewed as increasingly unlikely, could have a pivotal impact on the title race.\nRonaldo, 40, still has nearly 18 months left to run on the contract he signed with Al-Nassr in the summer and there has so far been no suggestion that he might look to cut his stay short. Instead he will hope that his deadline day strike will convince PIF to offer backing to his side in the transfer window.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason continues to wind down, with just over a week remaining until pitchers and catchers report for duty at sites scattered across Arizona and Florida. That doesn't mean teams are free to take the next few days off, however. Several notable free agents remain unsigned, including veteran starting pitchers Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Monday's most notable moves and murmurs in one spot for your viewing convenience. Yankees, Mets interested in FranceCount the Yankees, Mets, Padres, and Diamondbacks among the teams with interest in free-agent first baseman Ty France, according to MassLive.\nFrance, 31, hit .257/.320/.360 (88 OPS+) last season with seven home runs in 138 games split between the Twins and Blue Jays. His contributions were estimated to be worth 1 Win Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference's calculations. France is considered to be a quality fielder at the cold corner, though he hasn't posted an OPS above .700 against either lefties or righties in either of the past two seasons.The Yankees, at least, have also been connected to a potential reunion with Paul Goldschmidt. As such, it seems fair to describe them as being on the prowl for a right-handed first baseman to pair with lefty-hitting Ben Rice.\nSantana among D-backs' optionsAs noted above, the Diamondbacks are one of the teams tracking France. They also have some degree of interest in Carlos Santana, per 98.7 FM. Currently, the D-backs are projected to use Pavin Smith as their most-days first baseman. \nSantana, 40 come April, hit .219/.308/.325 (77 OPS+) last season in 124 games split between the Guardians and the Cubs. His contributions were nonetheless estimated to have been worth 1.1 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. \nLike France, Santana is considered to be an excellent defender around the first-base bag. Clearly there's a market for that particularly skill right now.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        51 days until Opening Day ...Eugenio Suarez has been one of the toughest players to rank in Fantasy Baseball this offseason, and he got harder to rank the longer he sat out there on the free-agent marketplace. We know Suarez can be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but we also know through two separate stints in Seattle that his value can be very dependent on his home park. In the end, all that worrying was for nothing, as Suarez settled on a one-year deal to return to Cincinnati, where he first established himself as a star. And it's just about the best possible landing spot for his Fantasy value. Great American Ballpark is one of the three best hitter's parks in baseball, and based on Statcast data, it is the one he would have hit the most homers in for his career by far. Per Statcast's xHR stat, Suarez would have hit 346 homers if he played every game of his career in Cincinnati, compared to 313 for the next-best park and 264 for the average of the other 29. This also isn't theoretical. Suarez spent the first half of his career in Cincy, and while it took him a few years to establish himself, he would go on to hit .250/.343/./496 with a 38-homer, 100-RBI pace over his final five seasons with the Reds. The Reds lineup itself is a bit iffy, but Suarez should provide a nice boost, and we can be pretty sure Great American Ballpark isn't going to hold him back, at least.That doesn't mean Suarez comes without risk in 2026 drafts, of course. It just means that the risks aren't external. If Suarez is going to have a bad season, it won't be because his home park is holding him back, the way Seattle's T-Mobile Park clearly did in his two stints there, including at the end of last season. \nThe risk here comes from Suarez's age (he'll be 35 midway through the season) and his skill set. There's always been a lot of swing-and-miss here, and it's led to some ugly seasons even during his peak – in 2021, his final year during his first stint with the Reds, he hit .198/.286/.428 with 150 combined runs and RBI in 145 games, something even his 31 homers couldn't really overcome. And that was when he was 29. That's why you shouldn't draft Suarez based on his 49 homers and 118 RBI from last season. He might do that again, and he might even do it with a .250-ish average, which would make him pretty easily worth a top-50 pick. But he might hit .228 with 30 homers and just not be worth the trouble, at least at that kind of price.The answer, then, is to downgrade him a bit. He was the No. 40 player in Roto leagues last season, but you shouldn't draft him at that cost. But as the No. 75 player? He's well worth drafting around that price as the No. 6 third baseman in most drafts, and his move back to Cincy locks that up.\nUnfortunately, it also locks up a bunch of playing time. That's not a bad thing for the Reds, who need competent hitters to help their lineup take the next step. However, this was already a team with some playing time questions, and they just got a lot more pronounced for one guy in particular: Sal Stewart. Stewart is a popular sleeper/breakout pick for Fantasy, but with Ke'Bryan Hayes and Matt McLain expected to be locked in at third base and second base most days, Stewart's path to everyday at-bats just got a bit more unclear. He could still be the primary option at first base (and I would expect that to be the plan), but now he doesn't have the fallback of regular DH duty to lean on. It puts more pressure on his bat to play immediately, especially with Spencer Steer still around as a viable option at first base if Stewart doesn't hit.Of course, if Stewart does hit, I don't think this will actually be an issue. He is potentially the team's second or third-best hitter, and while he has only played 38 games at Triple-A, it's not like he looked like he had much left to learn at that level – he hit .315/.394/.629 as a 21-year-old last season, which is impressive even for the inflated offensive environments of the International League. The best version of this Reds lineup is almost certainly one that features Stewart playing up to his highest potential, and they should give him that opportunity unless he absolutely flops in Spring Training.\nWhich is possible! There is certainly a bit more risk to drafting Stewart today than there was a few days ago. But there was always a risk that he would fall on his face and end up sent back to Triple-A. That risk is mitigated by his obvious talent, his positional flexibility – neither Hayes nor McLain should be viewed as a guarantee for 600 plate appearances given their deficiencies as hitters – and, most importantly, his cost. Stewart's ADP in 117 January drafts on the NFC platform was 203.4, and while that's not literally nothing, it's cheap enough that there just isn't much risk. He might bust at that price, but that price is cheap enough that it won't seriously impact your ability to win this season.Which is to say: I still think Stewart is a fine sleeper. If anything, this move only figures to make him an easier pick, since it will likely serve to further depress his price. Stewart has 20-20 upside in this ballpark, and if he hits the way we expect him to, I think any questions about his playing time will disappear one way or the other. He has to make himself indispensable to the Reds, but if he does, there is significant upside here. More than enough to make him worth whatever downside risk might be there.So, don't react to this move by taking Stewart off your sleepers list just yet. Maybe we'll hit a point this spring where the path to playing time just doesn't materialize, and we have to reassess the situation. But for now, Stewart remains one of the better cheap, high-upside picks you can make. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        As they hoisted their record third Vince Lombardi Trophy in four years, no one would have anticipated that the Dallas Cowboys wouldn't sniff another Super Bowl for the ensuing 30 years. Since defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX, the Cowboys have won just five playoff games and have not advanced beyond the NFC divisional round. In fact, the Cowboys' conference title game drought is the longest in the NFC and the third longest in the entire NFL. Conversely, the New England Patriots' frequent trips to the big game over the past 30 years have made a seven-year hiatus seem like an eternity. This year marks the Patriots' 11th of 12 all-time Super Bowl appearance since 1996, the most of any team in NFL history. New England can become the first team to win seven Super Bowls if it can defeat the Seattle Seahawks 11 years after it first defeated them in the big game. \nBelow is a rundown of the NFL's longest Super Bowl droughts, a list that includes four franchises that are still awaiting their first trip to the Super Bowl. TeamYearsLast Super Bowl appearanceLast Super Bowl winNew England Patriots 02026: ???2019Seattle Seahawks02026: ???2014Kansas City Chiefs12025: Lost vs. Eagles 2024Philadelphia Eagles 12025: Won vs. Eagles 2025San Francisco 49ers 22024: Lost vs. Chiefs 1995Cincinnati Bengals 42022: Lost vs. Rams N/ALos Angeles Rams 42022: Won vs. Bengals 2022Tampa Bay Buccaneers 52021: Won vs. Chiefs 2021Atlanta Falcons 92017: Lost vs. Patriots N/ADenver Broncos 102016: Won vs. Panthers 2016Carolina Panthers 102016: Lost vs. Broncos N/ABaltimore Ravens 132013: Won vs. 49ers 2013New York Giants 142012: Won vs. Patriots 2012Green Bay Packers 152011: Won vs. Steelers 2011Pittsburgh Steelers 152011: Lost vs. Packers 2009New Orleans Saints 162010: Won vs. Colts 2010Indianapolis Colts 162010: Lost vs. Saints 2007Arizona Cardinals 172009: Lost vs. Steelers N/AChicago Bears 19 2007: Lost vs. Colts 1986Las Vegas Raiders 232003: Lost vs. Buccaneers 1984Tennessee Titans 262000: Lost vs. Rams N/ADallas Cowboys 30 1996: Won vs. Steelers 1996Los Angeles Chargers 31 1995: Lost vs. 49ers N/ABuffalo Bills 321994: Lost vs. Cowboys N/AWashington Commanders 341992: Won vs. Bills 1992Miami Dolphins 41 1985: Lost vs. 49ers 1974Minnesota Vikings 49 1977: Lost vs. Raiders N/ANew York Jets 571969: Won vs. Colts 1968Cleveland Browns N/A None N/ADetroit Lions N/A None N/AHouston Texans N/A None N/AJacksonville Jaguars N/A None N/ATwo notable droughts from this list are the ones in Buffalo and Detroit. The Bills, following another heartbreaking playoff loss this season, fired their coach Sean McDermott and replaced him with former offensive coordinator Joe Brady. The decision spoke of Bills owner Terry Pegula's desire to end Buffalo's Super Bowl drought while maximizing the remaining years of Josh Allen's prime. \nThe Lions, one of four teams that have yet to reach a Super Bowl, got close in 2023 but were unable to finish off the 49ers in one of the greatest NFC title games ever. Detroit made the playoffs again in 2024 but were upset by the Washington Commanders in the divisional round. The Lions are hoping to make another run away in 2026 after missing the playoffs this past season for the first time since 2022. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer faces a critical 2026 season. Year 3 could be tenure-defining based on the expectations set by the previous Nick Saban regime.Following a narrative-setting Rose Bowl loss in the College Football Playoff that bled into several high-end swings and misses in the transfer portal, patience is wearing thin. DeBoer is 20-8 overall at Alabama since taking Washington to the national title game in 2023.Players defended DeBoer following the 35-point defeat to Indiana and the confidence from those he has coached hasn't stopped. It's imperative Alabama extends the runway for DeBoer, according to former Crimson Tide tight end Josh Cuevas.\"I've never played under Saban. I've always been with coach DeBoer from Washington up until now,\" Cuevas said at the Senior Bowl. \"But I can say that the fans need to have the utmost trust in coach DeBoer. He knows how to take a team and turn them into a national championship team. And once everybody's really bought into his process, I think he's going to do great things with that program.\"\nCuevas played in every game for Pac-12 champion Washington in 2023 before following DeBoer and several of his Huskies teammates to Alabama. Over two seasons with the Crimson Tide, Cuevas recorded 53 receptions for 629 yards and five touchdowns.Cuevas' words echoed what multi-year starter and outgoing fifth-year senior Deontae Lawson said from Pasadena when jeers for DeBoer hit an all-time high a few weeks ago. Lawson interrupted a reporter and said he wasn't finished when the topic turned to how Alabama would get out of this funk under its current leader.\"Coach DeBoer is an excellent coach. He's a true players' coach,\" Lawson said on Jan. 1. \"His future here will be remembered, that's all I can say. He cares for us. He cares for his players. He's always wanting to get better. Like I said, his future will definitely be remembered.\"\nForgettable transfer portal cycleDespite signing the nation's 16th-best best transfer class per 247Sports, Alabama lost more quality talent than it acquired. Six of the top 80 transfers in the 2026 cycle were former Crimson Tide players, including wideout Isaiah Horton, who notched 42 catches for 511 yards and eight touchdowns last season.The misses were notable, too. Elite running back Hollywood Smothers from NC State committed to Alabama before signing with Texas and the Crimson Tide lost a head-to-head battle with South Carolina for top transfer offensive tackle Jacarrius Peak, also from the Wolfpack. Former Oregon edge Blake Purchase planned a visit to Alabama, but canceled and instead signed with Ole Miss.Alabama's lacking NIL resources compared to other programs of similar stature is well-documented. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne delivered a message to fans in December 2024 centered around supporting the school's fundraising efforts, which was more or less fighting against apathetic feelings under DeBoer coming off unrivaled success previously.\nThe Crimson Tide rebounded from a lackluster — by program standards — 9-4 finish in 2024 with 11 wins including a postseason victory, but non-competitive losses to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game and later Indiana left more to be desired.And with quarterback Ty Simpson turning pro, no identity yet in the backfield and a bunch of newcomers on defense, there are more questions than answers roster-wise approaching the start of spring practice in a few weeks.DeBoer encouraged by changesThe Crimson Tide moved on from offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic after two seasons primarily due to execution issues and an overall lack of physicality. Sophomore tackle Michael Carroll is the group's only returning starter next season and will be joined by several portal acquisitions and returning players anticipating reps.\nAlabama gave up the most pressures in the SEC last season (183), according to 247Sports. Alabama surrendered the fourth-most sacks (32) as an underachieving unit, according to Pro Football Focus. This group was supposed to be one of the league's best with preseason all-conference returning starters Kadyn Proctor and Jaeden Roberts as anchors.\"A lot of new faces that are gonna be in that room. So kind of a fresh start there,\" DeBoer said from the Senior Bowl.Alabama's defensive line is another position group undergoing a massive overhaul after losing all three starters from last season's team and three primary backups  — Jordan Renaud, Keon Keeley and Kelby Collins — to the transfer portal.\nDeBoer argues that Alabama's pass rush in 2026 will be \"stronger and more athletic\" despite the changes. That will include USC transfer Devan Thompkins, Oregon's Terrance Green, Kedrick Bingley-Jones from Mississippi State and Washington's Caleb Smith along with former South Carolina edge Desmond Umeozulu.Alabama also signed five freshmen defensive linemen and bring back London Simmons, Edric Hill and Jeremiah Beaman to complete the room.\"I'm fired up about that group,\" DeBoer said in Mobile. \"I'm fired up about what those guys bring, both the returners and also the newcomers that come in.\"\nDuring spring practice, DeBoer gets an opportunity to see how well Alabama's new additions mesh with the current roster and get a feel for a two-deep approaching his third season. Three opponents on the Crimson Tide's 2026 schedule are ranked in CBS Sports' way-too-early top 25.\n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nWelcome to February, everyone! This is Zach Pereles pumped to deliver the first newsletter of what will be a thrilling month. No matter your sport, February has something for you. Super Bowl. Winter Olympics. NBA trade deadline and All-Star weekend. Unrivaled. College basketball. Golf. Soccer. Tennis. Hockey. UFC. Hey, even Spring Training is just a few weeks away. So whether you're shoveling yourself out of snow or enjoying some nice weather -- and if it's the latter, I'm jealous -- or somewhere in between, make sure to treat yourself to plenty of sports viewing, too. Let's get right to it.  👀 Five things to know Monday The Cardinals have their new coach, and the Raiders have theirs in sight. The historically large coaching carousel has (almost) come to a halt. The Cardinals hired Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur to be their coach, and the Raiders plan to do the same with Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, though that one can't become official until after the Super Bowl. Once Kubiak becomes official, all 10 vacancies will have been filled. It was tied for the most coaching turnover in a single offseason in NFL history, and Tyler Sullivan graded every hire.Carlos Alcaraz, Elena Rybakina are Australian Open champions. Once again, Carlos Alcaraz stands alone. The 22-year-old superstar Spaniard beat Novak Djokovic, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5, in the Australian Open men's singles final to become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam. Alcaraz now has seven major titles, the most before turning 23. A day earlier, Elena Rybakina upset Aryna Sabalenka, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, for her second career major title.The NBA suspended Paul George 25 games for violating terms of the league's anti-drug policy. In a statement, George said he took \"full responsibility\" for the suspension and explained he took an \"improper medication\" to combat mental health issues. The 76ers are sixth in the East.The NBA trade deadline draws closer. The deadline is Thursday afternoon and the Cavaliers, Kings and Bulls swung a trade that sends Keon Ellis and Dennis Schröder to Cleveland, De'Andre Hunter to Sacramento and Dario Šarić and two second-round picks to Chicago. In his trade grades, Sam Quinn says the Cavs came out on top by a wide margin.Alexander Volkanovski makes his GOAT case at UFC 325. A considerable case can be made following Volkanovski's featherweight win over Diego Lopes. The judges scored the fight 49-46, 49-46, and 50-45 in favor of Volkanovski to defend his title. Here's what could be next. 🏀 Do not miss this: LeBron James gets an All-Star nod for a 22nd season, but did he deserve it? \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            I don't know about you, but LeBron James is feeling 22 straight All-Star Game selections. The Lakers star made the All-Star Game as one of 14 reserve selections announced Sunday night. West: Anthony Edwards, Jamal Murray, Chet Holmgren, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Deni Avdija, LeBron JamesEast: Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Scottie Barnes, Jalen DurenThey join the starters, who were announced a few weeks ago: West: Luka Dončić, Stephen Curry, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokić, Victor WembanyamaEast: Tyrese Maxey, Jalen Brunson, Cade Cunningham, Jaylen Brown, Giannis AntetokounmpoAs with any selection process, there are snubs, too. And the most glaring one, Brad Botkin writes, plays in the same city as James and the same arena that will host the festivities in just under two weeks. \nBotkin: \"Kawhi Leonard -- Leonard is having a career season for a Clippers team that has been bulldozing teams for the last two months. His 27.7 PPG is a career high. He's on track to join the ultra exclusive 50/40/90 shooting club. His 94% clip at the free-throw line leads the league, as do his 2.1 steals per game. The side by side vs. LeBron isn't even close.\"I couldn't agree more. Leonard is very much deserving a spot. He's been a top-10 player league-wide over the past two months -- but he's not even a top-12 player in the West? Don't love that. I do love the Powell and Avdija nods, though. Well deserved. There's a good chance there will have to be an injury replacement for Antetokounmpo, but the biggest Antetokounmpo headlines continue to be whether he will or won't be traded before the Thursday deadline. Brad ranked the best possible trade packages.Could we get an Antetokounmpo-Curry pairing for the Warriors? Draymond Green isn't losing sleep.The Blazers reportedly also have interest. 🏈 Super Bowl week is here!  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Seahawks and the Patriots made their way to the Bay Area for Super Bowl LX, and Opening Night is tonight. We'll hear from Roger Goodell and both teams. \nThat, of course, includes the NFL's leading receiver, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. I loved Chris Hummer's feature on Seattle's breakout star. I also loved Doug Clawson's 60 crazy stats entering Super Bowl 60. Oh, and by the way, I've made my pick. Signed, sealed and delivered. Take it to the bank: Pereles: \"Expect some nerves early, especially from the quarterbacks, but as both settle in, this should be a great, close battle between an ascending star and an unlikely one. ... Ultimately, the Seahawks' defense gets a few timely stops, and Seattle leaves with its second championship. Pick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20\" 🏀 Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan among big winners in men's college basketball \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            So maybe it's not all doom and gloom for No. 14 Kansas and Kentucky. This weekend proved it. The Jayhawks topped No. 13 BYU, 90-82, and though the showdown between likely top-two picks Darryn Peterson (18 points in 20 scintillating minutes) and AJ Dybantsa (17 points) was cut short due to another Peterson injury, Bill Self should feel great about Melvin Council and Bryson Tiller carrying the load, Isaac Trotter writes. \nKentucky also got arguably its best win of the year, going into Fayetteville and knocking off No. 15 Arkansas (and former Kentucky coach John Calipari), 85-77. \"This is the kind of win that could turn things around,\" Cameron Salerno writes. Elsewhere in the SEC, Todd Golden and No. 19 Florida talked the talk and then walked the walk. Days after calling out Alabama and Nate Oats for playing Charles Bediako -- who signed multiple NBA contracts -- Golden saw his Gators wallop the Crimson Tide, 100-77. Don't look now, but the reigning champions are starting to get it together. We have weekend winners and losers from men's and women's basketball, and how about Michigan beating Michigan State in both?! \n 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Justin Rose set the Torrey Pines scoring record at 23 under to win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open.The 49ers hired Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator.Tuskegee basketball coach Benjy Taylor is considering legal action after a bizarre post-game incident during which he was temporarily placed in handcuffs following a loss at Morehouse.Cooper Flagg didn't get some calls down the stretch, and Jason Kidd was not happy.

    "body": "\n        The confetti has fallen at the AFC Championship Game in Denver and the NFC Championship Game in Seattle, and we now have our Super Bowl LX matchup: the AFC's second-seeded New England Patriots against the NFC's top-seeded Seattle Seahawks.When the two teams take the field at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8, it will mark the first Super Bowl in NFL history in which both starting quarterbacks (the Patriots' Drake Maye and the Seahawks' Sam Darnold) and both head coaches (the Patriots' Mike Vrabel and the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald) are in either their first or second season with their respective teams, per CBS Sports Research.Maye versus Darnold will also be just the third Super Bowl matchup in the past 40 years in which both quarterbacks entered the season with no playoff wins, joining the 1999 season's Kurt Warner vs. Steve McNair and the 2021 season's Matthew Stafford vs. Joe Burrow.The Patriots franchise returned for its NFL-record 12th Super Bowl appearance as the first team to reach the big game after a 13-plus loss season. (New England went 4-13 in 2024.) The Seahawks broke through for their fourth Super Bowl appearance and first since Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots in 2014.\nNew England made it rain in free agency, signing wide receiver Stefon Diggs, cornerback Carlton Davis, defensive lineman Milton Williams and edge rusher Harold Landry, while also drafting offensive lineman Will Campbell fourth overall. Those moves helped lift the Patriots back to the Super Bowl six seasons after Tom Brady's departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Seattle also reshaped its roster, swapping out Geno Smith for Sam Darnold at quarterback, elevating Jaxon Smith-Njigba to the WR1 spot after trading DK Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers, and signing Pro Bowl edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence and former Super Bowl MVP wide receiver Cooper Kupp in free agency. The changes helped the Seahawks reach Super Bowl heights once again.So what will happen in Super Bowl LX between the Patriots and Seahawks? Enjoy an early breakdown and prediction to kick off your two-week wait for the big game.\nWhere to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC, streaming on PeacockFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -4.5, O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)The old adage that \"defense wins championships\" doesn't always ring true, but it certainly has in the 2025 NFL season. Seattle finished with the league's No. 1 scoring defense in the regular season (17.2 points per game), while New England wasn't far behind, allowing 18.8 points per game, the fourth-fewest in the NFL.New England played a bend-but-don't-break style with the NFL's eighth-best total defense, allowing just 295.2 yards per game. Seattle's unit was led by both a top-10 pass rush (47 sacks, tied for the seventh-most) and a top-10 coverage group (77.9 passer rating allowed, fourth-best).Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald's defense could pose a litany of problems for Maye, the Patriots' 2025 second-team All-Pro quarterback, particularly when it comes to pass protection. Maye became the first quarterback ever to be sacked at least five times in three games in a single postseason, taking exactly five sacks in each AFC playoff game. \nHaving a leaky offensive line could doom him against 2025 second-team All-Pro defensive tackle Leonard Williams, Pro Bowl edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence, 2025 second-team All-Pro linebacker Ernest Jones and 2025 second-team All-Pro cornerback Devon Witherspoon. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the fourth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has endured plenty of rookie struggles in these playoffs. His three sacks allowed and nine quarterback pressures allowed are both the most in the NFL this postseason.Darnold led the league in turnovers with 20 in the regular season, but like Patriots archnemesis Eli Manning in 2007, he's found another level in the playoffs. Darnold has played turnover-free football through Seattle's divisional round and NFC title game wins, throwing for 470 total yards and four touchdowns while completing 69.8% of his passes (37 of 53).Now, he has a shot to complete a Manning-like path with a victory over the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Smith-Njigba, who led the NFL with 1,793 receiving yards in 2025, is clearly Seattle's go-to target, but he'll have a worthy adversary in Patriots Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez in Super Bowl LX.\nSuper Bowl 2026 prediction\nMaye and the Patriots winning three consecutive playoff games despite him absorbing five sacks in each one is a historic anomaly. Maye joined Tony Eason (1986) and Craig Krenzel (2004) as the only quarterbacks since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to win three straight games while taking five or more sacks in each, per CBS Sports Research.In Eason's case, his three-game streak of luck -- also with the Patriots -- came to an end with a 31-7 regular-season loss to the Cincinnati Bengals after he took six sacks in Week 14 of the 1986 season. As for Krenzel, a 41-10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 11 of the 2004 season followed his three-game run, and he took four sacks that day.Maye overcoming that level of poor pass protection for a fourth straight game to emerge victorious would be a historic first, and that just won't happen against the Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense. Seattle wins Super Bowl LX by multiple possessions.\nEarly pick: Seahawks 27, Patriots 13 | Seahawks -4.5, Under 46.5    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Somehow another NFL season is almost complete and in just a few weeks a champion will be crowned. Super Bowl 60 will be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers. The big game, known as Super Bowl LX for the purists, will take place on Sunday, Feb. 8, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.Levi's Stadium officially opened in July of 2014 and has a capacity of 68,500. The stadium has hosted numerous events including WrestleMania, their highest attended event, concerts, NFL games, MLS games, College Football Playoff contests and more.The New England Patriots will represent the AFC and it will be the Seattle Seahawks representing the NFC.Super Bowl LX will be the third Super Bowl in the San Francisco Bay Area and is the second at Levi's Stadium. The Broncos are the last team to win a Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium, doing so against the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 in 2016. \nThe other NFL championship in the area was Super Bowl XIX, which took place in 1985 at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California. That year, the 49ers defeated the Miami Dolphins, 38-16.California is about to host its 14th Super Bowl -- second to Florida's 17 -- which includes Super Bowl I in 1967. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10, in the game at the Los Angeles Coliseum.

    "body": "\n        If this year's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks is even half as good as the last time these two franchises met on this stage, it will be a wild ride. Eleven years after a Super Bowl XLIX thriller, the teams meet again with the Lombardi Trophy on the line.The Seahawks, similar to their previous Super Bowl trips, have been powered by one of the NFL's best defenses. Seattle allowed the fewest points in the league this season and finished first in yards per pass attempt allowed and yards per rush attempt allowed. The defense flexed its muscle in Seattle's 41-6 divisional-round win over the San Francisco 49ers, allowing a paltry 3.9 yards per play -- San Francisco's worst mark all season.But it was the offense that stepped up most in the NFC Championship Game. Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams, with 153 yards and a touchdown going to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kenneth Walker III had 111 yards from scrimmage and a score, and Cooper Kupp and Jake Bobo also found the end zone.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThough the offense was hit-or-miss down the stretch of the regular season, it seems to have found its footing in the playoffs and, crucially, has zero turnovers. Overall, Seattle has a plus-four turnover differential this postseason.\nSpeaking of turnovers, no one has forced more than New England this postseason, and it's not particularly close. The Patriots' defense has absolutely wreaked havoc, first against the Los Angeles Chargers, then the Houston Texans and finally, in the AFC Championship Game, the Denver Broncos. The Patriots' 8.7 points per game allowed is the fewest by any team through three playoff games since the vaunted 2000 Baltimore Ravens defense.The Patriots offense, which powered much of the team's regular-season success, hasn't fared as well. New England's 18.0 postseason points per game is the fewest entering a Super Bowl appearance since the 1979 Rams. Still, Drake Maye has made several big plays -- both with his arm and his legs -- and New England's firepower will certainly be a major test for Seattle's defense.Here's how to watch the game, followed by keys to the contest and a prediction.Super Bowl 60: Where to watch Seahawks vs. PatriotsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyTV: NBC, streaming on PeacockFollow: CBS Sports AppBetting odds: Seahawks -4.5 | O/U 45.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPatriots-Seahawks Super Bowl big questionsCan the Patriots force Sam Darnold into mistakes? For as good as Darnold has been this season -- and especially this postseason -- he does have a penchant for turnovers. In fact, his 20 turnovers this season were most in the NFL, and his 14 interceptions were third-most. Eight of those 14 turnovers happened when he was pressured, tied with Geno Smith for most in the NFL.\nNow (mostly) healthy, the Patriots' pass rush has been dominant this postseason with an NFL-best 52% pressure rate. For comparison's sake, the highest pressure rate during the regular season was 45% (by the Minnesota Vikings). The Seahawks have done a good job keeping Darnold clean for the most part, and play-caller Klint Kubiak does a good job of getting him out of the pocket via play-action and giving him easy answers. But Milton Williams, who had a big impact in last year's Super Bowl for the Philadelphia Eagles, K'Lavon Chaisson and other members of the New England front seven will hope to make an impact so talented cornerbacks Christian Gonzalez and Carlton Davis have a chance to make Darnold pay for a poor decision.\nCan the Patriots' offensive line hold up?The path for the underdogs to come out on top starts with getting to Darnold. The next step is protecting their own quarterback. Maye has taken five sacks in all three of his playoff games so far, and while that's come against three of the NFL's best defenses, it's not as if the Seahawks' unit is any easier. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald dials up a variety of different schemes and pressure looks, and he has both a disruptive duo inside (Leonard Williams, Byron Murphy II) and a plethora of edge rushers to generate pressure. When the Seahawks do get pressure, Maye has to be careful with the ball: He has six fumbles (three lost) this postseason, both most of any player.\nCan Maye hit the deep ball?The Seahawks' excellent cornerbacks play very aggressively, and it almost always works. The results speak for themselves.But if the offensive line holds up, Maye might have the opportunity for a deep ball or two, and he's been as good as anyone in those scenarios: His 35 completions at least 20 yards downfield this regular season were second-most in the NFL behind Matthew Stafford.Super Bowl 60 pick, prediction\nExpect some nerves early, especially from the quarterbacks, but as both settle in, this should be a great, close battle between an ascending star and an unlikely one.\nMaye is looking to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Darnold is looking to become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl after playing for at least five different teams.Ultimately, the Seahawks' defense gets a few timely stops, and Seattle leaves with its second championship.Pick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20\n            ",

The Green Bay defense has the tools to take away what Philadelphia does best also, with the second-best run defense at 89.4 yards allowed per game and the fewest passing yards per attempt (5.8) in the NFL. The model projects the Packers to win and cover in 54% of simulations. Back Green Bay at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Bulls to defeat the Spurs (+140)Chicago won six of its first seven games to open the new season, and although it has lost back-to-back contests, the Bulls return home, where they are 5-0 this season. Chicago has home victories over teams such as the Pistons, Knicks and 76ers, knocking off strong opponents on its home floor this year. Josh Giddey is nearly averaging a triple-double at 21.4 points, 9.6 rebounds and 9.3 assists per game this season. Those numbers increase to 23.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists at home this season, as the model projects the Bulls to win in 52% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back Chicago at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Santa Clara vs. Xavier: Under 157.5 points\"Herb Sendek has his Santa Clara shooting lots of three-balls as in recent seasons, but it remains to be seen if he has similar marksmen on the roster,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"In Friday's 79-67 win over McNeese, the Broncos hit 12 of 31 triples, though it took 5 of 8 from Villanova transfer guard Sash Gavalyugov to up the percentage. While SCU's not quite a well-oiled machine yet, Xavier surely isn't for its new HC Richard Pitino (whose dad Rick once had Sendek on his staff).

These are two of the seven remaining NFL teams with just two losses, as both sit atop their respective NFC divisions. Philadelphia (6-2) is coming off a bye and knocked off the New York Giants, 38-20, in Week 8. Green Bay (5-2-1) had its three-game win streak come to an end on Sunday as the Pack fell to the Carolina Panthers 16-13.

The Eagles have won three straight versus Green Bay, and Philadelphia has a rest advantage in coming off a bye. The Eagles are 4-0 outright after a bye under coach Nick Sirianni, and 4-0 is also the team's record as an underdog since the start of last season.The Eagles had their best offensive performance in their last game, with season highs in points (38), total yards (427), passing touchdowns (4) and rushing yards (276). That came without the injured A.J. Brown, though he is expected to return on Monday. Philly's offense leads the NFL in two very important metrics -- it has the fewest giveaways in the league and it tops the league in redzone scoring. The former will be magnified by the fact that Green Bay has the fewest takeaways in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Packers can coverComing off a loss as 13.5-point favorites versus Carolina is sure to motivate Green Bay on Monday, and it also has confidence in having the backing of Lambeau Field. The Packers have won six straight home games on Mondays, with an average margin of victory of +13.6 points over this streak. Additionally, they have an 18-6 all-time record versus the Eagles at home, including winning the last Lambeau meeting in 2020.Matt LaFleur has the best cover percentage (66%) by any head coach in primetime this century, going 23-12-1 against the spread. The 2025 Packers boast top-eight rankings in total yards, passing offense and third-down offense while the defense is also carrying its weight. Green Bay shuts down the pass, allowing the fewest yards per attempt and fewest yards per completion, while Micah Parsons and co. rank in the top 10 in pressure rate. That pass rush could cause problems for an Eagles offense that ranks 28th in third-down conversion percentage. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Eagles vs. Packers picksFor Packers vs. Eagles on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 44 combined points.

This game will be the ultimate crossover for former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. He graduated from West Point and began his head coaching career with Army before taking the job with the Blue Devils in 1980. The last time the Blue Devils played at West Point was 1997. The Blue Devils are entering a new era after reigning CBS Sports National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg departed to the NBA. Duke is led by star freshman Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. He is coming off his best performance of the season after posting 25 points in a blowout win over Western Carolina. Army is led by Kevin McCarthy and Jackson Furman, who both enter this matchup averaging 16 points per game.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        New York Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson will miss more time during an injury-plagued season with his second knee issue of the campaign. According to ESPN, the star wideout is expected to miss at least three to four weeks with a knee sprain, which he sustained in Sunday's win over the Cleveland Browns. The silver lining is that Wilson will not require surgery, thus aiding in the likelihood that he returns before the end of the regular season.The looming absence will mark Wilson's second multi-week recovery of the year. He sat out of the Jets' Week 7 and Week 8 games due to a hyperextended knee and returned after the team's bye week. It was just one game back on the field for the former first-round pick, though, before he landed back on the shelf with another ailment.Wilson left in the second half on Sunday and did not return to the game. He limped off the field after an attempted diving catch, and coach Aaron Glenn confirmed after the victory that Wilson suffered another injury to the same knee that hampered him earlier in the year.The early exit kept Wilson out of the box score as he did not haul in any of his three targets for catches. It was a quiet day for the Jets' passing game as a whole. Quarterback Justin Fields completed six passes for 54 yards, and all but 12 of those yards came on one connection with running back Breece Hall.\nWilson's injury comes at an inopportune time for the Jets, who have momentum for the first time this year. New York won each of its last two games, reversing its fortunes after a dreadful 0-7 start. And it did so in a couple of different fashions, leaning on its offense in a 39-38 shootout with the Cincinnati Bengals and relying on its defense in a 27-20 battle with the Browns.The multiple absences will likely prevent Wilson from reaching the 1,000-yard mark this season. If that is the case, it will be the first time in his four years as a pro that he does not crack that threshold. His four touchdowns, however, are the second-most of his career.\nIf Wilson misses just three games, he would be back in the lineup for the Jets' Dec. 7 matchup with the Miami Dolphins. A four-game spell would have him return for a Dec. 14 trip to face the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL's great promise is its parity, a theory the Kansas City Current downright rejected as the runaway winners of the Shield, commanding a 21 point lead between first and second place at the conclusion of the regular season. The Current's surprise elimination by Gotham FC on Sunday, though, means it just might be anyone's game as the postseason reaches its penultimate stage, setting up for an intriguing final batch of games this season.At this point, the NWSL Championship just might be the Washington Spirit's to lose, partially by default as the highest seed left in the playoffs. It would not be hard to envision a single one of the semifinalists winning the whole thing, each of them heavyweights in their own right – the Orlando Pride, Gotham, the Portland Thorns and the Spirit are the last four NWSL champions. The quartet feel as evenly matched as it gets, though – none of the remaining teams enter the semifinals in perfect shape, but have demonstrated an ability to problem solve with the talented players that they have.Here's a look at where each team stands as they target a spot in the NWSL Championship on Nov. 22 at San Jose's PayPal Park.NWSL Playoffs semifinal scheduleAll times U.S./EasternSaturday, Nov. 15Washington Spirit vs. Portland Thorns, 12 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)\nSunday, Nov. 16Orlando Pride vs. Gotham FC, 3 p.m. (ABC, ESPN+)4. Portland ThornsThe Portland Thorns have punched above their weight all season long, rising all the way to a third place finish and booking a berth in the playoff semifinals. They have reached these heights because of an overreliance on midfielder Sam Coffey, who has often made up for her team's defensive vulnerabilities during a career-best season. The Thorns may finally be peaking at the right time, though – Olivia Moultrie's run of eight goals and one assist in her last 11 games for club and country gives her side an attacking edge that they have missed at times this season.3. Orlando PrideThe Orlando Pride's end product has slowed since Barbra Banda sustained a season-ending hip injury in August, scoring just 11 goals in the 10 regular season games she missed down the stretch. The good news for the Pride, though, is that they are well-positioned to survive the issue – they won the NWSL Championship a year ago with a gritty 1-0 win over the Spirit, opting to absorb the opponent's pressure after taking an early lead. Reigning defender of the year Emily Sams remains a fixture in the back line, while Lizbeth Ovalle has settled in well and ranks inside the NWSL's top 10 for chances created since Banda's injury.2. Gotham FCIt has been an imperfect season for Gotham but in their 2-1 win over the Current in the quarterfinals, they found a response to the doubts they have faced in recent months. They have been overreliant on MVP candidate Esther Gonzalez, who has scored around 40% of the team's goals this season, but their depth paid off against the Current. Jaedyn Shaw has been a game-changer since her September arrival, showcasing her skill yet again with a goal on Sunday, while Katie Stengel proved to be a surprise hero with the last-gasp game winner in Kansas City. Like the Thorns, they may also have hit their stride at the right time – and could really challenge the Pride's stingy defense if Gonzalez is able to participate in the semifinals.\n1. Washington SpiritThe Spirit's playoff run has centered around Trinity Rodman's availability following an MCL sprain, her return potentially imminent if her recovery has gone as expected. Until Rodman's prognosis suggests otherwise, the Spirit are the team to beat, especially since she is buoyed by Gift Monday and Croix Bethune. Without Rodman, though, the Spirit are a very different team – they have just four wins in 12 matches without her and their goal difference swings from +13 when she is on the field to -3 when she is not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles will visit the Green Bay Packers on 'Monday Night Football' to conclude NFL Week 10 at 8:15 p.m. ET. The over/under is 45 points as temperatures will sit around freezing come kickoff time. Big names like Jalen Hurts, Jordan Love, Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs will be popular options to populate NFL DFS lineups in this matchup of Super Bowl contenders. Deep threat Christian Watson, meanwhile, is averaging 71.5 receiving yards in his two games since being activated off IR and has seemingly leapfrogged rookie Matthew Golden, who is questionable (shoulder) for this game, on the depth chart. Watson could be one of those 'Monday Night Football' DFS picks whose production far exceeds his NFL DFS price tags, so should be a big part of your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Packers vs. Eagles on 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The reigning Super Bowl MVP is having the most efficient year of his six-year career, with career highs in passer rating, completion percentage and touchdown-to-interception ratio. His best two games of the season have been his last two, in which he combined for seven touchdown passes and no turnovers.On SNF, he'll face a Packers defense which has the second-fewest takeaways, so you likely don't have to worry about Hurts losing you any Fantasy points. He should also rack up plenty of points, considering Green Bay has allowed four of the last five QBs it has faced to pass for multiple touchdowns. Also, Hurts has a positive history versus the Packers as he had a pair of two-touchdown games versus Green Bay in last year's regular plus postseason. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers tight end Luke Musgrave. He becomes Green Bay's No. 1 tight end with the season-ending ACL injury to Tucker Kraft, and Kraft entered Week 10 as the Fantasy TE1 which shows how important this position is to Green Bay's offense. Musgrave and Kraft were both drafted by the Packers in 2023, and Musgrave was taken earlier, which indicates how highly the team thinks of him.Playing in just 46.2% of snaps last week, Musgrave had three catches for 34 yards. He could see twice as many snaps going forward as Kraft routinely played over 90% of snaps in games this year. With the Eagles holding their last two opponents to under 90 rushing yards, Green Bay may lean more on the pass, raising Musgrave's NFL DFS value.

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings committed eight false start penalties in Sunday's 27-19 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, good for the most by a home team in the last 16 NFL seasons. It was a stunning lack of discipline that affected players across the offense, both on the offensive line and at the skill positions. Vikings running back Aaron Jones suggested there was something more nefarious at play than lapses in focus from his teammates.Jones said the Ravens' defense made calls and movements at the line of scrimmage designed to draw the Vikings into pre-snap penalties. He said they were also \"playing a little game there\" with snap counts.\"They're making move calls up front, so sometimes it sounds like it could be J.J. (McCarthy) saying 'hut,'\" Jones said after the loss. \"They're making move calls and you see them stem. So they're trying to get them to jump, as well.\"Jones, notably, was the only Vikings player to allege that the Ravens' defense was at least partially to blame for the infractions. Minnesota head coach Kevin O'Connell pushed back on the claim and directed the blame toward his offense.\nThe use of disconcerting signals, whether verbal or physical, is prohibited. It is punishable by a 15-yard penalty. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh denied that his team did anything outside of the rulebook.\"One of the players said that,\" Harbaugh said on Monday. \"I read five other players and the head coach said, 'no.' But it did catch my attention, yes. So I went back and I watched it. We didn't have a game plan for that. If we did, I would have been happy. But we're not going to do anything illegal. If you stem, you make a move call. You're allowed to say 'move.' You're not allowed to say 'set' or 'hut' or anything else or a cadence, which we never have done.\"But then I watched all of them, and none of them did we stem. Not one did we move. … They were doing a lot of on-two, trying to draw us offsides. And then they were doing some shifts where they could uncover man/zone and try to see what we were in. They jumped a few times when they were doing that to try to get to their alerts and their change of plays. So, like Coach O'Connell said, it wasn't anything we were doing.\"\nUnforced errors plagued the Vikings in the loss, as they committed 13 total penalties for 102 yards. Eight of the penalties and 40 of the yards came from false starts. Minnesota's offense also coughed up the ball three times, twice by way of interceptions and once with a fumble.\n            ",

She is no longer in a boot but is still working toward full recovery. Betts, the No. 2 player of the 247Sports class of 2025 rankings, got injured during a scrimmage against UC Riverside on Oct. 19 and has yet to make her college debut. She has been doing individual work during practices, but has still not been cleared for contact. Betts and the training staff are taking her recovery day by day and haven't announced a specific timeline for her return.Despite not playing a game yet, the 6-foot-4 forward is expected to be an impactful part of the roster. Betts is the younger sister of UCLA star center Lauren Betts, but she brings her own skillset and talent. Sienna averaged 23 points and 16.5 rebounds per game during her senior year at Grandview High School in Colorado, and Close has talked about how her \"challenger\" personality will help make the team even more competitive.\nThe Bruins are fresh off their first-ever NCAA Tournament Final Four appearance, and the expectations remain high this season. The matchup against Oklahoma will be a good test for both teams because the Sooners are coming off of their first Sweet 16 appearance in over a decade. One of the biggest storylines of this game was supposed to be Betts playing against No. 1 freshman Aaliyah Chavez, but that encounter will have to wait a little longer. Five Bruins have averaged double figures in the first two games, led by Gabriela Jaquez and Lauren Betts. Meanwhile, Oklahoma has four double-digit scorers with leader Reagan Beers averaging 29 points per contest. There will be a lot of talent on the court, and the venue also makes this matchup stand out. The game will take place at Golden 1 Center, which will host the Sacramento Regional of the 2026 NCAA Tournament.\nNo. 3 UCLA vs. No. 6 Oklahoma is set for Monday at 10:30 p.m. ET on Fox Sports. \n            \n    ",

Among the biggest are Sunday, when the AFC West co-leading Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams face off as Sam Darnold looks to guide the Seahawks past Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Anothr key divisional matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos in a pivotal AFC West meeting. The Rams are -2.5 favorites, while Kansas City is favored by -3.5 points on the road.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications features the Detroit Lions against the Philadelphia Eagles. Philadelphia has won the last two meetings, the last a 38-35 triumph in 2022. Sunday's largest spreads are -8.5 points by both the Green Bay Packers over the New York Giants and the Baltimore Ravens over the Cleveland Browns. The Giants, who fired head coach Brian Daboll on Monday, may be without quarterback Jaxson Dart after he suffered a concussion in Sunday's loss to the Bears. If he can't go, Russell Wilson may get the start. The slimmest spread has the Eagles by 1.5 points over the Lions.

    "body": "\n        The work Jedd Fisch accomplished in his first two seasons at Washington, and his propensity to move from one job to another, made him a popular name on the 2025 college football coaching carousel. His alma mater, Florida, is in search of a new coach, which only adds to the speculation that he could bolt from Seattle early in his tenure. Fisch was vocal about his status with the Huskies amid the numerous ongoing coaching searches across the country.While he did not explicitly state his disinterest in other jobs, Fisch made it clear in a lengthy statement that he very much enjoys his position at Washington.\"Those lists are made by people that have no idea what's going on, honestly,\" Fisch said Monday of those speculating about his future. \"They don't know what's happening in our program. They have no idea how excited I am about the youth in our program. They have no idea how excited I am about the fact that we're playing six or seven true freshmen. No idea how excited I am about the fact that Demond Williams, I believe, has a chance over the next year or two years after this to be one of the all-time best quarterbacks that have come through this area.\"If Fisch were to leave Washington after just two seasons, Florida would be the obvious destination. Fisch graduated from Florida in 1998 and landed a job on Steve Spurrier's staff in 1999 as a graduate assistant, making his college coaching debut with the Gators. His ties to the university are deep and provide fuel to the intrigue of a potential return to the Sunshine State.\n\"I don't think that they would know how I enjoy coaching here, that we've spent a ton of money into building this program the way we want to build it, that I had a great hand in all the facilities,\" Fisch said. \"I was a big part of making the decisions on how we wanted to recreate this space to give our players an unbelievable opportunity to have a recovery room that they never had, working on making sure that they have the best nutrition they could possibly have, give them great new meeting rooms, new office spaces for our coaches.\"Beyond Florida, Fisch could be an attractive candidate for a number of the other open jobs across the nation. He has spent time in effectively every region of the country throughout his college and NFL coaching careers, and after resurrecting the Arizona program in short order and positioning Washington for College Football Playoff contention in Year 2, his limited track record as a head coach speaks for itself.\"I think, unfortunately, what happens is they just want to tie coaches to lists,\" Fisch said, \"and then we have to sit there and defend it rather than just be able to just tell our fans -- our players, our coaching staff, myself, my family, we love coaching at the University of Washington.\n\"The ridiculousness of people that want to claim that because my wife and daughters are living in Arizona, because I have a 16-year-old who's been in five different schools in the last eight years to finish her high school, has anything to do with my decision. Or the ridiculousness of just putting my name on a list just to do it. Not only does that affect recruiting, it affects our team, it affects our staff. My hope is that our players, our coaches, our families understand how much we love it at Washington.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tempers erupted in college football this past weekend, igniting on-field brawls and postgame confrontations that led to numerous player suspensions, institutional fines and a season-ending decision at the Division III level.The SWAC announced disciplinary actions Monday following a halftime altercation between Bethune-Cookman and Grambling State on Saturday. Video footage captured players from both teams exchanging punches and being thrown along the benches as coaching staff struggled to restore order.\"We're extremely disappointed by the events that transpired during halftime of the Bethune-Cookman at Grambling State football game,\" SWAC commissioner Dr. Charles McClelland said in a release. \"Acts of that nature have zero place in the Southwestern Athletic Conference and intercollegiate athletics. The Conference Office has and will continue to enforce a zero-tolerance policy for all acts deemed to be unsportsmanlike and contrary to the high standard of good sportsmanship we expect from all individuals associated with the athletics programs within our league.\"A total of 27 players -- nine from Bethune-Cookman and 18 from Grambling State -- were suspended, with three receiving two-game suspensions for particularly severe conduct. However, specific names were not given. Additionally, fines of $25,000 and $40,000 were levied against Bethune-Cookman and Grambling State, respectively.\nGrambling State coach Mickey Joseph defended his players after the 31-23 win, suggesting that Bethune-Cookman's delayed exit from the locker room contributed to the escalation.\"That's the disrespect stuff,\" Joseph said, via KNOE-TV's Clay Witt. \"We're not going to tolerate disrespect here at Grambling. You won't disrespect us. We're going to meet disrespect with disrespect.\"On Monday, Joseph clarified in a prepared statement that his comments were not meant to condone violence.\nTexas State-Louisiana postgame scuffle results in 13 player suspensionsThe Sun Belt handed down several suspensions after a postgame confrontation following Louisiana's 42-39 win against Texas State. The conflict began during the final offensive plays and intensified as players and coaches gathered for postgame handshakes, ultimately spilling into the stadium tunnel.\nTexas State had six players suspended, including defensive end Tymere Jackson for two games. Louisiana suspended seven players, with safety Tyree Skipper sidelined for the remainder of the season, including any potential bowl game.Louisiana suspensions:Tyree Skipper*, safety (remainder of the 2025 season including any potential bowl game)Kaliep Edwards, linebacker (1 game)Courtline Flowers*, safety (1 game)Kody Jackson, safety (1 game)Collin Jacob, safety (1 game)De'Antonio Lesueur, defensive lineman (1 game)Evan Stroman, wide receiver (1 game)Texas State suspensions:Tymere Jackson*, defensive end (2 games)Khamari Terrell*, cornerback (1 game)Justin DeLeon*, offensive line (1 game)Kyran Bourda, defensive line (1 game)J.P. Deeter, defensive line (1 game)Devarrick Woods, defensive line (1 game)* denotes starterThe altercation has left both programs dealing with fallout from the incident while trying to chase bowl eligibility in the final weeks of the season.\n\"We got some preliminary stuff that we're trying to sort through, trying to appeal some of them,\" Louisiana coach Michael Desormeaux said Monday. \"I just think it's really hard. I mean you get attacked and I don't know how you're supposed to respond. I don't understand how this wasn't cleared up before once it broke the first time I don't understand how we didn't get people off the field. I just don't understand how this happened.\"Louisiana's next game is scheduled at Arkansas State on Nov. 20, while Texas State travels to Southern Mississippi on Saturday.ODAC ends Guilford, Averett seasons after postgame altercationAt the Division III level, the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) made the unprecedented decision to end the football seasons of Guilford College and Averett University following a postgame altercation this past Saturday. Both schools will forfeit their remaining game, with opponents Bridgewater College and Roanoke College having the opportunity to play against each other to complete their season.\n\"While competition is at the heart of what we do, the integrity with which we compete defines who we are,\" ODAC commissioner Brad Bankston said in a release. \"The actions following Saturday's contest did not reflect those values, and this decision underscores our commitment to maintaining the standards our conference represents. I want to thank both schools for their cooperation and open dialogue in reaching this decision.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As Arne Slot was laying out what needs to happen before his side can even start thinking about a title race, it was hard to shake the sense that you'd heard this all before. Not, it should be noted, from Slot himself. Before this almighty slide, he had never had to set his team the target of \"result after result after result.\"In doing so, however, he cast this particular mind (London warped, watches too much Arsenal) back 364 days to what seemed to be the all too early end point of another title challenge. Mikel Arteta had just seen his side cede further ground to the leaders with a 2-2 draw at Chelsea. He too insisted now was not the time to discuss a title race that so many had expected them to be key riders in, that all his side could do from here on out was \"win, win, win, win, win, win, win and win.\"History records that Arsenal did not manage to do as their manager commanded. Indeed, only twice did they \"win, win, win.\" A point further from the top than the eight-point hole Liverpool find themselves, Arteta's side never regained the ground they had given up in the first third of the season. The standards they set themselves were too vertiginous. One wobble begot another; the gap felt too wide and players couldn't help but let their focus drift to the competitions they were still alive in.Already you can see how that might be a template for Liverpool in 2025-26. Between now and Christmas, their league fixtures look rather more favorable but it only takes a rough trip to the London Stadium or some off color finishing against Robin Roefs and there's a chance for Arsenal and Manchester City to push away.\nAs Andrew Robertson acknowledged, what comes next could be an almighty slog. \"We've given ourselves a huge uphill battle,\" he said after the 3-0 loss at the Etihad, \"but I don't think any of the teams will really look at the league table until we're halfway through. That's what we've got to do but we've got to pick up points on a more consistent basis. Then let's see where we are after Christmas time or whatever. We've just got to focus on ourselves and focus on performance levels.\"I don't think you can talk about the title this early on in the season, regardless of what position you're in, but you need to then consistently start winning games again for that to even come into question. It's definitely not a question that's getting spoken about in the changing room or anything. We just need to get back to the levels that we know we can, the levels that we brought the last two games in particular. If we do that on a more regular basis, then we pick up more points than we won't.\"Selection troublesSomething needs to change drastically with Liverpool. That may start on a tactical level. Slot went back to last season's template with great success against Aston Villa and Real Madrid last week, wins which delivered two of the meager four clean sheets this side have kept in 17 games. It is worth noting that the man himself had spoken of his qualms that that particular approach might have been figured out by opponents at the end of last season. After all, the champions have lost 40 percent of their games since Paris Saint-Germain slipped by them in the Champions League. The problems might have been exacerbated, for now, by the hierarchy's actions in the window but that's the point. They were there.\nThat much was apparent as City brushed them aside. To many it would have seemed like Liverpool lacked the stomach for the fight, that the events of the preceding eight days had taken too much out of them, a worrying sign indeed given that their hosts had played 24 hours later. Instead Slot laid the blame for the first half struggles on himself. \n        \n            \n                Liverpool's title defense over? Loss to Man City after Real Madrid win in UCL showcases alarming inconsistency\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's easy for players to win their duels if the game plan and the tactics are working and I think that's what it did against Villa and what it did against Madrid,\" he said. \"We struggled now a lot with them bringing so many players into the centre of the pitch and it was difficult then for some of our players to make the right decisions. It wasn't about my players not wanting to make the duel, they had to run a lot because [City] were so much better on the ball than us.\"Out of possession, Liverpool tend to defend in something between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-2-4, depending on whether Dominik Szoboszlai is pushed up into the front line of the press. In the first half, City found the holes in that with supreme efficiency, Rayan Cherki drifting infield to give his side at least four options to stretch apart Liverpool's three, Erling Haaland also dropping off the front line on occasion to add more ballast. Liverpool could only respond by chucking more and more bodies into midfield positions, in doing so, leaving Conor Bradley defenseless as Jeremy Doku put him in the blender. \nNow there are only a handful of teams who can do to Liverpool what a near-peak efficiency City did. Not many of them play in the Premier League. If, for instance, Nuno Espirito Santo fancies packing the middle with Tomas Souceks and James Ward-Prowses in three weeks' time then that will probably be a win for Slot. This is, however, only one of a few ways to skin this particular Liverpool cat.There is certainly a bit of misfortune in their record of dead-ball concession, seven goals against from 3.4 xG, but Slot's seeming dismissal of Nico Gonzalez's goal, City's second, as nothing more than \"a set piece\" was alarming. Teams are allowed to defend these and it was alarming how poorly prepared Liverpool seemed when their opponent manoeuvred a corner around with a few short passes.Those comparisons to last season's Arsenal rear their heads when you consider the injuries, too. Certainly, Liverpool haven't yet been dogged by the sort of relentless blows that hit the Gunners later on in 2024-25 but at this stage of last season that wasn't the issue for the title challengers. They had really just lost one load-bearing figure in their structure, Martin Odegaard, who limped back from an ankle injury too soon because the attack just couldn't get going without him.\nIn Liverpool's case, you sub in not Alexander Isak (though it might help to have him competing with Hugo Ekitike now the Frenchman has gone off the boil) but Alisson. Giorgi Mamardashvili has performed ably since stepping in between the sticks, not least in saving Haaland's penalty, but he is not the best one vs. one goalkeeper of his generation. Nor does he have Alisson's ball-playing skills, the sweeping skills that can push a defensive line five yards up the pitch nor an authority that radiates beyond the backline. At a time when so many of the totems of last season's title win are askew -- the Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk axis, Alexis Mac Allister, Mohamed Salah -- they need the transformative impact of the best goalkeeper in the game.Can Liverpool get 'result after result?'If nothing else, it would help no end to have a truly elite goalkeeper while they are as vulnerable down the flanks as they have been so far this season. Right now, there is not much of a case to be made that Liverpool can get \"result after result,\" given how their defensive standards have slipped this season. Once more, the parallels with old Arsenal are striking, perhaps even a bit more pronounced. Eleven games into the campaign, Arteta's side had gone from holding teams to an exceptional 0.69 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) per game to 1.03. Liverpool too have faltered, allowing a rot that began to set in around March to carry on into a season where they are allowing 1.12 npxG per game. To consistently deliver title-winning results with those sort of underlying defensive metrics requires one of the greatest attacks in the sport. Liverpool don't have that. They have scored 18 in 11 Premier League games, good for sixth most, and have 17.25 npxG, seventh best. When that gives you an npxG difference that that is only the fifth best in the league at 0.44 per game, you aren't profiling as a team that is going to go on a run. The narrative arc of this season might feel like Arsenal's but the data is closer to 2024-25 Aston Villa, who would go on to pick up 48 points from their remaining 27 games of the season. Suffice to say they never got \"result after result after result.\"\nThat was in a division that might have been more stratified than this season's. The story of the first 11 games of the season is, as Slot put it, \"one team is quite far ahead ... the rest is quite close.\" There is no great gap in npxG difference either. From Liverpool at 4.88 to Tottenham at -4.26 there are 14 teams. Perhaps only Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley are legitimately bad this season. Take out maybe half the gimme games there were last year and it becomes so much harder to get on a roll. On paper, Liverpool face teams ranked 18th and 19th immediately after the international break and then two newly promoted sides. In reality, both West Ham and Nottingham Forest look to be toughening up under veteran coaches well versed in defend and counter play. Leeds on an Elland Road night sounds like a tough task too, Sunderland might not be the same force away from the Stadium of Light but would you bet on them not giving Liverpool a bloody nose after what they did to Arsenal?It felt the same for the Gunners 12 months ago after all. They thought they'd got through the hard part and that succour was on the horizon. Instead they ended up as living proof that even title contenders can't flick a switch and \"win, win, win.\" If that is true of Liverpool, then their title race is already run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's easy to see why some Washington Commanders fans are uneasy. A young, electric quarterback wins Offensive Rookie of the Year, energizes a franchise, then suffers a major injury against the Seattle Seahawks -- on nearly the same patch of grass where Robert Griffin III's career-altering moment unfolded more than a decade ago. But Griffin isn't buying the idea that history is repeating itself as it relates to Jayden Daniels.The parallels are striking -- the same stadium, the same opponent, even the same down and yard line, just on opposite ends of the field. Jayden Daniels' dislocated elbow in Week 9 brought back memories. Yet Griffin was quick to push back, calling the comparisons mere coincidence.\"Nope,\" Griffin said on his podcast. \"I am a positive thinker. I believe he will bounce back, as long as they give him the proper amount of time to fully heal. Everyone keeps mentioning me on social media, going into all these diatribes about how they're comparing my situation to Jayden Daniels, but they're really not even close to the same.\"Griffin, who won Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2012, suffered a series of right knee injuries that season, beginning with a sprained LCL after taking a direct hit from Baltimore Ravens lineman Haloti Ngata in Week 14. Though he missed only one game, the injury lingered into the postseason. In an NFC wild-card game against Seattle, Griffin's knee buckled on a bad snap, leaving him crumpled on the turf. The damage -- torn ACL and LCL ligaments requiring reconstructive surgery -- effectively marked the beginning of the end of one of the most promising rookie campaigns in league history.Daniels, by contrast, appears to have avoided that kind of long-term setback. The 24-year-old dislocated his left elbow in Washington's 38-14 loss to the Seahawks but escaped ligament damage and will not require surgery. The Commanders plan to re-evaluate him after their Week 12 bye rather than place him on injured reserve -- a scenario that amounts to the best-case outcome for a scary-looking injury.\nGriffin described Washington's environment as one of the biggest differences between his experience and that of Daniels.\"There's no infighting in this organization,\" Griffin said. \"The head coach and the owner aren't fighting about who they want the quarterback to be, how they want the offense to be run, who's supposed to be in charge.\"Under new owner Josh Harris, general manager Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn, Washington's leadership structure is far more unified than during Griffin's time. The front office also built a veteran support system around Daniels -- including offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, receiver Terry McLaurin, tight end Zach Ertz and linebacker Bobby Wagner -- creating the kind of stability Griffin rarely enjoyed.\n\"I can understand the concern and the injury and how that makes Washington fans have PTSD about what happened in 2012 going into 2013,\" Griffin said. \"But Jayden Daniels' story is not like mine.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Missouri State will petition the NCAA for a postseason waiver that would allow its football team to play in a bowl game this season, despite rules blocking first-year FBS programs, CBS Sports has learned.\"We know the history of what that looks like, and it's traditionally not been looked at favorably, but we will be petitioning, and we'll see where that goes,\" Missouri State athletics director Patrick Ransdell told CBS Sports on Monday. \"We'll let the chips fall where they fall.\"The Bears (6-3, 4-1 Conference USA) reached the six-win threshold for bowl eligibility in dramatic fashion Saturday, rallying past Liberty on Jacob Clark's 13-yard touchdown pass to Tristan Gardner with 27 seconds remaining. However, NCAA rules prohibit postseason participation for teams transitioning from the FCS to the FBS.Teams in transition are prohibited from postseason events for two years, including their final season in the FCS. The probationary period enables athletic departments to implement improvements and meet specific criteria to compete in the FBS, including expanding scholarship opportunities and enhancing facilities.\nRansdell believes the logic is \"antiquated\" and the rule should be changed.\"In today's world, you can reinvent your team in a matter of weeks. It's just something that's dated,\" he said. \"If we're really in the business for student-athletes and the betterment of the student-athlete experience, there's no reason we should be punishing the student-athletes who are working hard day in, day out and deprive them of a postseason opportunity when there's really no good reason to do that.\"Missouri State and Delaware both jumped from the FCS to the FBS this year and joined Conference USA. As part of the transition, both were required to skip the 2024 FCS playoffs.There is a secondary path to the postseason: if fewer than 82 teams reach bowl eligibility, the NCAA can pull transitioning programs into the bowl pool to fill open slots. Fifty-nine teams have already reached six wins heading into the final three weeks, and another 19 sit at five victories.\n\"A lot of our guys came back knowing the challenges because they believe in what we're doing, what coach (Ryan) Beard and his staff are preaching,\" Ransdell said. \"To be able to reward these guys with a post-season opportunity, I don't care if it's in Anchorage, Alaska. You throw the ball down, we'll play.\"In 2023, three programs transitioning to the FBS had their postseason waivers denied by the NCAA, including James Madison, which started 10-0 and climbed to No. 18 in the AP Top 25 poll. The Virginia Attorney General even threatened legal action.JMU and Jacksonville State were ultimately allowed to play in bowl games because of a lack of bowl-eligible teams. Missouri State could also receive a bowl invitation in December if fewer than 82 teams are eligible.\nMissouri State has not conducted discussions with lawmakers. \"We'll obviously keep our options open, but you would like to think that cooler heads prevail and you figure out a good solution that's good for everybody,\" Ransdell said. \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"Missouri State's revenue has doubled year over year during its first fall in the FBS, Ransdell said, and football attendance is expected to increase as much as 40% in the first year.\"This last year of transition and playing an FBS schedule is nothing short of exhilarating,\" Ransdell said. \"So to be able to go to a bowl game in Year 1 would be amazing and something that I really think would help springboard us into future years. It allows you to hopefully get some sense of consistency in a world where consistency is really, really hard.\"\nRansdell said the school will file the petition with the NCAA within one week.\n            ",

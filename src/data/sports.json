    "body": "\nMonday night's College Football Playoff National Championship Game between No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami shapes up as a grueling, physical battle between two teams that have embraced that identity all season. The unbeaten Hoosiers are trying to become college football's first 16-0 national champion, but they must get past a resurgent Hurricanes team playing on its home field.Miami's path has been anything but easy. The Hurricanes knocked off No. 7 Texas A&M on the road, eliminated No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl and outlasted No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl to reach the title game. Powered by a massive offensive line, Miami has created running lanes for Mark Fletcher Jr. while quarterback Carson Beck distributes the ball to elite playmakers such as Malachi Toney, giving the Hurricanes a balanced, efficient attack.First-year defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman has elevated Miami's defense into one of the nation's best, bringing to life fourth-year coach Mario Cristobal's vision of a big, punishing roster. Still, the question remains whether that physicality is enough to test Indiana.The Hoosiers have overwhelmed everyone in their path, blasting No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl and dismantling No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl. With Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza at the controls and no obvious weaknesses on the roster, Indiana enters as a more-than-touchdown favorite.Second-year coach Curt Cignetti has orchestrated one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history, putting Indiana on the brink of its first national championship.Where to watch Miami vs. IndianaDate: Monday, Jan.

Indiana\n                    \n    \n    Tom Fornelli: At what point does everybody start listening to what Indiana's been telling them all season? It has blown out Alabama and Oregon in consecutive playoff games and comes into the championship in much better shape than the Miami Hurricanes do health-wise. I don't expect we see a blowout along the lines of what the Rose and Peach Bowls provided, but I do expect the outcome will be clear before the fourth quarter starts. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 13Shehan Jeyarajah: Indiana has been a perfect football team in 2025, and it will ultimately end with an elusive first national championship. It won't come easy. Miami's top-rated defensive line will force mistakes, including at least one turnover from Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza. However, Mendoza's legend will be cemented with a fourth-quarter touchdown to ice the game and deliver the Hoosiers an unlikely title. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 17David Cobb: Miami's offensive line is sturdy enough to prevent Indiana's defensive front from completely taking over, a necessity if the Hurricanes hope to stay within striking distance. On the other side, Miami has enough punch up front -- led by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akeem Mesidor -- to make the Hoosiers uncomfortable at times. Ultimately, Indiana looks like a team of destiny and should win outright. But Miami is capable of turning this into a fight. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 20Chris Hummer: Miami is playing a national championship game at home. What a story. What an opportunity. What a moment. The Hurricanes can't lose it, right? Well ... here comes Indiana. It feels ridiculous to type that with a 15-0 Indiana. It's Indiana! History tells us this isn't possible, but Curt Cignetti has created a monster in Bloomington. They're the most well-coached, most disciplined and best team in the country. Plus, they have a Heisman Trophy-winning QB and, if you talk to coaches around the sport, have a roster that athletically matches up with anyone. As crazy as it feels to write, I'm picking Indiana to win a national championship. How could I not? Maybe Miami finds a bit more magic at home. But this has been the season of Indiana. As long as Indiana's o-line can hold up on the edges, it wins this game. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 24, Miami 21Who will win and cover in Indiana vs. Miami? SportsLine's computer model just simulated the College Football Playoff National Championship Game 10,000 times and projects that one side will cover well over 50% of the time. Visit SportsLine to find out who it is.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll into their second week with the divisional round NFL schedule on Saturday and Sunday. Underdogs went 4-2 against the spread on Wild Card Weekend, which could certainly affect where you lean with your divisional round NFL picks. The No. 1 seeds take the field on Saturday with Broncos vs. Bills (+1.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. 49ers (+7) at 8 p.m. ET. Buffalo defeated Denver in the postseason last year, while San Fran and Seattle split their two matchups this season.Sunday divisional round NFL bets would then center on Patriots vs. Texans at 3 p.m. ET and Rams vs. Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Pats (-3) are on a 1-6 run versus the line when they have a rest advantage, which could make them ones to fade with Houston coming off a Monday victory. Meanwhile, L.A. is the only Wild Card team that lost against the spread but won its game outright, as the Rams are 4.5-point road favorites in the latest divisional round NFL odds. All of the updated divisional round NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best divisional round NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the divisional round of the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Head here to see every pick. Top divisional round NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest divisional round NFL picks is the Bears (+4.5, 48.5) covering at home versus the Rams on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. The Rams are the lone team still in the playoffs that lost versus the spread last week, as L.A. has dropped two straight ATS on the road. Chicago, meanwhile, has just two ATS losses over its last nine games overall. Los Angeles' defense is falling apart as its 31 points allowed in the Wild Card win versus Carolina tied for the Panthers' most scored all season, as the former has allowed 28.3 points over its last seven games. On the other hand, Chicago is much more stout on that side of the ball at home, giving up just 16.3 points over its last four home contests. In addition to the Bears covers, the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bears using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make divisional round NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the divisional round NFL schedule. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL divisional round picks can you make with confidence, and which money line pick should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        To have any hope of competing for a Big Ten championship, home games have to be no-brainer wins. For the last few years, that hasn't been the case for Ohio State. The Buckeyes have lost 18 home contests since the start of the 2022-23 campaign. Ohio State (11-5 overall, 3-3 in the Big Ten) has let Nebraska and Illinois walk into the Schott and emerge with roadkills in the past five weeks. The script has to flip quickly for Jake Diebler and Co., starting Saturday against UCLA (12-5, 4-4 in Big Ten play) in a game that both squads could certainly use to boost their resumes.   Where to watch UCLA vs. Ohio State live   Date: Saturday, Jan. 17 | Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Schottenstein Center -- Columbus, Ohio TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium     \n        \n            \n                College basketball picks, schedule: Predictions for Top 25 games with Duke, Florida, Purdue in action Saturday\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n UCLA vs. Ohio State: Need to know Who is the best guard on the floor? Bruce Thornton's head-to-head showdown with Donovan Dent is the headliner of this Big Ten bout. Thornton has played like an All-American for Ohio State, averaging 20.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.9 assists while shooting a sizzling 44% from 3-point range. Conversely, Dent, a preseason All-American, has been mired in a miserable shooting slump in his first season in Westwood. The UCLA senior went 0-for-6 from the field against Penn State, but he's still highly dangerous, especially in the open floor. Ohio State does not have elite rim protection either, so Dent will have his opportunities to wiggle his way to the tin. Thornton is Ohio State's best offensive player and best defensive player. He will likely get the assignment on Dent. If he can keep him from turning the corner in ball screens, Ohio State can keep Dent under wraps. \nWill Juni Mobley shine against Mick Cronin's hedge-and-help defense? UCLA's defensive structure can be vulnerable to off-ball shooters. I don't see a path for Ohio State to find success offensively without Mobley beating the Bruins over the top. The 6-2 sophomore guard is a dynamic shooter who can also be notoriously streaky. He hit 14 combined treys against Nebraska, Rutgers and Grambling State, but Mobley had an off night the last time out against Washington (3 points on 1-5 shooting with three turnovers). Ohio State needs Good Mobley to win at home. What's the plan against Tyler Bilodeau? Dent got the most preseason hype, but Bilodeau has been UCLA's best player. The 6-9, 235-pound forward is four missed free throws away from being in the lofty 50-40-90 club. He is one of the best offensive players in the Big Ten with a polished game. He can drill pick-and-pop 3s. Bilodeau can go to work on the block or in the mid-post game. He's also an expert foul-drawer, who has started to sharpen a nifty rip-through move to catch defenders with their hands in the cookie jar. Ohio State can throw freshman Amare Bynum or veteran Devin Royal at him. If Christoph Tilly is healthy, the Ohio State 7-footer could get some opportunities, too. Pick-and-pop bigs have smoked Ohio State a few times this year, and Bilodeau enters Saturday with a ton of confidence after cracking double figures in each of the last 10 games.  UCLA vs. Ohio State prediction, picks \nThere are a few schematic advantages for Ohio State in this one. Ohio State has been very good at limiting transition opportunities this season, which is essential against Dent, who can be a one-man fastbreak. It also has enough capable decision-makers and off-ball shooters to find open shots against UCLA's patented pressure defense. The Bruins also don't have that interior enforcer who can poke at Ohio State's shaky rim defense. Against high-major competition, UCLA's offense manages just a 30% rim rate. That is one of the worst marks in the country. If this becomes a jump-shooting competition, Ohio State has the edge. This feels like a game where UCLA sorely misses veteran Skyy Clark, who is nursing a hamstring injury and is doubtful to play. In the last game of a long road trip to the East, UCLA runs out of gas late.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The lawyers of Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss officially filed a lawsuit on Friday in the chancery court of Lafayette County in Mississippi, seeking another year of eligibility for their client. The news of Chambliss filing a lawsuit against the NCAA was expected, as it was reported earlier this week that the legal team for Chambliss planned to file suit in Mississippi state court for a preliminary injunction to secure eligibility for next season.Attorney Tom Mars is working with Mississippi trial lawyer William Liston to assist in the move for Chambliss, who seeks relief for his 2022 season at Division II Ferris State. The NCAA denied his waiver request last week, which would likely bring an end to his college career. Chambliss led Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff semifinals before losing to Miami.Chambliss had a deal in place at Ole Miss to return in 2026 under first-year coach Pete Golding, contingent on the NCAA granting his waiver request.\nChambliss argues the legitimacy of his case because of \"incapacitating injury or illness\" in 2022. The NCAA argued that proper documentation from that time period wasn't provided and Ferris State's reasoning for Chambliss not playing after redshirting the previous season was \"development needs and our team's competitive circumstances.\"If Chambliss is ruled ineligible for the 2026 season, he will be eligible for this spring's NFL Draft. In CBS Sports' NFL Draft Prospect Rankings, Chambliss is ranked as the No. 3 signal caller behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Alabama's Ty Simpson. Chambliss finished the 2025 campaign by throwing for 3,927 yards and 22 touchdowns to just three interceptions.\nWith Chambliss' eligibility in limbo, the Rebels signed former blue-chip quarterback recruit Deuce Knight. The former Auburn signal caller would be the projected starter for Ole Miss in 2026 if Chambliss heads to the NFL.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of big-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Friday's roundup just below. Angels, Rays, Reds pull off three-way tradeThe Angels, Rays, and Reds have agreed to a three-team trade that, most notably, sends outfielder Josh Lowe to (greater) Los Angeles, the teams announced. Here's the full trade: Angels get: OF Josh Lowe from Rays Rays get: INF Gavin Lux from Reds, RHP Chris Clark from AngelsReds get: LHP Brock Burke from AngelsLowe, who turns 28 in February, enjoyed a standout season in 2023 when he hit 20 home runs in 135 games and put up an OPS+ of 128. Over the last two seasons, however, his offensive numbers have declined significantly. Lux is a veteran lefty bat who has a career OPS+ of 99. He can play second base and get by in left field. Lux is going into his walk year in 2026. Clark, a former fifth-round draft pick, is 24 and reached Double-A last season. Across parts of three minor league seasons, he has an ERA of 5.25 and a K/BB ratio of 2.52 in 54 starts and a pair of relief appearances. Burke is a 28-year-old lefty reliever with a career ERA+ of 110. Yankees, Mets targeting Peralta in trade talks\nIt's not known whether the Brewers, coming off back-to-back NL Central titles, will trade their ace this winter, but they appear to at least be considering it. On that front, the Yankees and Mets have engaged the Brewers in discussions about Peralta as there's an increasing perception that Milwaukee will indeed deal him away this offseason, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.Peralta, 29, is entering the final season of his contract. He's compiled a 3.40 ERA (123 ERA+) and a 3.27 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 95 starts since 2023. His consistency, reliability, and affordability (he's owed $8 million) make him an attractive target for teams seeking front-of-the-rotation help.\nYankees adjusting offer to Bellinger\nThe Yankees remain in negotiations with free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger, who was a key driver of their success last season. Thus far the sticking point has been contract length, and rather than meet Bellinger's ask the Yankees are proposing an alternative structure, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Specifically, the Yankees are willing to give Bellinger not one but two opt-outs in a contract that includes a substantial signing bonus and no deferrals. Whether that's enough to move Bellinger's camp off their contract-length stance depends upon the market. Red Sox checking in on Paredes\nThe Red Sox need infield help after losing out on Alex Bregman, who inked with the Cubs, and the Astros have infielders to spare. As such, the two sides are discussing Isaac Paredes, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Paredes, who soon turns 27, is coming off a strong bounceback campaign in 2025 in which he had an OPS+ of 123 and earned his second career All-Star selection. He's best suited to third base and is under team control through the 2027 season. Tigers at least listening on Skubal\nWill the Tigers trade back-to-back AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal heading into his walk year? The guess is no as they aim for a third straight trip to the postseason in 2026, but they're at least listening to trade inquiries, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Skubal and the organization may be at odds given the chasm between their respective filed arbitration figures, and that at least theoretically may increase the odds of a trade. Even with only one year of team control remaining, Skubal will command a high cost in return, as he's perhaps the best starting pitcher in all of baseball. \nTwins, Caratini agree to deal\nThe Twins and free-agent catcher Victor Caratini have agreed to a two-year deal, according to FanSided. Caratini has also seen time in recent years at first base and designated hitter and going back further has also played third base and left field. In 114 games for the Astros last season, he was worth 0.9 WAR. The 12 homers marked a career high for the part-timer, who has now slugged above .400 in two straight seasons. Ryan Jeffers is the likely starter for the Twins heading to 2026 and Caratini slides in as a nice backup option.\n            ",

The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos are back in action after a first-round bye last week, and each team faces a tough task as they host the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, respectively. The Houston Texans head to New England for a date with the Patriots on Sunday after these teams knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively, and the weekend concludes with the Chicago Bears hosting the Los Angeles Rams after each team won a close one last week. Some teams are looking much better in the injury department than others entering the Divisional Round, so here, we break down the top injuries bettors should know before placing wagers, and also share the latest NFL betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)BUFF LB Terrel Bernard (calf, questionable)BUFF DT Ed Oliver (biceps, questionable)BUFF S Jordan Poyer (hamstring, out)BUFF CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle, out)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)BUFF WR Curtis Samuel (elbow, questionable)BUFF WR Tyrell Shavers (knee, out)BUFF WR Gabe Davis (knee, out)\nIf you want to see the difference a first-round bye makes, look no further than this matchup. Buffalo is beat up on both sides of the ball, with linebacker Terrel Bernard and questionable and safety Jordan Poyer out. Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston is also out. Offensively, receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis each suffered torn ACLs last week, while No. 2 back Ty Johnson aims to return to Buffalo's backfield. The Bills activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve, giving the team a likely boost on both sides of the ball. Both are officially questionable to suit up.Denver is a 1.5-point favorite here, and the total is 45.5.San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)SF TE George Kittle (Achilles, out)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)SF Fred Warner (ankle, out)SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, questionable)\nIt's always a concern when a player surprisingly pops up on the final injury report, and it's especially noteworthy when it's your starting quarterback. That's the case for Seattle's Sam Darnold, however, as he is questionable with an oblique injury. Darnold told reporters he \"felt a little something\" during practice on Thursday but that he expects to play on Saturday. Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters Friday he expects his starting quarterback to suit up as well. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.  Seattle is a 7-point favorite at home. The total is 45.5.Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, Sunday)HOU WR Nico Collins (concussion, out)NE CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion, will play)\nThe Texans' offense has been limited at times throughout the year, but it always had one constant in star receiver Nico Collins. That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)\nThe Rams are in a good spot when it comes to the health department, and the biggest injury news for the Bears is that second-year receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that cost him considerable time this year. Odunze played last week and told reporters he expects to suit up against the Rams.The Rams are 3.5-point road favorites. The total is 45.5.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke star quarterback Darian Mensah plans to enter the transfer portal, multiple sources told CBS Sports. Mensah is one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the country after signing a multiyear deal last offseason that pays him $4 million annually, according to sources. His name has surfaced repeatedly this cycle as a potentially movable quarterback in conversations with industry sources, and that chatter only intensified in the closing hours of the 2026 portal window as quarterback-needy programs look to add a proven passer.Mensah emerged as an all-ACC selection in his first year with Duke, finishing the 2025 season second nationally with 3,973 passing yards and 34 touchdowns.The 6-foot-3, 205-pound California native transferred to Duke last offseason from Tulane.\nWhy now for Mensah? Mensah and Duke were an ideal partnership during the 2025 season. Duke spent big to land him, and it led to an ACC championship. Meanwhile, Mensah emerged as one of the truly elite passers on the Power Four level, finishing in the top 10 nationally in almost every major passing category. There were even reports last month that Mensah decided to return to Duke for the 2026 season, passing on the NFL Draft to do so. At that time there were rumors Mensah could consider the portal. He was a popular potential name for several schools, but he seemed to shut all that down midway through December. \nBut in recent days, Mensah's name began to pick up steam again talking with industry sources. There are several QB-needy teams without solutions to their quarterback issues, and no real answers to be found in the portal. The top 26 quarterbacks in the 247Sports portal rankings are all accounted for and the only quarterback in the top 50 with starting experience is EJ Colson, who is coming from Incarnate Word.Mensah instantly becomes the most in-demand prospect in the portal. Industry sources also consider Mensah's contract language with Duke to be more stringent than those of other contracts across college football, which will make it more difficult for Mensah to get out of his deal. Miami interest?Earlier this week, CBS Sports reported that Miami was aggressively shopping for a quarterback to replace the graduating Carson Beck, and their list of targets might include names not yet in the transfer portal. The Hurricanes pursued Ty Simpson, but the former Alabama quarterback reaffirmed his commitment to the NFL Draft. \nNow, sources tell CBS Sports that Miami is an early team to watch as a potential landing spot for Mensah. No. 10 Miami will face No. 1 Indiana on Monday night in the College Football Playoff National Championship at Hard Rock Stadium, a surreal setting that underscores both how quickly the program has risen and how fragile that ascent can be without the right quarterback. Over the past two seasons, the Hurricanes have leaned aggressively on veteran transfers to fuel their climb, pulling off moves few programs can match.Miami convinced Cam Ward to withdraw from the 2024 NFL Draft, a decision that ultimately led to him becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Hurricanes followed that by landing Carson Beck, who reversed course after initially declaring for the draft following four seasons at Georgia.\nBoth moves were transfer-portal coups. Both were big gambles. And both worked exactly as intended. Could Mensah be the the next in line? It'd be the third straight year the Hurricanes made the seemingly impossible happen once again. What would Duke do? Mensah decision puts the Blue Devils in an extremely difficult position. There's only a few hours left in the 2026 transfer portal window and very few starter-quality players left on the board at quarterback. Duke's room has also experienced so much upheaval during the portal window, with backup QB Henry Belin transferring to Missouri State. The Blue Devils did add North Alabama QB transfer Ari Patu, and they're optimistic about the future of true freshman quarterback Dan Mahan. \nStill, a starter, let alone an All-American candidate, leaving at the last moment would be devastating for Duke's hopes of repeating as ACC champions in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just eight teams remain in the NFL playoffs, and a trip to Championship Sunday is on the line this weekend as the divisional round takes center stage. The league is coming off a truly wild Wild Card Weekend, with most games decided in the final moments, setting the stage for what's shaping up to be one of the most memorable postseason runs in recent memory. The bar is high for the divisional round -- and it has a lot to live up to.As much as the focus is on the matchups that will determine who advances and who goes home, injuries are also looming large. Wild Card Weekend delivered plenty of drama, but it also took a toll. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles, while Texans wide receiver Nico Collins and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez each exited their games with concussions. Meanwhile, the Seahawks are keeping a close eye on Sam Darnold after he suffered an oblique injury during practice.With teams wrapping up their on-field preparations for this latest round of the playoffs, let's take a look at the final injury reports to see who's in, who's out and whose status remains up in the air.Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBillsMaxwell HairstonCBAnkleOutJordan PoyerSHamstringOutTerrel BernardLBCalfQuestionableDamar Hamlin (IR)SPectoralQuestionableTy JohnsonRBAnkleQuestionableEd Oliver (IR)DTBicepQuestionableCurtis Samuel (IR)WRElbowQuestionableBroncosDrew SandersLBAnkleOutLucas KrullTEFootOutJosh Allen began the week as a limited participant due to foot, knee and right finger injuries. However, the franchise quarterback logged back-to-back full practices to close out the week and carries no injury designation for Saturday's matchup. Meanwhile, defensive end A.J. Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf) and linebacker Matt Milano (ankle) also enter the weekend without injury designations after each was limited throughout the week. On Friday, Buffalo did activate both defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel off of injured reserve, signaling their return. Oliver hasn't played since Week 8. Denver is relatively healthy heading into this matchup. Just four players appeared on the final injury report, and only two have been ruled out. Most notably, linebacker Dre Greenlaw logged a full practice on Thursday and carries no injury designation.\nSan Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatus49ersJi'Ayir BrownSHamstringOutFred WarnerLBAnkleOutJacob CowingWRHamstringQuestionableLuke GiffordLBQuadQuestionableRicky PearsallWRKneeQuestionableDee WintersLBAnkleQuestionableSeahawksElijah ArroyoTEKneeOutJosh JonesOTKneeOutChazz SurrattLBAnkleOutSam DarnoldQBObliqueQuestionableDespite making a strong push to return, the 49ers ruled out linebacker Fred Warner for this playoff matchup. Meanwhile, the status of wide receiver Ricky Pearsall remains up in the air, though he did practice all week on a limited basis. On a more positive note, star left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) carries no injury designation after practicing fully in each of the final two sessions of the week.All eyes are on Sam Darnold after he popped up on the injury report Thursday with an oblique injury. Darnold has said he's confident he'll be able to play through it, but he is officially listed as questionable. If he's unable to go, backup Drew Lock would be thrust into the starting role for this playoff matchup.\nHouston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN, ABC | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusTexansNico CollinsWRConcussionOutPatriotsTerrell JenningsRBConcussion ProtocolQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableThe Texans are relatively healthy entering this divisional-round matchup, but the one absence looms large. The club has ruled out top wide receiver Nico Collins after he suffered a concussion last week against Pittsburgh. Collins did not practice at all this week.The Patriots will have top cornerback Christian Gonzalez available after he cleared the concussion protocol and practiced fully over the final two days of the week. Right tackle Morgan Moses (knee) also carries no injury designation after being limited earlier in the week. One player worth monitoring is Harold Landry III. He was limited on Wednesday and Thursday with a knee injury but did not practice Friday, putting his status in doubt heading into the game.\nLos Angeles Rams at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRamsJimmy GaroppoloQBBackQuestionableDesjuan JohnsonDEIllnessQuestionableBearsNick McCloudDBGroinOutJalen Reeves-MaybinLBBackQuestionableRome OdunzeWRFootQuestionableL.A. will get right guard Kevin Dotson back after missing the last few weeks due to an ankle injury. He was a full participant during Friday's session. Chicago is listing wide receiver Rome Odunze as questionable for Sunday's contest, but he practiced fully on Friday, which suggests he should be available. DJ Moore is also expected to play after logging a full practice Friday following limited sessions Wednesday and Thursday due to a knee injury. As for McCloud, he did not practice at all this week while dealing with a groin injury and is the lone Bears player who has been officially ruled out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Carrick might fulfil the one criterion that so many of his former team mates have been saying is critical to managing Manchester United -- he knows the club, probably better than you do, probably better than the club knows itself come to mention it, actually probably better than you know yourself -- but this is not an episode of Mastermind that the former Middlesbrough manager is preparing for. Carrick has been handed the United reins at the gallop to the finish line, 17 games of Premier League and Premier League only with the chance to pip an awful lot of other big name runners and riders in the final furlongs. There is an immense opportunity to deepen his status in Old Trafford folklore over the coming months but how might Carrick go about claiming it?The first thing to say is that Carrick has done his apprenticeship and while the United job, even on an interim basis, is an almighty step up, it would be for almost anyone. At least the 44-year-old does not need to learn the basics on the job like the man he replaced, caretaker Darren Fletcher. Beyond a successful three game spell holding the Old Trafford fort in 2021 -- United cycle through safe pairs of hands like the Robot Devil -- there is three years at Middlesbrough to fall back on and it is at the Riverside Stadium that we get our first hints at what kind of manager Carrick might be.How Carrick managed MiddlesbroughThe most important takeaway from his time at Middlesbrough might be that Carrick seems to be absolutely fine. That is not nothing when it comes to appointing a new manager. Most statistical analysis on the impact of head coaches has suggested that only the very best have an outsized positive impact, most might come in and deliver a short term boost before performances settle down. Much as a small few might overhaul a club for the better there are those who can do so for the worst. No thank you, I will not be naming examples today. Carrick though, does not appear to be from that dreaded latter category.His trajectory in the north east is that aforementioned middle of the road output. Coming to Middlesbrough with a record of two wins and a draw as United's pre-Ralf Rangnick interim, Carrick inspired an immediate upswing in performances. On his appointment on October 24, 2022, Boro were hovering above the relegation zone. When they crushed Preston North End 4-0 in March automatic promotion was only three points away, their style of football one of the most thrilling in England with Carrick coming to be viewed as an outstanding coaching prospect.\nIt never quite got better than that. Middlesbrough committed one of the EFL's cardinal sins of heading into the playoffs without momentum and found themselves beaten by Coventry City in year one. The next saw Boro slip just outside the top six and the following ended with them in 10th. A record of 60 wins, 28 draws and 50 losses was not to be sniffed at, but few tears were shed on Teeside when owner Steve Gibson sacked Carrick in the summer.After all Middlesbrough were one of the leading sides in the second tier. Their salary bill last season was estimated to be the sixth largest in the division, much as it had been the previous year. Here's the thing though, while an upper midtable finish on a fringe playoff wage bill might seem like an underperformance at the Riverside, you would take that in a heartbeat if you were Manchester United. That's bringing European football back to Old Trafford. Where does Sir Jim sign up for that?It might ultimately have been a disappointing ending for Carrick, but it was one that the man himself \"learned an awful lot\" from. Just how much of that he will be able to apply during a tenure with a defined end point is an open question, particularly when it comes to his tactics.\nIt would perhaps be wise not to expect too much of an overhaul from a man who has professed his hatred for the word \"philosophy.\" Anyone who has spent most of their playing career under Sir Alex Ferguson will appreciate that management is about much more than turning up with a formation and expecting the club to bequeath you the players to best deploy that. It might just be that Carrick adapts to what Ruben Amorim has left him.That might not be as hard as you imagine. During his Middlesbrough tenure Carrick played what on paper looked to be a 4-2-3-1, but his approach is perhaps best illustrated from this pass network in a 2-1 win over Oxford United last season. Playing Samuel Iling-Junior at left back makes for a particularly extreme example, but note just how dramatically the left back, No.29, has pushed on, with right back Anfernee Dijksteel (No.15) notably more withdrawn. This was consistent across Carrick's three seasons in the Championship, his left back pushing on and his left sided forward moving infield to create the standard 3-2-5 attacking shape, a strong double pivot shielding against counters.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Now imagine how that might look at United, with Patrick Dorgu bombing on from left back into space created by Matheus Cunha's movement infield with Noussair Mazraoui tucking into a position he is very confident in. If need be the roles could be reversed too with Luke Shaw well suited to the third center back in possession role now that he has lost the burst of his youth. It wouldn't exactly be Dorgu and Amad Diallo charging down the flanks, but United can probably cope with a bit of a downgrade on what is, in expected goals terms, the second best attack in the Premier League. \nWith the ball at their feet, Middlesbrough played how you would expect from a team managed by one of the few great tempo-dictating midfielders produced by England. They passed the ball, a lot. In Carrick's final season Boro ranked fifth in the league for possession having been eighth and third in the two proceeding years. Only two teams attempted more passes of 10 metres or fewer and they ranked in the same position for average number of passes per attacking sequence. They weren't the Championship's most sedate side but they weren't exactly hurrying up the pitch either.It's a similar story without the ball too. Only two teams allowed their opponents to complete a greater proportion of their passes than Boro's and they allowed the eighth most passes per defensive action (a measure of pressing intensity) in 2024-25. Broadly middle of the road defensively, they were strong in their duels but when they allowed opponents through struggled to stop good shots, a bit of a problem right the way through Carrick's tenure.That in possession style could be a tough match for the Premier League. After all, plenty of the hallmarks of Carrick's Championship side were similar to those implemented by Amorim in his early weeks at United. He too wanted to build play with short goal kicks, with his deeper players drawing the opposition onto him, finding a way through the press and unleashing forwards in transition. It never really worked and by his first full season the Portuguese had adapted to the top flight's new normal: balls into the channels, goal kicks up to the big man, runners right across the pitch.\nCBS Sports sources suggest that United are unlikely to do major business in the January transfer window so what Carrick has is what he will have to work with. That will be a challenge if he wants to create ball-playing sides. The Old Trafford engine room has long been held together by sticking plasters and good will and this summer must see the arrival of someone who can dictate tempo from midfield. Bruno Fernandes can do that but his greatest qualities are found in his more aggressive passes. Whether Carrick can trust him to play deep in a back four system will be an intriguing early question?If not Fernandes, it is not obvious who else. For all the excitement around what Amorim's sacking might mean for Kobbie Mainoo, Carrick has previously described the 20 year old as \"more of an attacker\" than a holding midfielder. Mainoo's great talents are in ball-carrying rather than passing. Again it looks like a gamble to play him alongside someone like Casemiro, who doesn't have the legs to cover if there are two or two and a half center backs behind him.In spite of Amorim's complaints about how much more would be needed for him to get his project up and running, this United already has the look of one that might suit a back three system. There are a lot of center backs, plenty of whom are pretty decent, and enough options to fill the spots for attack-minded wing backs or inside forwards.\nCarrick, however, knows that tactics are only part of life as a head coach, interim or otherwise. He has to set the tone at one of the biggest sporting organisations on the planet. At his first press conference, it didn't seem to be a role he was relishing. \"Sat in this chair in front of you lot is very different to the role in coaching,\" he joked. Carrick might not like it, but it will matter. Indeed, one of the few things Amorim could be said to have done at a very high level was to reset expectations at Old Trafford according to where United were not where they expect to be.Carrick too is not going to let supporters get carried away, stressing the priority as \"improvement,\" using that or its derivations seven times in response to a question of what the target was for his interim tenure. \"Improvement. I think certainly improvement and helping improve individuals. \"A big part of what I really enjoy is improving individuals and, in the end, I think if you improve the individuals, we create a better team. So, certainly working with the players and improving them with that, I think. And, listen, results, that's what it is. There's an element of performance, there's an element of improvement, and there's an element of doing what it takes to win in certain ways, in certain occasions.\n\"So, certainly, the higher up the league we finish, we want to keep pushing and finishing as high up as we possibly can, and we'll see where that takes us.\"Beyond that and a nebulous reference to Europe, there was not much to set expectations against. That is the way Carrick would like it. In his playing career he was not one for making headlines and it seems he won't be in his second spell in the Old Trafford dugout. Roy Keane had dragged his old feud with Carrick's wife Lisa back into the headlines this week, jibing that she would \"probably [be] doing the team talk\" at Manchester United. It is the sort of story that could run and run in a media ecosystem that evidently discombobulated Amorim.Not when Carrick is in charge. \"Honestly, it didn't bother me,\" he said of the pressure Keane might be applying. \"I understand there's plenty of opinions around and some are positive, some are not so much.\n\"There's a lot of opinions, a lot can be said. It is the way of the world, I'm not going to pay too much attention to most of that. I think it's not for me to do that.\"There was Carrick serving notice. If anyone had come to Carrington in search of some Ragnickian soundbites, a cutting assessment of where United really are a la Jose Mourinho, they were going to be disappointed. As best he can, Carrick will be taking the air out of Old Trafford. That is no bad thing.The sheer noise around Old Trafford for so long seemed to obscure one simple truth this season. United were alright. They were not zooming back towards title contention as their fans might expect, not least because ownership had set a target of glory in two years' time, but they were ticking along reasonably nicely. They might only need a coach who can convert a few draws into wins, give them a bit of a short term boost and then move on. If that is indeed the case, then Carrick should do just fine.\nHow to watch Manchester United vs. Manchester City, oddsDate: Saturday, Jan. 17 | Time: 7:30 a.m. ETLocation: Old Trafford -- Manchester, EnglandTV: USA Odds: Man U +283; Draw +310; Man City -120\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a funny thing about this game we play, Fantasy Football. The most important part of the NFL season, the playoffs, is largely irrelevant to most Fantasy Football managers. But for Dynasty managers, this is a time to watch for future value and there are still several players playing in the Divisional Round who could see their value spike or fall, based on the results of this weekend and the remaining playoffs.Unsurprisingly, most of the players on this list are guys who are younger and less proven. That makes sense, right? The less information we have, the more we should be open to changing our opinion based on a few games. But there is at least one veteran who could change perception, and for me, that is Sam Darnold. Darnold has put together back-to-back solid regular seasons. He's still just 28 years old. He is under contract through 2027. It feels like he should be a high floor QB2 at the very least. But he turned into a pumpkin in the playoffs last year, turned the ball over twice, and lost to the Rams in the Wild Card Round. And the Vikings moved on. This year, the Seahawks earned the top seed and a bye into the Divisional Round, so we're still waiting to see Darnold in the playoffs. If he repeats last year's performance we will have to wonder just how long his leash in Seattle is. On the other hand, if he leads the Seahawks to the Super Bowl, he should have multiple years of security as an NFL starter.In my early January Dynasty rankings update I had Darnold at QB25, behind Bryce Young, J.J. McCarthy, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray, Tyler Shough, and Matthew Stafford. He could pass several of those QBs in the next month. This week on FFT Dynasty I did a one-man mailbag answering your questions about 2026 rookie picks, Rashee Rice, and more. We are back to two episodes a week for the offseason and have a ton of great content planned for the Spring. Check it out:\nLuther Burden had a quiet start to the playoffs with three catches for 42 years in a win over the Packers. That came after he averaged 81 receiving yards per game in the final month of the regular season. He was one of the most polarizing wide receivers in the 2025 class and I am not sure his rookie season did much to change that. In truth I could have put any number of Bears in this article, but Burden seems to have the widest range of potential outcomes. After Week 18 I had him ranked as WR17 in Dynasty and a month from now anywhere from WR12-25 seems possible. One Bears rookie, Colston Loveland, has already secured his spot as a top five tight end heading into next year.Like Burden, Jayden Higgins had an uneven rookie season that wasw better in the second half than the first. Now he may get the playoff spotlight against New England without WR1 Nico Collins on the field. There are Dynasty analysts who believe Higgins has nearly as much upside as Burden, and there are others who believe he's a Dynasty WR3 at best. I have him at WR32 for the moment, but he could certainly change my mind with a big performance under the brightest lights against a difficult matchup.If you have read any of my Dynasty coverage this season, you know I am a big believer in TreVeyon Henderson. While it is hard to say he had a bad rookie season, with 1,132 yards from scrimmage and 10 TDs, it has been disappointing that he has been unable to wrestle more work from Rhamondre Stevenson. And Stevenson has been very good as of late. If that continues and Stevenson looks like he'll stay in New England next year I may have to reevaluate my RB8 ranking of Henderson in Dynasty. But if Henderson looks like the star I believe he is, you'll be hearing a lot more from me about him heading into 2026.\nRicky Pearsall isn't a rookie, but it feels like we may know even less about him than we do the rookies above. He has played 20 games in his two NFL seasons and he has played less than 60% of the snaps in six of those. Pearsall is fighting to play this weekend and has the potential to increase his value if he matches his production in his last two games, when he caught 11 passes for 181 yards. As of now, I have Pearsall as WR30, the perfect picture of a boom/bust WR3. That is probably where he stays unless he's able to give us multiple good performances in the playoffs.\n            ",

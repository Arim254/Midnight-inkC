    "body": "\n        After capping off an excellent season by winning the MLS Cup on Saturday, Lionel Messi has been named the MLS MVP for the second consecutive season. Messi just completed a season with the second most goal contributions in league history with 48 from 29 goals and 19 assists, while also becoming the second player in league history to lead the league in both goals and assists alongside Sebastian Giovinco. Messi has capped off one of the most successful seasons in league history and been rewarded with another MVP award. No player has ever won the award in consecutive years, while Preki is the only player to win the award twice. Preki did it in 1997 and 2003, a very different era than this current iteration of MLS, during which the talent level of both youth players and stars in the league are growing.Becoming the first player to have 10 multi-goal games in a season and also only failing to register a goal or an assist in five of 28 games played during the season, Messi was the picture of consistency at 38 years old. Messi has at least finished as an MVP finalist every season since coming to Miami from PSG in 2023, and in only 53 regular season appearances during his career has already scored 50 goals and assisted 35 more.\nThis season, Messi takes the award, finishing ahead of Anders Dreyer of San Diego FC, Denis Bouanga of Los Angeles FC, Evander of FC Cincinnati, and San Surridge of Nashville SC. Taking home more than 70% of the total vote, which included media, players, and club officials, it was a landslide victory for the Argentine number 10. He'd ride that form into setting more records during the postseason with 15 goal contributions, scoring six goals and assisting nine more while his Herons would go on to defeat the Vancouver Whitecaps for their first MLS Cup in their history. Messi has already brought three pieces of silverware to Miami, and with him signing an extension to play through 2028, he'll be along to provide more while also entering next seaon as the favorite yet again to lift the MVP award.\nIt will be a season of change for Miami following the retirement of Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, but co-owner Jorge Mas has already promised that he'll reload, and with players like Rodrigo De Paul joining the band, there's no reason to doubt that assertion. With the Herons moving to a new home stadium, as Miami Freedom Park is set to open next season, they'll be set for more success, as Messi has shown that he can accomplish whatever he puts his mind to, but that he can also take the club to new levels that they may have never dreamed of. If that's not an MVP, I don't know what is.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ORLANDO, Fla. — Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski doesn't play on the winding roads. In a sport where execs hedge, posture, overthink the value of a trade, and talk in circles, he usually tells you exactly where he's going. He sticks to the same lane. The lane that he believes will achieve the most success for his club. So at the start of the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings on Monday, Dombrowski made it clear what the plan was for his Phillies. \"We're not running our club back,\" Dombrowski said from his suite an Orlando hotel. Yet what does that look like? Dombrowski, true to form, laid it out without being asked. Left-handed-hitting Max Kepler isn't coming back. And Nick Castellanos won't be either, with the Phillies still working on a move that gives both sides a fresh start. The Phillies are bullish on the upside of younger, unproven players like Otto Kemp and top prospect Justin Crawford. That's a shift for Dombrowski, who's built his reputation on leaning toward established, star-level talent when it's time to push a team to its ceiling.\n\"We've talked about Crawford, we're going to give him that opportunity to make the club and feel good about it,\" Dombrowski said. \"Some people think he's a better left fielder. Some people think he's a better center fielder, or at least going to be a better center fielder as time goes on. So there's really a difference of opinion [within the organization]. I don't think he's a right fielder. So he'll play either left or center.\" Brandon Marsh, who played 84 games in center and another 62 in left field last season, historically has struggled against left-handed pitching. Dombrowski sees Kemp (who had a .786 OPS against lefties in 2025) as a means to possibly combat that. Top infield prospect Aidan Miller is viewed as close to big-league ready with shortstop, second, and third base all in play. A new-look Phillies team will rise or fall on two things: the growth of their young players and their superstars, like Bryce Harper, playing to their ceiling.\nBut there are pieces Dombrowski would still like to keep in place, namely current free agents J.T. Realmuto and Kyle Schwarber. Elite catching is almost impossible to replace, especially when it comes with a bat like Realmuto's, even despite his down year at the dish. Realmuto has been linked to clubs like the Red Sox, Mets, and Rangers -- all of them searching for a catching upgrade. That's a position the Phillies can't gloss over, and one that won't come into focus until the market settles.Schwarber, however, is widely believed to be the name that helps, perhaps, not set the market but help assist in getting it moving after a slow start to the winter. \nThe Pirates reportedly made Schwarber a four-year offer. The Orioles have interest as do the Red Sox. But, according to one source, Boston is viewed as a long shot.The Mets are in the mix, too, but New York might prefer to use its money elsewhere. The Reds are around the edges of the conversation, but the question lingers: are they truly ready to win right now?Many within the industry are confident that ultimately Schwarber ends up back with the Phillies. \n\"There's probably not nearly as much out there as he thought he would get,\" said one high-ranking member of a front office. \"I'd call his bluff on going to Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. I'm sure he wants to win. He's almost certainly going back to Philly.\" Certainty, though, didn't sit with Dombrowski. Or at least that was one of the hands he was reluctant to show.\"The one thing I want is for those guys to know how much we respect them, how much we like to have them back,\" Dombrowski said, referencing Schwarber and Realmuto. \"But there's a time frame too that you can just doesn't mean you have to do something else, but at some point you need to move some things forward. So I think that's been properly communicated.\"\nStill, what does that shift even look like? How do you replace a Kyle Schwarber? And where does the power come from? Dombrowski said he prefers a doubles-oriented club because it usually points to a sound approach. But the league runs on slug. Outside of Schwarber, the Phillies didn't have much of it in 2025. Only two hitters cleared 20 homers last season, Schwarber with 56 and Harper with 27.Dombrowski knows he needs Schwarber. And Schwarber, who has never cared for the attention or the noise that comes with free agency, knows Philadelphia is the right fit for him. It's still early in the process, and Dombrowski has given Schwarber and his camp space to see what's out there before coming back to the Phillies with the final word.\"There's optimism [that we will re-sign Schwarber], but the reality is you just don't know,\" Dombrowski said.\nThis Phillies club isn't running it back. It will look different. But in order for it to raise that World Series banner, some things probably still need to look the same. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An appeals court in the Dominican Republic has ordered a new trial for Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, according to the Associated Press. Franco was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor and given a two-year suspended sentence earlier this year. A new panel of judges has been ordered to oversee the case. It is unknown when the new trial will begin.\"The court understood that there were many flaws, many  omissions, many issues, and decided to send the case to a new trial,\" Franco's attorney, Teodosio Jáquez, told the AP.José Martínez Montan, the district attorney for the province of Puerto Plata and the prosecutor for the initial trial, said: \"In a new trial, the procedures will be reevaluated. We won the case  in the first trial, and we expect the same in the new trial.\"In January 2024, prosecutors delivered roughly 600 pages of evidence    alleging that Franco had a relationship with a 14-year-old girl for  four months. He was also accused of providing the girl's mother with cash  payments and a car in    exchange for her consenting to the  relationship.  The girl's mother received a 10-year prison sentence.\nWhile  awaiting trial, Franco was arrested on a gun-related charge following  an altercation in November 2024. He faces a separate legal case for the  gun charge.Once criminal proceedings in the Dominican  Republic are  complete, Franco will be investigated by MLB and will face a suspension  under the league's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child  Abuse Policy. Criminal  charges or a conviction are not required for  discipline under  the  domestic violence policy.Franco last played a game for the Rays on Aug. 12, 2023. He was on  administrative leave from that day through July 10, 2024, when charges  were filed. At that point, he was placed on the restricted list. Franco  has not been paid nor received service time while on the restricted  list. The 2025 season was Year 5 of the 11-year, $182 million contract extension he  signed in November 2021.\nNow 24, Franco was once one of the brightest young stars in the game.  He finished third in the 2021 American League Rookie of the Year voting, despite  playing only 70 games, and was an All-Star in 2022.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        106 days until Opening Day ... Cody Ponce wasn't the most-hyped player coming over to MLB from an overseas league. Not even close. And he won't get the biggest contract of any player coming to MLB from an overseas league this offseason. Not even close. But the $30 million deal he signed with the Blue Jays last week is big enough that Fantasy Baseball players have to stand up and take note. Sure, it's a far cry from their first move to bolster their rotation, the $210 million they gave Dylan Cease the week before. But Ponce's deal is the biggest ever for a pitcher returning from the Korean Baseball Organization to MLB, per The Athletic, and it's the kind of investment that should immediately put Ponce on Fantasy radars. So what's the deal? Why are the Blue Jays throwing life-changing money at a 31-year-old who flamed out in his last stint in the majors, putting up a 5.86 ERA in 55.1 innings back in 2020 and 2021? And why should Fantasy players care?Well, for one thing: The Blue Jays just gave him life-changing money! If Ponce signed a one-year deal worth $5 million, he'd be easy enough to overlook. But the people running major-league teams are, by and large, pretty smart. They're not just throwing money at anyone, especially not that kind of money over three years. The Blue Jays are contenders who believe Ponce can help get them over the hump after they fell short in heartbreaking fashion in Game 7 of the World Series. \nNow, let's not get carried away: The Blue Jays didn't pay Ponce ace money, and you shouldn't expect him to pitch like an ace against major-league hitters. But he was the best pitcher in the KBO in 2025, putting up an MVP-winning season. His 1.89 ERA was the best of any starting pitcher, and his 252 strikeouts led the league (and his 180.2 innings were second-most in the league. He struck out 36% of opposing batters in 2025 – for comparison's sake, Erick Fedde struck out 29.6% of opposing batters during his own KBO MVP campaign in 2023 before coming back to the majors. Fedde, of course, gave up much of that strikeout rate once he got to the majors, settling in around an average 21.2% rate in 2024. But he was still effective (for that first season, at least), putting up a 3.30 ERA and 1.16 WHIP over 177.1 innings of work. Ponce was both better in Korea and got more money (twice as much, albeit with an extra year on the deal), so it seems reasonable to assume Ponce is the better pitcher as he makes his return to the majors.And Fantasy players should have him on their radars as a result. He pitched with a bump in velocity in 2025, sitting at 95.5 mph and hitting 98, per reports, with a cutter and curveball that he has had since his days in the majors. The big change for Ponce in 2025 was, well, the change – a kick-change to be exact, though it moves like and is often confused with a splitter, apparently. The four-seamer was an effective swing-and-miss pitch when he threw it up in the zone, and it paired nicely with the changeup, which Lance Brozdowski describes as \"a plus pitch.\" \nAs always, we have to acknowledge that Ponce's success came against a league that probably has a level of competition below Triple-A, on the whole. If a 31-year-old dominated Triple-A like this, we wouldn't necessarily be running to add him in all formats. We would rightly view that pitcher with skepticism, given their age and level of competition.It is additionally worth noting that Ponce was one of the least effective pitchers in the entire world in 2024. Pitching for the Rakuten Golden Eagles in the Japan Pacific League in Nippon Professional Baseball, Ponce had a 6.72 ERA in 67 innings, which is actually even worse than you might think – the league average ERA in the Pacific League in 2024 was 3.04, meaning his was more than double the average. He was the only pitcher in that league with at least 50 innings who had an ERA over 4.32 – again, his was 6.72. And that was just one year ago!Pitchers can turn their careers around that quickly, and Ponce showed enough – and the Blue Jays showed enough faith in him – that he's certainly someone Fantasy players should be willing to take a flier on. It's just important to keep those expectations reasonable. $30 million is significant money, but it's also the same contract Reynaldo Lopez signed a few years ago and is slightly less than Clay Holmes got this time last year. It's a show of faith, but it's not a sign that the Blue Jays think he's an ace. \nThere might be an ace among this year's international free agent crop, though. And there might be at least a couple of impact bats, too. There's nobody on Yoshinobu Yamamoto's level, but there should be more immediate impact from this year's class of Japanese and Korean league imports than last year, when Roki Sasaki led what turned out to be a pretty underwhelming group of debuts. Let's get to know the other names who could matter for Fantasy in 2026: \nMeet the KBO/NPB importsTatstuya Imai, SP27 on Opening Day2025: 1.92 ERA, 178 K, 45 BB in 163.2 IPImai is the gem of this class and seems likely to get the biggest contract this offseason. It almost certainly won't approach Yamamoto's $300 million contract, but Imai should end up one of the most handsomely paid pitchers of this free agency class overall, with Fangraphs.com projecting a $100 million contract that honestly feels a bit light at this point. Imai is coming off a 1.92 ERA in his final season with the Seibu Lions, though we do, of course, have to account for the extreme dead-ball era NPB is currently experiencing – his ERA+ of 158 relative to the 3.04 league average is roughly equivalent to what Freddy Peralta managed last season. There's nothing wrong with Peralta, of course – if he was a 27-year-old free agent, he'd definitely get $100 million this offseason – but it's just a reminder that we need to take all pitching stats out of Japan with a serious grain of salt.It's also worth noting that, while Imai walked just 2.5 batters per nine innings in 2025, control has been an issue earlier in his career. He walked over four per nine innings as recently as 2023, and any regression in that regard would be detrimental. But if the improvements stick, he looks like at least a mid-rotation arm coming off a season very similar to the one Kodai Senga had before joining the Mets. \nAs for the scouting report, Imai comes in around 95-96 mph with his fastball on average, pushing it up to 98-99 at the high end, giving him slightly better than MLB average velocity. The fastball comes in pretty flat from a low release slot, similar to someone like Joe Ryan, which is a good starting point. He leans heavily on that fastball and his slider against right-handed hitters, though he doesn't just ditch the slider against lefties – in fact, because it has arm-side movement as opposed to glove-side movement like most sliders, it's a pitch that shouldn't have significant platoon issues. He has a few different offspeed looks, including a changeup, splitter, and vulcan change, as MLB.com notes here, and each of his secondaries boasted impressive whiff rates in 2025. Given his fastball velocity and movement profile, that gives Imai a full arsenal of swing-and-miss stuff. There should be plenty of strikeouts here, and Imai seems especially well-suited to succeed early in his MLB tenure; given his weird slider, variety of offspeed looks, and low arm slot, there just aren't a ton of pitchers who throw like Imai. That uniqueness should benefit him well, and I like Imai as a mid-rotation starter for Fantasy who could throw 160-plus very good innings as a rookie, like Senga and Shota Imanaga did in their respective rookie MLB seasons. Munetaka Murakami, 3B26 on Opening Day2025: .273/.379/.663, 22 HR in 56 G in NPBMurakami's value has been on quite a ride. In 2022, he set the single-season record in the NPB for home runs by a Japanese-born player, clubbing 56 while hitting .318/.458/.710 – and 1.168 OPS in a league where the average was .678! He did that as a 22-year-old and followed it up by putting himself further onto stateside radars by being part of Team Japan's World Baseball Classic winning team in 2023 and homering in the final. He was supposed to be the next big thing after Yamamoto and Sasaki came to the majors.\nAnd now he's on the verge of coming over, and it doesn't seem like there's very much hype around him at all, does it? In fact, I feel like I've seen a lot more skepticism around Murakami than excitement, largely based on trouble with contact metrics. Per MLB.com, Murakami has had a whiff rate around 36% over the past two seasons, with his strikeout rate jumping to 29% in that stretch. That's a frightening statistic, and his in-zone contact rate is even more troubling, as he was at just 72.6% in 2025, down from 77.1% in 2022 and well below the MLB average of 82.5%. And he was doing that against less-than-MLB-level competition, meaning we might project even more regression there. And Murakami has also notably struggled against high-velocity fastballs, something he'll see a lot more of in the majors than he has in NPB so far.I don't want to totally write off those concerns. But I do want to put them into some context. Murakami is a big slugger, and strikeouts are probably always going to be a part of the package here. And the floor here is pretty low, with his contact skills (or lack thereof) requiring truly elite power to work. If it's just plus power, he's probably a Ryan McMahon type who just won't matter very much for Fantasy. Even an outcome where the power plays could still be pretty underwhelming – nobody's exactly banging down the door to draft Matt Wallner these days, right?But Murakami has been tracked hitting a ball 116.5 mph in 2025, a mark only 23 hitters in MLB managed in 2025. We're talking about what could be true plus-plus power, with a very good approach at the plate, even with the swing and miss. And there are plenty of players who are thriving in the majors like that right now. Heck, Riley Greene has played his way into borderline-elite territory despite pretty terrible swing decisions because he just does so much damage when he does make contact; Rafael Devers' swing decisions might be even worse, but he overcomes that to an even greater degree than Green does, while other names like Kyle Schwarber, Matt Olson, and Cal Raleigh have become stars despite plenty of swing and miss in their games. \nThat roughly shows the range of outcomes for a guy like Murakami. There's plenty of risk that he just won't be able to handle MLB-caliber pitching consistently enough to let the power play. And there are some outcomes where the power is legit, but he's a tough Fantasy fit, ala Eugenio Suarez (in the years he isn't hitting 50 homers, at least). And there are some high-end outcomes where he's a legit top-50 player in Fantasy despite some batting average woes. I'll let the market dictate how excited I am to draft Murakami. If he's not being drafted as a top-200 player, I'll probably be pretty in on him as a later-round target. If he gets pushed closer to the top 150, I'll probably be a bit less excited about him. Given the vibes out there right now, his current ADP of 224.6 should rise once he signs, but there's still plenty of room for upside there. Kazuma Okamoto, 3B 29 on Opening Day2025: .327/.416/.581, 15 HR in 69 games in NPBOkamoto didn't have nearly as much hype as Murakami during their respective NPB careers, but there are plenty of people who are arguably more excited about the elder bat here. Partially, it's because he just doesn't have those huge red flags in his profile – Okamoto's career high in strikeouts is just 132 back in 2019, just a 21% rate. \nBut Okamoto probably doesn't have the upside Murakami does. His career-best OPS was his 1.014 mark in 2025, which came in just 69 games, and would just edge out 2020 as Murakami's third-best mark for a season. He also doesn't hit the ball nearly as hard on the high ends, with his max exit velocity in 2025 sitting at just 108.9 mph, about 1.4 mph lower than the MLB average. He's an older player and doesn't seem to share Murakami's physical gifts, so the ceiling probably isn't as lofty here. He's a safer bet to be a viable major-league hitter, but probably doesn't have the 35-plus homer outcomes here, either. The better bat-to-ball skills should make for a safer projection, though, and it wouldn't surprise me if Okamoto gets a similar average annual value as Murakami, albeit likely on a shorter deal. If he can be a .260-ish hitter with 20-25 homers, there's plenty of value in that. It's just that, if you're projecting best-case scenarios, maybe Okamoto's looks like the best Alec Bohm or later-Houston-era Alex Bregman, while Murakami's might look more like Austin Riley's best seasons. The floor might be higher with Okamoto, but if both are going outside of the top-200 in ADP, a higher floor is less of a concern. Of course, Okamoto figures to be quite a bit cheaper: His ADP is currently 373.6, and the upside is clearly worth taking a flier on if all it costs is one of your last few picks. \nKona Takahashi, SP29 on Opening Day2025: 3.04 ERA, 88 K, 41 BB in 148 IP in NPBFair warning: This group is about to get a lot less interesting. Takahashi was posted along with Okamoto, and the 29-year-old has been roughly a league-average NPB pitcher in recent years. He was quite a bit better than that in 2022 and 2023, when he had consecutive seasons with an ERA of 2.20 and 2.21, but he has regressed badly in his late 20s. After being more like an average strikeout pitcher with great control earlier in his career, Takahashi's strikeout rate fell to a measly 14.3% in 2025.Sports Info Solutions has a scouting report from back in 2024 that notes that Takahashi had added velocity in recent years and was sitting around 93 mph, but FanGraphs noted more recently that Takahashi's fastball \"misses bats at a single-digit clip,\" indicating that we're probably looking at below-average stuff overall. You can survive with below-average stuff in the majors, but the margin for error is pretty slim, and it's not necessarily a profile you want to bet on. In Takahashi's case, he's probably limited to just 15-team leagues as a final-round dart throw to see if he has a good schedule early in the season and can get hot, and even then, there will probably be someone on your Draft Board with more upside, even with the 450th pick. This profile worked for Tomoyuki Sugano for a few weeks early last season – though Takahashi's control has never been as good as Sugano's, so even that comp might be asking too much. Ryan Weiss, SP, Astros 29 on Opening Day2025: 2.87 ERA, 207 K, 56 BB in 178.2 IP in KBOWeiss is the other big KBO import, but he was neither as dominant as Ponce nor did he get nearly as lucrative a deal. Weiss' deal will pay him $2.6 million for 2026, with an option for 2027 that could push the total worth north of $10 million, per ESPN.com, which should put him in contention for the Astros' rotation. This is an organization that has a well-earned reputation for developing pitchers, and the Astros did well to wring a lot of value out of fairly marginal talents like Ryan Gusto, Colton Gordon, Jason Alexander, and Brandon Walter last season. That's where we should be setting expectations for Weiss, which means you're hoping he can emerge as a viable streamer at some point, not a Draft Day target. \nAnthony Kay, SP, White Sox31 on Opening Day2025: 1.74 ERA, 130 K, 41 BB in 155 IP in NPBFoster Griffin, SP30 on Opening Day2025: 1.62 ERA, 77 K, 18 BB in 78 IP in NPBGriffin and Kay make their returns from NPB with similar profiles, as left-handed pitchers capable of starting, but without the stuff to be rotation stalwarts. Kay should end up in the White Sox rotation by default, and they'll likely try to pull the same trick off with him as they did with Fedde two years ago – hope he pitches well enough for long enough to net something of some value for their long and winding rebuild. Griffin hasn't signed yet, but it is worth noting Kay's contract – he got $12 million over two years guaranteed, with a mutual option worth $10 million for 2028. That's enough to at least merit a look in some deeper leagues, though we're probably ultimately just talking about a streamer type for Fantasy in most leagues. \n            ",

Additionally, there are captivating non-divisional games to make NFL best bets on such as Packers vs. Broncos (+2.5) and Lions vs. Rams (-5.5).While those games all have close NFL spreads, there are some wider ones featuring playoff contenders versus teams contending for high positions in the NFL Draft. The Week 15 NFL odds have the Eagles favored by 12.5 points over the Raiders, while the 49ers are 12.5-point favorites against the Titans.

The Saints pulled off a road upset victory on Sunday over Tampa, covering for the second straight and for the third time in the last four games. QB Tyler Shough is providing a running element that Spencer Rattler didn't, as the rookie had 55 yards and two scores on the ground versus the Bucs. New Orleans also has an underrated pass defense, ranking sixth in the NFL, while Carolina already struggles on offense. The Panthers are in the bottom 10 in points scored, total yards and redzone scoring, and they have just one victory, as well as one cover, over their last five versus the Saints. The model also has the Over hitting in over 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 15 NFL predictions: the Giants (-2.5, 47.5) cover versus the Commanders in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. Jayden Daniels re-injured his elbow in Sunday's shocking 31-0 loss to Minnesota, leaving the game in the third quarter and not returning. While his availability is unknown to face the Giants, Zach Ertz (ACL) is now done for the year. That's a big blow to a passing offense which is already a bottom-10 unit, while Washington ranks in the bottom-five in points allowed, yards allowed, run defense and pass defense. Both Washington (eight) and New York (seven) are on lengthy losing streaks, but the Giants have a 4-3 spread record during their streak, while the Commanders are just 1-7 ATS on theirs. New York is projected to cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 15 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 15 NFL schedule and just revealed three underdogs projected to outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        Speculation on LeBron James' future seems to run rampant with every comment and every rumor, but Rich Paul's latest remarks seemed to quell the fire -- at least for now. Paul, speaking on the debut episode of the \"Game Over\" podcast he co-hosts with longtime sports analyst Max Kellerman, addressed both the Los Angeles Lakers' ability to contend for a title this season and whether James will be on the team by the end of this season.\"I personally don't think the Lakers are good enough to be contenders right now -- not right now,\" said Paul, the CEO of Klutch Sports and James' longtime business partner. \"I don't think they have enough to get to the Western Conference [Finals]. I don't think they have enough to contend from that perspective right now.\"\nThe Lakers are 17-6 this season, tied for the second-best record in the Western Conference with the Denver Nuggets, even though James has only played in seven games due to sciatica that kept him out until mid-November. The Lakers are 6-1 when James plays this season. Overall, Los Angeles, led by Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves, has the sixth-best offensive rating in the league, though it is 21st in defense.Unfortunately for James and the Lakers, they play in the same conference as the Oklahoma City Thunder, whose 23-1 record is tied for the second-best mark through the first 24 games of a season in NBA history. There's also the Nuggets, Houston Rockets (15-6), San Antonio Spurs (16-7) and Minnesota Timberwolves (15-9) in the top six of a loaded conference.Could that mean James, who might be in the last season of his NBA career, will play elsewhere this season?\n\"No,\" Paul said when asked about James potentially playing for another team this season. \"Where's he gonna go?\"Kellerman mentioned the New York Knicks as a possibility.\"That's wishful thinking, Max, from New York\" Paul said. \"Does LeBron make the Knicks better? Yes. Yeah, he would, of course. But 29 other teams would say the same thing.\"James, as Paul later noted, has a no-trade clause. The 40-year-old superstar is scoring 16.1 points per game, which is on pace to be a career low, though he's also averaging career lows in minutes (33.1) and shot attempts (13.9). He is coming off a season-high 29 points in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\nThe Lakers have chances to prove they can hang with the West's best coming up. They face the Spurs in the NBA Cup quarterfinals Wednesday, and they take on the Rockets on Christmas Day.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    OF/DH Kyle Schwarber, free agentSchwarber, one of the game's most productive hitters, hasn't yet chosen which team he'll suit up for during the coming regular season. He has, however, declared that he'll play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. Schwarber has averaged a 135 OPS+ with 47 home runs per season over the last three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Will Smith, DodgersSmith, fresh off winning a second World Series title in a row, will be in the squat for Team USA as he pursues an international championship to add to his collection. Smith has developed into one of the best backstops in baseball and over the past three seasons has amassed a 125 OPS+ and 12 Wins Above Replacement.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    INF Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson will be making his first WBC appearance after blossoming into a star with the Orioles in recent years. Over the course of his first four seasons in the majors, he's compiled a 134 OPS+ and more than 21 Wins Above Replacement. His experience at shortstop and third base could come in handy, depending on the rest of the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2B Brice Turang, BrewersTurang is fresh off a breakout season with the Brewers that saw him post new career highs in home runs (18) and WAR (5.6).

The Indiana Hoosiers are the only 13-0 team in the country, and after beating Ohio State in a thriller of a Big Ten Championship Game, our voters in the CBS Sports 136 have named Curt Cignetti's squad the unanimous No. 1 team in our college football rankings. Of course, since the CBS Sports 136 is concerned with far more than the top 10 or even top 25, we do have a total update of the rankings after championship weekend that showcases how our voters reacted to the results between conference title contenders. Georgia's impressive win against Alabama had the Bulldogs moving up to No. 3 but falling behind Ohio State, which dropped to No. 2 after the Big Ten title game loss. Tulane also had a big jump up after beating North Texas in the American Championship Game, moving up three spots into the top 20, and Boise State was one of the biggest movers of the week with a 12-spot jump right to the edge of the top 40 after beating UNLV to claim the Mountain West championship. Interestingly enough, conference championship game wins did not do a ton for Texas Tech or Duke in terms of big moves up, but those games did see rankings drops for the losers with BYU and Virginia losing some spots in the CBS Sports 136. The same cannot be said for Kennesaw State and Western Michigan, the winners in Conference USA and the MAC, who both saw a rankings boost after winning their conference championship game. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket picks: Expert predictions for who will win 2025 national championship\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNow, as you can imagine, the movements in the wake of a nine-game FBS week weren't overly dramatic as voters adjusted their ballots for all the championship game results. But just because a team did not play does not mean it did not see some movement as the resumes and rankings were adjusted with new information, so we've detailed some of the notable movements in the Mover's Report below the top 25 table.College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Indiana13-022Ohio State12-113Georgia12-144Texas Tech12-135Oregon11-156Texas A&M11-167Ole Miss11-178Oklahoma10-2119Notre Dame10-2810Miami10-21211Alabama10-31012BYU11-2913Vanderbilt10-21314Utah10-21415Texas9-31516USC9-31617Michigan9-31918Arizona9-32119Tulane11-22220James Madison12-12021Virginia10-31722Georgia Tech9-32323North Texas11-21824Houston9-32625Iowa8-427Biggest movers No. 40 Boise State (+12): The Broncos rallied from a midseason injury to starting quarterback Maddux Madsen to finish strong and then claim yet another Mountain West championship on the way out the door as the program prepares to make its move to the Pac-12 in the offseason. Boise State jumped out to a big lead against UNLV in the conference title game and defended it the rest of the way to finish 9-4 and jump ahead of a dozen other teams in the rankings. No. 63 Western Michigan (+9): It has not been since the P.J. Fleck era that Western Michigan has experienced the kind of success the Broncos saw under Lance Taylor in 2025. The team came a long way from lopsided nonconference losses to Michigan and Pitt and finished the season playing its best football to claim the MAC Championship. No. 57 Kennesaw State (+8): A thriller between Kennesaw State and Jacksonville State was decided with Amari Odom and the Owls coming up with clutch play in the final minute, and this program completed one of the most impressive year-over-year turnarounds in the country. From two wins a year ago to 10 wins and a conference title, Kennesaw State deservedly got some attention from our voters in their post-championship week adjustments.  No. 21 Virginia (-4): The Wahoos' overtime loss to Duke in the ACC Championship Game did not do a ton of damage to the resume, which still hangs on the strength of 10 wins. Our voters moved up Michigan and Arizona ahead of the Wahoos, along with conference winners Tulane and JMU, but weren't ready to put Virginia behind ACC foe Georgia Tech. No. 23 North Texas (-5): The rankings resume for the Mean Green has always been powered by a high win total (11), so any additional loss was going to lead to a correction when you start putting the resume under a microscope. Not only did North Texas give up some ground to Tulane after the loss to the Green Wave, but it fell behind JMU and a few other power conference squads. No. 48 UNLV (-9): The Rebels have been among the most volatile teams to rank all season long. The strength of schedule isn't great but the win total (10-3) has been impressive for much of the year. By beating UCLA early this was a team that got on our voters' radar, but after each of the three losses they've taken a tumble in the rankings. Even though Boise State is s big riser in this week's ranking, our voters brought an equally aggressive move down for the Mountain West Championship Game loser. Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Despite Lane Kiffin's exit for LSU, the majority of the Ole Miss coaching staff will remain together for the Rebels' College Football Playoff run. The team already announced that offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. will see the season through before he follows Kiffin to LSU, and according to ESPN, four other offensive assistants returned to Oxford for the postseason. Tight ends coach Joe Cox, wide receivers coach George McDonald, assistant quarterbacks coach Dane Stevens and slot wide receivers coach Sawyer Jordan will reprise their roles as Ole Miss assistants during the CFP.Each of the four coaches, plus Weis, will assume their regular duties with LSU once the Rebels complete their playoff run. With the transfer portal set to open Jan. 2, they could have to balance postseason coaching at Ole Miss with recruiting tasks at LSU if the Rebels advance deep enough in the bracket.That Kiffin is permitting a handful of LSU assistants to temporarily return to Ole Miss is arguably unsurprising given his stated desire to coach the Rebels through the CFP.\"I was hoping to complete a historic six season run with this year's team by leading Ole Miss through the playoffs, capitalizing on the team's incredible success and their commitment to finish strong, and investing everything into a playoff run with guardrails in place to protect the program in any areas of concern,\" Kiffin said after accepting his LSU offer. \"My request to do so was denied by Keith Carter despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance.\"Weis, Cox, McDonald, Stevens and Jordan will reunite with quarterbacks coach Joe Judge, running backs coach Kevin Smith and offensive line coach John Garrison. Those three were already announced as assistants who would remain with the Rebels through the CFP, at least.\nThe majority of Ole Miss' defensive staff also remains intact for the postseason. The Rebels announced former defensive coordinator Pete Golding as their permanent head coach, and he figures to retain select assistants for 2026. Secondary coach Bryan Brown, for one, will stay as Golding's defensive coordinator.Staff moves brighten Ole Miss' CFP outlookIt is a victory for Ole Miss to temporarily reconstruct the coaching staff with the assistants who helped build one of college football's most dominant offenses. While Kiffin's offensive acumen will be missing, Weis' return and the presence of numerous top staffers should offer enough continuity to keep the Rebels firing on all cylinders.The first round of the CFP pits Ole Miss against Tulane for a rematch of their Sept. 20 non-conference clash. It was with this same offensive staff that the Rebels lit up the scoreboard in a 45-10 win over the Green Wave the first time around, so the expectation will be to find similar success in the Dec. 20 contest and, in turn, advance to the second round.\nOle Miss offensive rankingsCategoryPer-game averageNational rankingScoring37.3 points11Total offense498.1 yards3Passing offense309.6 yards3Rushing offense188.5 yards31The Rebels need their offense to click in order to survive beyond that playoff-opening date with the Green Wave. The winner faces Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, and when Ole Miss met the Bulldogs in the regular season, not even its 35 points was enough to defeat Kirby Smart's team in a 43-35 loss.\n            ",

That's why the Rangers (78-84 in 2024) have better 2026 Draft Lottery odds than the Giants (80-82 in 2024) even though the two clubs finished with identical 81-81 records in 2025.Why are the Rockies not eligible? Despite going 43-119 this past season, baseball's worst record by 17 games, the Rockies are not eligible for a lottery pick in next year's draft. That's because teams cannot pick in the lottery in more than two consecutive years and Colorado had the No. 3 pick in 2024 and the No. 4 pick in 2025. That bumps them out of the lottery in 2026. The earliest the Rockies can pick is No. 10 overall.Why are the Angels and Nationals not eligible?Teams that pay into the league's revenue-sharing program cannot hold lottery picks in consecutive years. The Nationals (No. 1 pick in 2025) and the Angels (No. 2 pick in 2025) both fall into this bucket. They pay revenue sharing, so last year's lottery picks bump them out of this year's lottery. Like the Rockies, the Angels and Nationals cannot pick any earlier than No. 10 overall. This rule is why the White Sox were ineligible for the 2025 Draft Lottery despite losing 121 games in 2024. They pay revenue sharing and had the No. 5 pick in 2024.The rest of the first round Previously, the Draft order was set by the reverse order of the previous year's standings. It was nice and easy. Now the top six picks are determined through the lottery, the remaining 12 non-postseason teams then pick in reverse order of the standings (picks 7-18), and the 12 postseason teams pick in order of their finish (picks 19-30).  Furthermore, within each \"tier\" of postseason finish, those teams pick in reverse order of the standings, with teams that receive revenue sharing picking before teams that pay into revenue sharing. Got it? Good. Here is the order for the No. 19-30 picks: Wild Card Series losers19. Reds (83-79, receive revenue sharing)20. Guardians (88-74, receive revenue sharing)21. Red Sox (89-73, pay revenue sharing)22. Padres (90-72, pay revenue sharing)Division Series losers23. Tigers (87-75, receive revenue sharing)24. Cubs (92-70, pay revenue sharing)25. Yankees (94-68, pay revenue sharing)26. Phillies (96-66, pay revenue sharing)Championship Series losers 27. Mariners (90-72, receive revenue sharing) 28. Brewers (97-65, receive revenue sharing) World Series loser 29. Blue Jays (94-68) World Series winner 30. Dodgers (93-69) This order is not final. The Dodgers, Mets, and Yankees will all have their first-round pick moved back 10 spots because of their competitive balance tax (CBT) status. Teams that exceed the third CBT threshold ($281 million in 2025) have their first rounder pushed back 10 spots. The Yankees and Dodgers will get bumped back from Nos. 25 and 30 to Nos. 35 and 40, respectively. We don't know where the Mets will pick yet because they're eligible for the lottery. Lottery picks are not subject to CBT penalties. If the Mets move into the top six picks in the lottery, the penalty will be applied to their second-round pick, and that will be moved back instead. New York keeps a lottery pick. Otherwise their first rounder moves back 10 spots. The rest of the draft Only the first round is set using the Lottery. The order of rounds 2-20 is the reverse order of this year's standings, so the MLB-worst Rockies will have the first pick of the second round regardless of how the lottery shakes out. There are also free-agent compensation and competitive balance round picks scattered throughout the draft. Those additional picks will be determined throughout the offseason. Tuesday's lottery will set the first-round order. Everything after that is TBD as the offseason plays out. \n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here.\nAs a Notre Dame fan since birth, I'm still licking my wounds this Tuesday morning. That is neither here nor there, however, as those in my camp have to accept the reality that there is no chance at a CFP championship this year.Instead, we look ahead at a Tuesday full of sports action. From the return of the UEFA Champions League to NHL, NBA and NCAA basketball action, there is plenty of action -- enough to move past any personal bitterness one might have over the CFP selections. There is no shortage of drama on the sports landscape. Let's get caught up on what you need to know to get your big sports day started. \n 🏈 Five things to know Tuesday Chargers defeat Eagles in overtime after ugly, turnover-filled game. It was a Monday Night Fiasco for Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was picked off four times and fumbled once to help the Chargers claim the 22-19 overtime win. There was actually a wild sequence in the second quarter in which there were three turnovers on one play -- and Hurts accounted for two of them. But the Chargers were far from perfect as they committed three turnovers in a game that also saw 13 penalties. The loss, the Eagles' third straight, still leaves Philadelphia (8-5) with a decent lead over Dallas (6-6-1) in the race for the NFC East crown, and L.A. (9-4) kept pace with Denver (11-2) in the AFC West. With Monday night's action officially in the books, we have our final grades for Week 14 and the updated 2026 NFL Draft order, complete with an analysis of every team's projected needs.Four Heisman finalists are heading for New York. As usual, it's a quarterback-heavy list, with Indiana's Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin among the four finalists. While Notre Dame may have been snubbed from the CFP, star running back Jeremiyah Love was not. Meanwhile, Mendoza is the favorite to be selected first overall in next year's draft.Shedeur Sanders named Browns QB1 for the rest of the season. Coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed to reporters on Monday that Sanders will start the remainder of Cleveland's games this season. Sanders had a rough beginning to his starts under center before things clicked on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and three touchdowns in a loss to the Titans.As the CFP looms ... We offer this week's installment of our College Football Power Rankings for all 12 teams in the playoff field. While Ohio State and Indiana are favored to meet in a Big Ten championship game rematch, some of our experts figure things will play out differently over the next few weeks.Champions League action resumes on Tuesday. One of the biggest annual sporting events in the world resumes on Tuesday afternoon, as a host of UEFA Champions League matches stream on Paramount+ in the men's and women's tournaments. We have a list of burning questions on the men's side, including how Liverpool plays without Mohamed Salah, as well as our UCL Power Rankings and expert picks and predictions. We also have our Women's Champions League Power Rankings. ☘️ Do not miss this: Drama continues after Notre Dame misses CFP \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The College Football Playoff snub felt in South Bend, Indiana, and beyond continued to dominate the news cycle on Monday. As a lifelong Notre Dame fan, I can admit to being frustrated with the situation, but the Fighting Irish haven't been doing themselves any favors in the court of public opinion since being left out of this year's championship tournament. After Sunday's decision not to play in a bowl game, which is a decision Tom Fornelli said signals the coming end of bowl games entirely, Pete Bevacqua, the school's athletic director, said that the ACC's campaigning for Miami over Notre Dame caused \"permanent damage\" to the relationship between the university and athletic conference. While Notre Dame icon Joe Theismann described the CFP's decision as \"disgusting\" and \"deplorable,\" there is some hope that Irish fans never see this outcome again. The university signed a memorandum of understanding with the committee that states the Fighting Irish will automatically qualify for any 12-team playoff where Notre Dame ranks in the top 12 -- or any 14-team playoff where the team sits at least No. 13 in the rankings. The Irish's 2026 schedule doesn't appear to include many hurdles to reaching the bracket next year.  🏈 Are the Chiefs going to miss the playoffs? \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            At the start of the NFL season, it seemed unfathomable that the Chiefs and Ravens would miss the playoffs. However, that has become quite the possibility now that both teams are rocking records that are ... 6-7 -- that one's for you kids. The Chiefs will not win the AFC West for the first time in nine seasons, and Kansas City's streak of 10 straight playoff appearances is in massive jeopardy. That door hasn't yet closed, but there's only a narrow path to making the playoffs. \nOne of the key issues for Kansas City has been a banged-up offensive line. That trend continued on Sunday, and now Wanya Morris is out for the season with a knee injury. While things are increasingly dire in 2025, CBS Sports' Tyler Sullivan says things could get even worse for the Chiefs next season. Sullivan: \"Specifically, Kansas City's road schedule in 2026 is projected to be a gauntlet with trips to Buffalo, Los Angeles and Seattle on deck, with the possible addition of Cincinnati. Collectively, their road opponents (excluding the rest of the AFC West) are 43-35 this season through Week 14. Their home opponents (excluding the rest of the AFC West) are 34-31. While the home schedule is a touch lighter, hosting the Patriots and 49ers won't be gimmies whatsoever.\" 🏀 A pivotal moment in NCAA basketball rankings \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Since the 2009-2010 season, every eventual college basketball national champion has been ranked in the top 12 of the Week 6 AP Top 25 poll. That's a wild stat, but it's also where we are currently at in the current season. So, can we take this week's poll and decide that one of those teams will cut the net at the end of March Madness? Here's a list of the top 12 in the most recent AP Top 25 poll. 1. Arizona 2. Michigan 3. Duke 4. Iowa State 5. UConn 6. Purdue 7. Houston 8. Gonzaga 9. Michigan State 10. BYU 11. Louisville 12. Alabama \nArizona also grabbed the top spot in this week's Top 25 And 1 rankings, but Michigan has grabbed the No. 1 spot in the coaches poll. On the women's side, UConn remained in the top spot in the AP Top 25.  👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Christian Pulisic scored two goals after coming off the bench in the second half to lead AC Milan to a 3-2 road win over Torino. The USMNT captain was dealing with the flu Sunday and didn't travel until the day of the match.The Colts quarterback situation is dire as Riley Leonard is now battling a strained knee ligament after stepping in for an injured Daniel Jones on Sunday. In response, Indianapolis has opted to bring in 44-year-old Philip Rivers for a visit.With things down to bowl games and the CFP, we've identified the top quarterbacks who could enter the transfer portal ahead of next season.Commanders tight end Zach Ertz will be out the remainder of the NFL season after suffering an ACL tear.Bengals' defensive end Trey Hendrickson is set to undergo core muscle surgery that will sideline him into the playoffs, if Cincinnati somehow makes it that far.In more positive news, Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels avoided a long-term injury after landing hard on his left elbow in a game against the Vikings.New Ole Miss coach Pete Golding took a small shot at former coach Lane Kiffin, saying, \"I ain't going to yoga.\"Tulane tabbed its next coach, saying Will Hall will replace Jon Sumrall after the College Football Playoff.Tennessee has parted ways with defensive coordinator Tim Banks, with coach Josh Heupel saying, \"He helped restore our program to national prominence.\"UFC middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev said that he will defend his championship once before jumping to light heavyweight in search of another title. 📺 What we're watching Tuesday We're watching Champions League soccer on Paramount+ all day 🏀 Heat at Magic, 6 p.m. on Prime Video 🏀 Villanova at No. 2 Michigan (M), 6:30 on FS1 🏀 Clemson at No. 10 BYU (M), 6:30 on ESPN 🏒 Golden Knights at Islanders, 7 p.m. on TNT/HBO Max 🏀 Knicks at Raptors, 8:30 p.m. on Prime Video 🏀 No. 18 Florida at No. 5 UConn (M), 9 p.m. on ESPN 🏒 Avalanche at Predators, 9:30 p.m. on TNT/HBO Max \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Russell Henley enters the new season as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii. The American enters as the fifth-ranked golfer in the men's top 200. The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu,  Hawaii. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards. Henley is the +1100 favorite (risk $100 to win $1,100) in the 2026 Sony Open odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Hideki Matsuyama and Ben Griffin at +1700, J.J. Spaun at +1800, and Si Woo Kim, Robert MacIntyre and Collin Morikawa at +2000. Before making any 2026 Sony Open picks, you need to see the 2026 Sony Open predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 Sony Open field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 Sony Open expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 Sony Open predictions: He's fading Tom Hoge, the 36-year-old TCU grad. He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.Another golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +1100. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically. I imagine it will turn around for a player of his caliber, but I am not going to count on it happening just yet. In five prior visits to Waialae, Finau has missed the cut twice and never finished better than 20th.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000, with Keegan Bradley close behind at +2200 and Maverick McNealy at +2500. Spieth is +4500, just a bit behind defending champion Nick Taylor, who is +4000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +1800 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        Speaking to the media days after firing John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said he hopes to have a Lamar Jackson extension done by the start of free agency in March, with the goal of lowering Jackson's $74.5 million cap hit in 2026.For reference, the highest cap hit in 2025 was Dak Prescott at just over $50 million.\"I want [Jackson] to be my quarterback,\" Bisciotti said. \"... The urgency of that matters to me because we've got free agents, and I don't want to go into free agency with that hanging over our head. And I made that clear to Lamar and I think he was very appreciative of my stance and hopefully willing to work with [Ravens GM] Eric [DeCosta] and not get this thing dragged out into April like the last time. It was very hard for [DeCosta] to build a roster when that thing is not settled.\"\"Like the last time\" is worth noting. Jackson, who does not have an agent and represents himself in contract negotiations, has stated multiple times that he wants to stay in Baltimore. But the last time the two sides worked on a contract extension, it took three years. Jackson was eligible for an extension in 2021, after his third NFL season, but the two sides didn't come to an agreement. In 2022, Bisciotti seemed to pin the lack of negotiations on Jackson.\n\"Unless he has a change of heart and calls Eric and says 'I'm ready,' Eric can't keep calling him and say, 'You really need to get in here,'\" Bisciotti said in March 2022. \"That's not a GM's job.\"In 2023, the situation reached fever pitch. The Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him, a move that allowed him to negotiate with other teams. A few days later, Jackson revealed he had requested a trade weeks prior as Baltimore wasn't \"interested  in meeting [his] value.\"Then in late April 2023, Jackson signed a five-year, $260 million extension with Baltimore.\n\n        \n            \n                Assessing past, present, future of Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh, Ravens as contract negotiations loom\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBisciotti also said Tuesday that if the two sides couldn't agree to an extension, the team would lower Jackson's cap hit by spreading it into void years, though that's a far less desirable outcome.\"We want another window, and Lamar knows that,\" Bisciotti said. \"I think that he's amenable to doing something that mirrors the last deal he did, although the annual number will be a little higher. But I'm hoping that it's 'Plug a new number in the same contract he signed last year' and move on.\"The Ravens are coming off arguably the most disappointing season in the NFL, falling from preseason Super Bowl favorites to an 8-9 record and missing the playoffs entirely. Baltimore fired Harbaugh after 18 years and will look to reload around Jackson, 29. The two-time MVP, who missed four games due to injury, will be actively involved and have \"a lot of say\" in the hiring process, Bisciotti added.\n\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens?

    "body": "\n        After Kansas lost to West Virginia on Saturday to fall to 1-12 in Big 12 play, Jayhawks coach coach Bill Self ripped his team, saying \"we suck right now.\" Self's assessment didn't age well Tuesday when the unranked Jayhawks put on their best showing of the season and upset No. 2 Iowa State 84-63 in emphatic fashion at Allen Fieldhouse to hand the Cyclones (16-1, 3-1 Big 12) their first loss of the season.Kansas (12-5, 2-2) went wire-to-wire with the win and dominated on both ends with a season-high 12 made 3-pointers on the offensive end while forcing 12 turnovers on the other end from an ISU team typically careful with the ball. Every major piece clicked for KU including star freshman guard Darryn Peterson, who had 16 points and five boards. Fellow backcourt mate Tre White added 19 points -- a game-high -- of his own. Fifteen of White's 19 points came from the 3-point line.\nThe dominant win for Kansas is more of the same vs. an Iowa State program it has dominated historically and recently. The win extended KU's winning streak vs. the Cyclones in games played in Lawrence to eight games, and improved its record in the last 11 meetings to 8-3. KU now holds a 100-16 record vs. ISU in games played in Lawrence.Self's proclamation over the weekend that his team sucks right now was not tongue-in-cheek -- but it was made with a heavy emphasis on the latter part of that statement. \"But it's right now,\" Self said. \"Everybody goes through ebbs and flows in the season. ... We've got to flip it.\"\nIt's just one game -- an impressive one, to be clear, but still just one game -- so we can't declare KU flipped. Not yet. But KU dominated one of the best teams in college basketball in a way that cannot be ignored. For a KU team that has been riding a roller coaster much of the season, this could serve as an inflection point to get its season back on track. For Iowa State, it loses the chance to be the last remaining unbeaten team (only four remain) and it takes a tally in the loss column -- but there is no reason to panic. The Cyclones didn't have their best stuff Tuesday. Kansas did. It happens. It was ugly, to be sure, and out of character. ISU's mighty defense gave up 50.8% shooting from the field to Kansas, 12-of-24 shooting from 3-point range and forced only nine turnovers. No team has made ISU look more fallible this season than Kansas.\nDespite the loss, ISU is still tracking toward a potential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and remains a real contender in a wide-open Big 12.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith have all committed to play on LIV Golf for the 2026 season following the departure of Brooks Koepka for the PGA Tour. Talking at LIV Golf's media week in South Florida, DeChambeau noted that he is under contract for the upcoming season while Rahm and Smith stated they had no plans to go anywhere.\"I'm contracted through 2026, so excited about this year,\" DeChambeau said.\"Yeah, I'm not planning on going anywhere, so very similar answer to what Bryson gave,\" Rahm said. \"I wish Brooks the best, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on LIV for this year and hoping my team can repeat as champs.\"Meanwhile, Smith told Golf Digest's Evin Priest, \"I made a decision to come here and I stand by it.\"\nOn Monday, the PGA Tour announced the creation of the Returning Member Program targeted at four members of LIV Golf -- Koepka, Rahm, DeChambeau and Smith. Under the pathway back to the PGA Tour, those players who had won a major championship or the Players Championship from 2022-25 would be allow to play on the PGA Tour in 2026. The transfer window opened Monday and will close on Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf's first tournament of its 2026 season.Koepka mutually parted ways with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, 2025 citing the desire to spend more time with his family. The five-time major champion applied for his PGA Tour membership to be reinstated and utilized this newly-created mechanism to return in 2026 with his first start coming at the Farmers Insurance Open at the end of January.DeChambeau and Smith have both been with LIV Golf since the summer of 2022 while Rahm came over to the league at the onset of 2024. Since then, Rahm has collected two straight season-long individual crowns with his Legion XIII squad taking home the team title as well in 2025. Smith's Ripper GC won the team competition in 2024 while DeChambeau's Crushers raised the trophy the year prior.\nLIV Golf is moving to 72 holes for the first time in league history in the 2026 season in hopes of appeasing the Official World Golf Rankings for its players to earn points from. The league applied again recently for that purpose. Its season begins Feb. 4 when the circuit travels to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \n            ",

Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.Contrary to the belief of some, Major League Baseball is an excellent product right now. People have been lamenting that \"baseball is dying\" for well over 100 years -- for real, you can find articles from the early 1900s saying as much -- and it's not even remotely true. Baseball is very healthy. That doesn't mean things couldn't improve. For example, pitchers are too good. The velocity at which they are throwing stuff that moves just isn't all too fair to today's hitters. There's a relatively long line of former players who love to lament that today's hitters just have terrible approaches. Even if you think the approaches at the plate could be better, it's lunacy to suggest the league batting average sits at .245 instead of, say, .265, based solely on hitter approach. As a friend of mine likes to say, \"pitchers are witches.\" It isn't just the pitchers, though. The defenders are more athletic and positioned better than ever. Arms at shortstop and third base are better than they used to be, allowing these defenders to play deeper than several decades ago, meaning their range increases on grounders that might've bled through the infield for singles back in the 1970s. \nIn terms of the positioning, I have one possibly nitpicky complaint. You know those notecard-sized item players pull out of their pocket between at-bats? These are defensive cheat sheets. Teams fill these out for every single hitter on the opposite team. They've studied everything possible about each hitter and have an ideal defensive positioning chart that corresponds to the research. Even without data, it sure feels like players hit the ball hard right at a defender, whether in the infield or outfield, more often these days. Teams are amazing at positioning their fielders. Again, it might be a nitpick, but couldn't we at least cut this out? See how many defensive players can remember where they are supposed to be for each hitter on the opposing team or at least make the coaching staff try to move them -- old-school style -- from the dugout with hand signals.\nIs this petty? Probably. I'm OK with that. The pitchers and defense already have so many advantages in baseball; we don't need them to have the extra layer of an open-book test on defense. Lose the cheat sheets!\n            ",

If recent history is any indication, the Under should hit with points to spare. Each of the last 10 meetings have gone under not only 154.5 points, but none of them have even reached 150 combined points. Those 10 meetings have averaged just 124.8 total points.Granted most of those came under former UVA coach Tony Bennett, and his preferred slow pace implemented on the Cavaliers, but Virginia still ranks 262nd in the country in tempo this season. The Under is 9-7 for Virginia, as each of its last three, and five of its last six games have gone under. Louisville also has an Under record of 9-7, with each of its last three also failing to reach the total. The model projects 152 combined points as the Under hits in 54% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Virginia vs. Louisville, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        On Monday, Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott revealed wide receiver Gabe Davis tore his ACL in the Bills' 27-24 wild card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tyrell Shavers was being evaluated for a knee injury.Tuesday, the bad news continued to come in: Shavers also tore his ACL, leaving the Bills with just three healthy wide receivers on their active roster: Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman and Khalil ShakirNicknamed \"Big Game Gabe\" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.\nShavers, 26, had started to come on as an important piece. After catching just one pass last year, he had 15 catches for 245 yards and one touchdown this season. He also had a 14-yard catch against the Jaguars for a key first down.McDermott said Shavers suffered the injury during a punt in the first half but played through it in the second half. He called the effort \"unbelievable\" and \"remarkable.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBills receiver situation vs. BroncosBuffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.\nShakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.Shavers (54% snap share) and Cooks (48%) were next in line Sunday. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops.The only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.\nWith Davis, Palmer and Shavers out, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play.The Bills also added Kristian Wilkerson to the practice squad Tuesday, and he joins Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell there. Wilkerson has not appeared in a game this season, Hardman has appeared in just two games this season while battling injuries, and Gosnell has never appeared in an NFL game.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race ",
    "body": "\n        Antoine Semenyo couldn't ask for a better start to his Manchester City career. Whether he can make the difference in the Premier League race remains to be seen, but so far, so good. His goal helped break a deadlock and secure a 2-0 victory in the first leg of the EFL Cup semifinals away at St. James' Park. During the entire season, City's attack has been calling out for who would be the second player to look to in the attack after Erling Haaland, and while it's early in his City career, being able to get his first and second goal out of the way will bode well for upcoming Premier League and Champions League games.Rayan Cherki was able to add an insurance goal late, which will ensure that City have a two-goal advantage for the second leg, which will take place on Feb. 4 at the Etihad Stadium live on Paramount+.It's easy to look past Semenyo getting a goal in a match where City scored 10 at the weekend in the FA Cup, but in an away trip to face Newcastle, opportunities were hard to come by, and when City needed him most, Semenyo popped into space to deliver an all-important goal. Newcastle United limited Haaland's impact well, so someone had to step up, and while coming into the season, it would've been expected for that to be Phil Foden, it was the new man who made the impact.\nSemenyo's immediate impact shouldn't come as a surprise as he didn't score 10 Premier League goals with Bournemouth by accident, but his creativity also will bring more to City, too. A master of long throws, Semenyo also has three assists this season and will be able to add more playing with such a talented City squad. The Manchester derby looms this weekend with Manchester United just announcing Michael Carrick as their interim manager for the remainder of the season, and if Semenyo can score in a third consecutive match, he'll go a long way to endear himself to his new fans.City needed a player who could slot seamlessly into the attack alongside the creativity of Jeremy Doku, and they may have done just that. Defenders will be punished for devoting too much attention to Haaland, with a player like Semenyo roaming the wings will make things happen. Only two players, Igor Thiago and Haaland, have scored more goals than Semenyo's 10 in the Premier League this season as his hit rate from the wing has been nothing short of impressive in 20 matches played. The opposition will get tougher now playing in the Champions League, but his supporting cast will also improve with the switch to Manchester.\nAdding wingers hasn't gone well recently for Pep Guardiola with players like Savinho and Omar Marmoush struggling to settle at the Etihad, but the difference in Semenyo is that he's already a Premier League-proven attacker, so he only needs to adjust to the Guardiola way of life and not that and English soccer. Given this start, he's adjusting well to City, and who knows, the Premier League may feel like it's Arsenal's to lose, but the gap is only six points. If City can kick on and make things happen between now and the end of the season, they'll have every chance to reclaim the Premier League title, but any success will need Semenyo to keep his scoring touch going.\n            ",

Davis had been out for the past two games for Dallas, seeking multiple opinions on if surgery was needed for the injury. It's been determined that surgery will not be needed, per ESPN and he'll be reevaluated in six weeks. He sustained the injury during Dallas' 116-114 loss to the Utah Jazz last week, when his hand got caught in Lauri Markkanen's jersey while defending him under the basket.When the injury occurred, Davis immediately began grabbing at his hand in pain and came out of the game. He walked back to the locker room, but paused for a moment in the tunnel doubled over in pain.\nWhen the Mavericks traveled to Chicago to face the Bulls Jan. 10, Davis was seen in a sling with his hand heavily wrapped. Missing the next six weeks means Davis won't return until after the Feb. 5 trade deadline, but that seemingly won't stop the Mavericks from shopping him around on the trade market.\nIf Davis returns to the floor this season, he could be doing so for a different team, as ESPN reports that Dallas still plans to make him available on the trade market. Given Davis' current injured status, as well as his hefty contract and lengthy injury history, determining what team would be willing to take the risk to take him on is difficult.There was thought that the Hawks could make a run at Davis, especially after they traded Trae Young to the Wizards, which makes them able to take on the $54.1 million Davis is owed this season. That interest may have dissipated with him now out for at least a month and a half.\nIf there is a team out there who still wants Davis, the Mavericks will have to sell low on the big man. That's a consequence of trading for an oft-injured player who hasn't been able to stay on the floor long enough to rebuild his trade value. The Raptors have been linked to Davis in the past, so too have the Bulls and Warriors at one point or another. But at this point, it would be more shocking for Davis to be traded before the deadline than to see him suit up for the Mavericks again this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NEWARK, N.J. — For Dan Hurley's Connecticut Huskies, 2025-26 has become all about exorcising the demons from a season ago. No matter how those exorcisms happen.On Tuesday night, the hardest purging one yet.Last year's Huskies famously didn't get that unobtainable three-peat in 2025, but their chase for a third national title in four seasons is very much on thanks to their latest win, this one a vindicating 69-64 victory vs. Seton Hall on Tuesday. With the win, the Huskies are 17-1 overall and 7-0 to start league play for the first time since 1998-99 — the season of UConn's first NCAA championship.Now it's chasing a seventh. The path through the Big East looks significantly easier this season vs. last. Still, one the team's toughest tests came vs. the Pirates. No. 3 UConn was up by 18 points in the second half and seemingly on its way to a cruise-control road win against 25th-ranked Seton Hall. Instead, the Huskies succumbed to the Pirates' full-court press in the final 10 minutes and wound up narrowly escaping, winning despite 17 turnovers. \"These guys STICK to you,\" Hurley said. \"They're very quick.\"UConn's victory was ultimately aided by the fact that Seton Hall, which ranks near the bottom of 3-point accuracy among all Power Five teams (31.4%), was a season-worst 1-of-16 from beyond the arc. Connecticut was barely better, managing a mere 3-of-17 showing from deep. Seton Hall's only 3-pointer came in the final minute, when Pirates junior guard Mike Williams III hit a trey to cut the lead to two with 48 seconds remaining. Well-timed, but too little too late. \n\n        \n            \n                Kansas upsets No. 2 Iowa State: Jayhawks hand Cyclones first loss just days after Bill Self says 'we suck'\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Huskies' victory marked the first time in 58 months — since March 3, 2021 — that Connecticut beat SHU on the road. And it did it in escape-route fashion in the final minute. UConn point guard Silas Demary Jr. sank two foul shots with less than 30 seconds remaining to put the Huskies up 67-64. The Rock was thumping. Then Williams III tried another 3, only to have it blocked by Husky freshman guard Braylon Mullins. A scramble ensued. Who wound up with the ball underneath?Demary. He hit two more freebies to give the game its final score. A UConn team beating opponents by 16.6 points on average had to settle for a five-point edge, nearly blowing an 18-point lead along the way. That kind of twist can send Hurley into a fit against many teams and on many nights. But not this one. \nThat's because the Pirates are a viable potential NCAA tourney squad, at least in Hurley's view. \"That's a team that's going to compete at the top of the league,\" said Hurley, \"I wouldn't want to see Seton Hall's name drawn next to mine in the NCAA Tournament this year, I can tell you that.\"The Hall's rise has been one of the surprises of the season. SHU was picked last in the Big East in the preseason, yet no team at the Power Five level has jumped more in KenPom's ratings from October until now than the Pirates (50 spots: from 93rd on opening day to 43rd after Tuesday's loss). \nSweet revenge and a win to separate in-leagueTuesday night was about survival, Hurley said, and of course ending the road streak against his alma mater. UConn had lost its last four trips down to the Prudential Center — yes, including both NCAA title seasons under Hurley earlier this decade — and so this victory is surely a balm on his soul. Though he swears it wasn't something weighing on him until this past weekend. \"You're obviously not thinking about it in the preseason. You're not thinking about it in the summer. You're not thinking about it in October,\" Hurley told CBS Sports in the UConn locker room afterward. \"But then when you get to two days out and the media reminds you that you've lost four in a row here, and that chip gets implanted somewhere in the brain, you try not to think about that.\"Says who? With the comfort of heading home with a win, UConn senior forward Alex Karaban readily admitted he was thinking about it.\n\"A lot of anger just walking into this arena,\" he said. That anger was channeled appropriately in the first half, when UConn went into the break with a 35-22 lead. Karaban finished with 13 points and avoided an O-fer at Seton Hall for his lauded college career.\"It was never 'here we go again,'\" he said. \"It was staying together. It was similar to BYU in a way.\"Connecticut's win vs. BYU in November was another game that was won because of Demary's poise late. On the whole on this night, the most valuable player on the floor was Tarris Reed Jr., who had 21 points and nine boards. \n\"That's real against those guys,\" Hurley said of Reed's showing against Shaheen Holloway's team. \"I just have so much respect for how hard his teams play. His team may be the hardest-playing team in the country.\"Huskies can win in myriad waysIn a down year for the Big East (where questions linger about if the league can play itself to even four NCAA bids), Tuesday was a chance for Seton Hall to vault its national profile. This was the school's first ranked-on-ranked home game since Jan. 1, 2022. The comeback was impressive — UConn somehow only took one field goal attempt in the final five minutes, a feat that almost definitely will not be repeated the rest of the season — but the Huskies made just enough plays to get it done. A Seton Hall win would've been better for the Big East. UConn's on a tier to itself in the conference, though. It's winning in a lot of ways, including dramatics as of late. Last Wednesday, UConn overcame a 13-point gap with less than nine minutes remaining to slip out with an OT win at middling Providence. There have also been emphatic defeats over Illinois, Kansas and Florida.\nThe defense is closing in on efficiency numbers that are in earshot of the Hurley's two title teams.\"We've shown some special qualities,\" Hurley told CBS Sports. \"With our injuries and the schedule, and we've won well, but haven't played as well (lately). Especially at the offensive end and on the backboard, in terms of the turnovers, and some rebounding issues that I think are fixable with this team.\" Hurley said if the turnovers and rebounding get worked out, UConn is as strong as any team in the country with as good of a chance at the title as anyone. And he's right. The Huskies are 5-0 on the road. That's a better road record than anyone else in high-major basketball, and only second to Miami-Ohio's 8-0 mark. (The RedHawks are a college hoops-best 18-0 after their 100-61 win vs. Central Michigan win Tuesday.) \nThe Huskies have won 13 in a row since their shorthanded loss at home to No. 1 Arizona in November. It looks like this team's worst-case scenario in the Big East will be an 18-2 run of the regular season. Villanova and St. John's both are playing well, but beyond that, challengers will be hard to come by. When UConn lost in overtime at Seton Hall a year ago — vs. a SHU team that would finish with just seven wins — Hurley called the ride back that night a \"coffin on wheels.\"I asked him late Tuesday: What's the term for this year's trip back to campus?\"Grateful,\" he said. UConn has five Quad 1 wins, tied for second-most with six other teams. But those teams (Arizona, Nebraska, Vanderbilt, Iowa State, BYU) have a lot more opportunities in Q1 because their leagues are so much better and deeper than the Big East.\n\"There's not a lot of chances for us in the league this year to get Quad 1-type games games, to get Quad 1 wins, to get to beat teams that are going to be in the field,\" Hurley said. \"I mean, that's a team (Seton Hall) that's going to be in the field, that's an excellent team. It was actually fun to play a game that we could gain from. I think the group was probably a little bit looser, because it was a game that we could gain from, as opposed to a game that you lose, ow becomes a résumé hit.\" Seton Hall's improvement is huge for the Big East but also beneficial to UConn in this spot. The Huskies are the league's only title national title contender. The start of 2026 has been a bit bumpy, but all signs point to a return to supremacy when it matters most. The next two months will be about asserting dominance, taking back the Big East and positioning themselves for another run into April. Until then, Hurley will surely conjure up a few more demons to hunt.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The change Philadelphia Eagles fans have been waiting for is finally here: head coach Nick Sirianni is making a change at offensive coordinator and removing Kevin Patullo from that role. Philadelphia took a significant step back offensively with Patullo as the offensive play caller in place of Kellen Moore after he departed to become the New Orleans Saints head coach following the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX triumph. Quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for under 200 yards nine times in the 2025 regular season, which was the second most such games with Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young (12) having more. That's astounding considering Hurts possesses running back Saquon Barkley, wide receiver A.J. Brown, wide receiver DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert at his disposal with a stout offensive line in front of him. Barkley averaged just 71.3 rush yards per game this season after averaging 125.3 in his 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year campaign in 2024. Brown had zero catches in the second half of a game five times, which is the same amount times the following top wide receivers had combined in 2025: Ja'Marr Chase (one), Justin Jefferson (one), Puka Nacua (one), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (zero), Amon-Ra St. Brown (one), CeeDee Lamb (one) and George Pickens (zero). Eagles last two seasons20242025Record14-311-6Playoff resultWon Super BowlLost wild cardPPG27.2 22.3Total YPG367.2*311.2Rush YPG179.3*116.9* Top 10 in NFL So which established offensive minds will Sirianni pursue in an effort to elevate his squad back to true Super Bowl contention? Here is a look at five potential candidates.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McDaniel, former Miami Dolphins head coachMike McDaniel has already been requested to interview for multiple head-coaching vacancies, so there's a good chance he will remain an NFL head coach in 2026. However, on the off chance he doesn't get one of the NFL's nine vacancies that are currently available, he would be the most coveted offensive coordinator option. His Dolphins offenses averaged 5.78 yards per play, the seventh-best among head coaches in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), minimum 50 games as an NFL head coach.Tua Tagovailoa's connection to Tyreek Hill in McDaniel's first two seasons in Miami, 2022 to 2023, was electric. Hill produced over 1,700 yards receiving in both years, which earned him consecutive first-team All-Pro honors. Perhaps he could do the same with Hurts and Brown if he doesn't become a head coach in 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brian Daboll, former New York Giants head coachBrian Daboll knows a thing or two about building capable NFL offenses around quarterbacks who have limited passing skillsets. Daboll went to the playoffs in 2022 with then-New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones averaging 6.5 air yards per pass attempt, which ranked 31st of 33 qualified quarterbacks that season. Barkley still produced 1,312 yards rushing and 10 rushing touchdowns on under 300 carries, 295 to be exact, that year.Daboll could certainly put together a high-flying offense after being reunited with Barkley and having Brown and Smith at his disposal. Rookie first-round quarterback Jaxson Dart looked like a dual-threat dynamo with Daboll calling the plays before his midseason firing, so there's no reason why he couldn't get Hurts looking more like he did in 2022 and 2024 when Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Frank Reich, former Indianapolis Colts head coachSirianni was Frank Reich's Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator for three seasons from 2018 to 2020 before being hired to be the Eagles head coach in 2021. Reich was also the Eagles' offensive coordinator in 2017 for the franchise's first Super Bowl championship team. Hiring Reich would give Sirianni a trusted confidant and a coordinator who once upon a time had Carson Wentz playing like an NFL MVP candidate. Reich is also available right now after spending one season as Stanford's interim head coach for former Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who is now the general manager of his alma mater's football program. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kliff Kingsbury, former Washington Commanders offensive coordinatorKliff Kingsbury helped Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels produce what stands statistically as the greatest rookie quarterback season in NFL history after their run to the 2024 NFC Championship game. Wide receiver Terry McLaurin caught a Washington franchise record 13 receiving touchdowns in 2024 as well. With Daniels missing 10 games because of injury in 2025, Washington took a step back, which led to Kingsbury parting ways with Washington.If Kingsbury doesn't get his second NFL head-coaching job this offseason, perhaps he could come to the Eagles where he could certainly uplift a talented Philadelphia offense. Jayden Daniels 2024 season with Kliff Kingsbury, including playoffsAll-time rookie rankWins14T-1st*Total yards5,4161stTotal TD371st* Tied with Ben Roethlisberger (2004)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philip Rivers, former Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Chargers quarterbackPhilip Rivers is now done playing professional football, but that doesn't mean his time with the NFL is finished. He's been the head coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, but after getting a taste of football at the highest level again after playing for the Colts in 2025, could he be interested in coaching in the league? If he is, Rivers coming to work with Sirianni to coach the uber-talented Eagles offense would make sense.Sirianni was Rivers' quarterbacks coach on the Chargers for the 2013 and 2024 seasons, and he was Rivers' offensive coordinator with the Colts in 2020. There's a high level of familiarity there, and there wouldn't be a much better opportunity for the eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback to begin his NFL coaching career than with an offense as loaded as the Eagles' unit is entering 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        All bets appear to be off as Mike Tomlin has become the latest former NFL coach to leave his post. While many of his peers were fired since the 2025 regular season concluded, Tomlin was one of the fortunate few NFL coaches who was able to leave on his terms. That's what happened on Tuesday, mere hours after the Steelers' 2025 season came to an end after Pittsburgh lost its seventh straight playoff game under Tomlin. Tomlin and the Steelers' lack of recent playoff success somewhat overshadowed his overall body of work in Pittsburgh that included a Super Bowl win, two AFC titles, eight division titles, 13 playoff appearances and 19 straight non-losing seasons. Still just 53 years old, Tomlin will surely have his share of options regarding what he will do next. And while some potential options are more realistic than others, the recent turnover in the NFL should be a reminder to not rule anything out when it comes to Tomlin and what he might do next. \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin stepping away could give the Steelers the reset they need. It'll be easier said than done\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a quick rundown of Tomlin's likely options as he charts out on a new path. \nCoaching in 2026 While many assumed that Pittsburgh would be his last team, Tomlin recently acknowledged on the Rich Eisen Show that he still loves coaching despite the obvious challenges that come with it. \"Hey, I'm institutionalized,\" he said. \"Man, I gotta have it. I just love the challenges week in and week out that this job provides. The growth in it, the collective growth, the individual growth. A lot of lessons that I've learned in life have been through my football experiences. I've been on the team every year of my life since 1980, and so I really appreciate it.\" In that vein, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone if Tomlin is back on the sidelines in 2026. And if he chooses to coach again, he will likely have his pick of several jobs that are currently open. Having the opportunity to interview for one of the league's current openings may have been one of the reasons why he chose to step down less than 24 hours after the Steelers' season ended. \nOne thing we know is that Tomlin doesn't want to spend time on a rebuild. There's a reason why the Steelers never had a losing season under his watch. He wants the opportunity to win now and every year moving forward. That means that Tomlin's next potential team would have to have a roster that is in position to win now. That could lead to the Atlanta Falcons, who are coming off two disappointing 8-9 seasons despite having several stars on their roster that includes running back Bijan Robinson, wideout Drake London, tight end Kyle Pitts, safety Jessie Bates III, and pass rushers James Pearce Jr. and Jalon Walker, among others. Quarterback remains a question in Atlanta, although the Falcons don't have a bad situation after Kirk Cousins showed major signs of his old form last year after replacing Michael Penix Jr. in the starting lineup. \nOutside of Atlanta, the Ravens would be another appealing landing spot. In Baltimore, Tomlin would have his coveted franchise quarterback in Lamar Jackson and a team that was a play away from defeating the Bills and reaching the AFC title game in 2024. While less appealing, the Browns could also be a possible landing spot for Tomlin. Unlike Atlanta and Baltimore, Tomlin would likely get a statue in Cleveland if he led the Browns to their first division title since 1989. While his consistent streak of non-losing season probably wasn't properly appreciated in Pittsburgh, it undoubtedly would in Cleveland. The Browns are coming off consecutive losing seasons, but they fielded one of the NFL's defenses last season and have an intriguing quarterback room in Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Those things could be selling points for Tomlin, who also wouldn't have to move very far if he ended up in Cleveland. \nThere's a major roadblock, though, which would likely prevent Tomlin from ending up in either Baltimore or Cleveland. That's the fact that the Steelers still own his rights, which means that Pittsburgh would have to approve and then receive compensation should a team try to land Tomlin, which leads us to our next scenario. A jump to media Similar to coaching, there's a belief that Tomlin would have his pick of several media jobs should he chose to go that route. While it probably wouldn't be as gratifying as coaching, a job in the media would allow Tomlin to stay close to the game while working significantly less hours and giving him the chance to showcase his impressive communication skills. Tomlin-isms have become the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh. His weekly Tuesday press conferences typically included some of his patented sayings (my personal favorite was \"When you have red paint, you paint your barn red\") that were often as humurous as they were insightful. \nIt might help that Tomlin's mentor, Tony Dungy, has enjoyed an extremely successful career in broadcasting since he left coaching nearly 20 years ago. Tomlin's predecessor, Bill Cowher, has also enjoyed a highly-successful career in broadcasting that has actually lasted longer than his time as the Steelers coach. From a legacy standpoint, there's no doubt that Dungy and Cowher's relevancy as broadcasters helped both receive induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It would likely do the same for Tomlin, whose career in Pittsburgh largely mimicked the success that Dungy and Cowher had as coaches. A year offIn my opinion, this is the most unlikely scenario. For someone whose boundless energy became the stuff of legend in Pittsburgh, it's far-fetched to imagine Tomlin stashing that energy away for a year in lieu of some down time. \nThat being said, it is definitely possible that Tomlin takes a year to himself before making his next move. Coaching in the NFL is a grind, after all, and Tomlin might be ready for a well-deserved break. A year off would given Tomlin more time with his wife and three adult children. It would also give him some time to enjoy what he was able to accomplish in Pittsburgh before he delves into his next challenge. \n            ",

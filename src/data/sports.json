    "body": "\n        A Saturday tripleheader of 2025 College Football Playoff first-round games begins with the No. 7 Texas A&M Aggies hosting the No. 10 Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes. The Aggies (11-1) won their first 11 games before falling to the Texas Longhorns, 27-17, on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes (10-2) have won four in a row and last defeated Pitt, 38-7, on Nov. 29. This 2025 CFP First Round Game will be the third meeting between the programs since 2022, with the teams splitting the first two matchups.Kickoff is at noon ET from Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. The Hurricanes prevailed 48-33 when the teams last met in Miami in 2023. The Aggies are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Miami vs. Texas A&M odds, while the over/under is 48.5.

Additionally, the Aggies have struggled versus the line since Mike Elko came onboard in 2024, as A&M is just 8-17 ATS since then, with that 32% cover rate being the third-worst amongst Power Conference teams over that span. QB Carson Beck tops the ACC in both completion rate (74.7%) and passing rating (165.8), and his top target, Malachi Toney, is coming off back-to-back games with 125+ receiving yards and a touchdown. That offensive firepower sometimes overshadow the fact that Miami also has the No. 6 scoring defense in FBS and allowed just 16.3 points to its four ranked opponents. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Texas A&M can coverMiami has a recent history of not showing up for bowl games as the Canes have lost six in a row, which is one shy of the longest active streak in the nation. Additionally, Miami is on an eight-game road losing streak versus AP Top-10 teams. Those trends will bring A&M confidence, as will having dynamic playmakers on both sides of the ball. QB Marcel Reed led the SEC with 14 yards per completion and is a threat with both his arm and legs. Reed has more games with 4+ total touchdowns (four) than he has with one or fewer touchdowns (three). Meanwhile, on defense, DE Cashius Howell's 11.5 sacks top the SEC and rank fourth-most in all of FBS. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Texas A&M picksAfter simulating Texas A&M vs. Miami 10,000 times, SportsLine's model is going Over on the total as the teams combine for 61 points.

Knowing how teams perform with a rest edge is part of that, which puts a focus on the Bengals and Lions. Both teams are facing squads coming off Monday games, with Cincy 4.5-point favorites versus a Miami team that benched Tua Tagovailoa in place of rookie Quinn Ewers. The latest Week 16 NFL lines also have Detroit at -7 against Pittsburgh. While every team appreciates having a rest advantage, not every team makes the most of it per NFL spread records.Since 2023, no team has more ATS wins with a rest edge than Detroit (nine), while Cincy's 2-6 ATS record with a rest advantage is the third-worst in football over that span.

This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

R.J. White is +585 on his past 281 NFL picks, and he's backing Jalen Hurts as an anytime TD scorer in the early kick. \"The Eagles finally got back on track against the Raiders, and this is another good matchup for their offense,\" White said. \"The Washington defense has allowed 3+ TDs in every game played stateside since Week 6, and giving up 21 points and 384 yards to the Giants last week represents one of their best outings in that stretch. We're used to seeing Hurts' ATD prop at much shorter odds in this type of matchup, and even if Lane Johnson isn't able to make it back this week, I think he shouldn't be plus odds to score against a defense that gives up loads of points.\" Get more Eagles vs. Commanders picks here and see Packers vs. Bears picks right here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two SEC behemoths and two of the more iconic brands in the sport headline in the first round of the College Football Playoff as No. 9 Alabama travels to play No. 8 Oklahoma on Friday night. The Crimson Tide and Sooners are no strangers to one another, having met twice in the regular season since Oklahoma joined the conference ahead of the 2024 season. Alabama has had very little luck in the previous two matchups, however. The Sooners are 2-0 against the Crimson Tide in that span, including a 23-21 triumph this season that solidified Oklahoma's status as a legitimate playoff team. Oklahoma also knocked Alabama out of playoff contention last season when it pulled off a 24-3 upset of the Crimson Tide. This will be Oklahoma's first playoff appearance since 2019. The Sooners, who won just six games in 2024, turned things around with a 10-2 record in 2025 to earn their spot on college football's biggest stage. Alabama, meanwhile, is making its first playoff appearance under coach Kalen DeBoer, who is no stranger to the CFP; he led Washington to the national title game in 2023 before departing Seattle to succeed legendary Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban. \nFollow along for LIVE updates, highlights and expert analysis as Alabama travels to Oklahoma to kick off the College Football Playoff. Where to watch Alabama vs. Oklahoma liveDate: Friday, Dec. 19 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Oklahoma: Players to watchTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Alabama needs Simpson to be at his best, and he's been far from it since Alabama's first loss to Oklahoma. In the Crimson Tide's last four games, Simpson tossed five touchdowns to four interceptions. He's averaging 201.8 yards per contest in that span with two games under 200 yards passing. His completion percentage also dipped below 50% for the first time all season in Alabama's SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia. Simpson once looked like a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender, so the potential for a resurgence is there. \nGermie Bernard, WR, Alabama: Having a weapon like Bernard could help Simpson get back on track. Ryan Williams gets most of the attention after a breakout true freshman campaign, but Bernard is Alabama's best playmaker. He's a YAC monster that leads the Crimson Tide with 57 catches for 762 yards and seven touchdowns. Bernard is also the ideal safety valve for an ailing offense. The coaching staff likes to get him involved in multiple ways, be it as a route runner or on jet sweeps, so defenses have to account for that versatility. Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has emerged as one of the nation's premier ball-hawking safeties while anchoring Alabama's defensive backfield. The junior defensive back was an All-SEC First Team selection after tying for the conference lead with four interceptions. He is also the only player in the SEC with at least five pass deflections and four interceptions. Oh, and don't discount the three fumbles that Hubbard has forced. It's rare that one player creates that much havoc. Isaiah Sategna III, WR, Oklahoma: If there is one player that Alabama needs to have circled, highlighted and underlined on its defensive gameplan, it's Sategna. He is the engine behind Oklahoma's offense, and he's also one of the best big-play threats in college football. Sategna finished the regular season with 65 catches for 948 yards and seven touchdowns. His 14.6 yards per catch ranked second among SEC receivers with at least 60 receptions on the year. \nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma: Thomas' status is worth monitoring. He missed three games in November due to a quad injury, and his playoff outlook is up in the air. Even with the lost time, he was still an All-SEC selection after logging 6.5 sacks and 9.5 tackles for loss. He's a game-wrecking talent and Oklahoma's defense is obviously significantly better with him out there. Taylor Wein, EDGE, Oklahoma: Regardless of whether Thomas is unable to go, Wein has earned his spot on Oklahoma's defense. He stepped up in a major way in the wake of Thomas' injury and emerged as one of the SEC's most effective pass rushers down the stretch. He had 2.5 sacks and three tackles for loss in Oklahoma's last three games, and he had seven pressures in key victories against Alabama and Missouri. Alabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nWe've already seen this movie before. Oklahoma went on the road and beat Alabama in the regular season. The Sooners seem like a matchup nightmare for a Crimson Tide offense that has plummeted off a cliff since the start of November. Playing in a hostile environment certainly won't help Alabama. Alabama also has a solid defense, but Oklahoma has a key edge: the Sooners are great at forcing timely turnovers and producing points in multiple ways. Oklahoma consistently sets its offense up in ideal positions. The Sooners should be able to win pretty comfortably here. Pick: Oklahoma -1.5 (-105) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The time has nearly arrived for one of the most-anticipated boxing events of the year as we inch toward closing out 2025. The spotlight will be on Miami as Jake Paul takes on his literal biggest test yet when he steps in the ring with former unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. It all goes down on Friday night at the Kaseya Center and can be streamed live on Netflix.Paul has become one of boxing's biggest stars through careful matchmaking, expert promotion, world class training and solid athleticism. Over the last five years he's accumulated a 12-1 record by beating former UFC champions and stars with little boxing experience, smaller foes, and a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!Joshua, meanwhile, is one of the sport's most decorated champions of his era. He earned gold at the 2012 Olympics before turning pro and earning the unified heavyweight titles. While he has yet to secure the desired matchups against Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder, Joshua did have two chances against Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed crown, but came up short in both instances.\n\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"Bet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The undercard features more fighters from under the Most Valuable Promotions banner. That includes recent signing Alycia Baumgardner, who looks to defend her unified junior lightweight titles against Leila Beaudoin in the co-main event. Baumgardner, 31, reached undisputed status at junior lightweight in 2023. She made three defenses of the crown before vacating the WBC title to take this fight. Plus, former UFC champions are set to clash when Anderson Silva, 50, battles Tyron Woodley, 43, at cruiserweight. \n\"I feel like for me, it's my chance to go forward to increase my legacy. And for once, it's an opportunity for me to fight somebody that brings my value up,\" Woodley said. \"Anderson, that's the type of excitement that I got when the fight was requested.

    "body": "\n        Last month at the Players Era Championship in Las Vegas, after Texas took down then-No. 3 UCLA to set up a showdown with then-No. 2 South Carolina the next day, head coach Vic Schaefer took a moment in the press conference to make a bold statement.\"I thought down the stretch, Rori Harmon showed why she is the best point guard in the country,\" Schaefer said.This wasn't the first or last time that Schaefer made such a proclamation. But Harmon takes it to heart each time.\"For someone like Coach Schaefer, of his stature and his greatness, to think that of me is a pretty big deal and just something that I want to live up to,\" Harmon told CBS Sports. \"He has such a high standard for me to just come out and play as hard as I can and be that engine that my team needs to be on both ends of the floor. \n\"Yeah, I'm gonna take that challenge and try to live up to it every day. Not just showing up for games, but just being a good teammate and showing up for practice, playing hard and doing all the things that some people sometimes overlook. So yeah, I feel really happy that he thinks that about me. It feels really nice, but there's always room for me to improve.\"While some might call it a bold statement, it's not exactly far-fetched. Under Harmon's leadership, the Longhorns currently ranked No. 2 in the nation and are 13-0 heading into Sunday's matchup against South Dakota State (2 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network). \nHarmon is averaging 9.3 points and 7.8 assists per game. In the last four games, she has registered 44 assists and only two turnovers. She almost got a triple-double against Northwestern State with 11 points, 10 assists and a career-high seven assists.\nTexas is known as a defensive powerhouse, but the team has improved significantly on offense this season. There were already high expectations for the Longhorns, but they made a loud statement in November by taking down UCLA and South Carolina in back-to-back games. Harmon did a solid job directing her team, but she also hit the game-winning shot against the Gamecocks to win the Players Era championship. \nWhile Madison Booker has certainly been a highlight for the team, and players such as Jordan Lee deserve a lot of credit for embracing bigger roles, the point guard has been the key to tying it all together. Schaefer compares Harmon to Houston Comets legend Kim Perrot, whom he described as \"the heart and soul of the team.\"\"She made them go. She was their energizer bunny,\" Schaefer said of Perrot. \"Their toughness kid. She was a little bitty card.\"\nEarlier this season, Harmon became Texas's all-time assist leader, and she could be breaking more records before she finishes her master's degree. She is currently third on the Longhorns' all-time career steals list and only needs 26 more to tie Linda Waggoner's record of 346 steals.\"She is involved in so many things,\" Schaefer said. \"But here is, to me, the separator: it's what she does on the defensive end. It's how hard she plays down there. It's how much love she has for that end. A lot of kids go down there because they just have to. Rori loves that end of the floor. She loves to make an impact on that end. She takes pride in making an impact on that end. Not many kids do that. A lot of them can score, a lot of them can pass, but most of them don't defend like Rori Harmon. That,  to me, is what separates her. She is good on offense, but she is also that good defensively.\"Texas reached the Final Four last season, but Harmon, who was coming back from a torn ACL, was not even playing her best basketball. She and Schaefer had a productive conversation at the end of the season and he has continued to cheer her on during this journey.\n\"Last season was pretty tough for me, even though we did have a great season and went to the Final Four,\" Harmon said. \"We just had a conversation, he was like, 'What do you think is different?' We acknowledged the fact that I spent most of the year just trying to find myself again, including that the previous summer I didn't really get to touch the floor as much up until the season started.\"But a lot of our conversations now are like, he's just really happy. You can tell when he's smiling at me, he'll just not say anything, he'll smile. You can tell he's just super happy that I've found myself again. And I'm really enjoying the game of basketball again. I feel like myself. I'm moving better than ever.\"\n            ",

Watt will miss his second consecutive game after undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered while getting treatment at the team facility. Watt went to Pittsburgh area hospital last Wednesday after he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needling treatment session. He is expected to return to the field this season, per NFL Network. Watt was back at the team's facility this week but did not participate in practice, coach Mike Tomlin said.The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. A seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. He surpassed brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list this season. \nIn 13 games this season, Watt recorded 7.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception. With Watt out and Nick Herbig (hamstring) doubtful, the Steelers' pass rush will likely lean heavily on veteran Alex Highsmith and rookie Jack Sawyer during Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers are 8-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. Highsmith is tied for second on the team with 6.5 sacks. Sawyer has one sack, an interception, 26 tackles and three pass breakups in 14 games. \n\"He's had some opportunities this year and has made some plays,\" Tomlin recently said of Sawyer. \"Has had a sack. Has had an interception. So, I wouldn't be surprised if he displays that readiness if he gets an expanded role opportunity this week.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in more than a decade, the Kansas City Chiefs will be playing the final three games of the 2025 regular season without playoff seeding on their mind. At 6-8, the Chiefs have been eliminated from playoff contention in the AFC. Plus, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL last week to turn this Chiefs season into a true disaster. There are plenty of questions facing the Chiefs about their future and how they'll build the roster next year with Mahomes hopeful to be ready for the start of the season. Among the biggest questions is whether Travis Kelce will be back. He continues to brush aside retirement questions, noting that will be a tougher conversation he has to have with himself and the team in the offseason, via ESPN.\"I think I'd rather just keep the focus on this team, right now,\" Kelce said. \"All the conversations that I have with the team moving forward will be with them. It's a unique time in my life. I've got three games left. Unfortunately, I've got three games left and I know when the season ends. Just trying to make sure everybody here knows that I'm focused on trying to win these last three games.\"\nWhile his long-term future remains up in the air, Kelce stated on Friday that he has no plans on sitting out any of the Chiefs' final three games despite being out of the playoff race with a backup QB.\"It's just integrity, man,\" Kelce said. \"I signed up to be a Chief, and I love doing what I do. I know I've been dreaming of being in these moments and playing for an NFL team since I was a kid. Getting back to that will give you more motivation than you could ever need. That's just how you need to go about work, whether you're in the race or not. I'm going to make sure these guys know I'm out there giving them everything I got.\" Kelce will try to help close the season out strong and provide some help for backup Gardner Minshew as he takes over the offense in Mahomes' absence. Kelce does have some individual accolades to play for. He is just 203 yards shy of another 1,000-yard season, which would make him the oldest tight end to reach that mark. \nThe Chiefs close with games against the Titans, Broncos and Raiders -- with the Denver game as their final home game of the season on Christmas Day. Kelce will certainly get a send-off from the Kansas City faithful in that game in case that is his final time at Arrowhead, and all eyes will be on his emotions after the game as a potential tell for his impending decision this offseason. \n            ",

Well, you may get their wish on Friday night when the social media influencer-turned-boxer squares off with the biggest test of his career in the form of two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua (Netflix, 8 p.m. ET).Paul's career started off as little more than a sideshow, stopping fellow influencer KSI in a white-collar exhibition before knocking out another influencer, AnEsonGib, in his pro debut. Paul's second pro fight saw him score a viral knockout of former NBA star Nate Robinson on the undercard of the highly-watched event headlined by an exhibition between Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr.Paul then turned to facing a series of former UFC fighters, defeating Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Anderson Silva.

Another win over an aging former world champion followed as Paul took a decision win over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.Looking at that resume, you can see a pattern of Paul facing almost exclusively smaller, older and/or completely inexperienced boxers.\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul faces his toughest test to date as he makes a calculated business decision against Anthony Joshua\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat will not be the case on Friday, when Paul faces a much larger man in the 6-foot-6 Joshua, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist and two-time unified heavyweight champion of the world.\n\"Yeah, 100%. This is the Giants vs the Patriots 2007. I mean, the list goes on, but the odds are stacked against me,\" Paul said at the final press conference. \"There's no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it's this big of a difference in terms of skill, experience, resume, height, weight, etc. So this is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sports and you guys get to witness it.\"Bet Paul vs. Joshua at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:While Joshua is past his absolute prime, he is not so far removed as to not be capable of competing with the best heavyweights in the world.\nAfter a 15-0 start to his pro career, Joshua knocked out Charles Martin to capture the IBF heavyweight championship. After two successful defenses of the title, Joshua stopped Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA belt to his collection. Two fights later, Joshua would grab a third belt, stopping Joseph Parker for the WBO title.The Parker fight, the 21st of Joshua's career, was the first time a Joshua opponent made it to the final bell.In June 2019, Joshua suffered a shocking TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr., losing his status as unified champion in the process. The Ruiz upset was one of the biggest in heavyweight boxing history -- something Paul fans use as proof that Joshua is a vulnerable fighter, even when heavily favored.\nJoshua got his revenge in a rematch with Ruiz, regaining his three world titles. After a single defense, Joshua finally met a fighter who was clearly his superior, losing a September 2021 fight to Oleksandr Usyk and dropping the rematch the following August.Joshua has won four of his five fights since the Usyk bouts, including a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, before suffering a brutal knockout loss in an IBF title fight with Daniel Dubois.While no longer among the elite of the elite, Joshua remains a talented, strong, and large heavyweight and is a fighter unlike any Paul has shared the ring.\n\"Jake Paul creates a great challenge for me, and he's got a great mindset for sure,\" Joshua said. \"Great family, great brother, great person. So yeah, he definitely creates a good challenge for me. But as I said earlier, competition is really good.\"The undercard features more fighters from under the Most Valuable Promotions banner. That includes recent signing Alycia Baumgardner, who looks to defend her unified junior lightweight titles against Leila Beaudoin in the co-main event. Baumgardner, 31, reached undisputed status at junior lightweight in 2023. She made three defenses of the crown before vacating the WBC title to take this fight. Plus, former UFC champions are set to clash when Anderson Silva, 50, battles Tyron Woodley, 43, at cruiserweight. Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nJoshua vs. Paul fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookAnthony Joshua -1200 vs. Jake Paul +700, heavyweightsAlycia Baumgardner (c) -1400 vs. Leila Beaudoin +750, unified junior lightweight titleAnderson Silva -275 vs. Tyron Woodley +210, cruiserweightsJahmal Harvey -3500 vs. Kevin Cervantes +1300, junior lightweightsCherneka Johnson (c) -900 vs. Amanda Galle +550, undisputed bantamweight titleCaroline Dubois (c) -3500 vs. Camila Panatta +1300, WBC lightweight titleYokasta Valle (c) -1400 vs. Yadira Bustillos +700 .

If Jake Paul wins, it would be legitimately shocking. It would be a sport-shaking result -- and one many would refuse to accept as legitimate, no matter how little sense a fix would make. Joshua is bigger, stronger, more technical, has more power and high-level experience against some of the best fighters in the world. Paul has ... fought some guys people know who have all come into the fight with at least some degree of disadvantage.Anthony Joshua wins this fight 99 times out of 100. Paul's best trait is his power, and landing one big shot and knocking out Joshua is the way Paul wins that one fight out of 100. It's just very unlikely, and Paul's worst defensive traits, such as hanging around the ropes while not throwing punches, leaves him open to Joshua's power and sharp punching. In reality, every round Paul survives is a win in its own way.

    "body": "\nThe Week 16 NFL schedule sees a number of teams playing their final home games of the regular season. Thus, there's nearly a full year's worth of home games to gather NFL betting trends from in order to help with Week 16 NFL picks. Two of those teams with their final home stands include the Ravens, who are -3 versus the Patriots, as well as the Cardinals who are +3 versus the Falcons. Both Baltimore and Arizona have a league-high of six ATS home losses this year, perhaps, making them ones to fade with Week 16 NFL predictions.There are more road favorites than home teams giving points, according to the Week 16 NFL odds. Amongst those home dogs are Giants (+3) versus the Vikings, the Panthers (+3) against the Bucs and the Titans (+3) against a Chiefs squad that lost Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL and has been eliminated from playoff contention. All of the updated Week 16 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 16 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 16 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 16 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 16 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 16 NFL picks is that the Ravens (-3, 48) cover versus New England on Sunday night. Baltimore is coming off a dominant 24-0 win over Cincinnati, while the Patriots saw their 10-game win streak come to an end at the hands of Buffalo. The Pats have now dropped two of their last three versus the spread, as the team allowed season highs in points (35) and rushing yards (168) in the defeat to the Bills. Now, New England has to face the league's No. 3 rushing offense, led by Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson, and the quarterback has a stunning 16-0 regular season record in Week 15 or later. Baltimore is projected to rush for over 170 yards, which allows the Ravens to cover versus the spread 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Ravens using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 16 NFL predictions: the Chiefs (-3, 37.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. Patrick Mahomes' (torn ACL) injury shifted this line a full touchdown from Chiefs -10.5, but Kansas City still has a more complete team in just about all regards than Tennessee. While the Chiefs' No. 20 rushing offense isn't great, it's miles ahead of Tennessee's No. 30 ground attack. Then on defense, Kansas City boasts top 10 rankings in both points allowed and yards allowed, while the Titans rank in the bottom six in both categories. Tennessee is only 3-12 ATS over its last 15 home games and just allowed both its second-most total yards (430) and passing yards (292) of the year to San Fran on Sunday, so Gardner Minshew should be able to find success. The model also says the Under hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Chiefs to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 16 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 16 NFL schedule and just revealed four A-rated picks with the spread and total, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 16 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Audric Estime wasn't supposed to be in this spot in Week 16. We wanted Alvin Kamara to be taking on the Jets, but he's out for the fourth game in a row with a knee injury. Then, we were hoping it would be Devin Neal, but he was placed on injured reserve after hurting his hamstring in Week 15 against Carolina.So here we are with Estime in this dream matchup. Can you trust him? I'm willing to take the chance on him in several DFS lineups.He's a great bargain at $5,000 on DraftKings and $4,900 on FanDuel. And he could be awesome against the Jets, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs in the past five weeks. Over that span, the Jets have allowed 14 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have at least 90 total yards (TreVeyon Henderson, Derrick Henry, Robinson, Achane, Jaylen Wright, and Travis Etienne). It could be amazing for Estime.\nBut is he even the best running back for the Saints? Estime will share touches with Evan Hull, and we'll see who coach Kellen Moore leans on in Week 16.In Week 15 against Carolina, when Neal was injured, Estime had three carries for 11 yards and three catches for 39 yards on three targets, while Hull had four carries for 12 yards. At least one Saints reporter expects Estime to start, and I'm willing to take a chance on him in several lineups.We'll see if it works out. But the opportunity and matchup are great, and Estime could be a standout Fantasy running back in Week 16 against the Jets.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 16, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\nDespite reports that say that Michigan is interested in hiring Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer to replace Sherrone Moore, DeBoer says he has \"no interest\" in any other job and that he will be the coach of the Crimson Tide next year.That should put an end to any speculation to DeBoer leaving Tuscaloosa, because we all know that no coach has ever said publicly that he would not take another job and actually taken that job before, right?With that as the backdrop, the Alabama Crimson Tide (10-3) square off against the Oklahoma Sooners (10-2) on Friday night in a first round College Football Playoff game in Norman, Okla. The winner will advance to the Rose Bowl for a quarterfinal matchup against the No. 1-seeded Indiana Hoosiers, while the loser will have its season come to an end.Friday's game is a rematch of one played on Nov. 15 in Tuscaloosa, which the Sooners won, 23-21. Alabama outgained Oklahoma 406 yards to 212 and had a 95% win expectancy in that game but was done in by three turnovers, which the Sooners turned into 17 points. Oklahoma is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Alabama.While Sooners vs. Crimson Tide is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes five NBA matchups and a full college basketball slate. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Dec. 19. All times Eastern.College football best bets, where to watchNo. 9 Alabama at No. 8 OklahomaTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Norman, Okla. | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Alabama +1.5 | Expert: Alabama +1.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nThe Crimson Tide offense couldn't get moving in the SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia, rushing for -3 yards (that's not a misprint) and generating just 209 total yards in the 28-7 loss. But running back Jam Miller, who did not play against the Bulldogs, is expected to return on Friday against the Sooners. Meanwhile, how long can Oklahoma keep winning with its pop-gun offense? The Sooners rank 88th in the country in total offense (353.7 yards per game) and 76th in scoring offense (26.4 points per game). \"Brent Venables' big-play defense keyed a 3-0 turnover edge (in the first game against Alabama), but the Sooners offense hasn't looked smooth since before QB John Mateer injured his wrist in September,\" Marshall says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times, says the Crimson Tide have a 51.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Alabama +1.5.NBA best bets, where to watch76ers at KnicksTime: 7 p.m. | Location: New York City | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Knicks -3.5 | Expert: 76ers +5 (Matt Severance)\nThe newly crowned NBA Cup champions stayed hot on Thursday night, beating the Indiana Pacers, 114-113, on Jalen Brunson's go-ahead 3-pointer with 4.4 seconds remaining. That was the Knicks' seventh straight win and came two nights after their resounding victory over the Spurs in the NBA Cup title game in Las Vegas. On Friday New York will play its third game in four nights and the second half of a back-to-back. By contrast, the 76ers have been rested since Sunday. \"I still think (the Knicks) will be physically and mentally gassed from an incredibly hectic week,\" Severance says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says New York has a 67.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Knicks -3.5.Thunder at TimberwolvesTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Thunder -7.5\nNow, that's the Oklahoma City Thunder team we're used to seeing. The reigning NBA champs bounced back from their shocking — and rare — loss to the Spurs in the NBA Cup semifinals with a 122-101 blowout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night in Oklahoma City. In the win, the Thunder (25-2) actually improved their defensive rating to 103.0 points per 100 possessions. To put that in perspective, the difference between Oklahoma City and the second-best defensive team (Pistons at 110.9) is larger than the difference between Detroit and the 25th-best defensive team (Nets at 117.6). Despite the Thunder playing the second half of a back-to-back, the SportsLine Projection Model says Oklahoma City has a 52.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Thunder -7.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchVillanova vs. WisconsinTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Milwaukee | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Wildcats +3.5\nThe Wisconsin Badgers will try to bounce back from a listless defensive effort when they take on the Villanova Wildcats at Fiserv Forum. The Badgers (7-5) are coming off a 90-60 blowout loss to Nebraska in which Wisconsin allowed the Cornhuskers to shoot 54.1% from the field and 36.7% from beyond the 3-point arc. According to Kenpom, the Badgers rank 49th in the country in defensive rating (100.6 points per 100 possessions). On Friday, they will take on a Villanova team that is 23rd in the nation in offensive rating (120.0). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Wildcats have a 68.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Villanova +3.5.Looking aheadCollege football: Miami at Texas A&MTime: Noon Saturday | Location: College Station, Texas | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas A&M -3.5 | Expert: Miami +3.5 (Matt Severance)\nA spot in the CFP quarterfinals and a chance to play Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl will be at stake when the Texas A&M Aggies (11-1) host the Miami Hurricanes (10-2) at Kyle Field. Quarterback play could be the determining factor. The Aggies' Marcel Reed has thrown 10 interceptions this season, including six over his last five games. The Hurricanes' Carson Beck also has thrown 10 picks this year, but the A&M defense has just three interceptions all season. \"I honestly believe Miami is one of the top-five most talented teams in the country if (coach) Mario Cristobal would just get out of his own way sometimes,\" Severance says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says the Aggies have a 59.0% chance to cover and assigns a strong A grade to A&M -3.5.\n            ",

Both teams have, at various points of the season, looked like the NFL's best team. The two sides split their two regular-season meetings -- with both winning at home -- and the winner of the rubber match will earn a berth in the Super Bowl, where either the Denver Broncos or New England Patriots will be waiting. Kickoff from Lumen Field is set for 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday and game-time temperatures are expected to be in the low-40s with no precipitation in the forecast.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams as the 2026 AFC Championship Game and the 2026 NFC Championship Game are both set to unfold on Sunday. The Broncos will host the Patriots in the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and Denver's quarterback sittuation looms large in this matchup. Jarrett Stidham will replace Bo Nix, who was lost for the season on an ankle injury sustained late in Denver's win over Buffalo. The latest NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list the Broncos as 3.5-point home underdogs with the total at 43.5. The NFC title game showcases the NFC West as the Seattle Seahawks (-2.5, 45.5) host the Los Angeles Rams. These teams split their head-to-head matchups in the regular season straight up, against the spread and on both sides of the total, so how should you formulate your NFL best bets this time around? SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and NFL best bets as the conference championship games approach. A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this regular season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFC Championship game and 2026 AFC Championship Game, studied each matchup and the NFL odds in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+3.5)\n\"With two excellent defenses and Denver starting a backup quarterback, I just can't see this one turning into a Broncos-Bills type of shootout. My top play is the Under (43.5). I have a hard time seeing either team score more than 24 in this one. While I would've probably leaned Denver at home with a healthy Bo Nix, it's hard to imagine Jarrett Stidham pulling a Jeff Hostetler (see the 1990 Giants) and leading his team to the Super Bowl. Whereas the NFC game will likely be exciting to watch from an offensive standpoint, expect just the opposite here. Both of these teams have skated by with relatively easy schedules this season. This time, the Nix injury benefits New England significantly. The thing is, Drake Maye doesn't have to play well for New England to win. If the Patriots can run the ball effectively like Buffalo did last week, Denver is toast. And that's exactly what will happen.\"Pick: Patriots 21, Broncos 13Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\"Dating back to 2024, Sam Darnold has faced the Rams four times. His teams are 1-3 in those games, with the one win being a large blown lead by Los Angeles and won on a 2-point conversion (in December 2025). He's thrown six interceptions against L.A. already this season and is once again likely not to be 100% on Sunday with an oblique injury. Meanwhile, Matthew Stafford hasn't thrown an interception against Seattle this season (5 TDs, 0 INTs). Though Stafford hasn't been at his best this postseason, I can't possibly pick Darnold over him in a big game. I saw these two face off in person last January in a playoff game moved to Arizona and if it was a prize fight, they would've stopped it in the third round. While I'm not expecting Rams star wide receiver Puka Nacua to post a 225 yard, two touchdown performance against Seattle like he did in Week 16, I'm also not sure that the Seahawks have an effective answer to slow him down. In yet another playoff thriller, Los Angeles moves on to the Super Bowl for the second time in five seasons.\"Pick: Rams 27, Seahawks 23How to get more NFL conference championship picksSportsLine's model has simulated both conference championship game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\nInterest in NFL player props always increases as the importance of games increases as well, and such is the case with the penultimate week of the 2026 NFL playoffs. We've reached the NFL Championship Round with Broncos vs. Patriots (-3.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) in the AFC title game and Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) in the NFC title game. Prop bets for the likes of Drake Maye, Courtland Sutton, Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams and Sam Darnold will be among the most sought after with NFL picks, but considering overlooked players could find value with your NFL bets.Jarrett Stidham could be one of those as he starts in place of Bo Nix (ankle), and the former has an NFL props total of 0.5 interceptions (-202/+157) for Sunday. Those NFL prop odds for the Under are intriguing considering Denver may heavily lean on the run, and limiting Stidham's pass attempts would, in theory, limit his chances to throw a pick. There are several other plus-money NFL props available in the latest NFL championship round odds. Before locking in any conference championship NFL picks, you'll want to check out the top NFL player props and NFL prop predictions for the AFC and NFC championship games powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 bet wins on props like Stidham under 0.5 interceptions:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Championship Round NFL betting, the Machine Learning Model has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided prop picks for every position. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for the NFC and AFC Championship Games at SportsLine.Top NFL Championship Round QB, RB, WR, TE player prop picksHere's a look at some of the top Championship Round NFL prop picks from SportsLine AI: Quarterback: Sam Darnold, Seahawks: Under 1.5 passing touchdowns (-114)Darnold has gone under his passing touchdowns total in four of his last five games, including having one or fewer touchdown in each of his last three games. Darnold notoriously struggles when pressured, and the Rams have the fourth-best pressure rate in the league as they forced Darnold into a zero-touchdown, four-interception game earlier this year. SportsLine AI has Darnold having 0.7 passing TDs on average in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Darnold to go under 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nRunning back: TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots: Over 9.5 carries (+118)Denver led the NFL with 68 sacks, and the best way to neutralize a ferocious pass rush is by running the ball. Henderson has received double-digit carries in 10 of his last 12 games as he had 50 more rushing attempts than Rhamondre Stevenson in the regular season. The Broncos were just gashed for 183 yards versus Buffalo, which is the most Denver has allowed all season, as Henderson will be involved early and often. He's forecasted to have 12.9 carries in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Henderson to go over 9.5 carries at DraftKings:\nWide receiver: Puka Nacua, Rams, Over 92.5 receiving yards (-114)Nacua had an even 300 combined receiving yards in the pair of regular-season contests versus Seattle, including a career-high of 225 yards in the last matchup. The wideout has drawn double-digit targets in each of his last seven games, and Seattle owns the No. 3 run defense, compared to the No. 10 pass defense, so attacking the Seahawks through the air will be the preferred option. Nacua is forecasted to have 111 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Nacua to go over 92.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nTight end: AJ Barner, Seahawks, Under 29.5 receiving yards (-114)Seattle is favored on Sunday versus the Rams, and Barner has gone under his receiving yards market in seven of the last 10 games when the Seahawks are favored. He wasn't even targeted last week, despite playing more snaps than any other Seahawks RB, WR or TE, and Barner had just 14 yards the prior week. The Machine Learning Model has Barner finishing with 18.6 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Barner to go under 29.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make NFL Championship Round prop betsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model locked in confident NFL prop picks involving stars like Matthew Stafford, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Davante Adams and more. It's also identified a tight end with a plus-money payout and has over 20 other NFL props rated 4 stars or better.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-3.5, 43) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5, 46) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +276 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record at least half a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

    "body": "\nThe 2026 AFC Championship Game will welcome back some conference powers who have been away for several years as the top-seeded Denver Broncos host the New England Patriots on Sunday. These franchises rank in the top three of all-time AFC title game appearances, but this is just the second NFL playoff appearance for Denver since its 2015 Super Bowl run. The Patriots, meanwhile, have rapidly rebuilt under first-year coach and franchise legend Mike Vrabel, and they are set to return to the AFC title game for the first time since 2018. Jarrett Stidham will start at quarterback for Denver after Bo Nix broke his ankle in the divisional round. Kickoff from Empower Field at Mile High is set for 3 p.m. ET. New England is a 3.5-point road favorite in the latest Patriots vs. Broncos odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under is 43 with temperatures in the teens expected in Denver. Before making any Broncos vs. Patriots picks, be sure to check out the NFL playoff predictions from SportsLine's Bruce Marshall.Watch the game on CBS and Paramount+, where plans start at just $8.99/month. Sign up here.For years Vegas-based Bruce Marshall was synonymous with The Gold Sheet, the famed sports betting newsletter. With a background in play-by-play work and sports information while in college, Bruce joined TGS in 1981 when hired by the legendary Mort Olshan and served as executive editor for many years. Marshall has crushed his NFL picks, going 58-38-2 (+1494) in his last 98 NFL against the spread picks. Anybody following his NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.    Now, Marshall has set his sights on Broncos vs. Patriots.

The hypothetical lookahead lines for this game had Denver listed as a small favorite, so Nix's injury certainly changed the outlook in a major way. The Patriots have handled the Chargers and Texans without too much difficulty, defeating both by double digits. The Pats have also been beating market expectations all season as they led the NFL with a 13-5-1 record against the spread, and they were 7-1 ATS on the road. Denver, meanwhile, went just 8-10 ATS this season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverStidham is a competent backup who started multiple games for Sean Payton in 2023, so the drop off might not be as large as the odds shift is indicating. Denver can also lean on a stout defense that ranked second in the NFL in total defense and third in scoring defense this season. Denver's overall spread numbers aren't as strong as New England's, but the Broncos were 5-1 ATS as an underdog and 3-0 ATS as a home underdog, and now they're getting more than a field goal in one of the league's toughest places to play. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Broncos vs. Patriots picksMarshall is going Over on the total.

L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play.

Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass.

In 17 regular-season games, he completed 72% of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns with eight interceptions and a 113.5 rating. In the postseason, he has thrown for four touchdowns with two interceptions. In the win over the Texans, he completed 16 of 27 passes for 179 yards and three touchdowns with one interception.His top target has been Stefon Diggs. In 17 regular-season games, he caught 85 passes for 1,013 yards and four touchdowns. He had 17 explosive plays of 20 yards or more, including a long of 34. He also had 354 yards after the catch with 51 first-down conversions. He caught four passes for 40 yards and a score in the win over Houston. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverBackup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will take over for the injured Nix. He will be making his first extended appearance since Jan. 7, 2024, when he guided Denver against the Las Vegas Raiders. In a 27-14 loss, he completed 20 of 34 passes for 272 yards and one touchdown with one interception. For his career, he has played in 20 games, completing 59.4% of his passes for 1,422 yards and eight touchdowns with eight interceptions.Veteran wide receiver Courtland Sutton will be a key target. In 18 games, including playoffs, he has 78 receptions for 1,070 yards and seven touchdowns. Sutton had four catches for 53 yards in the win over Buffalo. He's had two games with seven or more receptions, including seven for 113 yards (16.1 average) and one touchdown in a 34-26 win over Green Bay on Dec. 14. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Broncos picksSportsLine's model is going Under on the total, projecting 40 combined points.

Jarrett Stidham steps in as the starter for the AFC Championship. While he has not thrown a pass in a game in two years, Stidham has been in the NFL for six seasons. He is backed up by a Broncos defense that led the league in sacks during the regular season and forced five turnovers against the Bills last week.

That loss marked the beginning of a lengthy stretch of traveling for Los Angeles, which is on the road for the fifth time in six weeks. The Rams needed a last-second score to beat Carolina during the wild-card round before beating Chicago in overtime last weekend.

The total closed at 42.5 in that matchup, and these teams have gone Under in 10 of their last 14 meetings. Seattle's defense has given up a combined 44 points in six of its last seven games, excluding the win over Los Angeles. The Rams notched a 21-19 win over the Seahawks in November, as the Rams picked off Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold four times.

The SportsLine Projection Model is expecting homefield advantage to play a significant role on Sunday, backing the Broncos as 3.5-point underdogs and the Seahawks as 2.5-point favorites to cover in its Sunday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.Despite the Rams and Seahawks ranking first and second in the league in total scoring, the model is also backing Under 45.5 points.

Although there's no debating a quarterback's importance to a team's success, the Broncos haven't been a team entirely built around the QB, ranking 10th in the league in passing yards per game and 21st in completion percentage. Getting to the quarterback is where the Broncos thrive, as their 68 sacks during the regular season were 11 more than any other team, and the model expects their defense to challenge Drake Maye on Sunday. Denver is just the second top-five scoring defense the Patriots have played this season, and that unit, combined with Payton's coaching ability, projects to be enough to keep this game close. The model projects the Broncos to cover in 58% of simulations. Bet the Broncos to cover at DraftKings here:Seahawks (-2.5) vs. RamsWhen the Seahawks have been at their best throughout the 21st century, it's been due to an elite defense, and this year's group can hold its own against any of those previous units. The Seahawks have the best scoring defense in the NFL, allowing 16.6 ppg this season, and they haven't allowed more than one touchdown in a game in six of their last seven contests. They haven't allowed a touchdown in either of their last two games, but this isn't a team that needs to win a 10-7 type contest. Seattle also has the No. 2 scoring offense (29.1 ppg) and the Seahawks have won six straight at home and eight straight overall. The Rams play their third straight road game, and nearly fell to the Bears last week in a 20-17 overtime classic. The Seahawks defeated the Rams, 38-37, in overtime in Week 16 in Seattle, and although that result doesn't cover this spread, the model projects Seattle to win and cover on Sunday. The Seahawks cover in 58% of simulations. Bet the Seahawks to cover at DraftKings here:Rams vs. Seahawks: Under 45.5 total pointsThe Rams and Seahawks have the top two scoring offenses in the NFL, but they also each have top-10 scoring defenses, including Seattle ranking No. 1 at 16.6 ppg allowed. That resulted in the Under hitting in three of the final four Seattle games during the regular season. The Over hit in Seattle's 41-6 playoff win against the 49ers, but it's difficult to imagine Seattle scoring 41 against a Rams defense allowing 20.7 ppg this season. The Seattle defense has been even more dominant over the last two months than the entirety of the season, allowing 11.6 ppg over its last seven contests. The model projects the Under to hit in 53% of simulations. Bet the Under at DraftKings here:\nWant more NFL picks for Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams, with both conference championship games taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the latest NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are now 3.5-point home underdogs to utilize in NFL picks after opening at -5.5. The total has also changed and is now at 43 after opening at 40.5.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoff bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (43) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-102) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

Gaethje's reputation as the ultimate action star was as-advertised for everyone who tuned in on Paramount+. I worry his durability will falter to Topuria's elite boxing, but that doesn't matter. Gaethje earned one last crack at undisputed status, and the fight will surely produce one last highlight.\nPaddy Pimblett vs. Dan Hooker: Credit to Pimblett, he showed incredible resilience and improved striking. What kept him from winning the interim title were the same things that have plagued him so far. Defensively, Pimblett still keeps his chin high and hands low, and gets backed up to the fence. His poor offensive wrestling also prevents him from implementing his elite top game. Hooker and Saint Denis co-headline UFC 325 next week. You could book Pimblett against either man, regardless of the outcome. Pimblett and Hooker have traded personal barbs online and in the media. We shouldn't rehash the subject matter -- it's beneath both of them -- but the energy is something you can bottle into a great fight.BantamweightSean O'Malley vs. Cory Sandhagen: O'Malley didn't do quite enough to surpass Dvalishvili. Even O'Malley said he'd have no problem if Dvalishvili got the title shot before him. Yes, he beat Song Yadong, but O'Malley didn't crank up the heat until Round 3. O'Malley vs. Sandhagen is a fight that fans have wanted for years. Book it on the same card as Yan vs. Dvalishvili 3, and let O'Malley step in if \"The Machine\" doesn't make it to the finish line. Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Song Yadong: I love it when fighters in the same division share a card. It makes for easy matchmaking.   Nurmagomedov is the odd man out after a decisive, but forgettable, performance against Deiveson Figueiredo. Yadong, who is now entering his athletic prime, fought impressively against O'Malley. The UFC still has something on its hands with the 28-year-old Chinese fighter. Nurmagomedov needs another marquee win, and there aren't many top bantamweights he hasn't fought.\nDeiveson Figueiredo vs. Aiemann Zahabi: Figueiredo's bantamweight title aspirations are behind him, but, after missing weight, so is a flyweight return. Zahabi has quietly evolved into a formidable contender. The younger brother of Firas Zahabi, UFC legend Georges St-Pierre's head coach, has seven straight wins, most recently beating Jose Aldo and Marlon \"Chito\" Vera. For Figueiredo, it's a winnable fight. For Zahabi, it's a chance to knock on the door of the bantamweight top five.Women's flyweightValentina Shevchenko vs. Natalia Silva: It wasn't pretty, but Silva did what was necessary to cement her spot as the top contender. Silva gambled on herself by fighting Namajunas on short notice. Silva kept her No. 2 ranking and defeated her third consecutive former champion on UFC's Paramount debut. Silva started slowly, and many people believe Namajunas should've won. Unfortunately for \"Thug Rose\" supporters, the three scorecards that matter most are the judges, and they unanimously sided with Silva. Her suboptimal performance keeps Erin Blanchfield in the running, but Silva's resume should net her the next title shot.Rose Namajunas vs. Alexa Grasso or Maycee Barber: Namajunas' two missed connections fight each other at UFC Fight Night in Seattle. Grasso was originally slotted to fight Namajunas on Saturday. The former women's flyweight champ pulled out and was later paired with Barber, and another woman who was set to fight Namajunas. A fight with either woman makes sense, win or lose, but maybe it's best to pair Namajunas with the loser and let the winner take a more meaningful step towards a title.\n            ",

It's a busy month on Paramount+ with consecutive weeks of numbered events. UFC 325 takes place in Sydney on Jan. 31, a week after the incredible scenes from UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Volkanovski, the UFC featherweight champion, has deja vu. While he had pictured a fight against Movsar Evloev or Lerone Murphy, Volkanovski instead fights Lopes for the second time in a row. Volkanovski shushed retirement rumors, but conceded that he's closer to the finish line than the start. Already one of the best featherweights in history, Volkanovski is determined to savor every moment of his second reign as champion.Lopes took a short detour between Volkanovski fights. Lopes, who graduated from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years, is coming off a knockout win over Jean Silva that was in the running for CBS Sports' 2025 Fight of the Year. Lopes is an impressive dual threat who captured fans' attention with his ability to knock people out or submit them with equal efficacy. Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nSpeaking of knockouts, it's very unlikely UFC 325's co-main event makes it to the scorecards. Dan Hooker is one of the best action athletes in the sport, but his chin will be tested by his upcoming opponent. Benoit Saint Denis' last 10 fights ended with a finish. He touches down in Australia on a three-fight winstreak, most recently knocking out ranked contender Beneil Dariush in 16 seconds.Other notable fights on UFC 325 include Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy, the return of fan-favorite slugger Tai Tuivasa and CBS Sports' 2025 KO of the Year winner Quillan Salkilld.\nBelow is the complete fight card for UFC 325, along with the latest odds.

The Cardinals went 4-13 during his first season, were 8-9 in 2024 and were 3-14 this season. Arizona started 2-0 this season before losing five straight one-possession games that included a 27-23 loss to the Packers in Week 7. A rocky year included Arizona hitting Gannon with a $100,000 fine following his interaction with running back Emari Demercado during a Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans. \nPrior to Arizona, Gannon enjoyed a brief albeit successful two-year run as the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive coordinator. During his last season in Philadelphia, the Eagles' defense finished eighth in the NFL in points allowed and first in passing yards allowed. Their success helped Philadelphia advance to the Super Bowl, while it fell to the Kansas City Chiefs, 38-35. The Packers defense ranked 11th this season in both points and passing yards allowed. They were just 28th in interceptions recorded and 21st in red zone efficiency. \nGreen Bay's defense suffered a big hit when Micah Parsons sustained a season-ending knee injury in Week 15. The Packers, who were 9-3-1 at the time of Parsons' injury, never won another game during the 2025 season. Their season ended with a 31-27 loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFC wild card round. \n            \n    ",

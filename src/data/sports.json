Williamson was the crew chief for that game, a 20-10 win for the Bulldogs, which featured a number of questionable calls.CBS Sports' John Talty reached out to the league for comment, but was told the SEC \"does not comment on personnel matters\". CBS Sports can confirm that Williamson did not officiate last week, but the rest of his assigned crew did -- and will not officiate another game for the rest of the season for the league. Williamson and his crew took center stage for all the wrong reasons in the Auburn vs. Georgia game. Late in the first half, with Auburn leading 10-0, quarterback Jackson Arnold appeared to score before the ball was knocked out of his hands on the goal line. However, officials ruled it a fumble on the field, and the call was upheld despite replay appearing to show Arnold breaking the plane with possession.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs led 13-10 when Kirby Smart ran up to the side judge and appeared to call a timeout. Once the clock was blown dead, Smart argued he was telling he official that Auburn defenders were clapping in an attempt to create a false start for the offense. The broadcast replay showed Smart making what looked like a timeout signal with his hands, but he and the Bulldogs were allowed to keep the timeout anyway.\nAuburn coach Hugh Freeze and Arnold both downplayed the controversial calls' effect on the game, but the seven-point swing was an obvious turning point in the contest. \n            \n    ",

Betts \"tweaked something\" on her left leg during a scrimmage against UC Riverside on Oct. 19. The Bruins will tip off their 2025-26 season on Nov. 3 against the San Diego State Aztecs. Coach Cori Close said there is currently no update on her status or timeline for her return.\"No, we don't know yet,\" she said, as reported by Benjamin Royer. \"We're waiting on results, from the tweak that she had at the scrimmage, and so we'll know more later.\"While Betts was not able to participate in much of the practice, she did some light exercises and worked on some shooting while sitting on a chair.\nThe 6-foot-4 forward has been expected to play a significant role in the Bruins frontcourt. Betts is the younger sister of UCLA star Lauren Betts, who had a breakout junior year while leading the Bruins to their first ever NCAA Tournament Final Four.Sienna averaged 23 points and 16.5 rebounds per game during her senior year at Grandview High School in Colorado. Besides her basketball skills, Close has talked about how her personality will also impact the team. \n\"There is a strength that Sienna has that is really unmatched,\" Close said during the Big Ten media day. \"We do the enneagram, which is a personality test. If you know anything about the enneagram, the 8 is the challenger, and Sienna is an 8. She just challenges every situation, and she is not afraid of that. And I always tell her, 'Yes, I'm going to ask you to have boundaries on that sometimes,' but I never want to push that down. We need that.\"\n            \n    ",

The entire Dodgers organization is sending our thoughts to the Vesia family, and we will provide an update at a later date.\"In light of the apparent gravity of the situation, Vesia's availability for the series against the Toronto Blue Jays that starts Friday is a secondary concern. Even so, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts on Thursday told reporters that the team is \"going day to day with no expectations\" insofar as Vesia's status for the World Series is concerned. This year, the 29-year-old left-hander made 68 appearances for the Dodgers during the regular season with an ERA of 3.02 and 80 strikeouts and 19 unintentional walks in 59 ⅔ innings. During the team's current playoff run, Vesia has a 3.86 ERA in 4 ⅔ innings. Over that span, he's allowed a run in only one of his seven appearances. Vesia has been a reliable fixture in the Dodger bullpen since they acquired him from the Miami Marlins via trade in February of 2021. \nGame 1 of the World Series is scheduled for Friday in Toronto at 8 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

According to UFC CEO Dana White, the winner will help  their case by putting on a show at UFC 321.Nurmagomedov  and Bautista are well-positioned to challenge Merab Dvalishvili if the  champ beats Petr Yan at UFC 323. Nurmagomedov had the best showing  against Dvalishvili in a failed bid for the title in January. A win over  No. 2-ranked contender Nurmagomedov would extend Bautista's win streak  to nine. \"I have a question for you, Dana,\" Nurmagomedov said at  Thursday's pre-fight press conference. \"Can I ask? Is it possible that  me and Mario is a contender fight?\" \"Could  this fight be the  contender fight?\" White replied. \"Go out there and put  on a show on  Saturday that makes people go, 'Damn, one of these guys  should be  fighting for the title next.'\"\n        \n            \n                UFC 321 predictions, odds, best bets: Prop picks for the title fights, Umar Nurmagomedov among top choices\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNurmagomedov accepted White's challenge, which also extends to Bautista.\n\"OK, I'm going to do it,\" Nurmagomedov said, to which White replied, \"Deal.\"Nurmagomedov  did not commit to a knockout, submission, or Fight of the Night.  Instead, he's keeping an open-ended approach to how he'll meet White's  request.\"I think I just need to show the best performance,\"  Nurmagomedov said. \"If  it's going to be a finish, of course it's going  to be great, but I think  I will show all my skills everywhere, and what  I want, I'm going to show,  a very good performance.\" \nUFC 321 is headlined by UFC heavyweight champion Tom  Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane.

It was wall to wall action with Paris Saint-Germain leading the way with seven goals, while Barcelona and PSV both scored six, while multiple clubs scored five. PSV's may be among the most impressive of the bunch, doing so against the reigning champions of Italy, Napoli. With that many goals, it caused some seismic shifts in the Champions League power rankings for this matchday, so let's get to it:\nRankTeamChangeAnalysis1Paris Saint-Germain--Depth continues to shine for PSG and Ousmane Dembele is back. This team are already among the top contenders to win the entire tournament and each week they're showing reasons why.2Real Madrid--It may not have been pretty, but Thibaut Courtois was able to save Real Madrid on the defensive end while Jude Bellingham got a much-needed goal to keep Xabi Alonso's team perfect in UCL play. Los Blancos are still finding their footing but if this is them not at their best, what's to come will be scary.3Arsenal--Gabriel Martinelli may be turning into Mr. Champions League for the Gunners, now with three goals and an assist during the campaign. Add that in with a strong defense and Arsenal are showcasing why they can't be counted out of lifting the UCL trophy.4Bayern Munich--Vincent Kompany started 17-year-old Lennart Karl, and he responded by scoring the opening goal in a strong performance. Everything's coming up Bayern so far this campaign. Is this the season that they end their UCL drought?5Inter--Inter haven't missed a beat under Cristian Chivu so far this season, and Lautaro Martinez has kept his own hot form going while the defense hasn't suffered.6Barcelona--Defensive concerns still remain, as Olympiacos had their own chances to score, but on a day where you score six goals without multiple top attackers being available, it can only be a good day.7Liverpool--Alexander Isak picking up a groin injury was an unfortunate blemish on an excellent day for Liverpool, but scoring five goals away to Frankfurt is just what the doctor ordered to help spark getting their season back on track.8Chelsea+1Even with a heavily rotated side, Chelsea were able to put up five goals at home facing Ajax. Any win without Cole Palmer is a good one for the Blues, who keep marching on.9Manchester City+1Another game and more Erling Haaland goals for Manchester City. This team hasn't hit top gear yet, but the defense will keep them in matches so Haaland can win them.10Galatasaray+4With another win under their belt, the Turkish side are moving in the right direction, and two more goals from Victor Osimhen is quite a help.11Borussia Dortmund+1Defensively, Dortmund are allowing too many chances, but that's fine when they're averaging four goals a match, the second-highest figure of any team. The UCL version of Dortmund continue to be a tough out.12Newcastle United+5Don't look now, but Eddie Howe has fully moved on from Isak. Newcastle's defense is stout, and Nick Woltemade is the real deal at striker.13Napoli-5Even before Lorenzo Lucca saw red, PSV were running away with this match in impressive fashion. Antonio Conte's side are down to their third-choice striker but with three points through three matches in the league phase, things need to improve.14Atletico Madrid-1No one knows which Atletico Madrid team will show up from week to week. This won't stop them from making the knockouts, but it's hard to see them going much further.15Marseille-4Emerson's yellow for diving, getting him sent off, was quite costly. Marseille's highs are high, but the lows are also quite low.16Tottenham--Guglielmo Vicaro was immense in net for Tottenham. They continue to bend but not break under Thomas Frank, and while it's not pretty and could fall apart at any moment, the points are adding up to advance.17Sporting Club Portugal+5They may have needed an extra man  advantage to get the job done, but toppling Marseille is a step in the right direction for making the knockouts in a second consecutive season.18Juventus-3Facing Real Madrid seemed closer than it actually was as Michele Di Gregorio made an impressive eight saves19Atalanta--You need to win your matches at home, facing smaller clubs, but a point will help more than it will hurt.20Athletic Club+3Finally off the mark with their first victory of the league phase, if things came to a close today, Athletic Club would be through to the knockouts.21Qarabag-3Perfect no more, Qarabag had a moment of hope in Spain before Athletic Club woke up to slam the door on them.22Club Brugge-2Slipping down these rankings, not much was expected going away to face Bayern Munich, but a loss is a loss.23PSV+8An absolutely massive showing for PSV. Defeating the reigning champions of Italy in a blowout is just what they needed during what has been a rough league phase so far. Is this when their fortunes begin to change?24Monaco+2Monaco may have deserved all three points, but not finishing past the keeper will cost them if they miss out on advancing to the knockouts.25Eintracht Frankfurt-4Conceding 10 goals in their last two Champions League matches is far from ideal for Frankfurt. There's talent in the squad, and two of their hardest matches are now out of the way, but it's far from an ideal performance.26Union Saint-Gilloise-2A club who had a strong start to the league phase, things are quickly unravelling for the Belgian side, but there's still time to get it back on track.27Villarreal-2Losing to Manchester City happens; it's all about how the Spanish side responds.28Benfica-1Has the \"Special One\" lost his touch? Three matchdays have passed and Benfica are still in search of their first victory in the league phase.29Slavia Praha+3It's not a bad point holding Atalanta to a draw away from home, but it's also not a particularly good one when you need wins sooner than later.30Copenhagen-1This just isn't a great season for the little guys in the Champions League. Copenhagen tried but they could never get things going against Dortmund, leading to another UCL loss.31Bayer Leverkusen-3Houston, we have several problems. The house that Xabi Alonso built has now been demolished, allowing seven goals at home. Sure, it's PSG, but this is a demoralizing loss that will last.32Bodo/Glimt-2Going into Rams Park is never an easy thing for any club to do, but getting dominated from start to finish won't bode well for Bodo.33Ajax--Day by day it's more of a season to forget for Ajax as they're far off the team who used to be contenders to make the round of 16 with ease. There's a long way to go for this club to return to that.34Olympiacos--It was nice to score a goal against Barcelona, but not so nice to concede six in the match while going down to 10 men.35Kairat+1Even with Pafos going down to 10 men, Kairat weren't able to get their first win in Champions League play. They did pick up a point, which should count for something.36Pafos-1David Luiz isn't enough to get Pafos wins in this competition even in winnable matches.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA coaching carousel continues to spin, and both expansion team jobs have now been filled. The Portland Fire announced that they have hired Alex Sarama, while the Toronto Tempo will hire Sandy Brondello. The Dallas Wings, meanwhile, have gone back to college and hired Jose Fernandez away from the University of South Florida.Now that the Wings, Fire and Tempo have made their decisions, two openings remain: New York Liberty and Seattle Storm. All three of those teams made coaching changes earlier this offseason. The Liberty parted ways with Brondello and the Storm decided not to move forward with Noelle Quinn. \n        \n            \n                Tempo to hire Sandy Brondello: Former Liberty coach will lead Toronto's WNBA expansion franchise, per report\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQuinn's departure was expected. The Storm only won one playoff series since she took over in 2021 and she was investigated last offseason for alleged bullying and harassment. Likewise, it was not all that surprising to see Koclanes relieved of his duties. He went 10-34 in his first season in charge of the Wings and did not seem cut out for the job. The Liberty's decision to part ways with Brondello just one year after she led the franchise to its first championship, on the other hand, came as a shock to many. It's unlikely we'll see any further coaching changes this winter. Seven teams changed coaches last offseason, and if you count Natalie Nakase with the expansion Golden State Valkyries, eight coaches started new jobs. One, Koclanes, has already been fired, and the only other one who could be in trouble is Tyler Marsh, who went 10-34 with the Chicago Sky. However, if the Sky were going to move on from Marsh, they likely would have done so by now. \n\n        \n            \n                Chicago Sky offseason outlook: What's next for Angel Reese and Co. after a disastrous 2025 campaign\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf the five teams that entered the 2025 season with established coaches, the Storm and Liberty have made changes. The Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury made it to the Finals, and Becky Hammon and Nate Tibbets have excellent job security. As does Cheryl Reeve, despite the Minnesota Lynx's early exit from the playoffs.  WNBA coaching tracker Team2024 recordPrevious coachNew coachDallas Wings10-34Chris KoclanesJose FernandezNew York Liberty \t\t\t\t27-17 \t\t\t\tSandy Brondello \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\tPortland Fire \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tAlex SaramaSeattle Storm \t\t\t\t23-21 \t\t\t\tNoelle Quinn \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\tToronto Tempo \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tSandy BrondelloWingsOut: Chris KloclanesAfter a number of years as an assistant at both the WNBA and collegiate levels -- largely working under Curt Miller, who is now the Wings' general manager -- Koclanes got a chance to run the show himself. His lone season with the Wings was a disaster. He never seemed comfortable in charge, and the Wings finished in last place at 10-34 and set the league's single-season losses record. By the end of the season, fans were chanting \"We want Nola!\" during games, asking for the team to replace Koclanes with assistant Nola Henry. The Wings will now search for their third coach in as many years. In: Jose FernandezUSF coach Jose Fernandez is making the leap from the college ranks to the WNBA after 25 years coaching the Bulls. After leading South Florida to 10 NCAA Tournaments, including in eight of the last 11 seasons, he'll take over the Wings and Rookie of the Year Paige Bueckers, coming off a 10-34 record in 2025. Liberty Out: Sandy Brondello Brondello had a very successful tenure in charge of the Liberty. Over her four seasons in charge, the team went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In 2024, she led the Liberty to the first championship in franchise history and in 2023 she helped capture the Commissioner's Cup title. Ultimately, those accomplishments were overshadowed by a disappointing 2025 campaign. The Liberty were beset by injuries, finished in fifth place and were bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury.  In: TBD \n        \n            \n                Liberty coaching search: Top potential candidates to replace Sandy Brondello after New York's stunning move\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFireOut: N/AIn: Alex SaramaSarama, who was born in England, has a fascinating résumé. He's worked with Paris Basketball and the London Lions -- where he briefly overlapped with Fire general manager Vanja Černivec -- as well as the Rip City Remix, the Portland Trail Blazers' G League affiliate, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. He also founded Transforming Basketball in 2023, which is \"widely regarded as a globally-leading resource in basketball coach education,\" and is a leading proponent of Constraints Led Approach or CLA, an innovative training technique. He was very highly regarded with the Cavaliers, but whether he works out as a head coach remains to be seen. \n        \n            \n                Portland Fire coaching hire: WNBA expansion team to hire Alex Sarama from Cleveland Cavaliers, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n Storm Out: Noelle Quinn Quinn, who won a championship with the Storm as a player, joined the Seattle coaching staff as an assistant in 2019 immediately upon her retirement. In 2021, she was elevated to head coach after Dan Hughes stepped down due to health reasons. While she led the Storm to four playoff appearances, they won only one series despite an abundance of talent and never finished higher than sixth in the league in offensive rating. Furthermore, Quinn was investigated for alleged bullying and harassment of players. A second consecutive first-round exit in 2025 was the final straw.  In: TBD TempoOut: N/AIn: Sandy BrondelloThe Liberty's decision to shake things up was a major win for the Tempo, who were able to hire Brondello as the first coach in franchise history. Brondello is one of the best coaches in league history. She's compiled a 269-181 lifetime record, is sixth on the all-time wins list and has won championships with two different franchises (Phoenix Mercury in 2014, Liberty in 2024). Brondello is highly regarded by her players and staff everywhere she goes, and will help set a winning culture in Toronto as the franchise begins its WNBA journey. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Both the Los Angeles Chargers and Minnesota Vikings are coming off losses to teams that have looked elite in the first half of the NFL season, but both teams will have the opportunity for a quick bounce-back on Thursday Night Football in Week 8.

Allen has 44 catches for 435 yards and four touchdowns in his first seven games back with the Chargers and is coming off his most productive game yet against the Colts, catching 11 passes for 119 yards and a score. The model predicts that he scores 0.50 touchdowns on average while the odds imply a 40.8% chance to score.Jordan Addison, Vikings (+180, DraftKings)The former first-round pick scored 19 touchdowns over his first two seasons in the NFL and he's been heavily involved in the Minnesota offense since returning from a three-game suspension to start the season. Addison has been targeted 26 times in three games and has 18 catches for 283 yards and a touchdown so far in 2025. Last week, he was targeted 12 times and finished with nine catches for 129 yards (all season-highs). The odds imply that Addison scores 35.7% of the time, but the model predicts that he scores 0.43 touchdowns on average.Josh Oliver, Vikings (+900, DraftKings)Oliver sits behind T.J. Hockenson on the Minnesota depth chart, but Kevin O'Connell incorporates plenty of two-tight sets into his offense and that's yielded some scoring opportunities. Oliver had five touchdowns on 44 receptions over his first two seasons with the Vikings and he's already scored twice over the first six games of the 2025 season. He's only been targeted seven times overall, but has played nearly 40% of Minnesota's offensive snaps and his size (6-foot-5, 260 pounds) has been an asset in the red zone. The model predicts that Oliver scores 0.20 touchdowns on average while the odds imply a 10% chance to score.Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Chargers vs. Vikings.

    "body": "\nEvery playoff berth is accounted for as we head into the final week of the 2025 CFL season, but the positioning has yet to be determined. One spot can be confirmed Friday, when the Hamilton Tiger-Cats host the Ottawa Redblacks at 7 p.m. ET at Hamilton Stadium.The Tiger-Cats (10-7) can secure the East Division title for the first time since 2019, as well as a first-round bye, with a victory over the Redblacks. Hamilton, which lost two of its three contests prior to last week's bye, is tied with the Montreal Alouettes atop the division but owns the tiebreaker as it swept the two-game season series between the teams.Ottawa (4-13) has missed the postseason for the fifth time in the last six campaigns but will be looking to end 2025 on a high note as it is coming off its fifth consecutive loss, a 39-28 setback against Montreal. The Redblacks dropped both of their previous meetings with the Tiger-Cats this year, including a 23-20 defeat at Hamilton in Week 6.Also on Friday, the Calgary Stampeders attempt to give themselves a chance for another home game when they visit Commonwealth Stadium to take on the Edmonton Elks at 9:30 p.m. ET. Calgary (10-7) is looking to end the regular season with a three-game winning streak after having trounced the Toronto Argonauts 44-13 in Week 20. The Stampeders can host a West Division semifinal contest with a win against the Elks and a loss on Saturday by the BC Lions, who face the division champion Saskatchewan Roughriders at Mosaic Stadium in Regina at 7 p.m. ET.Edmonton (7-10) was eliminated from postseason contention with last week's 37-24 setback at BC. The Elks split their two previous meetings with the Stampeders this year, winning 28-7 at Calgary in Week 13 and losing 31-19 at home the following week.The Alouettes hope the East Division title still is within their grasp when they visit the Winnipeg Blue Bombers at 3 p.m. ET on Saturday at Princess Auto Stadium. Montreal (10-7), which swept a home-and-home series with Ottawa following a Week 18 bye and enters its regular-season finale with a five-game winning streak, can win the East and receive a first-round bye with a victory if the Redblacks upset Hamilton on Friday.Winnipeg (9-8) can avoid the crossover spot with a win against the Alouettes and a loss by the Lions on Saturday. The Blue Bombers, who edged Saskatchewan 17-16 last week for their third victory in four games, also are looking to sweep the season series after having posted a 26-13 triumph at Montreal in Week 12.Saskatchewan (12-5) has nothing to play for when its hosts BC on Saturday evening, as it clinched its second West Division title in 15 seasons and an automatic trip to the conference final several weeks ago. The Roughriders won their first two meetings with the Lions this year, rolling to a 37-18 home triumph in Week 4 before posting a 33-27 victory at BC three weeks later.The Lions (10-7) can secure second place in the West and a home playoff game with a win at Saskatchewan. BC enters with a five-game winning streak during which it has scored a total of 192 points and recorded at least 37 four times.Hamilton is a 14.5-point favorite against Ottawa at FanDuel Sportsbook, while Edmonton is a 4.5-point underdog versus Calgary. Meanwhile, Winnipeg is favored by 5.5 points in its matchup with Montreal and BC is -7.5 against Saskatchewan.SportsLine football expert Emory Hunt is 42-35 on his CFL picks this year and has revealed his selections for Week 21 of the 2025 CFL season, including against-the-spread predictions and leans on the total of every game.Hunt is the founder and CEO of Football Gameplan, which has been supplying analysis of all levels of football since 2007. He is a former running back for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns and knows the game from a player's perspective. Hunt's dedication to analysis of all levels of professional football helped him crush the CFL, XFL and USFL in 2023, posting a combined ATS record of 98-73 in his SportsLine articles.Ottawa Redblacks at Hamilton Tiger-Cats (Friday, 7 p.m. ET)Pick: Hamilton -14.5Lean: Under 52.5Hamilton still has playoff seeding left to play for, hoping to host the East Division Final and not have to play in the semifinals. When you combine that level of urgency and high stakes with the fact the Redblacks' offense has been nonexistent over the last month of the season, I don't see how Ottawa has enough motivation to cover this spread.Calgary Stampeders at Edmonton Elks (Friday, 9:30 p.m. ET)Pick: Edmonton +4.5Lean: Over 53.5There's still a lot of fight left in the Elks, despite the fact their postseason hopes were dashed last weekend. How they've played over the last half of the season is impressive, and it's a sign of things to come. The Stampeders need this game for seeding, so expect their best. But in that same vein, you also can expect the best from the Elks and I feel they'll keep it closer than the spread indicates.Montreal Alouettes at Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Saturday, 3 p.m. ET)Pick: Montreal +5.5Lean: Over 49.5This could be a playoff preview. Both teams still are battling for seeding, so expect a high-level contest minus a few starters on each side as both teams get ready for the postseason. I like the overall depth of the Alouettes so even if we're seeing a good amount of reserves in the game, they'll be more than capable of holding their own.BC Lions at Saskatchewan Roughriders (Saturday, 7 p.m. ET)Pick: BC -7.5Lean: Over 51.5Saskatchewan will be resting a lot of its starters in the finale. Meanwhile, the Lions are trying to get a home playoff game, which they'll do with a win. Expect BC's starters to be in action longer than usual, considering they'll have to play again next week. You also can expect the Roughriders to think long term and pull some of their players as the game wears on.\n            ",

    "body": "\nTwo teams looking to bounce back from losses will square off on Thursday Night Football when the Los Angeles Chargers and Minnesota Vikings collide at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The Chargers (4-3) are coming off a 38-24 loss to the Colts and have dropped three of their last four games. They are now a game behind the Broncos (5-2) in the AFC West. Meanwhile the Vikings (3-3) enter the game off a 28-22 defeat to the Eagles. Minnesota sits in the cellar of the tough NFC North.Thursday's quarterback matchup features Los Angeles' Justin Herbert against Minnesota's Carson Wentz. In last week's loss to Indianapolis, Herbert set a career-high with 420 passing yards while also throwing three touchdowns and two interceptions. He became the first quarterback to pass for at least 400 yards and have at least three passing touchdowns in a home loss of at least 14 points since Dan Marino in 1988.Meanwhile, Wentz is set to start his fifth game since J.J. McCarthy went down with an ankle injury. The 32-year-old vet, who passed for 313 yards with two interceptions in last week's loss to Philadelphia, will try to improve his Thursday record to a perfect 8-0.The Chargers are 3.5-point favorites over the Vikings on Thursday.Los Angeles has struggled in the red zone this season. The team has scored touchdowns on just 41.7% of its drives to reach the opponent's 20-yard line. That's the second worst mark in the league, better than only the Raiders (38.9%). On Thursday the Chargers will face a Minnesota defense that has given up touchdowns on just 47.1% of opponent's drives to reach the red zone, the fourth best mark in the NFL.For the Vikings, turnovers have been a major issue. Minnesota has averaged 1.8 turnovers per game this season, the worst average in the league. By contrast it has failed to generate a takeaway in three straight games for the first time since 2018. While the Chargers-Vikings game is the marquee attraction on the sporting landscape on Thursday, there are other viewing options on a two-game NBA slate and South Alabama at Georgia State in college football.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on Thursday, Oct. 23. All times Eastern.NFL best bets, where to watchVikings at ChargersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Vikings +3.5 | Expert: Vikings +3.5 (R.J. White)\nStatistics suggest the Los Angeles defense has played well against the pass this season. The Chargers rank third in the league in passer rating (79.8) and eighth in pass defense (192.3 yards per game allowed). That normally would not bode well for Wentz and Minnesota's passing offense. However, White notes the Los Angeles defense has caught some breaks this season, with the Chiefs' Xavier Worthy leaving the season opener early and the Giants' Jaxson Dart making his starting debut against the Chargers. \"Last week it all fell apart against a strong Colts offense, but it was the third straight game allowing 27-plus points and at least three offensive TDs, with one coming against a broken Miami offense,\" White says. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, also likes the Vikings, giving them a 52% chance to cover.More NFL best betsBest betting apps, promos for Chargers vs. VikingsSportsLine Machine Learning Model AI's player prop picks for ThursdaySportsLine's Projection Model's best anytime touchdown scorer picksWill Brinson's best bets and props for Thursday nightNBA best bets, where to watchThunder at PacersTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Indianapolis | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Thunder -7.5 | Expert: Pacers +7.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nA rematch of last season's NBA Finals will take place when the reigning champions Oklahoma City Thunder (1-0) and Indiana Pacers collide at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Last season, the Thunder edged the Pacers in the NBA Finals 4-3 to capture the franchise's first title since 1979 when it was the Seattle Supersonics. On Tuesday, Oklahoma City began defense of its title with a wild 125-124 double-overtime victory over Kevin Durant and the Rockets. Thursday's game will be the season opener for Indiana, which will play this season without star guard Tyrese Haliburton (Achilles tendon). The SportsLine Projection Model gives the Thunder a 53% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to Oklahoma City -7.5. However Marshall likes the Pacers' depth. \"Pascal Siakam continues to perform at an All-Star level, and Rick Carlisle can rotate three bigs (Isaiah Jackson, Jay Huff and James Wiseman) in the post,\" he says.Nuggets at WarriorsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Nuggets +2 | Expert: Nuggets +2.5 (Micah Roberts)\nThe David Adelman era in Denver officially begins on Thursday when the Nuggets visit the Golden State Warriors (1-0) at the Chase Center. The 44-year-old son of former NBA coach Rick Adelman took over as interim coach of Denver late last season after the firing of Michael Malone. After guiding the Nuggets to the Western Conference semifinals, Adelman was named the full-time coach. Denver enters this season with key new faces on the roster including Cam Johnson, Tim Hardaway Jr, Jonas Valanciunas and Bruce Brown. They'll face a Warriors team coming off a 119-109 victory over the Lakers on Tuesday. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Nuggets have a 58% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Denver +2. Meanwhile, Roberts notes Denver is 9-1 against Golden State over the last 10 meetings. \"This team has a nice mix of players on the bench to help the starters maintain the lead in games,\" he says.College football best bets, where to watchSouth Alabama at Georgia StateTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Atlanta | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: South Alabama-6.5 | Expert: South Alabama -6.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nTwo 1-6 teams in the Sun Belt will try to earn their first conference victory this season when the Georgia State Panthers host the South Alabama Jaguars (both 1-6, 0-3) at Center Parc Stadium. After winning their season opener against Morgan State, the Jaguars have lost six in a row. Meanwhile, the Panthers have lost four straight games. Thursday's game features two of the worst defenses in the country; Georgia State ranks dead last in the nation (134th) in scoring defense (41.1 points per game), while South Alabama ranks 101st (29.3). The SportsLine Projection Model gives the Jaguars a 57% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to South Alabama -6.5. Marshall adds that while the Jaguars are on a six-game losing streak, they have been competitive in many of those games, particularly against Troy and Arkansas State. \"The Panthers have covered just twice since last September's Vandy upset,\" he says.Looking aheadWorld Series Game 1: Dodgers at Blue JaysTime: 8 p.m. Friday | Location: Toronto | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Blue Jays +129 | Expert: Dodgers -1.5 +125 (Angelo Magliocca)\nThe 2025 World Series gets underway on Friday when the American League champions Toronto Blue Jays host the National League champions Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 at the Rogers Centre. The Blue Jays are coming off a Game 7 victory in the ALCS over the Mariners in which George Springer hit a go-ahead three-run home run in the seventh inning. Meanwhile, the Dodgers have been nearly flawless in the postseason with a 9-1 mark, including a four-game sweep in the NLCS over the Brewers. Friday's pitching matchup pits Los Angeles lefty Blake Snell (3-0, 0.86 ERA) against rookie Toronto righty Trey Yesavage (2-1, 4.20). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Blue Jays have a 48% chance to win and gives a \"B\" grade to Toronto money line (+129). However, Magliocca notes Snell has allowed just six hits and two runs with 27 strikeouts in the playoffs. \"He also faced Toronto in August and threw five shutout innings with 10 strikeouts,\" he says.\n            ",

The Chargers have now lost three of their last four since starting the season 3-0, and they're still dealing with a rash of injuries as they look to keep pace in the AFC West.You can bet Vikings vs. Chargers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Minnesota came out of its bye with a loss to the Eagles, dropping the Vikings back to .500 on the season. Two of their three wins have come against the Bengals and Browns, so they should be looking to prove that they can compete with actual competitive teams as they move into a considerably tougher stretch of schedule over the next two months.\nWhich of these two teams will bounce back and get into the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Chargers vs. Vikings liveDate: Thursday, Oct. 23 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Stream: Amazon PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -3, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 8 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings' passing game has, somewhat surprisingly, looked better with Carson Wentz under center than it did with J.J. McCarthy. Kevin O'Connell has been willing to pass the ball at a higher rate with Wentz in the lineup, and the backup QB has done a better job of both getting the ball out (his sack rate is less than half of McCarthy's) and getting it down the field to his pass-catchers than did the rookie during his early-season stint. \nWentz has had the advantage of having Jordan Addison in the lineup for three of his starts, while McCarthy didn't have him at all, and that's been of tremendous benefit to the offense. Addison has gone for 4-114-0, 5-41-1 and 9-128-0 in his three appearances, and he'd helped take advantage of the coverage rolled Justin Jefferson's way while also allowing more space for Jefferson himself to operate. Jefferson has gone for 22-328-0 in Addison's three games after totaling 12-200-1 in the three games prior to his return.But while Wentz has gotten the receivers going a bit, he's also unsurprisingly undermined the offense himself at times with ill-timed sacks and incomprehensible turnovers. He barely had to do anything in his first start against the Bengals thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns, and in his other three games, he has three touchdown passes against four interceptions. His pick-six against the Eagles last week was entirely inexplicable. Sometimes, he seemingly just has his processor go offline for a play or two or seven, and it looks like he hasn't played football before. \nAgainst a Chargers pass defense that ranks fourth in the NFL in success rate, that could be dangerous. Then again, we also saw the Chargers get absolutely torn apart by Daniel Jones last week, and part of their high success rate ranking is having played games against the Raiders, Broncos and Dolphins. So perhaps Wentz has more of a chance to get going here than it might appear on the surface. At the very least, O'Connell will scheme him into position for success, and then it's up to him to take advantage of being put in those good situations.\nThe Vikings may have more luck running the ball against a Chargers front that has gotten licked to the tune of 5.1 yards per carry and the league's third-highest rushing success rate. Jordan Mason should probably be expected to lead the backfield whether Aaron Jones returns from his hamstring injury or not (he's listed as questionable), and Mason has averaged 4.5 yards a pop so far this year. If Jones is out, I expect to see a lot of downhill runs for Mason, with the Vikings trying to work the play-action passing game off of that. Pick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.When the Chargers have the ballThe Chargers have been one of the pass-heaviest teams in the NFL all season, dropping back on 64.9% of their plays, according to Tru Media. They also have the league's second-highest pass rate over expectation (PROE), according to Establish the Run, and that holds true for both the entire game and in neutral situations. They've been slightly less pass-happy over their last four games as they have dealt with injuries at tackle and running back, but they're still seventh in PROE during that time.\nThe reason this is particularly relevant for this game is that the Vikings have a pretty wide split between their effectiveness against the pass and against the run. According to Tru Media, they rank fifth so far this season in opponents' passing success rate and just 19th in success rate against the run. Opponents have thus been extremely run-heavy against the Vikes, calling a rush on 49.0% of their plays. \nThe Chargers, of course, may decide to go pass-heavy either way. The strength of their team at the moment is Justin Herbert and the pass-catchers. Even nominal starting running back Kimani Vidal, who is filling in for Omarion Hampton, is a better pass-catcher than a runner. He clocked the Dolphins on the ground two weeks ago, but so does everybody. In his career outside of that game, he's averaging around 3.4 yards per carry on his 56 totes. So, don't be surprised if it's a lot of Herbert dropping back and looking for the likes of Ladd McConkey, Quentin Johnston, Keenan Allen and Orande Gadsden II on Thursday night. If and when he does drop back, the Chargers will be faced with a pass rush that blitzes at one of the highest rates in the NFL. The Vikings have sent extra rushers on 41.9% of dropbacks, via Tru Media, which ranks second-highest in the league behind only the Falcons. Minnesota has killed teams when rushing five or more players, ranking third in the league in EPA per dropback. \nWith L.A.'s issues up front (we still don't know whether the starting tackles will actually suit up; they're each listed as questionable), it'll be important for Herbert to get the ball out quickly, which could lead to more work for the underneath targets like McConkey, Allen and Gadsden than for Johnston, who does more of his work down the field. Around 44% of opponent passes against the Vikings have traveled 0 to 5 air yards, according to Tru Media, which is the third-highest rate in football. They've faced bottom-10 rates of throws in the 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and 20-plus air-yard range.The Chargers should definitely at least try to get the run game off the ground, but it could prove difficult with Vidal and practice-squad passing-down back Nyheim Hines in the backfield. (Hassan Haskins is also out -- not that he was particularly effective rushing the ball anyway.) They're not a particularly good run-blocking unit to begin with, and it's not like the Vikings are slouches against the run; they're just not as good against the run as they are against the pass. Instead, this is likely to be a strength-on-strength matchup, with Herbert facing Brian Flores and his creative schemes. That's one of the most potentially exciting matchups you can draw up in the league. \nPrediction\nIn a game where two teams seem likely to have more success running the ball than throwing due to the respective strengths of the opposing defenses, but also probably still want to rely on their passing game to some extent, I'm going to lean toward the team with the quarterback I trust more. That's pretty clearly the Chargers here.Pick: Chargers 24, Vikings 20\n            ",

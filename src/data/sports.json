    "body": "\n        The NFL Thanksgiving Day games are often as anticipated as the food and family time which accompany the holiday, and the 2025 Thanksgiving NFL slate is among the best ever. Lions vs. Packers (+2.5) kicks things off at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Cowboys vs. Chiefs (-3) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Ravens vs. Bengals (+7) the 8:20 p.m. ET nightcap. Joe Burrow (toe) has been cleared to return in that one, though receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) has been ruled out. One could make an NFL parlay using those spreads, or incorporate picks on the total, with the money line, or by inserting NFL props. Baltimore enters in on a five-game winning streak this season, and it's won four straight versus Cincinnati, making the Ravens an attractive option with your Thanksgiving NFL parlay.As for those prop bets you could include, there is no shortage of stars to target, including Burrow, Jahmyr Gibbs, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Dak Prescott and a well-rested Ja'Marr Chase, who is coming off a one-game suspension. Prescott has multiple touchdown passes in five straight Thanksgiving Day games, but Kansas City has given up just 11 passing scores across 11 games this year. He has an over/under of 1.5 passing TDs versus the Chiefs, with NFL prop odds of -132 for the Over and an intriguing plus-money payout of +100 for the Under.

Not only has Baltimore won four straight versus Cincy, but the Ravens sport a 4-1 ATS record over their last five meetings. This season, Baltimore's defense is back to being elite as it has kept six straight opponents under 20 points, including a pair of top-10 scoring offenses in the Rams and Bears. Even with Burrow's expected return, the Bengals offense isn't on that level, especially with Tee Higgins (concussion), expected to be out. Cincinnati's defense, meanwhile, is the worst in the NFL.The Bengals rank dead last in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense, while working second-to-last in run defense and third-down defense. A lack of taking the ball away plays a big part in those rankings as Cincy has forced only one turnover, total, over its last four games, while Baltimore has nine takeaways over its last four. With these discrepancies, Baltimore is projected to win by double-digits and cover in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated spread pick. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Ravens to cover here:How to make Thanksgiving NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Thanksgiving NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Thanksgiving Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 11-1 payout?

    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet in the nightcap of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 51.5.

Jackson (toe) missed practice on Monday, but was a full participant on Tuesday. They're 3-2 against the spread during that five-game span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but have ruled out Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverHaving Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. Offensive lineman Trey Smith (ankle) and tight end Noah Gray (concussion) have both been ruled out for Kansas City.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Cowboys have won five straight home matchups against the Chiefs. Kansas City is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Chiefs vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points is 52.5.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

    "body": "\n        Outside of Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving is arguably the day most synonymous with football, and the NFL made sure to schedule three mouthwatering matchups. The Thanksgiving NFL schedule begins with the Detroit Lions (7-4) hosing the Green Bay Packers (7-3-1) in an NFC North battle at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Dallas Cowboys (5-5-1) hosting the Kansas City Chiefs (6-5) at 4:30 p.m. on CBS and Paramount+, before the Baltmore Ravens (6-5) host the Cincinnati Bengals (3-8) at 8:20 p.m. ET. All three games are sure to garner ample online sports betting interest. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL on Thanksgiving.

The Lions have lost seven of their last eight Thanksgiving games; however, Detroit did defeat Chicago, 23-20, on Thanksgiving last season. The Lions are coming off a 34-27 overtime victory over the Giants to improve to 7-4 overall and 4-1 at home this season. Jahmyr Gibbs rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns and added 11 receptions for 45 yards and a score last week, as a nearly unstoppable weapon out of the backfield. He's averaging 113 rushing yards at home this season, and the model projects Gibbs to be a significant reason the Lions win and cover on Thanksgiving. The model projects the Lions to cover the spread in 52% of simulations.Chiefs vs. Cowboys betting preview, picksChiefs (-3) vs. CowboysThe Chiefs missing the playoffs flashed before the eyes of nearly everyone in America when seeing Kansas City trailing by 11 points in the fourth quarter last week and on the verge of falling to below .500 after 12 weeks. But rather unsurprisingly, given how dominant the Chiefs have been in recent seasons, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid didn't allow that to become a reality, completing the comeback and forcing overtime in an eventual 23-20 win over the Colts, who entered last week as one of only three teams in the AFC with two losses. Every game remains crucial to the Chiefs, who at 6-5 are far from certain to make the postseason, and they'll take on the 5-5-1 Cowboys. Dallas' defense has performed better since its trade deadline acquisitions, but overall, the Cowboys still rank 31st in scoring defense at 28.5 ppg allowed this season. With a national audience in what is likely to be the most-viewed regular-season game of the NFL season, the model expects the Chiefs to put on a show, projecting Kansas City to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.Bengals vs. Ravens betting preview, picksRavens (-7) vs. BengalsEven if Joe Burrow (toe) can take the field for the first time since Week 2, the main reason for the Bengals' 3-8 record this season remains unaffected. Cincinnati has the worst scoring defense in the NFL, allowing 32.7 ppg on an NFL-worst 415.8 yards per contest. The Bengals are 18th in scoring this season at 22.5 ppg, which is just below the NFL average. The Bengals averaged 27.2 ppg in Joe Flacco's six starts, which would rank seventh over the course of the whole season, and they still went 1-5 due to the abysmal Cincinnati defense. With a matchup against Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers ahead, the model does not project this to go well for the Bengals' defense, and it will be difficult for whoever Cincinnati's QB1 is to keep pace with what the 'D' allows. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 54% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Los Angeles Angels and third baseman Anthony Rendon are in talks to buy out the final year of his contract (valued at $38 million), according to ESPN. Rendon, who missed the entire 2025 season after undergoing hip surgery in February, is expected to retire if a deal can be reached.Rendon, 35, agreed to a seven-year pact worth $245 million after winning the 2019 World Series as a member of the Washington Nationals. At the time, he was rightly viewed as one of the best at his position. In the preceding four seasons, he had averaged 26 home runs, 100 runs batted in, and a .912 OPS. His contributions had been worth an estimated 22.9 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nYet that version of Rendon rarely showed up for the Angels, instead dealing with constant injuries that, in recent years, required operations on both hips. To wit, Rendon had notched just 3.9 WAR in 257 games since joining the Angels. That works out to fewer than 43 games per campaign (though, to be fair, he did appear 52 of the Angels' 60 games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season). \nAngels general manager Perry Minasian revealed in October that Rendon had yet to resume baseball activities -- a less-than-promising sign for his chances of returning to the active roster.ESPN's report indicates that if the Angels and Rendon can agree to terms on a buyout, part of the arrangement is expected to see him defer some of the money owed to him. That would, in turn, create additional financial flexibility for the Angels to deploy this winter.\nIn Rendon's absence last season, the Angels started Yoán Moncada and Luis Rengifo more than 50 times apiece at the hot corner. Both Moncada and Rengifo are now free agents. \n            \n    ",

Faulk and the school have reportedly agreed to a three-year contract with an option. An official announcement is slated for Monday. Southern University officials recently flew out to Boulder to interview Faulk, a New Orleans native. One prominent university donor had reportedly been spearheading the move to hiring Faulk. Faulk, 52, was in the midst of his first season as Colorado's running backs coach under fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame icon Deion Sanders. Through 11 games, the Buffaloes are averaging just 3.6 yards per carry. Their top two rushers, however, are averaging 4.7 and 4.2 yards per carry, respectively. One of the most versatile running backs in NFL history, Faulk is one of just two running backs in NFL history with at least 12,000 rushing and 5,000 career receiving yards. He was named NFL MVP in 2000, a year after he helped the Rams win their first Super Bowl while also becoming the second player in league history to go over 1,000 yards in both rushing and receiving. \nPrior to the NFL, Faulk had a stellar career at San Diego State, where he rushed for 4,589 yards (while averaging a whopping 6.0 yards per carry) and 57 touchdowns across three seasons. Southern University had been in the market for a new coach since relieving Terrence Graves from his duties following a 1-6 start. Graves was dismissed less than a year after leading the Jaguars to an eight-win season that included a SWAC championship game appearance. \nThe Jaguars are now 1-10 and will finish their regular season with a showdown against Grambling State on Saturday in the Bayou Classic. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're now 13 weeks deep into the NFL season, and each and every game is taking on added importance as we get later and later into the year. And while it's true that every single game technically matters just as much as any other when it comes to determining who will make the playoffs (or win tiebreakers or have a better draft selection) and have a chance to vie for the right to take the Lombardi Trophy away from the Eagles, there are some matchups that stand out above the others. And this year's Thanksgiving day slate has a few of them. As an annual tradition, the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys will host games on Thanksgiving afternoon. But we've also got a potential barn-burner of a prime-time game on tap -- and it looks like we'll get some good news on the injury front for Joe Burrow. Read on below for details on the 2025 Thanksgiving slate.Green Bay Packers at Detroit LionsDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit, MI)TV: Fox | Streaming: fubo\nThis is a much-anticipated rematch of the Week 1 game wherein the Packers absolutely laid the smack down on the Lions. Detroit will surely have revenge on its mind for this one, while Green Bay will be looking to pull off another win and stake a claim to the division title.The Lions have played more Thanksgiving games than any other team, playing 85 times since 1934. They're 38-45-2 all time, but they finally got a win last year after losing each season from 2017 through 2023. Last year's game, of course, was notable for the clock-management abomination that resulted in then-Bears coach Matt Eberflus (now the defensive coordinator for the Cowboys) being fired. For the Lions, this game is part of a tough post-bye week schedule, wherein they play the Vikings (loss), Commanders (win), Eagles, Giants, Packers, Cowboys and Rams all in a row. That game against Dallas the week after Thanksgiving is also on \"Thursday Night Football.\"\nThe Packers, as many know, were once the Lions' annual opponent on Thanksgiving, playing them every year from 1951 through 1963. In their 38 total Thanksgiving games, the Packers are 16-20-2. They last played on Thanksgiving, well, last year. They beat the Dolphins 30-13 in the prime-time game. This will actually mark their third straight Thanksgiving game, as they played and beat the Lions 29-22 back in 2023. The game comes in the middle of a tough divisional stretch for the Packers, who play the Vikings in Week 12, Detroit in Week 13 and the Bears in Week 14. Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas CowboysDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, TX)TV: CBS | Streaming: Paramount+\nEven though the Cowboys are already only on the absolute fringes of playoff contention, this game is going to do monster viewership numbers. Dallas is always a ratings factory and the Chiefs are, right now, probably the second-biggest draw in the NFL -- and that's only if they haven't actually surpassed the Cowboys.Oh, and it should be a fascinating football matchup absolutely loaded with stars on both sides of the ball. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Rashee Rice, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens, Quinnen Williams and more all on the same field at the same time? Yes, please. Sign me up.Dallas has played 57 Thanksgiving games in its history and has compiled a 34-22-1 all-time record. The Cowboys have won three Thanksgiving games in a row, with each of those victories coming against a divisional opponent: the Giants twice and Washington once. The last time they lost on Thanksgiving was in 2021, when they lost an overtime game to the Las Vegas Raiders while playing without both Lamb and Amari Cooper. \nThis game is part of a hellacious end-of-season sprint for the Cowboys, who face the Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, Vikings and Chargers all in a row before closing out the season against the Commanders and Giants.\n        \n            \n                Chiefs vs. Cowboys prediction: Can Patrick Mahomes keep pace with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City is 5-5 in its 10 Thanksgiving contests, but has not played on the holiday since 2006, when Larry Johnson rushed for 157 yards to lead the Chiefs to a win over the division-rival Broncos. That was also the first year that the league played a Thursday night game on Thanksgiving in addition to the games hosted by the Lions and Cowboys. The last time the Cowboys and Chiefs played on Thanksgiving was in 1995, with the Cowboys prevailing 24-12 behind an 11-catch, 121-yard game from Michael Irvin.\nCincinnati Bengals at Baltimore RavensDate: Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank StadiumTV: NBC\nHere we have another big divisional matchup to match the one that gets the day started. The Bengals and Ravens played two of the most entertaining games of the 2024 season, and here's hoping we get treated to a rematch on Thanksgiving night. At the very least, here's hoping we get to see Joe Burrow back in action for this game, as Week 13 has been targeted as a potential return date for the injured quarterback. (Even if we don't, the Joe Flacco-led Bengals offense is pretty exciting, and could provide some fireworks here.)The Bengals have played just one Thanksgiving game in their history, losing 26-10 to the Jets in 2010 in what was a rematch of the playoff game the two teams played the year before. The Bengals have an interesting stretch of schedule beginning with this game, as they travel to Baltimore before heading to Buffalo to take on the Bills and then return home to host the Ravens again in Week 15.The Ravens have played just twice on Thanksgiving, winning each of their games in 2011 and 2013. The last time they played was when they took on the Steelers back in 2013, with the Ravens entering as the defending Super Bowl champions. Baltimore hosts the Steelers in between these two games against Cincinnati. \n            ",

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Packers liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -2.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings SportsbookBet Packers vs. Lions and other NFL Week 13 games at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\n        \n            \n                Why the NFL made a Thanksgiving scheduling change that broke 42 years of tradition for the Lions\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey storylinesRevenge game. The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

That means that Kelly will receive the entirely of his $54 million buyout as long as he fulfills his obligation to find another job. The letter reportedly details Kelly's responsibility to mitigate the buyout, which includes making \"good-faith, reasonable and sustained efforts to obtain\" employment. LSU expects Kelly to \"maintain reasonable documentation\" of his job search that includes interviews and offers. Kelly and LSU's breakup has been contentious. Kelly recently filed a lawsuit over the buyout situation to get the full $54 million he is contractually owed. LSU responded by stating that then-athletic director Scott Woodward didn't have the authority to fire Kelly, whose attorneys sent the school a letter which claimed that dragging out the firing process has hurt his ability to find a new employment. \nLSU had initially wanted to negotiate the buyout terms with Kelly and had been looking into whether they could fire Kelly for cause to avoid paying the buyout. Kelly's attorneys had insisted the school missed the window to do so. Kelly, 64, was fired last month following LSU's 49-25 loss to Texas A&M, an unceremonious end to what was a disappointing run for a man who is also the winningest coach in Notre Dame history. While the Tigers went 34-14 (that included a 3-0 record in bowl games) under Kelly's watch, they never finished a season ranked higher than 18th in the country. LSU finished outside of the top-25 last season and was 5-3 at the time of Kelly's firing. \nSince firing Kelly, the Tigers have gone 2-1 under interim coach Frank Wilson. After dropping their first game without Kelly, a 20-9 loss to Alabama, the Tigers have come back with consecutive wins over Arkansas and Western Kentucky to improve their record to 7-4 entering Saturday's regular season finale against No. 8 Oklahoma. \n            \n    ",

Only Lamine Yamal at 17 years and 68 days and Ansu Fati at 17 years and 40 days have accomplished the feat at a younger age than the Kairat man. You'd think, oh, teams around the world may take notice to enter a bidding war for him, but back in February, Chelsea got ahead of the race, signing him to a deal for €4 million with add-ons ons which is a transfer record for the Kazakhstan Premier League. The global market may move quickly, but Chelsea's scouts move faster when it comes to finding future talent. Satpayev will remain at Kairat on loan until August of 2026, before then moving to the Premier League side. He made his senior debut at 15 and has quickly become the hottest prospect in Kazakhstan and could also become the first player ever from the country to feature in the Premier League. Given what he's done in the Champions League this season, there's reason as to why he may. Only 10 teenagers have scored in Champions League play this season, and four are on Chelsea's books.Teenagers to score in the UCL this seasonNameAgeClubNumber of goalsEstevao18Chelsea3Lamine Yamal18Barcelona2Geovany Quenda18Sporting CP2Viktor Dadason17Copenhagen2Lennart Karl17Bayern Munich2Tyrique George19Chelsea1Marc Guiu19Chelsea1Senny Mayulu19Paris Saint-Germain1Dastan Satpayev17Kairat Almaty 1Christian Kofane19Bayer Leverkusen1The Blues are in a place where they could be set for seasons to come with the young talent already in the side and on the way in the future. This is without even taking a look at who the next players are that could be coming from Strasbourg in France, under the same ownership, where 18-year-old Kendry Paez is currently getting acclimated to European soccer.\nSatpayev has speed and can finish with both feet, while he's already getting experience of playing against sides like Real Madrid. Already with 19 goals and eight assists in all competitions at only 17, it's easy to see why the Blues would look to get a deal done quickly and adding even more talent to a club that's already second in the Premier League. Enzo Maresca has also brought along youth well, and it'll pay dividends as Chelsea continues to turn into a force. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent right-hander Dylan Cease on a seven-year pact worth $210 million, according to the New York Post. The Blue Jays have not yet announced the signing, but when they do it will become the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the franchise, topping George Springer's six-year agreement worth $150 million. Cease, who turns 30 next month, is fresh off a disappointing season. He posted a 4.55 ERA (94 ERA+) and a 3.03 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts with the San Diego Padres. Cease's arsenal continued to grade favorably, however, leading CBS Sports to rank him as the 11th-best free agent available. Here's what we wrote:Here's one for the dip buyers. Cease notched his fifth campaign in a row with 32 or more starts but, despite underlying data that bore resemblance to his past efforts, posted the worst full-season ERA+ of his career. Teams may ask themselves: what was going on with his slider? Cease is a two-pitch pony (fastballs and sliders combined for a usage rate over 80%), yet he tinkered with his top breaker, throwing it harder with less depth and sweep. His results were worse, suggesting he should revert. True in one way, true in multiple ways.Cease's contract is tied for the seventh largest free-agent deal ever given to a starting pitcher. He will join a Blue Jays rotation that figures to also include Kevin Gausman, rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, José Berríos, and Shane Bieber, who opted in to his contract earlier this winter. \nToronto won the American League pennant and AL East in 2025, falling two outs short against the Dodgers of their first World Series title since 1993.Here are three other things to know about this deal.\n1. Fourth richest contract among active pitchersOnce pen is put to paper, Cease will become one of the highest paid pitchers in the sport, as judged by total value. Do not that the list below excludes Shohei Ohtani on the grounds that he's a two-way player.Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto: $325MYankees RHP Gerrit Cole:                     $324M Yankees LHP Max Fried:                       $218M Blue Jays RHP Dylan Cease: $210M Diamondbacks RHP Corbin Burnes:                 $210MIt's worth pointing out that Cease's contract doesn't rank as highly when judged by average annual value. Then he falls to sixth behind Zack Wheeler, Jacob deGrom, Blake Snell, Cole, and Burnes, so far a multi-year contracts go. (Seth Lugo also has him beat if one-year deals are taken into consideration.)2. Why the Blue Jays chose Cease over Valdez, othersA fair question to ask in the wake of this signing is, well, why Cease? If the Blue Jays were deadset on adding a free-agent starter, why didn't they opt instead for left-hander Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, or any of the other free-agent options available to them.The Blue Jays will probably never provide the actual answer, but it seems reasonable to guess that it's because Cease is the most dynamic pitcher of the bunch. Indeed, he's struck out nearly 11 batters per nine innings for his career, as compared to Valdez's 8.9 and Suárez's 8.3 figures.\nAs an added bonus, Cease will add variety to a Blue Jays rotation that ranked 14th in the majors in strikeout rate. Rest assured, that won't be the case with him in tow.3. Good sign for other startersEven with the above subheading taken into consideration, you can bet that Valdez and other starters are tickled to see Cease's contract come in high.That's because the free-agent market is largely based on precedent. The agents for those pitchers can now argue that if Cease received this much, their client ought to receive at least the same.\nObviously that argument isn't guaranteed to end in a similarly lucrative contract. But those players and their agents have a better leg to stand on when they're making them now than they did coming into the week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- You don't have to believe the bookmakers' odds. You can plead ignorance to Elo ratings. You might even choose to skip over all the tables that rank teams by how good they are at accruing points from football matches. You cannot, however, avoid the evidence that is clear to see in front of your eyes.Arsenal are the best team in the world right now. Of course they are. They've just done what the best team in Europe does, grinding one of their leading rivals into submission. Bayern Munich were lucky to only have three hung on them. Their goal, which was shaping up to be a consolation within 10 minutes of its scoring, required them to enact by far the most impressive attacking move of the match.A team who've just won on the road to the European champions routinely needed moments of peerless individual brilliance or a move where every component touch and player was 90th percentile. That was just to get into the penalty area. Bayern ended this game with their customary 60% possession. They also ended with nine touches in the Arsenal box. Harry Kane, whose presence only became apparent when the Emirates Stadium serenaded him, ended this game with fewer penalty box touches than Jurrien Timber.Bayern tried a lot and a lot of it was unsuccessful. Take the period before their out-of-the-blue equalizer, when Vincent Kompany appeared to conclude that his side just weren't going to get the better of their opponents in one-on-one duels. And so their positioning went deliberately haywire for a few passages. No matter when Konrad Laimer started moonlighting upfront or Kane did the whole England at a major tournament trick of abandoning the frontline. If Bukayo Saka had to play center back then Bukayo Saka played center back. William Saliba would charge forward and why not? He was as well off winning the ball in the Bayern third as Arsenal's.\n\"Individually, we were immense to resolve all the challenges that this team brings to the table,\" said Arteta. \"The energy that we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality that we play with: it's incredible. We have to maintain that because it's still very early.\"Right the way through this game, the Arsenal machine was operating at peak efficiency. They have long since adapted to life without a center forward, on this occasion, rather than exploiting Mikel Merino's box-crashing qualities, they let him step back closer to Eberechi Eze and the indomitable triple pivot of Martin Zubimendi and two Declan Rices (wait, what?). Arteta wasn't looking to control possession, his side could control the positioning of Bayern even when they didn't have the ball at their feet. The center backs moved up and that created angles for the Gunners' wide men to fly into.That was what was so remarkable about this game. You wouldn't quite call it an off-finishing night from the hosts, who got three goals from 12 shots worth 2.72 xG, but they could have had more. Leandro Trossard's lob shot-cross produced nothing from a prime position. Had Eze shot when he passed in the first half, he might well have had a goal to follow up his derby hat trick. Even on an off night, Saka snapped on the heels of Bayern defenders, nearly forcing more than one prime shooting opportunity.\nThis was the best Arsenal have been in Arteta's tenure. Usually when a team reaches this level, everything has broken their way. They are not, for instance, down to their last Gabriel -- both Magalhaes and Jesus still working their way back to fitness. They have not played their last four and a half games without any center forward. Their captain, the technical heartbeat of their team, has played more than 266 minutes. The best team in the world doesn't lose its form attacker before half time and rip Bayern Munich to pieces. And yet here Arsenal were, having to adapt to the early exit of Trossard. No trouble, his replacement Noni Madueke delivered his first goal in the second half. This team may only just be emerging from a sustained run of difficulty with injuries but Arteta still has the strength in depth to turn the game, Riccardo Calafiori delivering the assist for Madueke with his first touch before fellow substitute Martinelli beat Manuel Neuer to Eze's ball over the top and tapped in. Now, of course, Bayern had selection issues of their own, a suspended Luis Diaz and injuries to Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala, but Kompany has not been bequeathed the strength in depth that Arteta has.The Arsenal boss would doubtless rather park the warm notices he and his players get. His press conference was notably taciturn for a man who has blitzed an opponent he labelled \"the best team in Europe.\" He would have no truck with questions as to what that made the side who just beat them. Kompany reflected why his counterpart was so taciturn. \n\"Mikel won't mind if I say, we had this discussion when we played PSG three or four weeks ago. I don't think any of us want to be the best team in November,\" he said. Perhaps in six months' time the status quo will have changed. Plug better fullbacks into the Bayern XI, not least a full fit Davies, and they could become a better defensive force. If Paris Saint-Germain find the fitness they had in the last run in, then they will not fear Arsenal.As Arteta himself put it, this is \"just the beginning.\" That might be an attempt to dampen expectations, but unfortunately for him, it might only serve to raise them. Right now, Arsenal are the best in the field. And they're only just getting started.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Get past the sticker shock: Dylan Cease just agreed to a seven-year contract with the Blue Jays that will pay him $210 million. And he's totally worth it. Yes, he's coming off a season where he posted a 4.55 ERA, his second season with an ERA north of 4.50 in the past three seasons. Yes, he can be maddeningly inconsistent even in the best of times, locked as he seemingly is, in a neverending battle between the quality of his stuff (some of the best in baseball) and the quality of his command (not some of the best in baseball). But we know ERA isn't all that matters. We know, for instance, that Cease's underlying metrics suggest he deserved much better than he got in 2025. Take your pick of your favorite metric: His xERA was 3.46, and that accounts for the quality of contact he gave up, while his FIP was 3.56, which is generally quality-of-contact agnostic. For his career, his xERA is 3.66 and his FIP is 3.67, both slightly better than his 3.88 ERA, and over 1,000 innings, it is fair to say that there must be something about Cease that these metrics aren't accounting for.But there's also plenty that his ERA doesn't account for, most notably his track record as one of the most durable pitchers in baseball. He doesn't quite qualify for the \"innings eater\" tag – he's never topped 190 innings in a season – but he'll go out there every fifth day and take the ball, something he has done almost without fail every time up since he made the majors back in 2019. He's had a few scares in that time, but nothing concerning at all – Cease left a start in May of 2025 with a cramp in his right forearm that didn't even end up costing him a start. \nAnd the highs are electric and when he's on, Cease can be simply overpowering. He's not on as often as you'd want, but for a team looking to repeat as AL champs, you'll chase the high points and hope they come in the right moments to help propel you. Cease has been overdrafted at times in Fantasy, but that's unlikely to happen coming off a mid-4.00s ERA. But the fact that a smart MLB club just gave him $200 million plus should be a sign that this is a pitcher you want to bet on. You're taking on ratios risk when you draft him, of course, but you're also locking in 210-plus strikeouts, a milestone he has hit in five straight seasons. And if you get the mid-3.00s ERA version of Cease – let alone the 2.20 ERA he posted in 2022, though it seems foolish to chase that at this point – you're going to get a huge value if his price remains around the 80th pick and the 20th starting pitcher off the board.And it's not like Cease is any riskier than some of the guys going ahead of him. Are Spencer Schwellenbach, George Kirby, or Joe Ryan really safer picks? Is Spencer Strider, going a few picks later? Cease has his warts, but the proven volume is something very few pitchers can match, and the proven upside is there, too. \nThe sticker shock is real, but this is what a pitcher with Cease's profile will fetch on the market. Blake Snell got $182 million over five years last offseason and he's a year older and doesn't have near Cease's track record of health (and has struggled almost as much with consistency). This is the market for pitchers who can pitch like an ace (even if just for a stretch) without missing starts. If Cease was a consistent low-3.00s ERA pitcher, he might have added another $100 million to that total.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA is in the midst of a cycle of coaching upheaval. Since the end of the 2023 season, 13 of the now 15 WNBA franchises have hired a new head coach. Eight of those jobs have gone to men, only two have gone to former WNBA players and zero have gone to Black women.In 2025, Noelle Quinn was one of four former WNBA players to serve as a head coach and the lone Black female coach. With the Seattle Storm choosing not to renew Quinn's contract, no Black woman is currently a head coach of a WNBA team, and barring a drastic offseason shakeup, that will be the case at the start of the 2026 season. That would make 2026 just the third season in WNBA history to tip off without a Black woman at the helm, joining 2006 and 2020. While Natalie Nakase, who is headed into her second season leading the expansion Golden State Valkyries, and Sonia Raman, the newly-hired Seattle Storm coach, are both women of Asian descent, the absence of Black women coaches in a league where Black women account for over half the player pool is jarring. \n\"When you look at 63.8% of all players identifying as Black or African-American, and you don't have that reflected in the coaching staff, there's an issue. There's a problem,\" Alicia Jay said on the latest episode of CBS Sports podcast We Need To Talk Now. \nAs the league continues to grow and evolve, why does it seem like retired players — especially the Black women who make up the majority of the league — are being left behind?The WNBA is changing, on the court and offBusiness and tactical changes to the nearly 30-year-old league are contributing to the drastic coaching turnover. As college stars like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers transition into the pro game, with them comes more viewership, attendance, and media coverage. On the court, the spike in versatile and elite-level talent means tougher competition. As parity in the league grows, it becomes harder to win. Teams want coaches who can win now. Gone may be the days of a coach remaining with one franchise for 16 seasons, as is the case with Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve. \n\"This league is different than just a couple of years ago, let alone that long ago,\" New York Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said in September while addressing the decision to part ways with Sandy Brondello. \"This decision comes after a thorough examination of what the New York Liberty need as we move forward into a future of an ever-evolving WNBA,\" Kolb added. Brondello, who became the winningest coach in Liberty history en route to the franchise's first WNBA title in 2024, was no longer the competitive edge the organization needed. The Liberty have since reportedly hired Chris DeMarco, a former NBA assistant coach and first-time head coach, to usher the 2024 champions into the next era of New York basketball. DeMarco is part of a growing trend: Right now, seven of the 15 WNBA head coaches have spent at least one year as an assistant coach in the NBA.\nNBA assistants are flooding to the WNBAPart of the reason NBA coaches may be desired hires in the WNBA is because of the shift in the game. As the emphasis on positionless basketball increases, so too does the need for players to continue to improve their individual games. In the WNBA, players like center Jonquel Jones are shooting from the perimeter and wings like Satou Sabally can take defenders off the dribble. Coaching staffs need to be able to develop a dynamic game plan to adjust to the new style of play. Player development roles, which have been commonplace in the NBA for years, are beginning to migrate to WNBA staffs. Additionally, the WNBA expanding to 18 teams by 2030 means there will be more head coaching roles available. As ESPN analyst and 2014 No. 1 overall draft pick Chiney Ogwumike recently noted on social media, there are more NBA coaching jobs (including assistants) than there are WNBA players at the moment, and the NBA tends to recycle former head coaches rather than provide opportunities to assistants. \n\"Getting a promotion to head coach in the NBA, especially with how they recycle respected names, probably seems really difficult, nearly impossible,\" Ogwumike said.So, NBA assistants looking for a chance to run their own team might be more enticed to take a leap to the WNBA — especially now that WNBA coaching salaries are trending into seven figures. \"You know what they say? Money talks. With coaches now making well over a million dollars, the WNBA is now becoming a destination for opportunity,\" Ogwumike said. \nWhile the increase in salaries and status might account for NBA talent seeking WNBA roles, it doesn't explain why former WNBA players aren't getting opportunities to lead in the league they helped build. Reports indicate former WNBA players such as Kristi Toliver and Lindsay Harding were up for vacant roles this season, but clearly, they didn't get hired.\"It's getting increasingly hard for aspiring coaches or even former players to win from within,\" Ogwumike said, shouting out players-turned-coaches like Briann January, Karima Christmas-Kelly, Toliver and Harding. A clog in the pipelineIronically, the trend of NBA assistant coaches jumping to the WNBA was jump-started by six-time WNBA All-Star Becky Hammon.\nHammon has only been with the Las Vegas Aces for four seasons, but she is already the second-longest tenured WNBA head coach, trailing only Reeve's 16. Previously, she was a trailblazer for women coaches in the NBA; she spent seven seasons as an NBA assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.So, when Hammon had instant success at the WNBA level, coaching the Aces to three titles in her first four years at the helm, it made sense that WNBA front offices started looking for other coaches with NBA experience. While Hammon was just the second woman to be an assistant coach in the WNBA, she was far from the last. By 2020, 11 women were actively serving as NBA assistant coaches. Many of those were Black women. But quietly, in the past couple of years, the number of women on the sidelines in the NBA has decreased. It is hard to find exact numbers due to the fact that every NBA team configures their coaching staffs differently and assistant coaches are regularly changing jobs, even within season, but right now it seems there are less than five women serving as assistant coaches in the NBA, including Harding with the Los Angeles Lakers, Jenny Boucek with the Indiana Pacers and Mery Andrade with the Toronto Raptors.\nSo, as the hiring of NBA assistants is becoming more prevalent, very few women are getting the opportunity to hold those positions and gain that necessary experience. And, as male coaches continue to gain power in the WNBA, it seems we are no closer to seeing a woman break through as a head coach in the NBA. South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley recently said she doesn't foresee a female NBA head coach in her lifetime.Unrivaled provides a blueprintThe women's basketball startup Unrivaled seems to have found a balance between hiring coaches with NBA experience, player development backgrounds and Black women. \"I think it's powerful that there are five black women leading, there are five black women head coaches in this Unrivaled league. It's not by accident. I believe it's intentional,\" Quinn said during an Unrivaled media availability this week. \nQuinn, Rena Wakama and Roneeka Hodges are new to the league and join returning Black women coaches Teresa Weatherspoon and Nola Henry, who squared off in the inaugural Unrivaled championship last season. Weatherspoon returns to Vinyl BC after being let go by the Chicago Sky after just one season as a head coach. She was replaced by former Las Vegas Aces assistant Tyler Marsh, a first-time head coach who recorded a 10-34 record and last-place finish. Despite posting a worse record and reports of issues with star player Angel Reese, Marsh was not one of the three coaches let go after the 2025 offseason. \"Representation is possible when leadership chooses to make it possible,\" Quinn said. \"So I'm just blessed to be a part of the league standing on intentionality behind diversity and hiring women, women of color and I give kudos to Unrivaled for leading the way now.\" \n            ",

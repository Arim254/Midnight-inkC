    "body": "\n        Auburn will be out to make history in the SEC's greatest rivalry on Saturday when the Tigers host No. 10 Alabama in a seismic showdown with far-reaching implications. Never in the Iron Bowl's expansive history has a top-10 Alabama team traveled to face an unranked Auburn team inside Jordan-Hare Stadium and lost. If that changes in 2025, the fallout will be dire for Alabama. The Crimson Tide looked like a near-lock to make the College Football Playoff just two weeks ago. Then came a loss to Oklahoma, which has eliminated Bama's margin for error as it heads into a venue where things are never easy. With a win, Alabama (9-2, 6-1 SEC) could reach the SEC Championship Game and cement its status as a CFP team.However, a loss would leave second-year coach Kalen DeBoer with consecutive nine-win regular seasons and an 0-for-2 mark on reaching the 12-team playoff. Furor would intensify to an uncomfortable degree. The Crimson Tide enter as just 6-point favorites against their hated in-state foe, despite the fact that Auburn is 5-6 (1-6) and playing under interim coach D.J. Durkin.But strange things tend to happen when this game is contested on The Plains. The Crimson Tide's last two wins at Auburn in 2023 and 2021 came by a combined total of five points against Tigers teams that finished just 6-7. Given the stakes and the narrow line, it would be no surprise if we're in for another thriller in 2025.\nWhere to watch Alabama vs. Auburn liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Jordan-Hare Stadium -- Auburn, AlabamaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis from the Iron Bowl.   Alabama vs. Auburn: Need to know  Auburn's improved offense: Auburn played its best offensive game of the season in its first game following Hugh Freeze's firing. Though the Tigers fell 45-38 in overtime at Vanderbilt, they showed a new and more exciting gear with Ashton Daniels unleashed as the starting quarterback and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix calling the plays. Daniels rested in last week's win over Mercer to help preserve his redshirt year, but he'll be in the lineup against the Crimson Tide. Another beneficiary of Auburn's offensive progression following Freeze's firing has been receiver Cam Coleman. The star sophomore made 10 catches for 143 yards and a touchdown against Vandy.Ty Simpson's turnovers: After thriving as a clutch playmaker and fierce protector of the football during an eight-game winning streak, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has picked up a case of the \"whoopsie daisies\" as of late. He was intercepted and fumbled in the Crimson Tide's loss to Oklahoma and was also picked off twice in the first half of last week's win over Eastern Illinois. While Simpson's play unquestionably helped elevate Alabama after a stunning Week 1 loss at Florida State, his recent regression is a concern heading into the Iron Bowl. For better or worse, the verdict on his redshirt junior season will be rendered largely based on his performance against Auburn.\nOnly once before: It's never happened inside Jordan-Hare Stadium before, but there is one example from this rivalry's illustrious history of a top-10 Alabama team losing to an unranked Auburn squad. It came in 2002, when a 7-4 Auburn team knocked off No. 9 Alabama 17-7 during Dennis Franchione's second and final season as coach. Bama was serving a postseason ban that year, which only magnified the Auburn game's significance as the barometer of a successful season. The Tigers jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead and ended Alabama's five-game winning streak.Alabama vs. Auburn prediction, picks\nAlabama quarterback Ty Simpson has been a bit rickety as of late, but he's successfully navigated a number of tense situations involving serious game pressure and won't be rattled by this environment. Auburn's quarterback group doesn't bring the same winning pedigree, and while the Tigers are a threat to run the football, Bama's run defense has improved significantly in the season's second half. The Tigers will be able to move the football some, but the Crimson Tide are masters of creating big turnovers and coming up with clutch stops. If Simpson returns to form, Alabama can gain second-half separation.

    "body": "\n        Who's scoring today? Whether your group chat is trying to cash in big with an anytime TD parlay, or you're looking for good value with an unexpected name, everyone wants to know which NFL players will find the end zone in Week 13.Last week, Cleveland Browns running back Quinshon Judkins found the end zone twice in the upset win over the Las Vegas Raiders, Tennessee Titans rookie phenom Chimere Dike caught a touchdown and returned a punt for a score as well, while New York Giants quarterback Jameis Winston CAUGHT a touchdown against the Detroit Lions. What will happen this week? Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 13. These will not be predictable choices like a Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long-shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with a tight end not many people are talking about.Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:\n1. TE Brenton Strange, Jacksonville Jaguars (+340)\nBrenton Strange is coming off a career-high 93 yards receiving against the Arizona Cardinals in his first game played since Week 5. His 297 yards receiving rank No. 4 on the team despite just six games played, which shows you that Trevor Lawrence likes him. Strange hasn't caught a touchdown this season, but I say that changes on Sunday against the rival Titans. 2. RB Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns (+110)\nJudkins was featured heavily in Shedeur Sanders' first start last week, rushing for two touchdowns against the Raiders. He even took snaps in the wildcat formation when the Browns got to the red zone. I'll take the rookie to find the end zone again in this highly-anticipated home matchup for the Browns.3. RB Kenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks (+120)\nWe cashed on Zach Charbonnet last week, so let's take the other Seahawks running back to score in a matchup where Seattle is favored by double digits. I was nervous about taking Walker last week over Charbonnet due to his glute injury, but Walker actually led Seattle with 11 carries for 71 yards. \nIt's pretty simple. The Seahawks will run plenty while the defense tees off on Minnesota Vikings quarterback Max Brosmer in his first career start. 4. RB Kenneth Gainwell, Pittsburgh Steelers (+230)\nThis Steelers vs. Buffalo Bills matchup is going to be a weird one. Aaron Rodgers is playing through a broken left wrist while Josh Allen won't have either of his two starting offensive tackles. You should consider Kenneth Gainwell or Jaylen Warren to score on Sunday. One is +135 and the other is +230, so I'll take the long shot.Gainwell is on a heater. He racked up 105 yards from scrimmage and two total touchdowns against the Cincinnati Bengals two weeks ago, and then had 122 yards from scrimmage last week against the Chicago Bears. Expect the Steelers to rely on their running backs plenty on Sunday. Not because Rodgers is injured, but because the Bills allow the third-most rushing yards per game (148.9) and the second-most yards per rush (5.3). \n5. WR Courtland Sutton, Denver Broncos (+170)\nBo Nix's No. 1 wideout leads the Broncos with 649 yards receiving, but has caught just one touchdown in his last seven games. Sutton had three touchdowns in the first four games of the season! This Washington Commanders team has lost six straight games, and that's in large part due to their defense. Washington's pass defense allows 387 yards per game, which ranks second-worst in the NFL. Sutton will take advantage of that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The only thing that's better than Thanksgiving dinner is when you can break open the leftovers. As we gear up for a jam-packed Sunday slate of NFL action, there's no better time to dive into those final pieces of turkey while firing off some last-minute bets in the process. Given that we just went through a busy Thanksgiving and Black Friday allotment of games, it's easy to not have your eye on the ball in terms of how to wager for the rest of Week 13. And that's where we come in. Below, we're going to highlight our best bets for the remaining games on the slate and give out a pick for every other contest on the docket. One common theme that you'll find in our best bets is that we're backing the underdogs to cover, which would be a continuation of what we've seen earlier in Week 13 as all four prior matchups saw the underdog not only cover, pull off the outright upset. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

Houston's defense is playing as well as any unit in the NFL right now. They rank first in the NFL in total yards per game allowed (264.3) and passer rating allowed (72.2), along with ranking second in points per game allowed (16.5). Meanwhile, Daniel Jones hasn't been as lights out as he was to begin the season. Over his last three starts, Jones has an 83.0 passer rating with five total touchdowns and seven turnovers compared to the 109.5 passer rating, 17 total touchdowns, and three turnovers in the eight games before that. This is the type of defense that can highlight the recent lull from Jones. While I think Indy can find a way to pull this out at home, it'll be within the number, and we'll be asking a lot of questions about this team's ceiling coming out of the contest. Projected score: Colts 24, Texans 21The pick: Texans +3.5Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles ChargersSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The Raiders are in a bad way, falling to 2-9 on the season last week following a loss to the Browns, which led to the firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. It's possible that this move provides a momentary boost for the unit in this divisional matchup, but this pick has more to do with questions surrounding the Chargers than anything else. Let's not forget that this team came out extraordinarily flat in a 35-6 loss to the Jaguars before the Week 12 bye. While they'll be well-rested for this game, it doesn't necessarily mean Justin Herbert will be better protected. They are still without starting left tackle Joe Alt for the year, and Herbert's numbers have dipped in his absence. Without Alt, Herbert is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt and has eight touchdowns with six interceptions compared to the 8.3 yards per attempt average, 11 touchdowns, and three interceptions with him. Las Vegas has a pass rusher led by Maxx Crosby who can continue to give Herbert fits, so this stays within a double-digit game. Projected score: Chargers 23, Raiders 17The pick: Raiders +9.5San Francisco 49ers at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)If it were up to Brock Purdy, the 49ers would've lost in Week 12. The 49ers quarterback tossed three first-half interceptions against the Panthers on Monday night, but was bailed out by his defense that allowed just three points off those turnovers en route to a win. And Purdy's struggles go beyond just this game as he's thrown seven interceptions in four starts this season overall. Now, he's asked to shake that off against a Browns defense that has been utterly dominant this season and is coming off a 10-sack performance in Week 12 against the Raiders. On the year, the unit is top three in the league in yards per game allowed (273.0), passing yards per game allowed (170.7), sacks (42), and third-down efficiency (34.5% opponent conversion rate). If Cleveland continues to play at that level, Purdy's issues could persist and keep the Browns within range of an upset. \nProjected score: 49ers 23, Browns 20The pick: Browns +4.5New York Giants at New England PatriotsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN | Fubo, try for free)The Patriots enter Week 13 atop the AFC as the No. 1 seed in the conference and the first club to reach 10 wins on the year. While they were able to notch a ninth straight win over the Bengals last week, it came at a cost. The entire left side of their offensive line went down due to injury, and both left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson are expected to miss time, including Monday's contest. One of the strengths of New York this season has been its front, which is headlined by Brian Burns (13 sacks). With reserves set to man Drake Maye's blindside, there's an opportunity for Burns, Abdul Carter, and others to tee off and throw the Patriots offense off the track. If they can do that, it'll help Jaxson Dart stay within the spread in his return to action.Projected score: Patriots 24, Giants 20The pick: Giants +7Rest of the bunchJaguars at TitansProjected score: Jaguars 27, Titans 17The pick: Jaguars -6Saints at DolphinsProjected score: Dolphins 28, Saints 20The pick: Dolphins -5.5Falcons at JetsProjected score: Falcons 24, Jets 17The pick: Falcons -2.5Cardinals at BuccaneersProjected score: Cardinals 24, Buccaneers 21The pick: Cardinals +3.5\nRams at PanthersProjected score: Rams 30, Panthers 17The pick: Rams -10Vikings at SeahawksProjected score: Seahawks 27, Vikings 14The pick: Seahawks -11.5Bills at SteelersProjected score: Bills 30, Steelers 21The pick: Bills -3Broncos at CommandersProjected score: Broncos 27, Commanders 20The pick: Broncos -5.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin had one final message for Ole Miss on the way out the door: You're just not good enough. Don't confuse his desire to coach in the College Football Playoff with actual remorse. By choosing to leave Ole Miss for fellow SEC foe LSU, as Yahoo reported he intends to do, Kiffin is saying with his entire chest that he can't win a national championship in Oxford, Mississippi. This is despite the Rebels being a lock for the CFP at 11-1 overall during what is by far Kiffin's best season as a head coach.  \n        \n            \n                Latest on Jon Sumrall and Florida, Lane Kiffin and other coaching search news\n                \n                    Matt Zenitz                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSomeone who rejects a program so openly doesn't deserve a chance to coach that team in the playoff. It shouldn't even be a discussion.If Kiffin wants to take LSU, he should move to Baton Rouge immediately.  Let one of the Rebels remaining coaches -- be it a Pete Golding or a Joe Judge -- lead the playoff charge. Teams feed off belief. If Kiffin actually wants to coach in the playoff, he has an easy option to do so. He could stay with Ole Miss. It's unreasonable to expect Ole Miss would let him finish out the season and then leave for competitor, especially in an era where so many of his players could go with him. \nFrankly, all of this is an ironic calculus by Kiffin given Oxford is where he experienced a career rebirth. Remember, for all Kiffin's recent success and his soon-to-be record-setting pay bump, his history as a coach is littered with failure. He escaped in the middle of the night in Knoxville after just one 7-6 season. He got fired on a tarmac as USC's head coach. Nick Saban even fired Kiffin ahead of a national championship game when Kiffin couldn't juggle his offensive coordinator duties with his next role as FAU's head coach. Other than a few seasons in Boca Raton, Oxford is the only place where Kiffin's had any real extended success on the big stage as a decision maker. \nIn Mississippi, Kiffin found a program that embraced his eccentric nature. Athletic director Keith Carter gave Kiffin all the leeway possible to run the Rebels as he saw fit. Ole Miss' collective emerged as an industry leader in the NIL era, allowing the Rebels to consistently reel in top portal classes Does Ole Miss have the recruiting firepower of a LSU, Alabama or Georgia? Obviously not. The history of Rebels football isn't there. The high-end money of a program like Oregon or Miami isn't either. There's a reason why the Rebels usually sign top 20 classes instead of top 10. But it's not as if Kiffin's ever been a superstar recruiter. He's a showy one. He wins on social media. But those who've worked with Kiffin wouldn't describe him as a recruiting maniac like his mentor Saban or his friend Kirby Smart. \nYou can get away with that at Ole Miss. The fans there were thrilled with Kiffin's portal-first approach. It will be much more difficult in Baton Rouge where elite classes are expected and every recruiting battle is a live-or-die moment for the Tigers community. That's the most confusing thing about Kiffin flirting with LSU and Florida so openly. \nYou could argue he already found his football soul mate. There's a reason Kirk Fertenz is in Year 27 at Iowa or that Steve Spurrier had so much success in 12 years at Florida. They were (are) great football coaches, yes. But their personality and style fit their school. Kiffin and Ole Miss seemed to be an ideal match. Nobody embraced Kiffin more than the Rebels faithful. And you know how he repaid that? With a wandering eye toward Auburn way back in 2022 and then Florida and LSU this time around. Those who've worked for Kiffin have expected him to chase a bigger SEC job for years. So, I'd just ask: Why doesn't Kiffin believe more in himself? The Rebels are just four games away from the ultimate goal in college football. Kiffin's already managed four double-digit win seasons in his last five years in Oxford. It's taken LSU 13 years to have that many double-digit win efforts. \nKiffin didn't have to leave Oxford to chase what he's looking for. That's why the thought of Kiffin getting to coach the Rebels in the playoff is so absurd.Why would Ole Miss, a program on the verge of history, let someone who's showed so little faith in the program keep leading it? \n            ",

The Sooners stunned Alabama two weeks ago to move into the top 10, and should maintain their spot as long as they take care of business against a flailing LSU squad. The Tigers fired coach Brian Kelly midseason and have since been inconsistent. LSU barely eked out wins against Arkansas (23-22) and Western Kentucky (13-10), but the defense has been lockdown across the season. In the win against Western Kentucky, the Tigers held the Hilltoppers to 152 total yards and 2.3 yards per play. Last season, LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier threw for 277 yards and three touchdowns in a 37-17 win against the Sooners. However, Nussmeier is questionable for the matchup as the Sooners push for their 10th win. Where to watch Oklahoma vs. LSU liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oklahoma vs. LSU: Need to know  Finding a way: Oklahoma's offense has remained an inconsistent unit despite the addition of quarterback John Mateer, but the Sooners' defense and special teams have been on a ridiculous run. Against Tennessee, kicker Tate Sandell hit three 50+ yard field goals to join a defensive touchdown. In an upset against Alabama, three Oklahoma drives started in Tide territory, along with another defensive score. Even against Missouri, Peyton Bowen blocked a field goal to hold the score. The Sooners are Iowa-ish in the way they control games without offense. \nStar secondary: LSU has limped out to a 7-4 season, but their highly-rated additions in the secondary have proven vital. Cornerback Mansoor Delane rates among the best in the sport, while safeties A.J. Haulcy and Tamacrus Cooley have led a stacked unit. The Tigers lead the SEC with a 109.7 opposing passer rating and have allowed only eight touchdowns to 14 interceptions. Mateer has mostly avoided mistakes, but the Tigers are by far the best pass defense the Sooners have played this year. Sategna's emergence: Oklahoma wide receiver Isaiah Sategna has quietly come on as one of the most important players on the roster. The junior is sixth in the SEC with 56 receptions, including at least four catches in every single FBS game. Last week against Missouri, Sategna broke off an 87-yard touchdown that proved to define the game. LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane is one of the best in the sport; the battle between him and Sategna will set the tone.   Oklahoma vs. LSU prediction, picks  \nBoth Oklahoma and LSU expected more out of their quarterback situations, but instead, expect an ugly defensive battle in Norman. Both teams will struggle to run the ball and the game could hinge on which team makes fewer mistakes on offense and special teams. That kind of game favors Oklahoma to win, but 10 is far too many points in a game that might not feature multiple touchdowns. Pick: LSU +10\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        The Legends Trophy is on the line as No. 9 Notre Dame and Stanford close out the regular season with a rivalry game. The Fighting Irish head to The Farm on Saturday in search of their third consecutive win over the Cardinal, and as commanding favorites over one of the ACC's bottom-dwelling squads, anything short of a victory would be not only a surprise but also catastrophic to their season goals.Those aspirations include a trip to the College Football Playoff, which is well within sight for Marcus Freeman and his team. The math is simple. With one final regular-season victory, Notre Dame will be a near lock to clinch a spot in the bracket. With a loss, the Fighting Irish can plan on watching the playoff from home.Even on the heels of a 70-7 win over Syracuse and with Stanford set to miss a bowl game, the Fighting Irish must not take the regular-season finale for granted. Coach Frank Reich guided the Cardinal to a victory in last week's Big Game with a season-high 31 points against California, and that triumph could give redshirt freshman quarterback Elijah Brown confidence as he leads the offense into another rivalry battle.Stacked with elite offensive talent, though, the Fighting Irish should be able to post a number on the scoreboard that Stanford is simply not capable of reaching.\nWhere to watch Notre Dame vs. Stanford liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 10:30 p.m. ETLocation: Stanford Stadium -- Stanford, CaliforniaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Notre Dame vs. Stanford: Need to knowPoints aplenty: The 70 points Notre Dame amassed in last week's rout of Syracuse were the program's most since 1932. The first 21 of those points came before the Fighting Irish even took an offensive snap. Across the first 5:17, the defense recorded two pick-6's and the special teams unit pitched in with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown. After the outburst, Notre Dame ranks as the seventh-highest-scoring team in college football.Gotta Love it: With his 20 touchdowns from scrimmage, Jeremiyah Love has a new career high in what has been nothing short of a marvelous year for the Heisman Trophy contender. He made three trips to the end zone last week and has scored in every game this year but the season opener. Love, with his 1,306 rushing yards, leads an incredible running back tandem with Jadarian Price, who boasts 10 touchdowns of his own.\nTake it away, Stanford: The Cardinal forced seven turnovers across their first two November home games, good for the most of any team in the country. Two of those takeaways came last week by way of scoop-and-score fumble returns. Standout linebacker Matt Rose picked up a third fumble in the Big Game win to add to his breakout season as one of the ACC's top defenders. He also boasts 97 total tackles on the year, good for second-most in the conference.Aerial threats: While Stanford has largely been woeful on offense this season, it does feature a pair of prolific playmakers in its receiving unit. Sam Roush is the most productive tight end in the ACC with 472 receiving yards, and wide receiver CJ Williams ranks fifth in the conference with 58 catches. Cardinal quarterbacks Ben Gulbranson and Elijah Brown struggled mightily at generating a consistent passing attack, but their safety valves are about as reliable as they come in this league.Notre Dame vs. Stanford prediction, picks\nPicking against Notre Dame after a 63-point just win feels wrong, but there is enough going Stanford's way to suggest the Cardinal can keep this rivalry game within a massive number. While nobody will confuse Stanford Stadium with the nation's toughest environments, the home team is 4-1 straight-up in the Bay Area and just set a season high in points (31) in front of its local fans. Frank Reich's squad is simply much sharper and, frankly, quite competent at home. Combine that with the fact that Marcus Freeman may be content with sitting on a lead and keeping his guys healthy for the CFP, and a five-touchdown margin becomes awfully large.

    "body": "\n        No. 19 Tennessee is set to host No. 14 Vanderbilt Saturday for the 120th meeting all-time between two of the SEC's oldest rivals. There's plenty at stake for both teams, as they look to solidify their postseason standing in the final week of the regular season. Though the Vols and the Commodores first met in 1892, this will be the first time in series history that both are ranked inside the AP Top 25 -- and the College Football Playoff Rankings -- at kickoff. This is also just the fifth time that Vanderbilt can boast an AP ranking entering its game against Tennessee and the first since 1958. The Commodores are 1-3 in those meetings. They've also just won once in 42 meetings against AP-ranked Tennessee teams. That one win came in 2016. So history certainly is not on Vanderbilt's side as it looks to build its case for a College Football Playoff appearance. The Commodores have also lost their last six in a row against Tennessee. They have not won in Knoxville in eight years. \nBut Tennessee has undergone its own share of struggles this season. The Vols have yet to down a ranked team and they have struggled against some of the SEC's lower-tier teams like Mississippi State and Arkansas. There's still motivation to send the year out on a high note and secure a quality bowl game. Where to watch Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Neyland Stadium -- Knoxville, TennesseeTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nTennessee vs. Vanderbilt: Need to know  Biggest game in Vanderbilt history: The stakes are simple for Vanderbilt: Win, and it gives itself a good chance to snag an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff. That the Commodores have a chance to do this on the road against their oldest active rival only adds to the importance. Vanderbilt is also seeking 10 wins in a single season for the first time in program history. The Commodores are the only current Power Four team without a 10-win campaign on record. There's no doubt that this is the biggest game that Vanderbilt has ever played, especially since the Commodores have not so much as won a conference title in the modern era of college football.     A lot on the line for Tennessee, too: Tennessee is virtually out of the College Football Playoff race at this point. The Vols have yet to snag a victory against an FBS team with a winning record and they're 0-3 against ranked opponents this season. But they do have a chance to win nine games for a fourth straight season, something they have not done since 1995-99. For rivalry purposes, Tennessee can also spoil Vanderbilt's Cinderella story which, after winning at Florida for the first time in 22 years, would be a nice cherry on top of a decent season for the Vols.    Vanderbilt's Pavia closing in on another record: Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia already holds the Vanderbilt record for most touchdowns passing in a season at 26. He leapt past former Commodore star Kyle Shurmur in the process. Now, he's just 254 yards away from surpassing Kurt Page for the most yards passing in a single season in program history. Pavia, who has 2,924 yards through the air on the year, is also close to becoming just the fourth Vanderbilt quarterback to exceed 3,000 yards passing in a single season. Both feats are certainly doable against a Tennessee secondary that ranks near the bottom of the SEC. \n  Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt prediction, picks  Tennessee currently ranks 14th in the SEC in total defense (378.5 yards per game). Vanderbilt ranks 11th in the SEC in total defense (353.4 ypg). Tennessee has held just one conference opponent below 30 points all season. Vanderbilt allowed an average of 32 points in its two games against top-20 foes this season. Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar is just the fifth 3,000-yard passer in program history. Pavia is a Heisman Trophy candidate. Are you getting the picture yet?

    "body": "\n        ANN ARBOR, Michigan -- Ryan Day didn't need to overthink himself to finally snap the four-game skid that had consumed him. He just needed to be himself.Pressure tends to bring out the best or worst in coaches. For Ohio State, a dangerous mix of those two resulted in a bizarre identity crisis: a four-game losing streak in \"The Game\" but a 52-1 record against every other Big Ten team.On Saturday, Day ditched the overcorrections and went back to what works. Michigan had no counter.\"I don't think there was any doubt when we walked into the stadium what was going to happen,\" Day declared after the 27-9 victory.\nA year after Ohio State tried to reinvent itself for one opponent and prove a point against Michigan by abandoning a high-flying offense to play bully ball, the coach kept it simple: just be a Buckeye.Julian Sayin threw howitzers through the air, dropping laser-guided bombs for two incredible touchdown catches by super receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate. Then the Buckeyes went to the ground, bulldozing Michigan and marching through the snow on a single possession to prove a point: these Buckeyes are not just better, they're bigger and stronger than the Wolverines.A 20-play drive over the course of 11 minutes, 56 seconds in the second half -- easily the longest drive of the season -- in the driving snow was more of a statement than any flag panting at midfield would have been.\n\"We wanted to end the game on our terms,\" Sayin said.\n        \n            \n                Ohio State's Julian Sayin finally got to make his Heisman case in Buckeyes' emphatic win over Michigan\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd, no, Ohio State didn't plant its flag or stomp on the block \"M\" at midfield. Day made sure of that, motioning a raucous group of Buckeyes back to the sideline after the game. Day had a lot to say after finally beating his rival for the first time since 2019, but he bit his lip, adding, \"The best thing to do is win with humility.\"Then again, maybe this is just the start of a new routine and winning streak in the sport's fiercest rivalry.\"When you think about where we were at this point last year to all the way now, there's been a lot of great football,\" Day said.\nMaybe it was that 13-10 loss last year inside a bone-chilling Ohio Stadium that awakened Day. Something flipped. Sixteen straight wins. A national title. Now a 12-0 record after losing 14 players to the NFL Draft. This shouldn't make sense, but it does at Ohio State. No team is hotter or better because of Ohio State's reluctance to stray from a self-determined identity. Eleven straight wins by double digits. A defense for a generation. All of that will be challenged next week in the Big Ten Championship Game against undefeated Indiana, a team hammering opponents by an average of 33.4 points, the widest margin in the sport since Florida State won the national title in 2013.For now, Day should live in the moment. He should celebrate. A year ago, fans turned on the coach, booing him out of Ohio State, demanding answers after losing a fourth straight to Michigan and missing the Big Ten Championship. The outside noise was so loud, Day's family hired security to guard their home. \nFour years is a lifetime in college football, but a win against a rival can erase many bad memories.\"You can see it in my face the last couple years,\" Day said. \"You feel like you're letting everybody down. That's just not a good feeling. You work like hell to make sure that you do everything you can to get your guys prepared. That's all you can do. That's exactly what happened here.\"Ohio State's offense may get the praise, but its defense has proven to be one of the best of the last 50 years. No opponent has scored 17 points in this 12-game season, a first in the sport since 1975 (Florida). \nThe offense will get headlines, but the defense has been the anchor of the entire season. No opponent reached 17 points through 12 games -- something no FBS team has done since 1975 Florida. Michigan came nowhere close. Outside of an opening burst and Sayin's lone mistake, the Wolverines were swallowed whole: 39 total yards in the second half, minus-8 rushing after racking up 108 before halftime.\n        \n            \n                2025 Big Ten Championship Game: Ohio State vs. Indiana set for monumental clash in Indianapolis\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We knew whatever they brought to us we were going to stop,\" defensive end Caden Curry said.Ohio State outgained Michigan 419-163 and took its rival's will somewhere deep under the snow.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, as the Buckeyes churned through their marathon drive, linebacker Sonny Styles glanced at teammate Payton Pierce and soaked in the moment. The snow, the stakes, the rivalry.\"I'm playing in 'The Game' right now,\" Styles said. Both teams trying to get to the Big Ten Championship. It's snowing. It's the end of November. It's the stuff you dream about.\"The domination all season may seem like a dream, but this is Ohio State. The Buckeyes are fully comfortable in their skin, fully aware of their power. \n\"We definitely got way more on the table and we just have so much more to prove,\" Curry said. \"This team has such a great story that needs to be told.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WWE's biggest superstars are calling for reinforcements. Survivor Series takes place in San Diego with two blockbuster WarGames matches. CM Punk, AJ Lee, Roman Reigns, Becky Lynch, and Brock Lesnar are among the main event stars taking part.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.Plus, John Cena takes part in his final PPV-level event when he looks to defend his newly won intercontinental title against the man he won it from in Dominik Mysterio. And Stephanie Vaquer looks to defend the women's world championship against Hall of Famer Nikki Bella.With so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what  the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action  goes down in San Diego.\n2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictionsCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, and The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) vs. Brock Lesnar, Drew McIntyre, and The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul) (WarGames match): I fear WWE leans on its classic playbook: Lesnar comes, Lesnar smashes, Lesnar leaves. The company's booking philosophy suggests that Lesnar will be last to enter the fray. He's the biggest star among The Vision's team, and his matches are typically short. The Vision's success in elevating its members is up for debate, but they definitely benefit from a win more than their opponents do. Punk, Reigns and Rhodes are essentially bulletproof. The Vision and McIntyre, specifically, are overdue for a win. Pick: The Vision wins -- Shakiel Mahjouri (also Brent Brookhouse)Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: I see no reason for Cena to win this match. The win over Mysterio was more of a career achievement award, allowing Cena to win the one title he had never held and become a grand slam champion. But Cena doesn't need the belt heading into his final match, and Mysterio holding a win over Cena would be perfect for Mysterio's character. He would be so obnoxious about defeating Cena that it would be a staple talking point in his promos for at least a year. That alone is a good enough reason for Mysterio to get the victory. Sometimes the decision is as simple as what benefits the promotion moving forward. Pick: Mysterio wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)AJ Lee, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, IYO SKY, and Rhea Ripley vs. Becky Lynch, Lash Legend, Nia Jax, and The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) (WarGames match): If WWE wants to level out The Vision's victory in the main event, they can give the heroes a win in the women's WarGames match. No one on Lynch's team desperately needs a victory, so it's hard to picture them edging out the fan favorites. Lee's team also has more main event stars, meaning one or two of them can parlay a victory into a world title program on Raw or SmackDown. Pick: Team AJ wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella's sole purpose here is name recognition. She's a semi-retired, part-time act coming off a rough return against Becky Lynch. By contrast, Vaquer is a talented full-time act with potential to become a major star for the company. Beating a WWE Hall of Famer will be a great feather in Vaquer's cap. Pick: Vaquer wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of WWE's signature events is back with some of the biggest stars imaginable. WWE Survivor Series goes down on Saturday night in San Diego with the imaginative format taking center stage once again in WarGames. There will be two WarGames matches taking place at Petco Park -- the fourth straight year the stipulation has been used -- in the men's and women's divisions, and will have names like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, AJ Lee, Rhea Ripley and Charlotte Flair in action.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.\nSurvivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion wrestles his last pay-per-view match, granting Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Plus, women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer has quite the challenge on her hands when she takes on former friend Nikki Bella with the title on the line. Bella turned her back on Vaquer after beginning to mentor the wrestler in her first year up from NXT. Now, the Hall of Famer has gold on her mind in her first world title match in nearly a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 7 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins. On the last Raw before Survivor Series, McIntyre and Paul won a match, earning their team the advantage.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch. On the final SmackDown before Survivor Series, Flair defeated Asuka to win her team the advantage.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Big 12 Championship Game is set as No. 5 Texas Tech and No. 11 BYU will battle at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday morning. The Cougars and Red Raiders have lorded above the rest of the league all season and formally clinched the matchup after Arizona State lost to Arizona on Friday night. Last year, four different teams tied at 7-2 in conference play. This year, there was no such concern. The Red Raiders and Cougars stood above the rest of the Big 12 for most of the 2025 season and previously played a top 10 matchup in Lubbock in November. The game will be highly significant as both BYU and Texas Tech try to make a College Football Playoff case. The Red Raiders are locks for the field and could push for a bye, but BYU sits on the outside looking in heading into the battle. They could need the Big 12's auto-bid just to reach the postseason. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Big 12 Championship Game. \n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Texas TechThe Red Raiders have been one of the best stories of the college football season after making a significant transfer portal investment over the offseason. Despite replacing both coordinators over the offseason, the Red Raiders lead the Big 12 in every major statistical category, including total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. \nAfter destroying UCF 48-9 last week, the Red Raiders captured their first 10-win season since 2008, the historic Michael Crabtree campaign. All 10 wins have come by double-digits, making for one of the most dominant runs in Big 12 history. The only loss came when starting quarterback Behren Morton was sidelined. With Morton banged up, Texas Tech has leaned heavily on running back Cameron Dickey to great success. The sophomore is No. 2 in the conference with 944 yards and leads the league with 13 touchdowns entering Week 14. However, the defense is the star of the show, rating top-five nationally in most analytic metrics. The Red Raiders are the only team with multiple finalists for the Nagurski Award, as linebacker Jacob Rodriguez and edge rusher David Bailey push for All-America honors. Texas Tech has not won an outright conference championship since 1955 or played for a Big 12 title since the league was formed in 1996. Generational curses could come to an end in Arlington. \n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about BYUThe Cougars are one of the top teams in college football over the past two years, posting a 21-3 combined record heading into Week 14. The only multi-score loss came against the Red Raiders on Nov. 8 in a marquee matchup, a 29-7 decision in Lubbock. After losing incumbent starting quarterback Jake Retzlaff to transfer, the Cougars turned to true freshman Bear Bachmeier. Despite only joining for the fall, Bachmeier has been one of the most effective quarterbacks in the Big 12. The Murrieta, California, native has thrown for 2,304 yards, rushed for 525 yards and scored 24 total touchdowns entering the weekend. But for BYU, defense and running take the spotlight. The Cougars rank near the top in most defensive metrics as linebackers Jack Kelly and Isaiah Glasker lead the way. Safety Faletau Satuala has been a breakout star, while running back LJ Martin leads the Big 12 in rushing yards. \nThe Cougars become the first team from the Big 12's first expansion in 2023 to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and second overall behind Arizona State. BYU has not won a conference championship since leaving the Mountain West Conference for independence in 2011. Texas Tech vs. BYU predictionWhen these two teams played in Lubbock, Texas Tech's defense dominated the matchup. Linebacker Jacob Rodriguez had a key interception and forced fumble in the game as BYU's offense was held off the scoreboard until the fourth quarter. BYU offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick will open up the downfield playbook with his freshman quarterback to try and spread the defense, which will create opportunities. However, Texas Tech is playing at an unbelievably high level right now, and won't waste its crowning moment. Prediction: Texas Tech wins Big 12 championship\n            ",

The goal was to play as close to perfect as possible in an effort to impress the College Football Playoff selection committee.And anything that happens from there in the bevy of ACC Championship scenarios and two-loss teams ahead of Miami in the current rankings was beyond the Hurricanes' scope. Following a dominant 38-7 showing, Mario Cristobal and the rest of his coaching staff and players will be glued to live scores on the flight home to try and map out positive outcomes that could benefit the Hurricanes later next week when the penultimate playoff rankings are revealed.\"This is a College Football Playoff team,\" Cristobal said after the game Saturday. \"We've all seen it. We know it. Proud of the way our guys came out, dominated from start to finish. We left a lot of points on the board as well. We're really starting to click. Complete dominance. We've got great players in all phases, and we're playing great football in all phases. The best part about football is you get to settle it on the field, where head-to-head is always the No. 1 criterion.\"Miami would play for a conference title only if Virginia Tech beats Virginia and California upsets SMU on Saturday night. That would give the Hurricanes a chance to secure an automatic bid next weekend in Charlotte. The more likely scenario is the wait-and-see frustration that comes with being one of several at-large hopefuls at 10-2 overall.\nWhere Miami is ranked Tuesday night is paramount since there's no additional game to move up in the eyes of the committee. Others could possibly move out -- namely 10th-ranked Alabama if the Crimson Tide beat Auburn then lose to Georgia in the SEC title game, and No. 11 BYU should the Cougars get crushed by Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship.Without a conference crown, Miami needs to get to No. 10 in the final rankings to reach the playoff and the Hurricanes will be battling for that spot with the Crimson Tide, Cougars and now Texas, whose impressive win over No. 3 Texas A&M on Friday night was a signature victory for the Longhorns.For the first time this season, the committee ranked Miami in the same tier -- or pod -- as No. 9 Notre Dame last week, which is significant given the Hurricanes' last two victories over common opponents that the Fighting Irish also dominated. Notre Dame was still ahead of Miami by a significant margin, despite its head-to-head loss to the Hurricanes in the opener.\nNotre Dame plays at Stanford on Saturday night as a heavy favorite and will likely finish 10-2.Miami's clearest playoff pathA loss Saturday by Alabama, Oklahoma or Notre DameSignificant game control edge over BYU + Texas should final at-large spot come down to thoseA loss by BYU to Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship GameA loss by Virginia and SMU to get into next week's ACC Championship Game\n            \n    ",

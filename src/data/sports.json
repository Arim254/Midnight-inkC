    "body": "\n        The available Week 7 survivor pool teams has dwindled even further. Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football', Broncos (-7) vs. Giants and Mike Vrabel's return to Tennessee in Patriots (-7) vs. Titans.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

The Packers are 6.5-point and -341 money-line favorites, making them one of four teams favored by more than a touchdown this week. The Cardinals are on a four-game losing streak, but they haven't lost by more than a field goal during that span. Kyler Murray (foot) is officially listed as questionable after missing last week's game. Even if he can't go, Jacoby Brissett is a very competent backup.

Mullen, a former SEC coach himself at Mississippi State and Florida, said he had 0.0% interest in succeeding Sam Pittman, and instead urged the school to hire current Florida State offensive coordinator and former Auburn coach Gus Malzahn instead.\"0.0 interest in Arkansas,\" Mullen wrote on X on Friday. \"Thanks for the shout out though. Y'all need to hire Gus Malzahn.\"Mullen has UNLV off to a 6-0 start (2-0 in Mountain West) in his first season at the helm of the program. Mullen spent 13 seasons as a head coach in the SEC, which included guiding Mississippi State to eight consecutive bowl games. Mullen had served as an on-air analyst for ESPN since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Arkansas coaching candidates: Rhett Lashlee, Bobby Petrino among options on hot board to replace Sam Pittman\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarlier in the week, Mullen addressed being linked to potential open jobs and reaffirmed his commitment to staying at UNLV.\n\"I'll be here,\" Mullen said. \"I'm going to be the head coach at UNLV next year. I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere.\" Arkansas fired Pittman last month after a 56-13 loss to Notre Dame, which dropped the Razorbacks to 2-3 at the time. Pittman finished with a 32-34 overall record at the school, which included going 14-29 against SEC opponents during his five-plus seasons as the coach.\nIf Arkansas did give Malzahn a look -- per Mullen's recommendation -- the school would get a coach with experience coaching in the SEC. The former Auburn coach left his post at UCF last fall to become the offensive coordinator at FSU under Mike Norvell. Malzahn helped orchestrate a 31-17 upset win over Alabama in Week 1, but FSU is just 2-3 since that dramatic victory.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Samoa Joe built his reputation as one of professional wrestling's most destructive forces. Ironically, he's also one of its most tender hands. As he prepares for \"Hangman\" Adam Page at AEW WrestleDream, Joe stands much closer to the end of his career than the start -- and he's determined to leave the industry better than he found it. \"Joe's gonna kill you\" is the rallying cry from fans when someone has the misfortune of sharing the ring with him. His legendary physicality and ruthless disposition contrast sharply with his soft-spoken reflections over Zoom. Much of the conversation centered on Joe's desire to shift attention toward AEW's next generation. Despite headlining Saturday's pay-per-view, he wasn't eager to hog the spotlight. It's a refreshing perspective in a business often dominated by ego.  \"I have known when great entertainment endeavors work, and I've seen  them fall apart to pieces,\" Joe told CBS Sports while discussing his upcoming AEW world championship match. \"I always laugh when I hear, 'You can make  money or you can make friends, but you can't do both in wrestling.' That  is an asinine statement. I've made tons of friends and I've made tons  of money.\"Joe's sentiments echoed an earlier conversation with interviewer Chris Van Vliet. Ten years ago, Tyson Kidd suffered a career-ending neck injury while taking a Muscle Buster from Joe in the WWE. It was a freak accident by all accounts. Joe voluntarily dropped the move for years. Not for fear of another injury, but out of respect, so Kidd, now a WWE producer, wouldn't be reminded of it each time Joe stepped in the ring.\nSuch empathy is rare. For Joe, that aptitude was shaped early. He debuted professionally in 1999, two years before ECW and WCW folded, leaving WWE as North America's lone major promotion. That collapse taught Joe a lasting lesson about ego and survival in wrestling.\"More often than not, a lot of that selfishness may  make you money, but generally, it leads to a lot of destruction and strife  throughout  the  company,\" Joe said. \"It can hurt a lot of things. It can close  companies down. Let's talk about the other side effects of this  behavior. I'm more   conscious because I came from a world where the  industry was completely   destroyed, and there wasn't an opportunity for a  man like me to make   any money.\"Starting a career in a monopolized industry forced Joe and others to forge new paths. Fortunately, passion -- and an audience hungry for alternatives -- filled the void. Joe went on to capture world titles in ROH, TNA and AEW, three beloved upstart promotions, each bigger than the last.  \n\"I had to  collaborate with others   to create systems and viability to make money in  the industry and   create new companies,\" Joe said. \"Those new companies weren't  created in this   backstabbing, everyone-for-themselves environment. They  were created by   a sum of great people, much like AJ Styles and me,  coming  together  to create something better for the fans. This theory is  based  on what  I've had to do my entire life and career... I'm going to   continue with  that despite what the drama merchants may want.\"Joe confirmed he'll \"most likely\" retire once his current AEW contract expires, a decision shaped, as always, by foresight. It's the outcome that best serves both his future self and the younger talent he hopes to elevate. \"You never want to  outstay your welcome in this industry, and I have been fortunate that I  have been able to be involved  with it for over 25 years now,\" Joe said. \"The other  thing, too, is that many of us want  to preserve what we can of our health for  our later years.\"\nCheck out the full interview with Samoa Joe below.  \nJoe kept his cards close when asked for a deadline. It's not strictly for privacy. Hold up a photo of Joe from 2002 and 2025, and little has changed: the same striped shorts, white towel and mean mug. He's never been flashy, and he applies the same principle to his exit. A grand send-off wouldn't feel right.  \"It might be a surprise. It might just be one day I'm   gone and leave it at that,\" Joe said. \"I'm not as ceremonial as everybody else. I   like disappearing into the sunset. I've always been somebody who's been firmly planted with my head toward the future and never   tried to dwell too much in the past. And it's kind of been my theory   with the industry, too. I would hope we always look towards the future   and not, obviously, appreciate the past, but not miss it too much.\"There's grieving happening among wrestling fans right now. John Cena will retire in December and Styles will hang up the gloves next year. The realization has hit: a generation of their heroes is aging out. Joe isn't sure what comes next for him after wrestling. He's not worried about it. Instead, he shares a piece of advice for those who come after him.\n\"The pushing of the envelope will always be an issue in wrestling,\" Joe said. \"If  there's anything I can tell people, it's not necessarily about trying to  put on the biggest spectacle, it's about making people care about you.  As long as they care about you and you've made that connection with  them, you'll be amazed and what they're willing to go through with you.\"\n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:\nLouisville +10.5 vs. MiamiMiami and Louisville played one of the most exciting games of the college football season last year, with the Hurricanes escaping in a 52-45 final. The Cardinals head into Friday's rematch ranked 12th nationally in yards allowed per game and are averaging 36 points per game offensively. Quarterback Miller Moss, a USC transfer, has thrown for 984 yards over the past three games. SportsLine's model is expecting a much closer game than the oddsmakers, as Louisville is covering in 63% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:Brewers +175 vs. DodgersLos Angeles took a commanding 3-0 lead in the NLCS with a 3-1 win on Thursday, giving the Dodgers a chance to sweep the series on Friday. However, the Dodgers have not been overly impressive offensively, which opens the door for Milwaukee to extend the series. Superstar Shohei Ohtani is just 3-for-29 at the plate since the start of the NLDS, and he has not pitched in 12 days heading into his Game 4 start.

Springer was replaced by fellow outfielder Joey Loperfido, who was only added to the roster on Thursday, replacing injured outfielder Anthony Santander.Springer, 36, had enjoyed a resurgent season this year for the Blue Jays. He batted .309/.399/.560 with 32 home runs and 18 stolen bases. His 161 OPS+ represented a new career best, and his contributions were worth an estimated 4.8 Wins Above Replacement.The Blue Jays held a 2-1 advantage at the time of Springer's departure. He hit a game-tying double in the fifth inning. A win would place the Blue Jays one more victory away from claiming the AL pennant and advancing to the team's first World Series since 1993.\nMajor League Baseball's rules surrounding playoff rosters dictate that if a player is removed during the course of a round, he is ineligible for the subsequent round. As such, it's plausible to suggest that the Blue Jays -- if they do advance -- would have to manage without either Springer or Santander.\n            \n    ",

Beck was a high-profile transfer portal addition from Georgia at the end of last year, but Louisville made a splash of its own in adding Miller Moss from USC. Moss threw for 2,555 yards and 18 touchdowns with nine interceptions at USC last year, and the fifth-year senior has thrown for more than 300 yards in three straight games for Louisville. Miami is the No. 2 team in the nation for good reason, but Louisville is 4-1 with its only loss coming in overtime against Virginia, who is 5-1 and ranked No. 18 in the nation. The Cardinals had a bye last week, so with additional time to rest and prepare, the model projects Louisville to cover the spread in 63% of simulations. Back Louisville at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Brewers to defeat the Dodgers (+176)The Brewers are one loss away from being swept, and although only one team has come back from being down 3-0 in postseason history, Milwaukee doesn't need to win all four games in one day. After having the best record in baseball (97-65) this season, the model expects a better final performance from the Brewers than exiting via sweep. Milwaukee also had the best road record in baseball at 45-36 this year. The Dodgers are starting Shohei Ohtani, and although the two-way superstar has pitched well over the past few months, he's only thrown 53 innings this season. The Brewers had the third-best scoring offense at 4.98 runs per game during the regular season, and the model projects value in them in this win-or-go-home matchup. The Brewers win in 49% of the model's simulations, showcasing strong value in backing Milwaukee on Friday. Back the Brewers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:North Carolina vs. Cal Over 46.5 total points (-115)Bill Belichick was considered one of the top defensive coordinators in the NFL before becoming arguably the greatest NFL head coach of all time. But that defensive success hasn't transferred over to Year One with the Tar Heels, as North Carolina ranks 100th in the nation in scoring defense at 30.8 ppg allowed. The Tar Heels are 102nd in yards per play allowed (6.0) and 97th in yards per game (417.3). Cal is coming off allowing 45 points to Duke, and the Golden Bears have allowed 34.3 ppg over their last three contests, so both offenses could take advantage of less-than-stellar defensive performances lately.

    "body": "\n        Developing a successful NFL DFS strategy can take many forms, but one of the most common approaches is focusing on games with the highest projected point totals when identifying top NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks.The highest over/under in the Week 7 NFL odds for the Sunday main slate is 54.5 in the Cowboys vs. Commanders matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include Colts vs. Chargers (over/under of 48.5), Saints vs. Bears (over/under of 46.5), and Raiders vs. Chiefs (over/under of 45.5). Thus, you can expect stars like Dak Prescott, Jayden Daniels, Jonathan Taylor, Ladd McConkey and Travis Kelce to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups. Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Daniel Jones or Justin Herbert find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Saquon Barkley and Tua Tagovailoa finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, where they can pick at Underdog and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager:The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel.

The former first-round pick out of North Carolina had a solid season as a rookie in 2024, as he threw for 2,276 yards with 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and a passer rating of 88.1. He also added 421 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on 54 attempts, showcasing his mobility and poise under pressure. In 2025, Maye has taken a big leap forward, throwing for 1,522 yards with 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions while completing over 73% of his throws. His improved accuracy and decision-making have helped the Patriots' offense become more efficient and balanced. Maye has shown impressive command of the playbook and confidence in the pocket, cutting down on turnovers while still attacking downfield. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cowboys running back Javonte Williams ($6,700 on DraftKings and $7,500 on FanDuel). The former second-round pick out of North Carolina signed with the Cowboys this past offseason after spending the first four years of his career with the Denver Broncos. Williams battled multiple injuries during his career in Denver, but still managed to rush for 2,394 yards and 11 touchdowns and catch 158 passes for 966 yards and five scores in 54 games. Williams has enjoyed a resurgence in Dallas, totaling 92 carries for 476 yards and five touchdowns through six games. He's also contributed 22 receptions for 83 yards and a receiving score, proving to be a reliable dual-threat option. Williams has shown renewed burst and confidence in the Dallas offense, thriving behind a strong offensive line. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 7 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        The NFL trade deadline is fast approaching, and rumors are swirling about various players who could potentially be dealt in the days and weeks to come.One of those players is All-Pro Cincinnati Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson. Hendrickson requested a trade multiple times this offseason amid a contract dispute with the team, but the Bengals ultimately did not honor that request and kept him around.With Cincinnati now 3-4 after a win over the Steelers and potentially back in the mix for a wild card playoff spot, the Bengals might not be inclined to deal Hendrickson. But with the star defensive lineman in the final year of his deal and the team apparently not willing to meet his long-term contract demands, they might also want to get out ahead of things and make sure they don't lose him for nothing in return this coming offseason.With that in mind, we wanted to create a list of potential landing spots for Hendrickson in the event the Bengals do decide to move him ahead of the deadline.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Carolina PanthersFor the second year in a row, the Panthers have a dreadful pass rush. Last season, they generated pressure on just 25.2% of dropbacks, which ranked dead last in the NFL. This year, they've somehow gotten pressure at an even lower rate: 24.3%, which again ranks dead last in the league. They are in desperate need of anybody who can get to the opposing quarterback. Hendrickson does that better than almost anyone else. The Panthers are surprisingly 3-3 and could look to add some talent at the deadline. With their $17 million or so in cap room, they can add the prorated amount remaining on Hendrickson's $16 million base salary.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsWe already know that there's a connection between Hendrickson and the Colts: Indy's defensive coordinator, Lou Anarumo, ran the Bengals' defense when Cincinnati spent big bucks to lure Hendrickson from the Saints; he personally oversaw each of Hendrickson's prolific seasons in the AFC North prior to this one. We also know the Colts could use some help in the pass rush department. They are in the bottom third of the league (tied for 21st) in pressure rate, per TruMedia. Between the need and the personal connection to the coaching staff, it's not hard to connect some dots here if you want to.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit LionsDetroit actually has a league-average pressure rate so far. (Like, exactly league average. The average pressure rate to date is 35.9% and the Lions have pressured quarterbacks on 35.9% of their dropbacks.) But with injuries mounting on the back end of the defense and some holes up front, it might be wise to lean into the pass rush as a foundation. Pairing Hendrickson and Aidan Hutchinson would give Detroit one of the best pass-rush duos in the league, if not the best. And the Lions have plenty of cap room available to make a move like this if they want to go in that direction: Only the Patriots, Cowboys and Commanders are further under the cap than Detroit at around $26.4 million.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensStop me if you've heard this before: the Ravens are not getting very much pressure on opposing quarterbacks. They're actually 28th in the NFL in pressure rate, just ahead of the Bengals. They also just traded away Odafe Oweh, leaving themselves even more shorthanded up front than they were due to the various injuries that have afflicted their defensive line. We know the Ravens love to try to buy in on elite players, especially if they come at a somewhat discounted cost. With Hendrickson in the final year of his deal, it's possible he could be had for a mid-round pick. If that's the case, Baltimore should be interested.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesSpeaking of teams that like to buy in on star players at potentially discounted prices, we have the Eagles. Philadelphia's pass rush this year has paled in comparison to what it was a year ago. The defense doesn't look the same and that lack of a dominant defensive line is a big part of it. Pairing Hendrickson on the edge with the likes of Jalen Carter on the interior would go a long way toward restoring the Eagles' advantage up front. We know that Howie Roseman is always looking for any and every avenue to improve his team midseason, and that he's not afraid to swing a major deal to upgrade a position of weakness. This could be one of those opportunities.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bradley Chubb has been one of the few bright spots for the Miami Dolphins during the 2025 NFL season. At 1-5, the AFC East club probably doesn't stand much of a chance of resurging for a playoff run. But the defense has gotten some vintage performances from Chubb one year after the longtime pass rusher missed a full season due to injury; he leads the unit with four sacks in six games.Now it might be time for Chubb to take his quarterback-chasing talents elsewhere. Why, you say? Wouldn't the Dolphins be especially motivated to keep him in town, given their widespread struggles on both sides of the ball? Isn't he one of the few reliable talents still left on a franchise that's already facing big-picture questions? The trouble is, he might be more valuable to Miami as a trade chip than a long-term building block, considering he's approaching 30 with a contract set to pay him more than $30 million in 2026.Where, exactly, might Chubb be headed if the Dolphins look to sell him ahead of the in-season deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 4? Here are some potential landing spots:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jacksonville JaguarsThe Jaguars are already paying top dollar to Josh Hines-Allen off the edge, and their defense ranks in the top 10 in terms of points allowed per game. Jacksonville ranks in the bottom five in sacks, however, logging just eight quarterback takedowns in the first six games. Chubb might like to stay in-state with a Florida relocation, and this swap might mean an actual chance at a division title and playoff run. New Jags general manager James Gladstone has shown an interest in splashy gambles (see: Travis Hunter deal), so this kind of upgrade could be par for the course.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesVic Fangio maximized the talent at his disposal in the Eagles' 2024 Super Bowl run. His current pass rushing outfit leaves a lot to be desired, however, with Nolan Smith Jr. banged up and veteran bargains like Azeez Ojulari and Joshua Uche hurting for sacks. Chubb isn't a spring chicken, so general manager Howie Roseman might be unwilling to part with a premium pick for such a short-term gamble. Still, Chubb is a Pro Bowl-caliber talent who also has experience playing under Fangio from their time with the Denver Broncos. Adding him might provide just the kind of spark the Birds need.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersThe 49ers have gotten occasionally decent push from Bryce Huff off the edge, but Robert Saleh's unit is otherwise in danger of depletion: With both Nick Bosa and Fred Warner lost for the year due to injury, San Francisco could sorely use some front-seven reinforcements. Chubb has been more of a standard 3-4 outside linebacker for much of his career, but pocket disruption is pocket disruption, and his veteran force could help preserve the 49ers' physicality in the trenches for the stretch run. They might really need the \"D\" if the offense can't stay healthy, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Texas Tech quarterback Will Hammond will make his first career start Saturday when the No. 7 Red Raiders travel to face Arizona State in one of the biggest games of the Big 12 season, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Typical starter Behren Morton left last week's win over Kansas with a lower leg injury and not practice this week in advance of the matchup with the Sun Devils.Hammond appeared in each of Texas Tech's first six games this season, on three occasions filling in for an injured Morton. He played extensively against Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Utah and Kansas and was more than serviceable in the role, combining for six total touchdowns in the three spots. He was excellent on the road against Utah, completing 13 of 16 passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns to go with 61 yards rushing. For the season, Hammond is a 66.7% passer with 411 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. The dual-threat weapon also has 231 yards and four additional scores on the ground in the first half of the season.Morton departed from last week's contest early in the second quarter after Kansas edge rusher Leroy Harris III sacked him and landed on his lower leg. He was ruled out for the game and watched the final two-plus quarters in street clothes on the sideline.\n        \n            \n                Texas Tech loses DT Skyler Gill-Howard, a top player on the Big 12's best defense, for season to injury\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile injuries limited Morton to just three complete games in the front half of the campaign, he has excelled when he on the field. The fifth-year veteran leads the Big 12 in yards per attempt and boasts 13 touchdowns to three interceptions as the catalyst behind the nation's second-highest scoring offense and third-best passing attack.\nThis is the second major blow to Texas Tech this week. Standout defensive lineman Skyler Gill-Howard was ruled out for the year with an injury he also sustained in the win over Kansas. The Red Raiders' defensive front has been among the nation's most formidable units this season but will miss Gill-Howard dearly as he grades as the fourth-best defensive tackle in the country, per Pro Football Focus.The Red Raiders, 6.5-point favorites at FanDuel, battle with Arizona State at 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday in a clash between a rising Big 12 power and the reigning conference champion. \nTexas Tech remains unbeaten while Arizona State, already with a conference loss, has minimal margin for error in its quest for a repeat title.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 Miami returns to action out of an off week with a Friday night home game against one of the ACC's top programs, welcoming Louisville to town in the latest test for the Hurricanes' unbeaten start to the 2025 season. With a huge rivalry win against Florida State in the rear view, Mario Cristobal's squad is now focused on finishing strong and securing a spot in the ACC Championship Game, which is the first step to winning the first ACC title in program history.  Louisville also had last week off but entered its break on a far different note, falling in overtime at home to Virginia back in Week 6. The Cardinals got 329 yards passing and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) from quarterback Miller Moss in the effort, but lost the turnover battle and gave up a walk-off touchdown on the second possession of overtime. At 4-1 overall, Louisville can still accomplish its goals of similarly competing for an ACC title, but that likely requires taking down the top-5 Canes in their own house on Friday night.  Bet Louisville vs. Miami at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Miami leads the all-time series with a 12-4-1 record, though Mario Cristobal and Jeff Brohm have split their meetings since taking over as head coaches at their respective alma maters. Louisville won 38-31 in 2023 en route to locking up a spot in the ACC title game, then last season Miami got revenge with a 52-45 win in Louisville last year.  \nWhere to watch Miami vs. Louisville liveDate: Friday, Oct. 17 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Follow along LIVE as the Hurricanes try to avoid the Friday night upset against Louisville.    Miami vs. Louisville: Need to know   Carson Beck's resurgence drives the Miami offense: Trying to fill the shoes for Cam Ward was going to be no easy task, but Carson Beck has found similar success without trying to replicate Ward's game. Beck ranks in the top five nationally in completion percentage and has done a great job of staying patient behind one of the best offensive lines in the country to dissect opposing defenses. The Hurricanes aren't putting up the same eye-popping offensive numbers as they did in 2024, but when Beck needs to take over he has shown he is capable of doing so like his 4 touchdown, no interception performance in the win against Florida State.   \nMiami defense boasting one of the best DE tandems in the country: The combination of Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr. have taken Miami's defense to a terrifying new level in 2025. The group needed a reset as new defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman took over a unit that was falling short of expectations, and with a new scheme and some healthier weapons the defense has become an absolute strength this season. Mesidor and Bain are among the best in the country when it comes to pressuring the quarterback, and their unique advantages change the way offenses have to adjust their play-calling particularly in key downs. Miami ranks second in the ACC and 14th nationally in third down defense, with that pass rush playing a key part.  Chris Bell stepping up in ACC play for Louisville: Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell has been one of the best pass catchers in ACC play, totaling 22 receptions for 305 yards and three touchdowns over the last two games. Bell was a machine in the loss to Virginia, racking up 12 receptions for a career-high 170 yards and two scores, becoming the first Louisville player since 2020 to have 170+ receiving yards in a game. Quarterback Miller Moss has been tasked with shouldering more of the offensive load as the Cardinals have dealt with some nagging and minor injuries in the running back room, and he's responded by elevating his production with the help of Bell's outstanding work at wide receiver.    Miami vs. Louisville prediction, picks   \nMiami has a major matchup advantage here when Louisville tries to block one of the best defensive fronts in the country. The Hurricanes don't do anything too exotic, they just have elite players who pin their ears back, win battles in the trenches and get after the quarterback. That's going to make for a long evening for Miller Moss so even if Miami's offense is a little slow out of the gates over the course of the game the Hurricanes should be able to cover the two-touchdown spread. Pick: Miami -13.5 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

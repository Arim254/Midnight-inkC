Although he lost his first two fights, he has not tasted defeat since. In September 2021, he earned a unanimous decision win over Ange Loosa in Dana White's Contender Series 39. He then joined UFC, and defeated Pete Rodriguez by TKO in his debut at UFC 270 in January 2022. In 20 professional fights, Della Maddalena is 18-2 with 12 wins by knockout, two by submission and four by decision.He is a highly decorated fighter, earning ESPN's 2022 UFC Men's Rookie of the Year and 2022 Co-Newcomer of the Year with Jailton Almeida by Cageside Press. He was UFC.com's 2022 Newcomer of the Year. He is a four-time Performance of the Night winner, and has won two Fight of the Night honors. He is No. 8 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. Check out SportsLine to see his picks and analysis.Makhachev, 34, turned professional in August 2010, and won his first 12 bouts, including his UFC debut in May 2015. At UFC 187, he defeated Leo Kuntz by submission. After being knocked out by Adriano Martins later that year, he has gone on a tear. In 28 career fights, he is 27-1 with five wins by knockout, 13 by submission and nine by decision.He is a former UFC lightweight champion, where he successfully defended his title four times before deciding on moving up in weight class.

Mariscal uses his pace, pressure and grittiness to intimidate his opponents and wear on them. His volume-striking attack makes him dangerous, but it's his ability to grapple and scramble that give him the edge in this matchup. Sabatini is a Ju-Jitsu ace, with 13 of his 19 pro wins coming by submission. He is a savvy grappler who can keep his opponents pinned to the mat. However, I have a hard time seeing him do that to Mariscal, who has never been submitted in his 18-6 pro career. Mariscal has a 73% takedown defense rate and has shown the ability to get up when taken down. If this fight plays out on the feet, Mariscal's relentlessness will overwhelm Sabatini.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev picksVithlani has strong picks for Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev and other bouts on the UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev card.

The host Vikings are 4-5 and in last place in the division, while the Bears are 6-3 and share the same record as Detroit Lions atop the division. The Green Bay Packers sit in third place at 5-3-1. The Bears right now are in playoff contention, but are they the real deal? They are coming off two weeks of comeback victories in which they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 47-42, and then rode a tremendous close to secure a wild 24-20 victory against the New York Giants last week. Their schedule strength has been on the easier side, defeating teams like the New Orleans Saints (2-8), Las Vegas Raiders (2-7) and Washington Commanders (2-8), so the question remains just how good are they.Bet Vikings vs. Bears at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:The Vikings may not be the truest test, but they are in season-saving mode so they should have extra motivation as a loss likely squashes any realistic path to the postseason. Minnesota is coming off a 27-19 loss to the Baltimore Ravens and defeated the Lions 27-24 the week prior. Is it just me, or does the Vikings' 14-3 record a season ago feel like a distant memory?Here's a look at how to watch the game live, along with betting odds and a prediction for the game.Where to watch Bears vs. Vikings liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 16 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Vikings -3; O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings)    Bears vs. Vikings: Need to knowMcCarthy has been banged up. J.J. McCarthy, the former No. 10 overall pick has been limited to four games this season due to injury, which is something that has already plagued his young career. He is 2-2 in those starts, with a 53.7 completion percentage, five touchdowns and six interceptions. McCarthy was limited in practice and will have a bandage on his hand as he recovers from hitting it on a helmet last week, said coach Kevin O'Connell. Williams stepping up. Over the last few weeks, Caleb Williams has impressed with his situational game awareness. He has been avoiding pressure and not just dodging the sacks, but making something out of seemingly busted plays. He hasn't thrown a pick in the last two weeks and so far this season, has 2,136 yards with 13 touchdowns and just four interceptions. The former No. 1 overall pick has already surpassed his rookie season win total. He also has 246 rushing yards on 48 attempts and three trips to the end zone.Where's the plunder?: Minnesota's defense has allowed 24+ points in four straight games and isn't taking the ball away from the opposing quarterback much, with just three interceptions on the year. The Vikings offense and special teams has struggled with turnovers recently, which hasn't exactly put the defense on a path to success. Though it must be said that the unit has been strong against the pass, allowing just 1,888 yards, which is tied for seventh-best in the league.Bears vs. Vikings prediction, pick\nI think the Bears will get revenge from their season-opening loss, get the road win and build upon their modest two-game winning streak.

He gave daily Fantasy football players a scare on Wednesday when he missed practice with a knee injury, but he was back by Thursday and he carries no injury designation heading into his matchup with the Browns. With that favorable matchup, can you trust Jackson in NFL DFS lineups, even if he is dealing with some knee soreness?Other top potential NFL DFS picks on the main slate at quarterback include Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Matthew Stafford.

Warren isn't putting up eye-popping numbers, but he's finding ways to be productive for DFS players. He scored twice in Week 9 despite averaging just 1.9 yards per carry that week. He was far more efficient in Week 10, averaging 5.0 yards per carry. The Bengals have given up more Fantasy yardage to opposing running backs than any other team, setting up a potential big day for Warren. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson at $7,500 on DraftKings and $,8600 on FanDuel, who is a nice bounce-back option after only catching four passes for 37 yards last week. He takes on the Bears, who have given up the third-most receiving touchdowns and the second-most receiving yards to opposing receivers. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 11McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

Thomas, who has already been discharged from the hospital, posted a video while standing up, indicating he was recovering well from the procedure. Thomas did not set a timetable for his return to the golf course but noted he will miss the start of the 2026 PGA Tour season at a minimum.\"My next few weeks will be a lot of resting before the rehab process begins,\" Thomas wrote. \"I have a great team behind me who I fully trust to get me back to a better place than I was before! Before you ask, I'm not putting any tournament on the calendar or specific time for returning. While I will miss some events in the beginning of 2026, I want to be very smart and patient in letting my disc fully heal so it isn't an issue again. I'm very lucky that the game of golf allows us to play at a high level for a long time, and that's what I plan on doing - this procedure will allow me to do that injury free in the future. Can't wait to see y'all back out there.\"\nThe 2026 PGA Tour season will start later than usual after The Sentry was cancelled due to drought conditions in Hawaii. Thomas won't set a target date, noting he will be patient and allow the disc to fully heal in hopes of avoiding any lingering issues. \nAlong with missing PGA Tour events, Thomas will no longer participate in the upcoming Skins Game competition on Black Friday. He was scheduled to compete with Keegan Bradley, Tommy Fleetwood and Xander Schauffele at his Panther National golf course in Florida. A replacement for Thomas was not immediately announced Friday. Thomas will also sit out the start of the TGL season. The second year of the simulator golf league begins Dec. 28, and if Thomas is going to miss tournaments in the 2026 season, he will assuredly be out for at least a portion of the TGL season for the Atlanta Drive. \nThe 2025 campaign was a return to form for Thomas, who picked up his first win since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and added three runner-up finishes among his eight top 10s. That showing earned Thomas a spot on the United States Ryder Cup team and pushed him back into the conversation among golf's best. Thomas' performance tapered off later in the year with just one top 10 in his last six events, and it has now become clear some of that was due to hip pain caused by a disc issue. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Injuries are a constant (and annoying) presence throughout the NFL season. While teams do their best to fend off the injury bug, it takes its fair share of bites, so it's worth monitoring how teams are handling that area of the game to better get a sense of how they'll perform from week to week. As we turn our attention to Week 11, injury storylines are front and center. Two of the game's brightest young quarterbacks, Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud, are still on the shelf. However, there is a positive development as it relates to injured quarterbacks, as the San Francisco 49ers are slated to get Brock Purdy back after he's missed the bulk of the year due to a toe injury. On top of the quarterback position, we're monitoring the statuses of some key contributors like Davante Adams, Bucky Irving, and Trey Hendrickson. Below, you can find the final injury designations for those players and more as teams turn in their final reports heading into the Week 11 slate.NFL odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

As for Sinnott, he popped up on the injury report on Thursday with an ankle injury and did not practice Friday, so his status is in true doubt. Chubb was a late addition to the injury report, popping up on Friday with a foot injury that now has him questionable for Sunday's international matchup. Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBearsT.J.

On a more positive note for Carolina, running back Rico Dowdle logged a full practice on Friday and carries no injury designation for Week 11, meaning he'll play. London missed Wednesday's practice due to an illness, but was limited for the rest of the week with an added back ailment. His status will be worth monitoring up until kickoff. \nGreen Bay Packers (-7) at New York GiantsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPackersNate HobbsCBKneeOutMatthew GoldenWRShoulderQuestionableLukas Van NessDLFootQuestionableSavion WilliamsWRFootQuestionableGiantsJaxson DartQBConcussionOutChauncey GolstonDLNeckOutEvan NealOLHamstringOutDarius SlaytonWRHamstringOutKayvon ThibodeauxOLBShoulderOutTyler NubinSNeckDoubtfulRakeem Nunez-RochesDLToeDoubtfulPaulson AdeboCBKneeQuestionableBobby OkerekeLBShoulderQuestionableHobbs is the only player officially ruled out by the Packers after not practicing throughout the week. Meanwhile, Golden, who missed Monday's game against Philadelphia, was able to practice on a limited basis throughout the week, leaving him open to a potential return. New York officially ruled out Dart as he continues to deal with his concussion, which means Jameis Winston will start for the Giants against Green Bay. He'll do so, however, without Slayton at his disposal, while the defense will be missing Thibodeaux. Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBuccaneersBucky IrvingRBFoot, shoulderOutChris Godwin Jr.WRFibulaOutBen BredesonIOLHamstringOutHaason ReddickOLBAnkle, kneeOutMarkees WattsOLBHandOutBillsDalton KincaidTEHamstringOutPhidarian MathisDTShoulderOutTaron JohnsonCBGroinQuestionableCam LewisDBCalfQuestionableShaq ThompsonLBHamstringQuestionableDespite being limited throughout the week of practice, the Buccaneers will go at least another week without starters Godwin and Irving. The pass rush will also be thin with Reddick and Watts both sidelined. Ona more positive note, Vita Vea and Antoine Winfield Jr. both do not carry an injury designation, so they will play this week after appearing on the injury report. \nBuffalo will be without its top tight end target in Kincaid. He did not practice at all this week due to a hamstring injury. The Bills also could be thin in the secondary with Johnson and Lewis both questionable.

Meanwhile, Arnette popped up on the injury report on Friday as a DNP and will play play in Week 11. Despite having the bye week in Week 10 to rest up, Tennessee is still a little banged up. Specifically, we'll be monitoring the status of both Ridley and Simmons, who are each dealing with hamstring injuries.

With him officially ruled out, it clears the way for another start for Joe Flacco. Meanwhile, the Bengals defense will be missing two key figures in Hendrickson and Stewart off the edge. \nPittsburgh has ruled out Slay after he suffered a concussion against the Chargers. He did not practice at all this week.

Head coach Kyle Shanahan did note that Lenoir will undergo an MRI. It was announced earlier this week that Marvin Harrison Jr. would not play for the Cardinals in Week 11 as the wideout underwent surgery for appendicitis on Monday night. Meanwhile, linebacker Baron Browning did not practice all week due to a concussion and is out. Baltimore Ravens (-7.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRavensRashod BatemanWRAnkleOutJay HigginsLBKneeOutJustice HillRBToeOutMarlon HumphreyCBFingerOutMike GreenOLBAnkleQuestionableBrownsAlex WrightDEQuadOutMaliek CollinsDTObliqueQuestionableLamar Jackson logged his second consecutive full practice on Friday and carries no designation heading into Week 11, so he is good to go.

That said, Collins popped up on the injury report Friday, being listed as a limited participant in the session due to an oblique injury that now has him questionable.  Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChiefsIsiah PachecoRBKneeOutBroncosJ.K.

Dobbins in the backfield on Sunday due to a foot injury. That injury looks like it'll keep him sidelined much longer than Week 11, however, as NFL Media characterizers it as \"significant\" and injured reserve is a possibility.  \nDetroit Lions at Philadelphia EaglesSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusLionsTerrion ArnoldCBConcussionOutKerby JosephSKneeOutSam LaPortaTEBackOutJosh PaschalEDGEBackOutMarcus DavenportEDGEShoulderQuestionableTaylor DeckerOTShoulderQuestionableMiles FrazierGKneeQuestionableD.J.

Sewell did not practice on Friday, which isn't an encouraging sign. Meanwhile, Philly's injury report is the polar opposite of Detroit's.

The move came less than a year after Harrison orchestrated one of the most controversial trades in NBA history, which saw Luka Dončić go to the Los Angeles Lakers and Anthony Davis return to Dallas as part of the deal.Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki commented publicly for the first time since Harrison was fired on Friday, stating that this move \"should've happened this summer.\"\"Too many distractions, too much going on to keep going this way,\" Nowitzki said on the Prime pregame show. \"This move probably should've happened this summer, honestly. I didn't want this negative energy and this black cloud over the Cooper Flagg era. ... This trade just made no sense.

    "body": "\n        Before the start of the 2015 NBA Finals, LeBron James was asked how a defense can slow down Stephen Curry, who at the time was about to win his first of two straight league MVPs. \"The same way you slow me down,\" James famously said. \"You can't.\"Indeed, teams have been trying, and failing, to solve the opposing superstar riddle for NBA ages. James was right: you can't stop, or really even slow down, the best of the best when they have it going. And oh my lord did Nikola Jokić have it going Wednesday night when he became just the fourth player in history, and the first this century, to score at 55 points on 78% shooting. Somehow, the numbers don't do justice to how unbelievable Jokić was in this game. Of the 18 shots that he made, four hit the rim. Not including four bank shots and a dunk, Jokić connected on nine shots, eight jumpers and a jump hook, outside of the restricted area. Eight of them were swishes, including four of his five 3-pointers. \nHis most impressive swish of the night actually wasn't included in that highlight package. Have a look at the touch on this teardrop. \nThat is a 7-foot, damn-near 300-pound giant downshifting from full speed to float a first-gear feather over the outstretched fingertips one of the highest-flying athletes in the league. The best players on earth could attempt that shot a hundred times and they wouldn't swish more than 10% of them. Jokic does this stuff regularly. Indeed, it's not even about whether Jokić makes his shots anymore. It's about how he makes his shots. A story went around about Curry before he was drafted and how he wouldn't leave the court until he swished five straight free throws. It was presented as an impossible standard to which only the greatest shooter to ever live could be held. But that's the bar we might be at with Jokić, whose touch, from everywhere on the floor, has probably passed his passing as the single-best skill of the best basketball player on the planet. The numbers are beyond ridiculous. 2PT%TS%FG%3PT%78.377.368.441.7Understanding that it's only been 11 games, those numbers have never even been approached by anyone with anything close to Jokić's shot diet over a full season. These are numbers reserved, historically, for the guys who attempt only dunks and layups. Take a look at Jokić's range breakdown, per NBA.com shot tracking. Restricted AreaIn PaintMid-Range87%70.3%81.8%These percentages are mind boggling. The guy has made 86 of 110 shots from the touch-range of 0-9 feet. The 15-19 foot range is, analytically speaking, the worst shot in basketball, and Jokić literally hasn't missed from there yet. He's a perfect 7 for 7. The 50-40-90 club -- 50% from the field, 40% from 3 and 90% from the free-throw line -- is reserved for the most exclusive shooters in history, but Jokić is on track to start a brand new club on an even higher floor: the 60-40-80 club. No qualifying player, meaning someone who actually takes 3s, has ever approached these numbers. At this rate, it would be surprising if Jokić didn't do it. Small sample sizes, sure. But come on. Jokić is averaging 28.8 PPG on just 16.1 shots this season. The only other player in history to hit those marks is Charles Barkley, who did so in 1987-88. The difference? Barkley took almost 12 free throws per game that year. Jokic is taking fewer than six so far this season. These are straight-up buckets at a clip the league has never even come close to seeing. \nMeanwhile, he's also leading the league in rebounds (13.1) assists (10.9) per game while the Nuggets are outscoring their opponents by an average of 15.3 points per game when he's on the floor, also a league-best mark. To say Jokić is the early season MVP favorite is an understatement (+200, per Caesars). It's also not nearly enough. Fact is, Jokić would have won the last five MVPs were it not for human voters and their time-honored need for new blood. Just as Michael Jordan should have more than five MVPs and LeBron should have more than four, Jokić should be going for number six this season. If that were the case, it would be easier to start talking about him as possibly the greatest player not just currently or even during this era, but potentially ever. That's going to sound dramatic to a lot of people. But it's not. He may never get there in terms of numbers or longevity (although maybe he will; he's only 30), but from a straight up \"that's the most all-around skilled basketball player I've ever seen\" standpoint, he's making it increasingly difficult to argue against him.He's already one of the top handful of offensive players in history. That can't even be debated. The simple truth is there has never been a player who could not just beat you, but dominate you, in as many ways as Jokić can. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said it after Jokić's 55-point outburst Wednesday night. \"Our game plan was to make him score and take away his passing.\" Broadly speaking, next game someone will try to take away his scoring by sending double teams at him and he'll hit them for 20 assists. On the extremely rare nights that you somehow mange to control his passing and his shots aren't falling, he'll control the game from the glass.More granularly, it's the different ways he can go about the scoring and passing domination. Put a big on him, as the Clippers did with Ivica Zubac, an All-NBA defender, and he pops out for jumpers and literally runs off pin-down screens like a shooting guard. Put a smaller player on him, and he's the best post-up player in the world. He faces up. Fades away. Cuts. Runs the floor. As a passer, he's a DHO hub. A point-center in transition. A high-post pilot. The best players in the world, pretty much in all sports, are typically the best at one or two things. The pitcher with the best fastball isn't supposed to also have the best curveball, slide and changeup. That's Jokić. He's Shaq down low. Magic running point. Kevin Durant as a shooter. \nHe is, all at once, the best scorer, passer and rebounder in the world and has been for more than a half decade. And somehow, with these preposterous shooting numbers, he's raising the bar even higher this season. \n            ",

This year, both teams cannot afford another loss if they hope to get back to the conference championship game. Georgia (8-1, 6-1 in SEC) already has lost to Alabama, while Texas (7-2, 4-1) has lost to Florida. In addition, the loser of Saturday's game will be in danger of missing the College Football Playoff. Bet college football Week 12, including Texas at Georgia, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning will start for the first time against the team he rejected in favor of Texas. In June 2022, the latest quarterback in the Manning family committed to the Longhorns, picking them over the Bulldogs and, to a lesser extent, Alabama. That decision comes full circle on Saturday.Top sportsbooks have made Georgia a 6.5-point favorite over Texas. The line has risen slightly after opening at -5.Is that line movement an overreaction or market correction? Here's a look at the Georgia-Texas point spread, as well as the line movement on the other three matchups featuring two teams in the CFP rankings and one other game with a big line change. All times Eastern.No. 9 Notre Dame at No. 22 Pitt (noon)Open: Notre Dame -11 Current: Notre Dame -12.5The line movement in favor of the Fighting Irish makes a lot of sense. They are on a roll, having won seven consecutive games by 26.1 points per game. They also are in the conversation for an at-large bid to the College Football Playoff, so style points are important to them, which can explain some of this money coming in on Notre Dame. Also, the Panthers have struggled to run the ball this year (104th in the country, at 124.2 yards per game), which eliminates one of the ways the Irish defense can be had.Bet Week 12 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Texas State at Southern Miss (3:30 p.m.)Open: Southern Miss -7 Current: Southern Miss -3This game features the biggest line movement of any of the Week 12 games, and there's an easy explanation: Golden Eagles quarterback Braylon Braxton left last week's game with a right knee injury but returned to throw what would end up becoming the game-winning touchdown pass. Braxton, the Sun Belt Conference preseason Offensive Player of the Year, is listed as probable for Saturday's game, but bettors don't seem to be believers. Southern Miss (7-2, 5-0), which is on a collision course to play James Madison in the conference title game, has much bigger games remaining. The Bobcats (3-6) are winless in conference.No. 21 Iowa at No. 17 USC (3:30 p.m.)Open: USC -5 Current: USC -6.5This line touched Trojans -7 briefly before dropping back down to below a touchdown. USC welcomes another Big Ten team from the midwest to the Coliseum, and the Trojans have excelled in those situations this season. They have clobbered Michigan State (45-31), Michigan (31-13) and Northwestern (38-17) in L.A. this year.

This seems to be an overreaction to the Sooners' 33-27 victory last week at No. 14 Tennessee, but I have to admit that I haven't had a good read on Oklahoma this season. While the Sooners' defense has been elite, the offense has been average at best, ranking 64th in the country in scoring offense (28.9 points per game) and 77th in total offense (373.7 yards per game). That offense will face an Alabama defense coming off its best game of the year, giving up just three field goals to LSU.No. 10 Texas at No. 5 Georgia (7:30 p.m.)Open: Georgia -5 Current: Georgia -6.5Bettors don't seem to believe the Longhorns (7-2) are suddenly right because of one victory over Vanderbilt and have shifted this line to almost a touchdown. Remember, Texas has had four true road games this season, losing at both Ohio State and Florida and escaping with overtime victories over Kentucky and Mississippi State. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs are 35-1 in their last 36 games between the hedges and are coming off their most complete game of the season. Based on the betting, I don't get the sense that this line will rise to -7.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick is not worrying about anything but North Carolina's next opponent. The UNC coach knows there's an opening in the NFL that many will link him to, but his attention is on Wake Forest.Belichick's name has been tied to the New York Giants coaching vacancy since Brian Daboll was relieved of his duties following New York's Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears.Belichick affirmed that commitment to Chapel Hill on Friday night when he said that he will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.\"I have great respect and genuinely care for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families. The New York Giants played an important role in my life and in my coaching journey. It was a privilege for me to work for the Mara family and be a member of Coach Parcells' staff for over a decade. However, despite circulating rumors, I have not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies. \n\"Since arriving in Chapel Hill, my commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. We have tremendous support from the university, our alumni, and the entire Carolina community. My focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team, develop our players, and build a program that makes Tar Heel fans proud. We're on to Wake Forest.\"These comments came after Belichick struck a similar tone on Tuesday during his weekly press conference.\"I've been asked about it from time to time, but I've been down this road before,\" Belichick said. \"I'm focused on Wake Forest. That's it, and that's my commitment to this team, and next week, it'll be to our next opponent, and so forth. But, you know, I'm here to do the best I can for this team.\" \nIt's easy to see why so many have speculated about Belichick's possible interest in the Giants, and vice versa. Prior to winning six Super Bowls with the Patriots, Belichick won a pair of Super Bowls as the Giants' defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells. He was carried off the field by Giants players after New York shut out Washington in the 1986 NFC title game en route to defeating the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.Four years later, Belichick's defense held the mighty 49ers' offense to just 13 points in what was one of the biggest upsets in conference title game history. A week later, his defense made even more history by holding the prolific Bills offense to just 19 points in the closest Super Bowl ever played. Belichick's controversial game plan worked; New York's defense (which often lined up with just two defensive linemen) allowed Thurman Thomas to rush for 135 yards, but it succeeded in neutralizing Jim Kelly and the Bills' prolific passing attack. That game plan currently resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nIn 2009, during a return trip to Giants Stadium, Belichick broke down in tears while reflecting back on his years with the Giants. Ironically, it was the Giants who handed Belichick's Patriots two of his three Super Bowl losses that includes New York's shocking upset over the previously-undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Belichick served as the Browns' head coach from 1991-95 and was the Patriots' coach from 2000-23. His six Super Bowl wins as a head coach is two more than the next closest coach, former Steelers coach Chuck Noll. Belichick's 303 regular season wins is the third highest total in NFL history. His 333 total wins is second to only Don Shula's 347 wins that came with the Dolphins and Colts. Belichick's NFL career will likely be immortalized in the Pro Football Hall in 2026. He is one of nine coaching semifinalists for induction next summer in Canton, Ohio. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is officially off the injury report and will start in Sunday's Week 11 divisional clash with the Cleveland Browns. Baltimore fans breathed a sigh of relief Thursday when Jackson returned to practice after missing Wednesday's session with a knee injury. Jackson said he tweaked his knee in last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings and Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Wednesday that Jackson, despite missing practice, \"should be OK.\"Baltimore has received a jolt, offensively, since Jackson returned to the field. The former MVP came back into the lineup in Week 9 and helped the Ravens to consecutive wins over the Dolphins and Vikings. Those wins have Baltimore just one game back of the falling Steelers for the AFC North division lead, but as they prepared to face the Browns on Sunday in an effort to get back to .500 on the season, they initially did so without Jackson. Jackson missed three games with a hamstring injury suffered in a Week 4 loss to the Chiefs, but he looked good in his return to the field. On the season, he's completed 70.1% of his passes for 1,249 yards, 15 touchdowns and one interception. Jackson's return, coupled with the run game and defense returning to form, has Baltimore looking like a threat in the AFC again, but his health will likely be the determining factor in the overall success to the team. Jackson took some big hits in Sunday's win over Minnesota, and the Ravens will have to establish a balance between their need to keep Jackson healthy to achieve their long-term goals of winning a Super Bowl. \nUltimately, Wednesday's practice absence appears to have been a matter of precaution for Jackson and the Ravens.\n            \n    ",

The Lions are coming off a dominant, 44-22 victory over Marcus Mariota and the Washington Commanders, while the Eagles escaped Lambeau Field with a 10-7 win over the Green Bay Packers Monday night.Both of these teams are 21-5 since the start of last season, which are the best records in the NFL. The reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles are the third team in the last 30 years to start 7-2 or better over four straight seasons, while the Lions offense hasn't missed a step without coordinator Ben Johnson. The 31.4 points per game they average ranks second in the NFL behind the Indianapolis Colts, and Jared Goff just tied Matthew Stafford for the most 300-yard, three-touchdown, zero-interception games in Lions history with nine.Bet Eagles vs. Lions at Fanatics Sportsbook, where new users get up to $2,000 in No-Sweat Bets in FanCash with the promo code CBSFAN:Let's break down this exciting NFC matchup, but first, here's how you can watch the game:\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Eagles liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 16 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Lincoln Financial Field -- Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaTV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -2.5; O/U 46.5 (via FanDuel)Lions vs. Eagles: Need to knowDan Campbell the play-caller. After the Week 9 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Campbell confirmed to reporters that he took over play-calling duties from offensive coordinator John Morton. However, he made sure to emphasize that it's still a collaborative effort. In his first game calling the shots, the Lions racked up a season-high 546 yards of total offense, 30 first downs and did not punt once. However, this Eagles defense is a bit better than the Commanders defense.Could rushing attacks rule the day? This is the first time the Lions and Eagles have faced off since Week 1 in 2022, a matchup which saw the Eagles win on the road, 38-35. There were seven combined rushing touchdowns in that game, compared to two passing touchdowns. That could happen again, as Jahmyr Gibbs has scored 41 total touchdowns in 41 career games and Saquon Barkley is the reigning Offensive Player of the Year. He's averaging just 64.3 rushing yards per contest and 3.9 yards per rush after averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per rush in 2024, but you know he can turn it on at any point. A.J. Brown's struggles. Brown's frustrations this season are well-documented. He caught just two of three targets for 13 yards against the Packers. He has caught 31 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns in eight games played this season. Brown's 51 receiving yards per game is a career low, and entering Week 11, he ranks 44th in the NFL. He's tied for 61st in receptions, and ranks 50th in receiving yards. Lions vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe Eagles have a shot to repeat as Super Bowl champions, and it's easy to trust them in tight games. However, I want to go with the more explosive team in this matchup -- and that's clearly the Lions. Detroit has also thrived as an underdog. According to CBS Sports Research, the Lions are an NFL-best 12-6 against the spread as an underdog over the last four seasons, and an NFL-best 13-2 in prime-time games. Campbell has the best cover percentage (65%) by any coach since 1970, with a minimum of 75 games. Give me the Lions to simply out-score the Eagles. Pick: Lions +2.5, Over 46.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nInjuries are an unfortunate part of the NFL, and we're seeing that as we reach Week 11. Some notable quarterbacks are injured heading into the weekend, which has played a big role in NFL betting odds. As we do every week, here are the biggest NFL injuries that bettors need to know, as well as a look at where NFL betting lines current stand according to the latest SportsLine consensus odds, which uses the latest data and odds from top sportsbooks. We will update this post with the final injury report for Monday Night Football once that's released on Saturday, and we will also update with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Washington Commanders vs. Miami Dolphins (9:30 a.m. ET, Madrid) WASH QB Jayden Daniels (elbow, out)WASH WR Terry McLaurin (quad, out)\nThe Commanders haven't put Jayden Daniels on injured reserve yet, but after his elbow injury a few weeks ago, it's unlikely we see the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year anytime soon, opening the door for another Marcus Mariota start. Mariota once again will be without Terry McLaurin, who has played just four games this year due to a nagging quad strain. Miami is favored by 2.5 points, and the total sits at 47.5. Green Bay Packers at New York Giants (1 p.m. ET)NYG QB Jaxson Dart (concussion, out)NYG WR Darius Slayton (hamstring, out)NYG OT Evan Neal (hamstring, out)GB WR Matthew Golden (shoulder, questionable)\nThe Giants will have an entirely new look this week. Brian Daboll is out as head coach, and Mike Kafka is the interim man in charge. Jaxson Dart is out with a concussion, opening the door for Jameis Winston to get the start. New York's offense has been beat up all year, and both receiver Darius Slayton and right tackle Evan Neal are out as well. Green Bay may be without rookie receiver Matthew Golden, who's questionable with a shoulder injury. Green Bay is a 7-point favorite on the road. The total is 42.5.Houston Texans at Tennessee Titans (1 p.m. ET)HOU QB C.J. Stroud (concussion, out)TENN WR Calvin Ridley (hamstring, questionable)TENN DT Jeffery Simmons (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Texans will be without quarterback C.J. Stroud once again as he remains in concussion protocol for the second week in a row. Houston will turn to Davis Mills against a Titans team that's hopeful to get its top receiver back in Calvin Ridley and top defender back in Jeffery Simmons for this AFC South tilt. Houston is a 6-point road favorite, and the total is 37.5. Carolina Panthers at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET)ATL WR Drake London (illness and back, questionable)\nThe Panthers are in good shape in the health department, especially with star running back Rico Dowdle good to go for Sunday. The big one to watch is with star Atlanta receiver Drake London, who is questionable with both a back injury and an illness. Atlanta is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 42. Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThese NFC North rivals meet for the second time this season as the Vikings won in Week 1 thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback. The Bears are tied for first place in the division right now while the Vikings are in last place. Both sides enter this game relatively healthy, and Chicago hasn't listed either of its top receivers -- Rome Odunze and DJ Moore -- on the final injury report of the week. Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite at home, and the total is 48.5.Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (shin, questionable)JAX WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle, questionable)JAX TE Brenton Strange (hip, out)\nThe Chargers' offensive line remains an issue with the team's top tackles out for the year, but besides that, they're in solid shape entering this week. The biggest injury to watch on the L.A. side is receiver Quentin Johnston, who is questionable. Jacksonville will be without tight end Brenton Strange, and Brian Thomas Jr., who was out last week, is questionable.The Chargers are favored at -3. The total sits at 43.5.Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Buffalo Bills (1 p.m. ET)TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, out)TB WR Chris Godwin (fibula, out)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring, out)\nDespite some promising reports coming out of Bucs practices, Bucky Irving and Chris Godwin will again be inactive for this week's game in Buffalo. The biggest Bills injury is tight end Dalton Kincaid, who's out with a hamstring injury. Kincaid leads the team in touchdown receptions. The Bills are favored by 5.5 points at home. The total is 46.5.Cincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (1 p.m. ET)CIN DE Trey Hendrickson (hip, out)CIN QB Joe Burrow (toe, out)CIN RB Samaje Perine (ankle, out)PITT CB Darius Slay (concussion, out)\nThis game was a shootout last time these teams faced off, and this has the makings for another high-scoring affair. Cincinnati's top defender, Trey Hendrickson, is again out. Steelers corner Darius Slay is also out. Joe Burrow is technically listed as out as the team opened his 21-day practice window, but he won't return for at least one more week. Chase Brown also figures to be extra busy with No. 2 back Samaje Perine out for the Bengals.The Steelers are favored by 5.5. The total is one of the highest of the slate at 49.5.San Francisco 49ers at Arizona Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)SF QB Brock Purdy (toe, will play)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (illness, out)AZ RB Bam Knight (ankle, questionable)\nFor the first time since Week 4, Brock Purdy will be under center for the 49ers. The young quarterback is off in the injury report and will make just his third start of the year after battling a major toe injury. Mac Jones had been starting in Purdy's absence, and San Francisco is 6-4 on the year. The Cardinals are last in the NFC West and will be without top receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. due to illness. Bam Knight, who has helped lead the Cardinals' backfield after injuries to both James Conner and Trey Benson, is questionable. The 49ers are favored at -3. The total is 48.5.Seattle Seahawks at Los Angeles Rams (4:05 p.m. ET)SEA WR Tory Horton (groin and shin, out)LAR WR Davante Adams (oblique, questionable)\nThe Seahawks and Rams meet for the first time this year with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line. Both teams are relatively healthy for this matchup, too. Seattle will be without rookie standout receiver Tory Horton, while the Rams have listed star receiver Davante Adams as questionable as the veteran receiver battles an oblique injury. The Rams are 3-point favorites. The total is 48.5.Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)KC RB Isiah Pacheco (knee, out) DEN RB J.K. Dobbins (foot, out)DEN CB Patrick Surtain II (pectoral, out)\nBoth teams are down notable running backs as Isiah Pacheco is out for Kansas City and J.K. Dobbins is out for Denver. Dobbins, whose career has been derailed by injuries in recent years, is off to a great start in Denver but is reportedly in danger of missing multiple weeks, opening the door for rookie R.J. Harvey to get extended playing time. The Broncos are also without reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II for this key AFC West battle.The Chiefs are favored by 3.5 in Denver, and the total is 45.Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns (4:25 p.m. ET)BAL WR Rashod Bateman (ankle, out)BAL RB Justice Hill (toe, out)\nThe good news for the Ravens is Lamar Jackson has no injury designation after missing practice earlier this week with a knee injury. The team will be without receiver Rashod Bateman, as well as backup running back Justice Hill, who opened the year as the team's No. 2 back but has lost playing time recently to Keaton Mitchell.Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points. The total is 39.Detroit Lions at Philadelphia Eagles (8:20 p.m. ET)DET TE Sam LaPorta (back, out)DET S Kerby Joseph (knee, out)DET OT Taylor Decker (shoulder, questionable)DET OT Penei Sewell (ankle, questionable)\nThe Lions are beat up entering Sunday Night Football. Four Detroit players are out, including standout tight end Sam LaPorta and safety Kerby Joseph. Meanwhile, the team has also listed 10 players as questionable, including starting tackles Taylor Decker and Penei Sewell. As for Philly, the team has just one player questionable, and it's a backup offensive lineman in rookie Willie Lampkin.The Eagles are 2.5-point favorites. The total is 46.5.Dallas Cowboys at Las Vegas Raiders (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)No major injuries of note\nThe final injury report for Monday Night Football will be revealed Saturday, and we'll update this section accordingly once that information is made available. But as of now, it appears both teams are in good shape in the injury department heading into Week 11.Dallas is favored by 3.5 points, and the total is 50.5, the highest of the Week 11 schedule.\n            ",

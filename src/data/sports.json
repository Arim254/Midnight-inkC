The latest Week 11 NFL odds list the Eagles as 2.5-point home favorites, while the over/under is 46.5 points, and there are also NFL player props available, like over/under 60.5 receiving yards for beleaguered Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown, or over/under 63.5 rushing yards for Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, where to bet on Eagles vs. Lions.

However, a divisional round exit for Detroit paved the way for Philadelphia to enjoy home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs, and they parlayed that into the franchise's second Super Bowl title. Now both teams are in contention for home-field advantage again as division leaders through 10 weeks and both teams are 6-3 against the spread on the season. However, Philadelphia is only 2-2 against the number at home while Detroit is 3-2 against the spread on the road. The Lions get the slight nod to cover in 51% of simulations.Over 46.5 pointsThese two teams last met in 2022 for a 38-35 shootout in Detroit. The rosters have turned over a bit since then, but the cores for both teams remain the same with Dan Campbell and Nick Sirianni both coaching by that point and Jared Goff and Jalen Hurts installed as the starting quarterbacks. Both of these defenses are good and not great, and the model is expecting playmakers like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Saquon Barkley, Jahmyr Gibbs and DeVonta Smith to win the day. It predicts that the Over hits in 58% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly. The top sportsbooks feature several tools and resources available on their apps and websites, including wager limits, voluntary self-exclusion options, and more.

Ian Fuller's men took a great finish from Nicola Rosamilia in the fourth minute and wouldn't look back from there, shepherding Spokane shots into areas that were easy for their stout defense to deal with. It was quite a finish from Rosamilia, but winger Stavros Zarokostas made the goal happen. Latching on to a ball over the top, he went on a mazy run through the Spokane defense before cutting it back for Rosamilia to have an easy finish. It's only the third goal of the season and the first since July for Rosamilia, but in a championship, you need contributions up and down the roster, which Knoxville got.\nKempes Tekiela added an insurance goal from the penalty spot to put the match out of reach, while defender of the year Jordan Skelton and the backline kept Spokane at bay. During the lead-up to the match, Fuller spoke about how much the community means to the team, and it's an impressive feat for him to bring them a title in only his first season as a head coach. Fuller has gotten the team to play in his image, and they were rewarded with an impressive title victory over a Spokane side that have made it back-to-back League One finals. Knoxville also did it in front of a league-record crowd of 7,500 fans, showing just how many people are tuning into what the club is building. \nTo topple Spokane, it took a prepared side who were up for the challenge. With this kind of progression in only his first year as a head coach, the future is bright for him and Knoxville. Another final loss will sting for Spokane, but they'll also be back for this stage as manager Leigh Veidman has been able to turn this side into consistent contenders, but for Sunday, it's time to party in Knoxville.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first is always the hardest, and in his 243rd start, Adam Schenk can finally say that the hard part is over as he is officially a winner on the PGA Tour. Outlasting and outmaneuvering the field at a blustery Port Royal Golf Course, Schenk claimed the 2025 Bermuda Championship by one stroke over Chandler Phillips at 12 under.Schenk was forced to make a 5-foot par putt on the final hole to fend off Phillips and become the 16th first-time winner on the PGA Tour in 2025. Amid a week where he was striking some putts with one hand and backing off due to discomfort over his golf ball, Schenk summoned the fortitude to fight through the demons and into a new class.With his maiden victory, Schenk secures his playing privileges on the PGA Tour for the next two seasons. The 33-year-old entered the week at No. 134 in the FedEx Cup standings and in major jeopardy of losing his full-time status. He had missed 15 cuts this season, including eight in his last 14 starts, and was without a top-20 result since The CJ CUP Byron Nelson back in May.Instead, he will not only find himself in full-field events in 2026 but also tournaments such as the Players Championship, PGA Championship and RBC Heritage. He moves up to No. 67 in the FedEx Cup standings and could find his way into the first two signature events should he climb inside the top 60 by the end of next week's season finale at the RSM Classic.\n\"I started to play some better golf the last four months,\" Schenk said. \"I always had a little bit of the belief. I've really been working really hard. I have so many people to thank. I wish my family could be here. Of course, I win out of the country and my wife can't be here.\"Nothing was easy about Schenk's Sunday stroll in Bermuda, as tee times were moved up due to weather conditions. Forced to deal with wind gusts up to 40 mph, players struggled to flight proper golf shots and withstand what Mother Nature had planned.Not Schenk, however, who started his day in relatively mundane fashion by making one birdie and eight pars across his front nine. While scoring chances were rare, the overnight leader did well to keep himself out in front and avoid any mistakes that would prove costly.\nUp ahead on the golf course, Alex Smalley and others made charges to apply pressure on the leader. Smalley got as deep as 11 under but needed three putts from approximately 15 feet on the last and dropped to 10 under for the tournament. Meanwhile, Frankie Capan III reached that same 12-under number before dropping shots on the par-3 16th and par-5 17th to settle for a tie for third.Schenk had opportunities to make things more comfortable down the stretch, but his putter had other ideas. Playing the par-5 17th to perfection thanks to a couple of stingers that barely got off the ground, Schenk missed a close-range birdie look that would have given him a two-stroke lead up the 72nd hole.\nWhen Phillips made par and Schenk's playing partner, Takumi Kanaya, missed the 18th green in regulation, he knew all he needed was one last par to break through. However, as fate would have it, it would not be without one last 5-foot tickler, and unlike the previous hole, Schenk stepped up and stroked beauty, exorcising his demons and becoming a PGA Tour winner all in one fell swoop.\n\"I knew I could win; it was just a matter of executing each shot and handling each situation I put myself in,\" Schenk said. \"I can't believe it's over. It seemed like the longest day ever.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Rams will be hosting the Seattle Seahawks in a huge NFC West showdown on Sunday and when the Rams take the field, they'll be wearing a new \"Midnight Mode\" alternate uniform. The uniform was unveiled back in August as part of the NFL's \"Rivalries\" program. The Rams were one of eight teams to get a \"Rivalries\" uniform for 2025, and they'll be the fifth team to debut the new look.The plan behind the \"Rivalries\" program was to design a uniform based on a theme that's local to each team. With the Rams being in Los Angeles, the team decided to create a midnight themed uniform that \"echoes the evening hue and energy at SoFi Stadium and pays homage to the hard work of so many across Los Angeles who grind around the clock to turn their dreams into a reality.\"\nThe uniform looks black, but there's a twinge of blue in there. According to the team, it's a \"matte near-black midnight base with a hint of Royal blue.\"\nThe Rams are wearing the uniforms for the first time ever in their showdown against the Seahawks, which kicks off at 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox. Fans got their first look at the uniforms in person when the Rams headed out for warmups at SoFi Stadium. \nAnd now, let's take a closer look at the helmet. \nWith the game being played in Los Angeles, the Rams will be celebrating their new uniform by giving their field a new look. The end zone have gone full \"Midnight Mode.\" \nEven the Rams mascot has a \"Midnight Mode\" uniform. \nThe Rams are one of eight teams that will be participating in the \"Rivalries\" program this year. This program was announced DURING the 2025 NFL Draft back in April, so a lot of people missed the initial announcement. \nOver the next four seasons, one NFC division and one AFC division per year will get to debut a new \"Rivalries\" uniform, so not every team got a new uniform this year. Here's when each division will be getting their \"Rivalries\" uniform: 2025: AFC East and NFC West (See all the 2025 uniforms here)2026: AFC South and NFC North2027: AFC West and NFC East2028: AFC North and NFC SouthAfter the Rams wear their new uniform on Sunday, we won't be getting another \"Rivalries\" uniform game until Week 14. Here's the the full \"Rivalries\" schedule for 2025 (The team listed first is the \"Rivalries\" uniform team):\nWeek 4: Cardinals vs. Seahawks (See the uniform here)Week 4: Dolphins vs. Jets (See the uniform here)Week 5: Bills vs. Patriots (See the uniform here)Week 11: Patriots vs. Jets (See the uniform here)Week 11: Rams vs. Seahawks (Sunday, Nov. 16)Week 14: Jets vs. Dolphins (Sunday, Dec. 7)Week 16: Seahawks vs. Rams (Thursday, Dec. 18)Week 18: 49ers vs. Seahawks (Jan. 3 or Jan. 4)The NFL approved a new rule in April that will allow each team to wear an alternate uniform in four different games, which is up from three. That means that any team with multiple alternate or throwback uniforms will now have an extra opportunity to wear those during the regular season. The \"Rivalries\" uniforms will only be worn once this season by each team\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup is approaching next year, and qualifying is well underway with more than half of the spots now accounted for. There are now 48 teams after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and will end on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City.With the tournament's expansion, the European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.Three teams have already secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Cape Verde will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 524,877, Cape Verde became the second-smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup, behind only Iceland, which had a population of 350,000 when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.Let's take a look at who has already booked their tickets to the World Cup:Already qualified for the 2026 World CupWorld Cup hostsSince the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. United StatesMexicoCanadaAFC QualifiersIranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaOFC QualifierNew ZealandCONMEBOL Qualifiers\nArgentinaBrazilEcuadorParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCape VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandFranceCroatiaPortugal Norway Chaos in UEFATeams such as England, Portugal, France and Croatia booked their place in the World Cup, as the winners of each qualifying group will head directly to the tournament. But the second-placed team in each group will head to a playoff phase, such as Italy that might miss their third World Cup in a row. Those 12 second-placed teams will be joined by the four best UEFA Nations League group winners.That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoffs. These also won't conclude until March of 2026.Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs?The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups. A playoff will take place in North America in March, including one team each from the following regions: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, alongside two from Concacaf to determine the final two places in the World Cup. The bottom four teams in the FIFA World Rankings will be drawn into two single-elimination matches, where the winner will advance to face the top two teams in the rankings, with the winners of those two matches qualifying for the World Cup. Currently in the inter-confederation playoffs\nCAF: DR CongoOFC: New CaledoniaCONMEBOL: BoliviaWhen is the World Cup draw?Paths to the World Cup final will be revealed on Dec. 5 in a ceremony taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C..

    "body": "\n        Long before the final putt of the 2025 DP World Tour Championship fell, Rory McIlroy had his hands on his seventh Race to Dubai title. Securing his fourth straight season-long crown in Europe to pull him second all-time behind only Colin Montgomerie (eight), the Northern Irishman nearly added even more hardware to his trophy case by pulling off a double and winning the European circuit's season finale alongside the year-long race.Instead, McIlroy -- despite an eagle on the 72nd hole -- fell on the first playoff hole to Matt Fitzpatrick, his Ryder Cup teammate and fellow European. The Englishman carded dueling 66s over the weekend to traverse his way through the peloton by tournament's end and finish his 72 holes at 18 under. A par on the first extra hole, the par-5 18th, was all Fitzpatrick needed to fend off McIlroy and secure his third DP World Tour Championship title.\"It means the world,\" said Fitzpatrick of his victory. \"Struggled at the start of this year, obviously, and to turn it around in the summer like I did and have a Ryder Cup like I did, Ryder Cup in particular, [I] feel like it's hard to top given everything. But the way that I played today, I feel like I really didn't hit one bad shot all day. I'm so proud of myself, the effort that everyone puts in behind the scenes. What a feeling.\"McIlroy appeared to have the tournament under control, walking off the par-4 11th as he possessed a two-stroke lead with seven holes to play. Getting as deep as 5 under in his round at that stage, the 36-year-old only then began to take on water, adding squares to his scorecard on Nos. 12 and 16 to fall off the pace.\nUp ahead, Fitzpatrick continued to scratch and claw, reminiscent of his year as a whole. A hefty diet of pars in the middle of his round preceded a flurry of a finish as Fitzpatrick rolled in respective birdie efforts from 9 feet and 25 feet on Nos. 14 and 15 to propel himself towards the top of a crowded leaderboard that featured the likes of Tommy Fleetwood, Ludvig Åberg and Laurie Canter.When those three men could do no better than 17 under, Fitzpatrick found himself in a position to seize the moment on the final hole. Getting up and down from right of the green, he posted 18 under as McIlroy watched from the right side of the fairway with 5 wood in hand and eagle on his mind.McIlroy feathered his 5 wood to perfection to set up a look for eagle. After getting a teach from his playing partner, Rasmus Neergard-Petersen, McIlroy marched to his putt and marched to the hole to pick up his ball from the bottom as he once again found his best at the precise right time.\n\"Of course you [think he'll make it],\" Fitzpatrick said. \"He's probably one of the only few that you know you go to a playoff, two clear and one to play, and you know you're going to a playoff. In typical Rory fashion, he did it again, and obviously, you never like to see the way it ends. But obviously delighted.\"While it may not have gone the way of McIlroy in the playoff, he does now inch closer to even more golf immortality. With seven Race to Dubai titles under his belt, the grand slam champion -- who now has an award named after him -- moves past European legend Seve Ballesteros' six titles and directly into the rearview mirror of Montgomerie. \"I said this on this green last year, [Seve] means so much to this tour and to the European Ryder Cup team,\" McIlroy said. \"We rally so much around his spirit and his quotes and everything he meant for European golf. To equal him last year was cool, but to surpass him this year, yeah, I didn't get this far in my dreams. So, it's very cool.\"\nMontgomerie's record number of eight included a streak of seven straight from 1999 to 2005. McIlroy finds himself amid a heater of his own, donning four crowns in a row dating back to 2022. He appears intent on giving it a go as he shows no signs of slowing down in the late 30s of his career.\"I want it, of course I do,\" McIlroy said. \"I caught up with [Montgomerie] this week when he was here a couple days ago, and I saw him. Look, it seems within touching distance now. I'd love to be the winningest European in terms of Order of Merits and season-long races. You know, I've probably got a few more good years left in me, and hopefully I can catch him and surpass him.\"\n            ",

That was also Kelce's 100th career touchdown scored including his 17 postseason touchdowns, but records (unless stated otherwise) only take regular-season stats into account.\nKelce, who has spent his entire 13-year career with Kansas City, already held the franchise records for receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.

He has had at least three touchdown receptions all of his NFL seasons except his rookie year, and he scored 33 touchdowns from 2018-2020, his age-31 to age-33 seasons. He is inside the top dozen all time in receptions regardless of position and third among tight ends, only behind Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 11, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 12 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Sean Tucker, RB, BuccaneersTucker has flashed with the Buccaneers during his short career in Tampa but he has been buried on the depth chart behind Bucky Irving and Rachaad White. With Irving still unable to suit up on gameday, Tucker has taken a considerably larger role in the backfield. In Week 11, Tucker broke out with 106 rushing yards on 19 carries. He had two rushing touchdowns including a long 40-plus explosive touchdown run. Tucker also added two receptions for 34 yards and caught a touchdown. A three touchdown performance should lock in some kind of role even once Irving returns to the lineup. However, for as long as Irving is out, it's clear the Buccaneers have turned to Tucker as their lead back over White. In an offense this potent -- one of Fantasy's highest scoring and most consistent -- that's a valuable every-week Fantasy starter. Once Irving comes back, he'll be relegated to a desperation FLEX. Enjoy it while it lasts.Michael Wilson, WR, CardinalsWith Marvin Harrison ruled out for Week 11, Wilson was expected to take over as the defacto first read in the passing game. No one could've expected these kind of numbers, however. Wilson went off for a career-high 170 receiving yards on 13 receptions. He was targeted a whopping 15 times. Now let's establish the context. The Cardinals were trailing in this game by multiple scores for almost the entire game. They were throwing early and often. Not every game will feature this kind of volume for Wilson, but it's clear Arizona is a more consistent dropback passing team when Jacoby Brissett is at quarterback. The expectation is that Harrison may miss another week after undergoing surgery for appendicitis. This is not guaranteed. For as long as Harrison is out, Wilson should serve as a locked-in WR2 with obvious weekly upside. Tyrell Shavers, WR, BillsKeon Coleman was made a surprise healthy inactive by the Bills for Week 11. Later, we found out this was due to disciplinary reasons. Coleman's role in the offense moving forward remains uncertain, but his absence allowed for Shavers to break out in week 11. Shavers caught four passes for 90 yards and a touchdown on five targets in a wild shootout. His production moving forward should be hard to predict and uncertain. He is best left on waiver wires. Emanuel Wilson, RB, Packers Wilson was less of a breakout and more of an immediate waiver wire alert after Josh Jacobs got injured during Green Bay's Week 11 win over the Giants. Jacobs got hurt early, tried to return and then left the game for good. Wilson finished with 11 carries for 40 yards and a rushing touchdown. He also added a reception for nine yards on his lone target. More importantly, Wilson operated in a workhorse role once Jacobs left the game. If Jacobs is forced to miss any time, Wilson could immediately operated as a borderline RB1 in Fantasy lineups. \nIsaiah Hodgins, WR, Giants Fans of the Giants are left pondering why this move didn't happen sooner, but Hodgins immediately resumed his role as the lead possession receiver for New York in Week 12 with Darius Slayton sidelined. Hodgins had a run with the Giants back in 2022 and knows the offensive system inside out. He immediately operated in a starter role. If Slayton is forced to miss more time, Hodgins could operated as a back-end WR3/FLEX.Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JaguarsTuten finally cashed in on his rookie promise with a big Week 11. Tuten racked up 74 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the red zone. More importantly, he operated as a 1B to Travis Etienne's 1A in the Jaguars backfield. Tuten could have some back-end RB2 upside running behind a rush scheme that has found success under head coach Liam Coen.Xavier Legette, WR, Panthers Legette continues to operate as Bryce Young's donwfield threat with four receptions for 83 yards and a highlight-reel touchdown. What's more important is that he racked up eight targets in this game. Legette's volume and TD upside make him a back-end WR3 option. \nDevin Singletary, RB, Giants Singletary is operating as the 1B in the Giants backfield but for Fantasy Football purposes he might as well be the 1A. Singletary is the preferred option in the red zone and he is cashing in on his red zone opportunities. Singletary scored two touchdowns in Week 11 for the Giants in addition to 47 total yards. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Joe Burrow returned to practice in a limited capacity last week, fueling speculation as to when the Bengals' Pro Bowl quarterback will playing again. CBS Sports' Melanie Collins provided an update on Burrow's progress and the Bengals plans for him during Cincinnati's Week 11 34-12 loss to the Steelers. Burrow did 7-on-7 work during practice last week, with the plan being for him to throw 11 on 11 against the scout team this upcoming week.\n \"A number of reports have come out about when he'll return to the field,\" Collins said. \"I was told by the Bengals this morning that Week 13 against the Ravens is a possibility, as is Week 14 against the Bills. But as of now, no definitive return date for Joe Burrow.\" Burrow, who hasn't played since sustaining his turf toe injury back in Week 2, said last week that \"a lot of variables\" will go into his return. He did acknowledge that it would be \"very\" meaningful to make his return in Baltimore, the site of where his 2023 season-ending injury took place. \"The number one is how [the toe] is feeling ... ,\" Burrow said last week. \"So we'll just take it day by day, like we have been throughout the rehab process.\" \nWith Burrow out, the Bengals have received steady play at quarterback from Joe Flacco, who was traded from Cleveland to Cincinnati after the Bengals went 0-3 with Jack Browning under center. The top overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in 2021, his first full season as the team's starting quarterback. He led Cincinnati to within a game of the Super Bowl the following season while garnering serious MVP consideration. Last year, Burrow, 28, won NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time after leading the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns. \nCincinnati has gone just 1-7 since Burrow's injury. While defense has been the team's Achilles heel, neither side of the ball was very good during Sunday's 34-12 loss to Pittsburgh. The offense committed two critical turnovers that led to two Steelers touchdowns. On defense, the Bengals allowed the Steelers to convert on more than half on their third-down attempts despite Aaron Rodgers leaving the game at halftime with a left wrist injury. \n            ",

Detroit (6-3) rolled past Washington 44-22 last week and is tied with the Chicago Bears atop the NFC North.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a showdown between the Chicago Bulls (6-5) and Utah Jazz (4-8) at 8 p.m. ET at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. The Bulls are looking to snap a four-game losing streak, while the Jazz seek just their second win in six contests.Meanwhile, the NHL has four games on its slate following a morning matchup between the Nashville Predators and Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2025 NHL Global Series in Sweden. One of the contests has the New York Rangers (10-7-2) hosting the Detroit Red Wings (10-7-1) at Madison Square Garden at 7 p.m. ET. The Rangers are riding a three-game winning streak but are just 1-6-1 at home this season.There also are more than 30 college basketball games on Sunday, with the action concluding when Miami (3-0) takes on No. 10 Florida (2-1) in the Jacksonville Hoops Showdown at 8:30 p.m. ET at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville. Miami trounced Stetson 102-61 in its last outing, while Florida edged Florida State 78-76 last Tuesday.The Eagles are 2.5-point favorites against the Lions in the latest consensus NFL odds.

Each of the Eagles' previous three contests saw 50 or more combined points scored, while the Lions are second in the NFL with an average of 31.4 points per game. These clubs put up a total of 73 points in their most recent meeting in 2022 and combined for 50 in their showdown a year earlier. Factoring in all of that, the SportsLine Projection Model sees a shootout on Sunday Night Football, as the Over hits in 52% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Emory Hunt believes that even though Detroit's offense is clicking, Philadelphia will cover the spread as he feels the Eagles are a good team on both sides of the ball and play their best when things look bleak.More NFL best betsSeahawks-Rams Under 48.5 (-109, SportsLine model B-rated play)Jacoby Brissett Over 225.5 passing yards -114 (R.J.

Both of Utah's last two contests have gone Over the projected total for this matchup, but only one of Chicago's past five has done so. Keeping that in mind, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations say the Under for Sunday's clash hits more than 56% of the time. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner thinks Utah's Lauri Markkanen, who is sixth in the league in scoring with an average of 29.3 points, will be productive against his former team as he is coming off a 40-point performance versus Atlanta and is averaging 33.2 per game at home this season.NHL best bets, where to watchRed Wings at RangersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: New York | TV: NHL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Under 6The Rangers had a brief offensive surge, scoring a total of 13 goals in victories against the Predators and Tampa Bay Lightning, before tallying just once in a 2-1 shootout triumph over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday. Detroit totaled 10 goals over its last two games after scoring a combined two times in its previous three outings. New York erupted for six tallies in its last home contest after netting only seven over its first seven games at Madison Square Garden this season, and the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see a high-scoring affair taking place Sunday as the Under hits in almost 61% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchMiami vs. FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: Jacksonville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Under 171.5 (-109)Both teams have played three games thus far this season, and the total was Over the projected number for this matchup in just one of them, as Florida was defeated 93-87 by Arizona in its opener. The Hurricanes have held their opponents under 70 points in each of their three contests, while the Gators allowed 76 or fewer in both of their victories. Miami enters having reached triple digits in points in back-to-back games, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think the streak will continue as its simulations have the Under hitting more than 76% of the time.\n            ",

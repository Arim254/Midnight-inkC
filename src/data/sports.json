He currently ranks among the tour's best in both service games held and return games won on outdoor hard. His win rate against top-10 opponents on the surface is outstanding, and his tiebreak record highlights how well his game holds up in pressure moments. If he's fully healthy, there's no better anchor at the top of the board.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code.

He's beaten nearly every top seed in both best-of-three and best-of-five conditions and has the physicality and resilience to handle the tough back end of a Slam.

He's posted quality wins over top-10 players in recent months, and his rally tolerance and court speed make him well-suited for long matches in the Australian heat.

She's won multiple Australian Open titles and has reached the final three years in a row,\" Onorato said. \"Her power game thrives in quick conditions, and her ability to win short rallies makes her perfectly suited to this surface. Statistically, she ranks near the top of the WTA in first-serve points won, ace rate, and short-rally points (0–4 shots). If she serves well, there are very few women who can stay with her for three sets.

Her return game is unmatched, consistently ranking among the top two or three in return games won. She also tends to dispatch lower-ranked opponents in straight sets, which helps manage physical load across the two weeks,\" Onorato said. \"While she hasn't looked quite as comfortable on hard as she does on clay, her numbers on the surface remain elite.

Huff suffered the injury in practice earlier this week.Huff, a junior, has been terrific for the No. 9 Bulldogs this season. His 17.8 points per game leads the team and represents a 6.8-points-per-game jump from last season. He's also shooting a team-best 66.2% from the field while averaging 5.6 rebounds per game, second to fellow big man Graham Ike.Huff had several impressive games to fuel the Bulldogs' strong non-conference display, including 20 points on 9-for-11 shooting in a win over then-No. 18 Kentucky in early December. A few weeks later, he posted a career-high 37 points in a win over Campbell, and more recently, he had 28 points to lift Gonzaga to an overtime win over Seattle.Gonzaga currently sits at 17-1 (5-0 WCC) on the season with its only loss to Michigan, currently the No. 4 team in the AP Poll. The Bulldogs are a projected No. 4 seed in CBS Sports' Bracketology.\nIf Huff returns on the earlier end of the projected recovery timeline, he'd be back in plenty of time to ramp up ahead of the conference tournament and NCAA Tournament. However, if it's closer to the eight-week mark, things would get tight. Eight weeks from Thursday's news is March 12; the first round of the NCAA Tournament begins March 19.\n            \n    ",

Mateer completed 62.2% of his passes for 2,885 yards, 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 12 games played this past season, and added 431 yards and eight more touchdowns on the ground. The Sooners made the College Football Playoff as the No. 8 seed, but were defeated by Alabama, 34-24. Mateer threw for 307 yards, two touchdowns, one interception and rushed for a touchdown in the playoff loss. It marked his 15th game with a passing touchdown and a rushing touchdown. No other FBS player has more than 12 such games over the last two years. Mateer's first season in Norman started off promising, as the Sooners registered victories against Illinois State, No. 15 Michigan and Temple. However, in the 24-17 victory over No. 22 Auburn, Mateer suffered an injury to his throwing hand that required surgery. He missed the following game against Kent State, but returned for the Red River Rivalry less than three weeks later. It ended up being Oklahoma's first loss of the season, as Mateer threw for 202 yards and three interceptions in a 23-6 defeat to Texas.Oklahoma finished out the regular season 5-1 following the loss to Texas, but Mateer did not look like the same dynamic offensive threat. He crossed 200 yards passing just twice in the Sooners' final six games of the regular season, and threw six touchdowns compared to four interceptions. However, Mateer did register 300 yards passing in the final two games of the season, including the playoff loss to Alabama. \nOne has to wonder what Oklahoma would have looked like had Mateer not sustained that hand injury. Now, he gets another shot to lead the Sooners to glory. Mateer was 247Sports' No. 1 transfer portal prospect last year. In his final season at Washington State, Mateer completed 64.6% of his passes for 3,139 yards, 29 touchdowns and seven interceptions. As a runner, Mateer put together a historic campaign, rushing 178 times for 826 yards and 15 more scores. His 44 total touchdowns were tied for the most in the FBS with No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, and he was one of just two FBS quarterbacks to throw for 20 touchdowns and rush for 10 touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to terms with outfielder Kyle Tucker on a four-year contract that will pay him $240 million. The resulting $60 million average annual value represents the largest in Major League Baseball's history, surpassing the $51 million AAV Juan Soto received last winter from the New York Mets. The pact reportedly includes opt-out opportunities after the second and third seasons. Tucker, 29 in a matter of days, was regarded by CBS Sports as the No. 1 free agent on the market this offseason. Here's what we wrote back at the onset of the winter:Bill James once theorized that it's better for a player's perception for them to start hot and finish cold than the inverse -- that way their numbers are more impressive for a longer period of time. Tucker tested that idea. He entered July sporting a .931 OPS, but from there on he posted an ice-cold .690 mark. His downturn seems connected to injuries, specifically the fractured hand he suffered in June. Tucker still produced his fifth consecutive four-win season, so the shape of his year may prove irrelevant to teams seeking a star-level performer who is good at everything (albeit seldom ranked among the league leaders at anything). Tucker now joins the Dodgers, MLB's first repeat World Series champion in more than two decades. He figures to slot high into a lineup that already includes All-Star talents like Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman. Tucker will also be part of an outfield alongside some combination of Teoscar Hernández, Andy Pages, and Alex Call.For more on Tucker's signing, let's highlight a few winners and losers of the deal.Winners1. Los Angeles Dodgers\nObviously enough. The Dodgers were already good enough to win the last two World Series and they already entered the offseason as the favorites to win yet another title. Then they inked closer Edwin Díaz earlier this winter to address their biggest weakness.  The Tucker signing, though, elevates them even more. Think about it this way. They'll now field a lineup that includes four of the top 20 position players in the sport, as judged by total Wins Above Replacement accumulated since 2023. That's Shohei Ohtani (second), Mookie Betts (eighth), Freddie Freeman (18th), and Tucker (19th). Only one other team has even three of the top 20, with that being the New York Mets: Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor rank fifth and sixth, and Marcus Semien checks in 17th.That the Dodgers were able to snag Tucker without committing to him for more than two guaranteed years ensures they should avoid any age-related decline. More on that later. For now, they've upped those World Series odds from +370 after Game 7 to +250 (via DraftKings).\n2. AAV-heavy structureIt's long been an accepted truth that top free agents, especially hitters who are in their prime years, are compensated in both term and wage. The Tucker signing helps introduce a new kind of contract that trades length for a more intense payday.The logic on the player's side is straightforward. Not only can Tucker control his own destiny by triggering an opt-out clause after either the second or third season, but he has a chance to walk away with significantly greater earnings this way than if he had signed a 10-year pact worth $300 million (or whatever the accompanying amount would have been). He'll now hit free agency again ahead of his age-33 season (at the latest) with $240 million already in the bank.As for the team, the Dodgers will be able to avoid paying Tucker deep into his 30s, when he's likely to suffer from age-related decline. Yes, they'll have to write a bigger check to cover their luxury tax penalties, but that's a small price to pay when there's a chance to string together three or more World Series titles in a row.\n3. Bellinger and BichetteThe biggest fans of the Tucker signing who don't have a vested interest? Probably free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger and infielder Bo Bichette.Bellinger is now, clearly, the top outfield bat remaining on the market. He's been engaged with the New York Yankees for weeks now, with the hangup being over the years. If nothing else, Bellinger's camp can point to the Tucker deal in an attempt to fetch a higher AAV, even if it doesn't necessarily come with a longer term.Bichette, on the other hand, had originally had his free agency prolonged by the Blue Jays' interest in Tucker and Alex Bregman. With both signing elsewhere, Toronto can more seriously engage in talks about a potential reunion. That doesn't mean Bichette will return to the only franchise he's played for as a professional, but the chances seem higher now than they were this time a week ago.\nLosers1. New York MetsThe Mets have already drawn their share of criticism this winter. Executive David Stearns allowed first baseman Pete Alonso and closer Edwin Díaz to leave through free agency and traded longtime fixtures in outfielder Brandon Nimmo and utility player Jeff McNeil. Still, it appears that Stearns had a real chance of landing Tucker, putting the wind back in New York's sails by giving them another high-level producer -- and potentially doing it without handing out another extremely long-term commitment.Owner Steve Cohen even raised eyebrows earlier on Thursday evening, sending out a social media post about waiting for smoke.Clearly Cohen wasn't playing coy. In the end, the Mets were outmaneuvered by the Dodgers, who offered $10 million per annum more than the Mets' last reported offer. (It's unclear if New York upped its bid before Tucker made a decision.) Now, if the Mets are to add another piece to their lineup before Opening Day, they'll have to resort to either signing a lower-tier free agent or making a trade.\nThat isn't to suggest the Mets are doomed -- they have plenty of talent in place and a handful of promising youngsters nearing a permanent big-league assignment -- but this isn't the kind of winter they had in mind after collapsing late last season and missing the playoffs.2. Toronto Blue JaysThe Blue Jays have to be tired of being beaten to the punch by the Dodgers. Over the last three years, the Dodgers have snatched free agent after free agent (Ohtani, Roki Sasaki, now Tucker) from Toronto's grasp. If that wasn't enough, the Dodgers also came from behind -- on the road -- to defeat the Blue Jays in last year's World Series.On the bright side, the Blue Jays can still pivot here and re-sign Bichette. They also made a fair number of additions earlier in the winter, landing right-handers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce, as well as Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto.\nTucker would've been a huge get for the Blue Jays. It just wasn't meant to be.3. The rest of baseballBecause the Dodgers are that much better, yes, but also because this ensures there will be more sustained bellyaching about a salary cap. (As if the owners have ever needed an excuse.)The Dodgers, for those keeping score, were already expected to have a luxury tax payroll around $360 million. Depending on the exact terms of Tucker's deal, as well as whatever else they do with their roster, they could exceed $400 million for the second year in a row.Thanks to their 2025 payroll, the Dodgers had to pay more than $169 million in luxury tax penalties, a new MLB record.\n            ",

Their only playoff contest in Chicago was a complete disaster as they racked up a mere 130 yards of total offense while getting trounced 24-0 in the 1985 NFC Championship Game.The fifth-seeded Rams hope for much better results when they visit Chicago to take on the No. 2 Bears in the NFC Divisional Round at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Soldier Field.Los Angeles (12-5) has lost its last four contests in Chicago, including a 24-18 setback last season in what was one of only six games in which Matthew Stafford did not throw a touchdown pass. The Rams dropped three of their final four road outings this campaign but went into Charlotte, N.C. last weekend and edged the Carolina Panthers 34-31 in the Wild Card Round as Stafford connected with Colby Parkinson for a 19-yard TD with 38 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to erase a four-point deficit.The Bears (11-6) won their first NFC North title since 2018 but entered their wild card matchup against the division-rival Green Bay Packers as 1.5-point underdogs. They trailed by 18 points at halftime but stormed back to score 25 in the fourth quarter and defeat the Packers 31-27 for their first postseason victory since 2010.Even though they made the playoffs as a wild card, the Rams are the second favorites at DraftKings to win Super Bowl LX at +320. They are behind only the NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks, who have +270 odds to capture the Lombardi Trophy.The Rams are 3.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 48.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Los Angeles vs. Chicago in the Divisional Round.Here is a look at the Rams vs. Bears matchup from a betting perspective.Rams vs. Bears odds\nOpening spread: Rams -3.5Opening money line: Rams -192, Bears +160Opening total: 51.5The line has not budged as the Rams have been 3.5-point favorites since it opened. Assuming nothing bizarre happens, they will join the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1977 Oakland Raiders and 2008 Philadelphia Eagles as the only teams since 1970 to play as road favorites multiple times in one postseason.Meanwhile, the Bears will be the fourth team in NFL history to be a home underdog twice in the same postseason. The 1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers upset Philadelphia their first playoff game but lost to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, the 2008 Arizona Cardinals made it all the way to Super Bowl XLIII but lost to the Steelers and the 2017 Eagles beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Chicago also will become one of only five teams to be a home underdog in the Divisional Round over the last 40 years.Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-6 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-7 (including playoffs)The Rams were double-digit favorites against the Panthers in the Wild Card Round but didn't come close to covering, although they owned 14- and 10-point leads in the second quarter. However, all but one of their regular-season victories were by five or more points, including each of their five triumphs away from home.Los Angeles has covered the spread in two-thirds of its Divisional Round games since 1970, going 12-6. Last year, the Rams were seven-point underdogs against the Eagles and managed to cover as Stafford and Parkinson hooked up for a touchdown with less than three minutes to play in the fourth quarter of Philadelphia's 28-22 victory.Stafford, who is expected by many to win the 2025 MVP Award as he led the NFL in passing yards (4,707) and touchdown tosses (46), can match Aaron Rodgers' league record by throwing at least two TD passes in his ninth consecutive playoff game. The 37-year-old, who enters with a postseason-record four straight 300-yard passing performances on the road, also is one scoring pass away from joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks with two seasons in which they had a total of at least 50 regular-season and playoff touchdown tosses.Bears betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-6 (including playoffs)ATS record: 10-7-1 (including playoffs)O/U record: 9-9 (including playoffs)A cover by the Bears wasn't looking good last weekend as they trailed Green Bay 21-3 at halftime and were down 27-16 with just over 6 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. But Caleb Williams connected with Olamide Zaccheaus for a touchdown and Colston Loveland on the ensuing two-point attempt with 4:18 remaining before throwing a 25-yard scoring pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 to play.Chicago hasn't done well against the spread in the Divisional Round since winning Super Bowl XX, going just 2-7. However, the club has had success against Los Angeles at home of late, covering in eight of their last 10 meetings at Soldier Field.Williams got off to a rough start in his postseason debut as he threw a pair of interceptions without guiding the Bears to a touchdown over the first three quarters against the Packers. But he finished with 361 passing yards and two TD tosses and can match the franchise record of seven consecutive games -- including playoffs -- with multiple scoring passes set in 1995 by Erik Kramer. Williams also can join Sid Luckman (two in 1941), Jim McMahon (three in 1985) and Rex Grossman (two in 2006) as the only QBs in Bears history to win multiple games in one postseason.Rams-Bears prop pick: Puka Nacua anytime TD scorer (-125)\nNacua found the end zone in nine of his 16 games during the regular season, including four of the final five. The 24-year-old wideout, who was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice in 2025, proved to be a double threat last week against the Panthers as he had a 14-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter and a 5-yard TD run in the second. It was the second rushing score of the campaign for Nacua, who has amassed eight touchdowns over his last six outings. The Bears allowed four different Green Bay receivers to score in their wild card win, so it doesn't seem likely that they'll be able to keep Nacua from doing so.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Speaking to reporters for the first time since tearing his ACL in Week 15, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes provided a positive update on his rehabilitation and expressed a desire to be back for Week 1 of the 2026 season.\"Rehab's going great so far, just hitting all the checkpoints that the doctor wants you to do and getting the strength and the range of mobility back,\" Mahomes said Thursday on a video press conference. \"So that's been going great, been doing all of it here in Kansas City so far, and [Chiefs athletic trainer] Julie [Frymyer]'s been crushing it, pushing me. The doctor kind of gives you goals to get to, and I try to maximize those, and they hold me back, because I always want to go a little bit further.\"It's been going great. Obviously, I think the long term, I want to be ready for Week 1. Doctor said I could be but can't predict what's going to happen throughout the process, but that's my goal, and so I'll try to prepare myself to be ready to play in that Week 1 and have no restrictions.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoffs power rankings: Seahawks top eight remaining teams still vying for a Super Bowl title\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMahomes said he hopes to be able to do \"some stuff\" in OTAs and \"a lot\" come training camp. The star quarterback suffered the ACL late in an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Chargers the same day the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention and Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons also tore his ACL. Speaking to the media Monday, Parsons also said he hoped to be back by Week 1 but \"realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4.\"\nMahomes said after suffering the injury he initially asked the Chiefs' medical staff if he could put a brace on the knee and finish the game, a request the staff denied.Mahomes also looked back on the season as a whole as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 (Mahomes was a freshman at Texas Tech that year) and finished the season with a 6-11 record.\"I think just compounding mistakes,\" Mahomes said. \"You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red-zone interceptions I threw in kinda bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That's stuff that I hadn't done in the past. Speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively, we weren't consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games we played good, we had stretches in the season we played really good, but we gotta be better, and that starts with me and it has to feed throughout the entire offense.\"\nMahomes' 7.1 yards per attempt this season was the third-lowest mark of his career, and his 256 passing yards per game was his second-lowest. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Some of the biggest names on the PGA Tour are letting their voices be known after Brooks Koepka was welcomed back to the circuit following a four-year stint with LIV Golf. Able to come back through the newly established Returning Member Program created by PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp -- with the help of player directors such as Tiger Woods -- Koepka's return has brought mixed reactions from players with whom he will be sharing the tee sheet in 2026.\"There are opinions from both sides,\" Woods said. \"We're not going to satisfy everyone. We know that. But the whole idea is to make our tour better than what it was. With Brooks' addition to the Tour, it ... makes it a better place to play. Now, with players who have earned equity, and there are four more years of potential earning of equity for these players, the fact that they own the Tour, if Brooks plays, it puts more money in their pocket. It's a win for everyone.\"Players such as Ben Griffin, Max Homa, Jordan Spieth, Collin Morikawa and other high-end members of the PGA Tour have similarly come out in support of the decision. Playing on the DP World Tour in Dubai this week, Rory McIlroy echoed those sentiments while also offering his holistic view of LIV Golf.\"This is great as it gets Brooks back to where he belongs,\" McIlroy told The Telegraph. \"He is one of the best players in the world, and anything that makes the traditional tours stronger is a good thing in my book.\"\nKoepka's departure from LIV Golf came at the tail end of an offseason during which the league largely struck out in its recruiting efforts. Si Woo Kim, Sungjae Im, Min Woo Lee and Akshay Bhatia all reportedly turned down LIV Golf; the league instead signed Byeong Hun An, Thomas Detry and Elvis Smylie as it appears to be focusing more on country-based teams. An will captain an all-Korean team that was formerly known as Iron Heads GC but has since rebranded to the Korean Golf Club.Although Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith all committed to play on LIV Golf in 2026 despite being eligible for the PGA Tour's Returning Member Program on the PGA Tour, the future is not set in stone. DeChambeau is in the middle of negotiations and is playing his hand hard, refusing to commit beyond 2026 and calling the possibility of playing only on YouTube and in major championships \"a viable option.\"\"It's not as if they made any huge signings this year, is it?\" said McIlroy about LIV Golf's recruiting attempts. \"They haven't signed anyone who moves the needle, and I don't think they will. I mean, they could re-sign Bryson for hundreds of millions of dollars, but even if they do, it doesn't change their product, does it? They'll just be paying for the exact same thing.\"\nMcIlroy and Woods were both offered astronomical paydays from LIV Golf at various stages, as was Wyndham Clark. The former U.S. Open champion had made jabs at LIV Golf in the past, noting the league only played 54 holes.However, with Koepka being allowed to return in relatively smooth fashion, Clark wonders whether he should have jumped ship, too.\"I personally really like Brooks, and I think it's ultimately really good for the PGA Tour,\" Clark said on SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio. \"But also, [as] a guy that had an opportunity to go to LIV, it's kind of frustrating that he's able to get the cake and also eat it. And if you would have told me that I could have gone for a year-and-a-half, make a boatload of money and then be able to come back, play on the Tour, I think almost everyone would have done that.\"\n\"At the end of the day, I want whatever is best for the PGA Tour, and I think if guys come back, especially top guys like Brooks, it's only going to help the Tour, which is ultimately going to help me.\"A key point in the Returning Member Program is that Koepka's addition to PGA Tour fields will not come at the cost of any other player, meaning the five-time major champion will be added to fields as an extra golfer. He will have to play 15 events and qualify for signature events while being ineligible for sponsor exemptions in those tournaments, all while working his way back up.\"That was one of the main concerns and one of the big things that myself and the other player directors demanded,\" Woods said. \"He's an additive. … The alternate list, I think they're going to be impacted getting in one or two more events, which is a positive thing. And on top of that, we get a probably top-three-of-his-generation player back that went to another tour, played over there, and was adamant about coming back here and got out early to come back.\n\"That says a lot about the PGA Tour, where we're headed, what we have done, what we accomplished and the players who have stayed and who have supported the Tour. Having another world-class player that these guys are going to try and beat, that's what the fans demanded.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sam Darnold has been labeled as questionable for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. The Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback was added to Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury. Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice. \"Didn't wanna push it,\" he said after practice. \"Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.\"Darnold said that there is a \"very low percentage\" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game. \"Probably closer to zero,\" he said with a slight smile. Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason. \nDarnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes. \nIf Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos. \"Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,\" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. \"Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.\" While Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field while making his second career postseason start. \n\"We'll attack it the next couple of days and be ready for Saturday,\" he said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The SEC is the toughest conference in women's college basketball and two of the heavyweights will face each other on Thursday night in one of the biggest regular-season games of the season. No. 2 South Carolina is hosting No. 4 Texas in a rematch of the Players Era championship in November, and this game could be a huge resume booster when March comes around.These opponents know each other well, as this will be their sixth meeting in 369 days. In all of these games, both teams have been ranked in the AP top five.South Carolina is 17-1 this season, with the Gamecocks' lone loss coming at the hands of the Longhorns in November. That game did not count toward their SEC record, which means Dawn Staley's team is still undefeated in conference play. Meanwhile, Texas is 18-1 overall and 3-1 in SEC play after a loss to LSU last weekend. Here is everything you need to know ahead of this top five matchup.Where to watch No. 4 Texas at No. 2 South CarolinaDate: Thursday, Jan. 15 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Colonial Life Arena, Columbia, South CarolinaTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds (via FanDuel): South Carolina -3.5, O/U: 137.5\nHow Texas won in NovemberSouth Carolina leads this series 5-4 dating back to 1988, including a win at the Final Four last April. However, Texas took the most recent victory with a last-second shot by Rori Harmon at the Players Era championship game in Las Vegas.At that point, South Carolina was ranked No. 2 and Texas was No. 4. The Longhorns had defeated then-No. 3 UCLA the previous day, which meant they became the first team in at least 25 years to defeat two top-three ranked opponents in back-to-back games.Texas only used a seven-player rotation against South Carolina due to injuries, but that was all the Longhorns needed. Harmon finished the game with only six points, but she was invaluable to her team's offense with nine assists. Madison Booker had 16 points and 9 rebounds, while Jordan Lee led all scorers with 19 points.\nFour South Carolina players scored in double figures, led by 16 points from Ta'Niya Latson. Madina Okot also stood out with a double-double of 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nCan Texas 'get ready' and bounce back after LSU loss on Sunday and Vic Schaefer's post-game rant?Texas is no longer undefeated after suffering a 70-65 loss to LSU last weekend. Although the Longhorns' offense has seen a significant boost from last season, they struggled mightily in Baton Rouge. Vic Shaefer's team has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, but on Sunday, his team registered a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Mikaylah Williams severely limited Booker in the first half. Meanwhile, Lee only made three field goals and Harmon sat out the fourth quarter. \nDuring the postgame press conference, Booker said her team needed to figure out how to get ready for South Carolina because they didn't show they were prepared on Sunday. Schaefer was also vocal about disliking a schedule in which they had to play LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road. \nDefense and rebounding will be keyOne of the things that helped LSU beat Texas was winning the rebounding battle 44-35. Staley highlighted this as one of the key areas that helped the Tigers and also something she wants her team to focus on.Defense will also be key as these are two teams in the top 15 nationally in scoring defense. Their offenses have been productive against other opponents, but this won't necessarily be a high-scoring affair. Texas' lowest scoring games this season have been against top SEC opponents South Carolina (66-64 win) and LSU (70-65 loss). As for the Gamecocks, they only reached 65 points in wins against Clemson and Georgia, but their 66-64 loss to Texas was a season low.\n\"They make it hard,\" Staley said. \"They make it hard for you to make entry passes. Anywhere on the floor. Anywhere. For us, we just have to be disciplined. Disciplined as to the way that we want to play defense and not give them multiple ways of coming off screens. You gotta give them one direction, and that's hard enough to guard, but when you give them options you are going to be running all over the place expending energy that we need on the defensive side of the ball, as well as the offensive side of the ball.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Although not yet officially official, John Harbaugh will be the next head coach of the New York Giants. According to Ian Rapoport and long-time Giants beat reporter Gary Myers, former Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken will be joining Harbaugh as the next Giants offensive coordinator. The decision to bring Monken with him makes a lot of sense from Harbaugh's standpoint and not just due to his familiarity and relationship -- the numbers back it up. The Ravens had a nearly historically strong offense in 2024 under Monken and maintained that level of performance throughout his tenure as offensive coordinator, particularly when Lamar Jackson was healthy.During the 2023 and 2024 seasons, when Jackson was fully healthy, the Ravens offense was a dominant unit. In 2023, they ranked fourth-best in the NFL in points per game, first in rushing yards per game, third in yards per play and sixth in offensive EPA per play. In 2024, Monken's offense saw significant growth, jumping to third in points per game, first in yards per play and the No. 1 offense in EPA per play all while maintaining the league lead in rushing yards per game. In 2025, things took a step back as Jackson played through injuries and Tyler Huntley was forced into action.For further context on Monken's borderline historical 2024 offense, Jackson reached career bests as a passer with 41 touchdowns and the Ravens achieved their best explosive play rate in franchise history while averaging over 30 points per game. While this is exciting news for the Giants' offense as a whole, it could mean even bigger things for running backs Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy Jr. Before his injury, Skattebo had broken out as an RB1 in Fantasy in large part due to his red zone role and efficiency scoring touchdowns plus his unique ability in the pass game. Under Monken, the Ravens had a dominant rushing attack. Skattebo has a chance to break into the RB1 ranks in 2026 and will be one of the highest upside draft picks.\nWhere Monken could make his biggest impact on Jaxson Dart is via the passing game. In each of his three seasons with Monken, Jackson topped 8 yards per attempt after averaging 6.9 yards per pass in his final season with Greg Roman as offensive coordinator. Dart's dominant rookie season from a Fantasy Football standpoint was mostly a result of his usage (and efficiency) as a runner. Dart scored over 100 Fantasy points on the ground with nine rushing touchdowns and 487 rushing yards. The rushing is part of Dart's game, unlikely to go away with Monken, and a big part of what makes him an exciting Fantasy Football pick -- but it's the passing that stands to make the leap under Monken.\nFrom a schematic standpoint, Monken is an excellent fit for Dart. In 2025, Brian Daboll and Mike Kafka took a hard look at their personnel once Malik Nabers was placed on injured reserve and decided that heavy personnel packages featuring multiple tight ends (12 personnel) would be the best way to maximize the offense. They were right. Dart thrived in these situations. Under Monken, the Ravens used light personnel groupings (11 personnel) fewer than any team in the NFL in 2025. Instead, they featured 12 personnel 35% of the time (the Giants were at 38%) and they mixed in 21 personnel (one tight end, one running back, one fullback) on 21% of their snaps.\nRavens fullback Patrick Ricard is a free agent this offseason and could be on the Giants' radar. Ricard is the type of player that makes the entire offense around him better and would be another boost to Dart's Fantasy outlook in 2026.Another way Monken fits the Giants and Dart like a glove is via the RPO (run-pass option game). The Giants relied heavily on RPOs in 2025 with Dart, using it as a way to quickly acclimate the rookie to concepts that he was comfortable running from his time at Ole Miss. However, in today's NFL, the RPO is a valuable tool for all offenses -- not just the college game. During the 2023 and 2024 seasons, Monken ranked first in the NFL with 101 RPO play calls in 2023 and fifth with 91 in 2024. The Giants ranked fifth in the NFL in RPO play calls in 2025 with Dart.\nDart is going to be one of the highest-upside Fantasy picks at quarterback in 2026 drafts. Jamey Eisenberg recently polled the FFT team on their early 2026 quarterback rankings and Dart ranked as high as QB5 (Jacob Gibbs). He was in the top 12 of almost everyone's early rankings. If Nabers trends in the right direction in his return from an ACL tear, Dart's stock will rise even higher. Monken brings a proven track record, an adaptive scheme that fits Dart and excitement for any Fantasy Football managers who plan to invest in the Giants in their 2026 drafts. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        ATLANTA -- Everywhere you turned, they were there. In your hotel lobby. Walking the streets of Atlanta. In your favorite restaurant or bar. Inside Gibney's Pub the night before the Peach Bowl, it was a full crimson takeover. Decked in their favorite red gear, Indiana fans packed into the popular pub to watch the Fiesta Bowl between Ole Miss and Miami. There wasn't an Oregon fan in sight. They loudly cheered for Ole Miss, letting out their famous \"Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers!\" chant any time the Rebels did anything successful on the field. And even though Ole Miss lost, there was a joyousness with this rabid Indiana fanbase that has sometimes been missing in recent playoff games, especially ones featuring traditional powerhouses. That was just a preview of what was to come the following night inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Indiana fans outnumbered Oregon fans at least 4-to-1 in what turned out to be a 56-22 blowout win to send the Hoosiers to the College Football Playoff national championship game. After it was over, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti loudly crowed, \"There's nothing like having a home semifinal game.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Indiana flirting with all-time great status as Hoosiers plow through Oregon, into CFP National Championship\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEven Indiana wasn't entirely sure what to expect in the lead-up to the game. Their ravenous fanbase had taken over the Rose Bowl already, but there were some initial concerns that Oregon could travel well. Indiana even practiced a silent count in case the opposing fans got loud in Atlanta, according to left tackle Carter Smith, which Indiana had had to do against Oregon the first time around in a 30-20 win. As Cignetti pointed out after the game, Indiana had seven pre-snap penalties in that game trying to deal with the noise. There was no leaving that up to chance with a national title game appearance on the line. As crimson flooded into the Benz, creating what might have been a 90/10 split against Oregon fans, any need for a silent count went out the window. \"Not having to go on silent count because of Hoosier Nation being here and making them go on silent count is a huge aspect of the game and offensive operation that's not talked about enough,\" Indiana star quarterback Fernando Mendoza said. \"Shout out to Hoosier Nation because going on silent count, especially against the Ducks, is always tough and making the other team go on silent count might have counted for some points.\"\nSaid Smith: \"I love Hoosier Nation. They rally for us so well, they travel for us so well.\"The noise certainly seemed to impact Oregon quarterback Dante Moore. He threw a pick-six on Oregon's first play, and it didn't improve much from there. It was deafening inside the stadium when D'Angelo Ponds returned that interception to give Indiana a 7-0 lead just 11 seconds into the game. Moore had three turnovers in total, seemingly overwhelmed by Indiana's swarming defense and its loud fans. \n        \n            \n                Inside the pick-six play that kickstarted Indiana's destruction of Oregon in CFP semifinals\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe questions on the minds of many: How exactly is Indiana doing this?If you weren't aware before, you certainly are now that Indiana claims the largest living alumni base (more than 800,000 worldwide). There are Indiana fans all over the country, but many lay dormant like sleeper cells as the Hoosiers' football program wallowed in losing and irrelevancy for decades. They needed a call to action, a reason to believe a financial investment in IU football was worth it.\nEnter Cignetti and his famous \"I win. Google me\" confidence that almost immediately changed fan attitudes. The tremendous winning that followed prompted more investment, financially and emotionally, from a fanbase that traditionally cared more about basketball. It all coalesced around this special 2025 Indiana team that featured Cignetti, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza and a defense that has frustrated every opponent to date. It was like after every Indiana win, it activated another part of the fanbase that never believed this kind of run was possible for the Hoosiers. \"To watch this many people getting excited about Indiana football is truly a surprise,\" said Galen Clavio, who hosts the CrimsonCast podcast, \"but I think it's because of how unique this story is. What Curt Cignetti and his staff and the players have done in creating not just a great story with all these unique features but being such a dominant team has galvanized the fanbase into almost Beatlemania.\"A sign of the changing times: The most packed Assembly Hall will be this year -- so far, at least -- will be for a title game watch party on Monday. Tickets for the event were all gone within two hours of being available. \nSquint hard enough and you'll spot some Oregon green among the swath of Indiana crimson.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Clavio, who also works as the director of IU's National Sports Journalism Center, made the trips to the Rose Bowl and Peach Bowl, and plans on being in Miami for the national championship. The Indiana alumnus says he's been to every Indiana bowl game over the last 20 years except one, and there's been strong fan turnouts along the way. But nothing quite like this, where IU fans have overwhelmed Alabama and Oregon fans on college football's biggest stage. It hasn't been cheap for Indiana fans to do so. If you've made the trips to the Big Ten championship, Rose Bowl and Peach Bowl you've already spent thousands of dollars on airfare, lodging and tickets. It'll be even more expensive to get into Hard Rock Stadium on Monday with the cheapest tickets available selling on third-party resellers like StubHub for nearly $2,700. But there's a newness to it all that feels special for Indiana fans. After all, this was the losingest team in FBS history before Cignetti took it over. The program had not won a bowl game since 1991 when Bill Mallory's Hoosiers beat Baylor in the Copper Bowl. \n\"We're hungry and we like being the underdog,\" alumnus and billionaire booster Mark Cuban told CBS Sports at the Peach Bowl. \"We haven't experienced this before, so I think everybody wanted to come out and see what it was like. Now they know. We've got one more.\"\nAs someone remarked to Clavio, \"We've been saving up for football trips for 30 years and didn't realize it.\"\"People are making the decision to do it because of the opportunity to potentially be a part of something truly historic,\" Clavio said. \"I think that's what this team has done. It's created an environment where people feel like this is historic. This is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\"That's the thing about Indiana people, maybe even more so than people from other schools. There's such an affinity for the university, there's such an affinity for the sports programs that are here that people want to feel like they're a part of it.\"Miami will be the ultimate litmus test for an Indiana fanbase that has conquered its opponent everywhere it goes. The Hoosiers have a massive alumni advantage over private school Miami, but the home game makes it easy for Hurricanes' fans to spend up on tickets without having to worry about airfare and hotel costs. That the game features a homegrown Miami coach in Mario Cristobal and a Miami native Heisman winner in Mendoza just adds to the interest. Count out this Indiana fanbase at your own peril, however. Said Clario, \"I wouldn't be shocked if Indiana had as many, if not more, in the stands.\" \nIndiana fans are everywhere, and the crimson wave is coming to overtake Miami next. \n            ",

These two teams haven't met since, though, and now the Thunder travel to Houston, where the Rockets are 12-2 this season. Only the Rockets and Thunder have just two home losses this season.

Both Cooper Flagg and Daniel Gafford left early with ankle injuries, and the Mavericks are already playing without Anthony Davis (finger) and Dereck Lively II (foot). However, the Jazz, who are also playing the second half of a back-to-back, could be without key pieces, including leading scorer Lauri Markkanen, who missed Wednesday with an illness. Neither team is having a great season, with Dallas at 15-26 and the Jazz at 14-26, but the Mavericks are home, where they are 11-11 this year.

Meanwhile, though it's still early in conference play, Pat Skerry's Tigers probably rate as the disappointment of the CAA, at 1-4 in loop action and only 9-9 overall from what was regarded as a league favorite.

It was rare for draft-eligible players with clear top-three-round grades to pass on the NFL and return to school.That's no longer the case. Not only are many Day 2 prospects choosing to cash in on NIL money this fall instead of entering the draft, but several presumed first-round locks have also told the NFL to wait -- at least for now.

Over his final five games, Manning accounted for 15 total touchdowns -- 11 through the air and four on the ground -- against just one interception. Heading into 2026, there isn't a quarterback in college football I'd rather have.\n2025 stats (passing): 71.8 comp%, 3,565 yards, 30 TDs, 10 INTs, 8.7 Y/A2025 stats (rushing): 73 carries, 156 yards (2.1 Y/A), 2 TDsDante Moore could have easily been a top-five pick had he declared, but returning to school is likely the best move for his long-term development. He's an excellent thrower with touch and accuracy to all levels of the field, but that consistency didn't always hold when he faced pressure this past fall. That's the biggest thing standing between Moore and immediate success in the NFL. He'll get a chance to answer those questions next season on a loaded Oregon team.\n\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 5.0: Dante Moore's decision shakes up Round 1, forcing Jets to pivot at No. 2\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTrevor Goosby was the top offensive tackle on my board -- and a top-10 player overall -- before announcing his decision to return to Texas. Given the lack of high-end competition in this year's tackle class, the move came as a surprise to many.While it may not be the best short-term financial decision, Goosby likely made the right call for his long-term development. He's still relatively raw, with just one full season as a starter under his belt. But his end-of-year tape was elite: Goosby allowed only three pressures over his final three games. Now, he'll have the opportunity to put that level of play on film across an entire season.\n2025 stats: 33 tackles, 4.5 TFL, 1.5 sacks, 8 passes defensedA'Mauri Washington is another one-year wonder who went from a part-time player in 2024 to a full-time wrecking ball in 2025. He was comfortably a first-rounder based not only on his tape, but also on his athletic profile. Washington ranked No. 4 on Bruce Feldman's Freaks List last year, and it shows every snap. It won't take much more development for him to emerge as a top-10 pick in 2027.\n2025 stats: 34 tackles, 9.5 TFL, 6.0 sacks, 4 passes defensed, 2 forced fumblesYou may sense a theme here. Oregon's ability to convince top draft prospects to return to Eugene mirrors what Ohio State pulled off ahead of its national title run last season. Matayo Uiagalelei is the first name on this list, though, who I believe made a truly sound financial decision.A former four-star recruit, Uiagalelei has the physical tools of a top-10 pick, but his tape this past fall graded out closer to the fringe of the first round. Because he's still so young -- he won't turn 21 until next July -- there's significant room for growth.\nKade Pieper has been a favorite of mine dating back to before he became a starter. On just 108 snaps as a sophomore in 2024, his athleticism jumped off the tape and made his NFL future obvious. I would have given him the same advice he received to return for one simple reason: he was playing out of position last season.\nPieper's body type projects best at center in the NFL, but with Logan Jones blocking his path there, he spent the year at right guard. He'll now get all of 2026 to showcase what he can do in the middle, and he already looks like an early front-runner to be the top center in the 2027 draft.\n2025 stats (passing): 60.8 comp%, 2,437 yards, 13 TDs, 8 INTs, 8.3 Y/A2025 stats (rushing): 149 carries, 270 yards (1.8 Y/A), 5 TDsLaNorris Sellers will be drafted highly whenever he declares, simply because he's an absurdly gifted physical talent. His combination of arm strength and mobility is unmatched in college football. The dropback passing game has always been his biggest question, though, and it wasn't fully answered on his 2025 tape. Another year of development could be the difference between Sellers becoming a top-five pick or sliding into the late Day 2 range.\n2025 stats: 58 receptions, 534 yards, (9.2 Y/R), 3 TDsI don't blame Eric Singleton Jr. for not declaring early after catching just 58 passes for 534 yards this past fall, but I do question his decision to transfer to Auburn last year. He landed in one of the worst passing offenses in the Power Four, with Cam Coleman already established as the WR1, so it's no surprise the move didn't pay off statistically. We'll see whether his transfer to Florida -- a program without an entrenched quarterback -- proves to be the better bet.\nSingleton needs a quarterback who can consistently attack downfield, because that's where he wins. He's one of the best deep separators in college football, but to this point, he hasn't had a passer capable of regularly finding him.\nAnother first-year starter along Iowa's offensive line, Trevor Lauck was wildly impressive while locking down the blindside this past fall. He allowed just five pressures all season. I love his body control and coordination when engaging defenders in space, but his play strength still needs work and remains his clearest area for improvement. If that comes along, Lauck has first-round potential in 2027.\n2025 stats (rushing): 121 carries, 857 yards (7.1 Y/A), 10 TDs2025 stats (receiving): 13 receptions, 50 yards (3.8 Y/R)After Dante Moore, Justice Haynes was the second-most surprising prospect in the country to return to school -- and for a couple of reasons. First, the 2026 running back class is one of the weakest in recent memory. It wouldn't be shocking if as few as three backs ended up as top-100 picks, with Haynes having a legitimate shot to be RB2.\nThe second reason is his portal move from Michigan to Georgia Tech, a program set to lose its best offensive lineman -- Keylan Rutledge -- to the draft. We'll see how that decision pays off for Haynes, who averaged 122 yards per game and 7.1 yards per carry last season while emerging as one of college football's most dangerous big-play backs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Calm and soft conditions early in the first round of the 2026 PGA Tour season saw the same man who reigned supreme at Waialae Country Club the year prior shoot out to the opening lead once again. Nick Taylor was flawless in the initial refrain of his Sony Open title defense as the Canadian carded a bogey-free 62 to command a share of the lead with Kevin Roy.Taylor's effort marked his 17 straight par-or-better round at Waialae Country Club, the last 12 coming under par. \"I think we got lucky with the forecast this morning. I expected some more wind,\" Taylor said. \"I read I think Michael Kim had a tweet about the direction of the wind this year, which was pretty accurate in the sense [that] a lot of the wind is doing with the dogleg, so it felt like some of the tee shots maybe weren't as challenging. I hit it great, but again, this course fits my eye. Irons were really sharp, and [I] was able to read the greens well.\"The five-time PGA Tour winner was in control from the onset as he rolled in two early birdies to get his year underway. A diet of pars filled his appetite for his next hour before he made the turn towards the outward half and made six birdies across his final 10 holes.\nTaylor was not the only winner from the 2025 season to look the part, however, as Ben Griffin and Chris Gotterup were up to something similar, carding matching 63s to sit one back. Griffin won in his final start of 2025 at the World Wide Technology Championship, while Gotterup credited a couple of matches in TGL the last few weeks for helping him assimilate to competitive golf without a hitch.\"You never really know what the first round back is going to feel like,\" Griffin said. \"It's been a couple months since I've competed out here. So played a decent amount at home and felt like I was playing well. When you tee up in a Tour event, it always feels a little bit different. So was really happy with my ball striking. Was happy with the way my overall game felt. Need to clean up a couple things, but overall, really happy with the way I played.\"Wind picked up in the afternoon and so did bogeys on scorecards as scoring proved to be more than one stroke more difficult by day's end. Caught in the breeze was former tournament champion Hideki Matsuyama, who signed for a 69 alongside U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley and Jordan Spieth, both of whom fired 68s. The trio will have a quick turnaround Friday morning where they will hope to turn on the gas towards the top of the leaderboard and play themselves into weekend contention.\nLeadersT1. Nick Taylor, Kevin Roy (-8): Taylor wasn't coming in totally cold as he traveled to South Africa last month to play in a DP World Tour event. Crediting the buildup to that tournament as a way to stay sharp, the 37-year-old arrived in Hawaii with additional friends and family and with a mindset ripe for a successful defense.On Thursday, he played about as stress-free golf as stress-free golf can look. Taylor connected on 10 fairways, 15 greens in regulation and regularly kept the course in front of him. A certified closer, Taylor now looks to keep this going. He knows that, if he gets to Sunday with his name on the first page of the leaderboard, there is a good chance it remains in first by the end of the tournament.\"I was saying earlier, I think I kind of timed the offseason well,\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to like play nothing for four months, so I had a couple tournaments after two months off to have something to gear up towards and take time off. I felt like that was about a month before this. Geared up to that, played decent, and took what I needed from it. Yeah, felt like my game was sharp coming over here. You never know. Coming to do a course I'm comfortable with definitely helps.\"\nContendersT3. Ben Griffin, Chris Gotterup, John Vanderlaan (-7)T6. Alex Smalley, John Parry (-6)T8. Denny McCarthy, Kurt Kitayama, Harry Hall, Russell Henley, Nick Dunlap, Adam Svensson (-5)In his first two seasons on the PGA Tour, Gotterup failed to gather a single top 10 finish across January, February and March. Sick of the idea of starting his season slow again, the Scottish Open winner decided to make the move to Florida this past offseason to practice more and keep his game sharp.\"I made a move this offseason down to Florida for hopefully reasons like this,\" Gotterup said. \"Feel like my game is in better shape just because I've been putting in more work at home. Yeah, me and my caddie were joking that playing TGL the last couple weeks has definitely helped me get ready for feeling some juice, and then playing in Grant Thornton and the Bahamas. I've played a decent amount the last couple weeks and months. Yeah, I feel like I'm in a pretty good spot.\"\nGotterup's move paid dividends on Thursday as he carded eight birdies against just one bogey to position himself one stroke behind the leaders. The big-hitting right-hander bullied Waialae CC into submission with an average driving distance north of 310 yards.\"I felt like, the last couple years, I started the tournaments really rough out of the gate,\" Gotterup continued. \"I loved living in Oklahoma, but 40 degrees and 40 mile an hour winds in December is not ideal for coming to Palm Springs or Hawai'i. So I just figured that was the smart move to make. One round through, it looks good. Yeah, it's tough leaving a place you call home for a little while. Yeah, got a new home now.\"2026 Sony Open updated picks, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookBen Griffin: 5-1Nick Taylor: 6-1Russell Henley: 8-1Chris Gotterup: 11-1J.J. Spaun: 19-1Maverick McNealy: 20-1Kevin Roy: 20-1Harry Hall: 20-1Spaun at 19-1 is intriguing. The U.S. Open champion did not make a ton on the greens on Thursday but still came in with a 4-under 66. The price is similar to the pretournament number, and his ball striking looked much like it did last year, which should allow him to make up ground over the next 54 holes. Berger at 45-1 should also be considered following his 66 in the much more difficult afternoon wave.\n            ",

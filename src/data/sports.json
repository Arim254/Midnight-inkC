    "body": "\n        The Week 9 college football schedule continues with a three-game slate on Friday night, heading by Virginia Tech vs. California in an ACC matchup at 7:30 p.m. ET. California is coming off a 21-18 win over North Carolina, moving within one with of bowl eligibility. The Golden Bears are 5.5-point underdogs against Virginia Tech, which is one of the Week 9 college football lines that SportsLine's proven computer model is targeting. The model is also backing the Over (61.5) in Charlotte vs. North Texas and the Over (51.5) in Nevada vs. Boise State. Those games start at 7 p.m. ET and 10 p.m. ET, respectively.  Click here to bet on Friday's games with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which offers new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses: The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and is a profitable 42-30 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024.

The 49ers have not given up less than 20 points in a game this season, which does not bode well against North Texas' explosive offense. The Mean Green racked up 55 points in a blowout win over UTSA last week, which was their seventh straight game with at least 33 points to open the season. They are scoring 48 points in the model's latest simulations for this matchup, helping the Over cash 59% of the time. Game: Virginia Tech Hokies vs. California Golden Bears, 7:30 p.m. ETThe Pick: California (+5.5) to coverCalifornia (5-2) has a significantly better record than Virginia Tech (2-5) heading into this matchup, but the Golden Bears are not getting much respect from the betting market. They can become bowl eligible and stay directly in the chase for an ACC title with a win on Friday night. Their offense is led by true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who threw for 254 yards and two touchdowns in his first conference road game at Boston College on Sept. 27. The model has California coming up just short of an outright win, but the Golden Bears are covering the spread 55% of the time.   Game: Nevada Wolf Pack vs. Boise State Broncos, 10 p.m. ETThe Pick: Over 51.5 total pointsNevada's defense has been leaky throughout the campaign, giving up at least 30 points three times while allowing 28 points per game overall. Boise State might not have Ashton Jeanty leading its backfield anymore, but it has still scored more than 40 points on five different occasions this season. The Broncos scored a season-high 56 points against UNLV last week after scoring 41 against New Mexico the week prior. They have gone Over the total in five of their last six games, and the model has the Over cashing 63% of the time on Friday.  More college football best betsEvery college football game simulated 10,000 times\n            ",

Those looking for an afternoon sports betting sweat should consider following one of SportsLine's experts in picking AC Milan to win by at least two goals against Pisa in a Serie A soccer match at 2:45 p.m. ET, and the SportsLine model also sees value in the Raptors as 1.5-point favorites in a 6:30 p.m. ET for Friday online sports betting.Click here to bet today's best bets at bet365, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets with a $5 bet whether it wins or loses:Whether you're looking into NBA betting, NFL betting, NHL betting or anything else on the Friday sports schedule, there are a number of online sports betting options, and our team can help point you in the right direction. Our computer model and experts will weigh in on all of the biggest events every day, and they're offering their top sports betting picks right now.Friday soccer best bets Game: Pisa at AC Milan, Serie A, (2:45 p.m. ET)The Pick: AC Milan -1.5 (-105)\"AC Milan are in a tremendous position in Serie A, and a big reason they are is due to their lack of a congested schedule,\" SportsLine soccer expert Jon Eimer said. \"While other teams like Napoli and Inter are having to deal with Champions League play, Milan doesn't have to worry about that. After their last season, they qualified for no additional European competitions, and are entirely focused on Serie A domination. Pisa are 20th on the table and seem to be drowning in Serie A play. I expect AC Milan to win this one, but multiple goals.\"Bet AC Milan vs. Pisa at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with your first $1 bet: More soccer best betsEvery Serie A, EPL, UCL game simulated 10,000 timesFriday NBA best bets Game: Milwaukee Bucks at Toronto Raptors (6:30 p.m. ET)The Pick: Raptors -1.5Both teams won their season openers, but the Raptors had no problems and had the No. 1 offensive performance in a 138-118 win over the Raptors on Wednesday; RJ Barrett had 25 points and eight rebounds and Scottie Barnes added 22 points, six rebounds and nine assists in the victory. Brandon Ingram added 16 points and nine rebounds in his Raptors debut after Toronto traded and signed Ingram to an extension in a clear move to try and win now after a few down seasons. Meanwhile, the Bucks are in a state of flux given the unknowns about Giannis Antetokounmpo's long-term future in Milwaukee, which could affect the team's play early in the season. The model predicts the Raptors to cover in 53% of simulations.Bet Bucks vs. Raptors at FanDuel, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Game: Atlanta Hawks at Orlando Magic (7 p.m. ET)The Pick: Magic -4.5 If the Magic are looking for a balanced attack from their newly formed Big Three, their first game couldn't have gone much better as Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner each had 24 points, with Desmond Bane adding 23 points in their 115-111 over Miami. The Magic have been building themselves up over Jamahl Mosley's tenure in Orlando, with him entering his fifth season as head coach, and after making the blockbuster trade for Bane, this seems to be the year the Magic are really going for it. They have the third-best odds to win the Eastern Conference, meanwhile, the Hawks are coming off a 40-42 season, and they've only finished with a winning record in two of their last eight seasons.

    "body": "\n        The University of Tennessee lost its most beloved coach this week, and the only one that delivered a national championship in recent years, as Tony Vitello accepted the manager position for the San Francisco Giants.\"Tony V\" is the first college coach to make the jump to MLB manager. Not only has Vitello never coached in the professional ranks, but he never played in them either. It's an incredible opportunity he felt like he had to take. Vitello just hopes he doesn't now have \"Lane Kiffin status.\" \"I feel like I made a selfish decision that was one I needed to make,\" Vitello told reporters, via 247Sports. \"It's the right decision and I just hope it doesn't give me Lane Kiffin status around here, because I feel like I'm a VFL. I think if someone truly invests in being a VFL for any amount of time, they're just that -- a Vol For Life. That's what I am in my mind.\"Kiffin famously sparked the Tennessee football program in his first year as coach back in 2009. Despite being just 34 years old, he encouraged fan fervor by being confident, and wasn't afraid to step on toes -- very similarly to Vitello. Kiffin also got results on the field from a new team entering a new era, as Tennessee finished with a winning record and earned a bowl appearance.However, Kiffin decided to pick up sticks and leave for USC after just one season in Knoxville, leading the students and fan base to feel betrayed. After all, Tennessee was used to consistent leadership when it came to the football program. Kiffin was just the third man to lead the Vols since 1977. \nWhen the news broke of Kiffin's departure, students in Knoxville took to campus in droves, and lit several items, such as a mattress and trash can, on fire outside the athletic center. It was an emotional outburst rooted in both pride and anger. Students walk past a charred mattress outside the University of Tennessee football practice facility after coach Lane Kiffin announced that he would be leaving his position. \n                                                                    USATSI\n                                                            When Vitello made his decision, there were no mattresses burned or student protests. He was the furthest thing from a one-and-done. He coached the Vols since 2018, went 341-131 as lead man and brought the program its first baseball national championship in 2024. He holds legendary status. If there's anger towards anyone in Knoxville, it's probably athletic director Danny White, who couldn't find a way to get Vitello to stay.Now, if things don't work out in the majors and Vitello returns to the college ranks and accepts another SEC job, like Arkansas for example, then maybe you would see Tony V approach \"Lane Kiffin status.\" However, at some level, your average Tennessee fan understands that Vitello couldn't pass up this MLB opportunity. \nMonte Kiffin has said that his son should have never left Tennessee. Hopefully Vitello doesn't feel the same way in the future.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the World Series begins Friday night, Bo Bichette will be an active player for the Toronto Blue Jays. Bichette, who has not played since suffering a knee injury in a collision at home plate on Sept. 6, is on Toronto's World Series roster, the team announced Friday morning. Outfielder Joey Loperfido was taken off the roster in a corresponding move.\"Continuing to make progress,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Thursday about Bichette's rehab work. \"He's going to do that again  today, hit live (batting practice).  He's taking ground balls, running.  He's going to do  more of the same today.  So you guys will see him out there.  He's  feeling good, which is nice.  Still a few more boxes to check.\"Bichette worked out at his usual shortstop position and also second base earlier this week. He has never played second in the big leagues and last played the position in Triple-A in 2019, and that was only one game. If the knee injury limited Bichette's range in the field, second base would be more logical spot to stash him. He would be a liability at short.\nThe Blue Jays could also put Bichette at DH, though that would mean moving George Springer to the outfield, and he's dealing with his own knee issue. Springer last played the field on Sept. 24 and played more games at DH (82) than in the field (54) this year. That said, the Blue Jays will do what they have to do to get Bichette in the lineup.\n\"We'll see,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Thursday about Bichette's World Series role. \"We're kind of coming right down to the wire with it.  I  could see (shortstop, second base, or DH) happening, to be honest with you.   Just kind of have to talk to him after the workout today, see how  comfortable he felt doing everything and make the best decision.\"\nBichette, 27, hit .311/.357/.483 with 44 doubles and 18 home runs in 139 games this year. At the time of his injury, he was on pace to lead the American League in hits for the third time in the last five years. Bichette and the Blue Jays will face the Los Angeles Dodgers when the World Series begins Friday night at Rogers Centre in Toronto.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 8 in the NFL kicked off with Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers crushing the Minnesota Vikings, 37-10. This weekend, Aaron Rodgers takes on his former team in the Green Bay Packers, DeMeco Ryans hosts his former team, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Philadelphia Eagles look to enact revenge on Jaxson Dart and the New York Giants from their loss a couple of weeks ago. Last week, we learned that Rashee Rice could propel the Kansas City Chiefs to another AFC Championship, the Detroit Lions could be Kansas City's opponent in Super Bowl LX following their statement victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Mike Vrabel's New England Patriots are a legitimate threat coming out of the AFC East. What will happen this week? Bet this week's top games at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Which teams should you pick in Week 8, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Steven Taranto are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Oct. 22, via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets:\nNew York Giants at Philadelphia Eagles (-7.5)\nDajani (Eagles -7.5): I'm sure Philly is motivated to avenge the surprising 17-point loss it suffered to New York in Week 6. I'm not expecting the Giants to sweep the Eagles this season. After all, the Eagles have won 12 straight home games vs. the Giants. Another reason I'm taking Philly to cover is because of what Jalen Hurts did in the passing game last week against the Vikings. A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith combined for 304 yards and three touchdowns. It was the second-most receiving yards the two had combined for as teammates, and the Giants have a bottom-seven pass defense  …  Prediction: Eagles 30, Giants 21Taranto (Eagles -7.5): Eagles legend Brandon Graham was a rookie in 2010 when the Matt Dodge Game happened, and he and the rest of the Eagles' greatest generation spent the next 15 years delighting in torturing the Giants every chance they could get. It's fitting, then, that Graham comes out of retirement one week after the Giants' biggest late-game meltdown since. Speaking of meltdowns, it's not just that the Giants haven't won in Philadelphia since 2013, it's that they've lost there every which way you can -- The miracle field goal in the Jake Elliott Game, practice squadders like Boston Scott coming out of nowhere to run all over the G-Men, the Evan Engram Drop, the list goes on. Expect the Eagles to take out their anger from two weeks ago on a demoralized Giants team whose issues go far beyond scapegoating the kicker. … Prediction: Eagles 34, Giants 17Chicago Bears at Baltimore Ravens (-6.5)\nDajani (Bears +6.5): I think everyone is shocked by this line. After all, the Ravens are 1-5 while the Bears have won four straight games. It may surprise you to know that the Bears are the only team in the NFL to score 21 points in every game this season, while the defense leads the league in takeaways. I expect Lamar Jackson to return to the starting lineup and offer Baltimore a spark, but I think the number is just too big …  Prediction: Ravens 26, Bears 24\nTaranto (Bears +6.5): The Bears' four-game winning streak comes with some subtext, as they've beaten teams that are either heavily flawed (Cowboys, Commanders) or are the outright dregs of the NFL (Raiders, Saints). Oddly enough, the Ravens fall somewhere in the middle of this, as they were 1-2 when Lamar Jackson got hurt and have gone from looking uncharacteristically poor with him to completely helpless without him. I think the Bears will take advantage of this matchup, and they'll have more games against soft opponents like the Dolphins, Jets, etc., over the next month or so. …  Prediction: Bears 26, Ravens 7San Francisco 49ers at Houston Texans (-1.5)\nDajani (49ers +1.5): Did you watch that Texans' loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Monday night? What a pathetic showing from that offense. Seattle kept giving Houston chances to come back and win the game, but C.J. Stroud just couldn't do anything. DeMeco Ryans, as a head coach and a former linebacker, had to be pulling his non-existent hair out. The Texans are 2-4 ATS this season, while the 49ers are 4-3 ATS. San Francisco is also 4-1 all time vs. Houston  …  Prediction: 49ers 23, Texans 17Taranto (49ers +1.5): I've seen way worse, but the Texans' popgun offense inspires little confidence that they're going to be much of a match for the better teams in the NFL. An interesting undercurrent to this game is that the Texans' struggles on offense have come after Houston's surprise decision at the end of last year to fire offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik, a Kyle Shanahan acolyte who had been instrumental in making Stroud the Offensive Rookie of the Year two seasons ago. Maybe this isn't real life, but perhaps Shanahan remembers that when he twists the knife into a 2-4 Texans team playing well below expectations. …  Prediction: 49ers 24, Texans 10\nNew York Jets at Cincinnati Bengals (-6.5)\nDajani (Bengals -6.5): The Jets offense is worse than the Bengals defense. I don't care if Tyrod Taylor is at quarterback or Justin Fields. We saw what Joe Flacco and Ja'Marr Chase are capable of last week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but don't forget that Chase Brown also got going with a season-high 108 yards rushing. With Cincy at home, I'll take the Bengals to cover  …  Prediction: Bengals 24, Jets 16Taranto (Bengals -6.5): It's fitting that the New York Post referred to Jets owner Woody Johnson's remarks this week as \"gasbagging\". We already know that the Jets' quarterback situation is terrible, and that they're still winless near midseason in large part because Justin Fields has never developed into an NFL-caliber passer. But actually coming out and throwing Fields under the bus the way he did does nothing to help the situation, especially given that there's a chance Fields has to play with Tyrod Taylor now, nursing a knee injury. By the way, didn't the Jets make Joe Flacco look finished when he was with them a few years ago? This franchise gets what it deserves.  …  Prediction: Bengals 30, Jets 7Dallas Cowboys at Denver Broncos (-3.5)\nDajani (Cowboys +3.5): I can't stop myself from being intrigued by this Cowboys team. Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams and George Pickens are the only trio that ranks top five in the NFL in passing, rushing and receiving this season, while the Cowboys are a perfect 3-0 ATS in 2025 as underdogs. Still, we understand that this defense stinks, as they rank last in the NFL (401.6 yards allowed per game). The Broncos, on the other hand, are an inconsistent squad that turns it on in the fourth quarter. They just became the third team in NFL history to win two games in the span of a month where they were down at least 14 points in the fourth quarter. Tough call here, but I'll take the hook with Dallas. Denver is 2-5 ATS on the season  …  Prediction: Broncos 33, Cowboys 30\nTaranto (Cowboys +3.5): The tide turned in the Broncos' favor a week ago when Giants cornerback Paulson Adebo got injured, allowing Bo Nix to target former first-round bust Deonte Banks throughout the fourth quarter with a high rate of success (the next time Banks turns his head to look for the football, it'll be the first time). The Cowboys have a far worse defense than the Giants' unit that shut Denver out before completely collapsing in the fourth quarter, but Dak Prescott has kept his end of the bargain by hanging big numbers on the opponent to try and boatrace them before Dallas' defense becomes an issue. Eventually, the Broncos defense having to carry Nix from week to week will catch up with them.  … Prediction: Cowboys 31, Broncos 17Green Bay Packers (-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers (SNF)\nDajani (Steelers +3): Aaron Rodgers at home in prime time vs. his former team, and he's getting three points? I'll take it. The Packers may be the No. 1 seed in the NFC if the season ended today, but they really haven't looked good since the Week 2 win over Washington. Green Bay has lost six straight trips to Pittsburgh, having not won in the Steel City since 1970 …  Prediction: Steelers 27, Packers 26Taranto (Steelers +3): A narrow loss to the Joe Flacco-led Cincinnati Bengals is nothing for the Steelers to hang their heads over, especially not given that it took place on the road. The Steelers aren't unbeatable in Pittsburgh (as the Seahawks proved earlier this year), but they're nonetheless going to take advantage of how intimidating their building is to play in. By comparison, the Packers haven't had an especially impressive road win yet this year, as they're 1-1-1 with a win over the Cardinals, a loss to the Browns, and a tie in a shootout against the Dallas Cowboys.  …  Prediction: Steelers 24, Packers 20\nWashington Commanders at Kansas City Chiefs (-11.5) (MNF)\nDajani (Chiefs -11.5): It's Marcus Mariota instead of Jayden Daniels at quarterback for the Commanders, but the Chiefs were still double-digit favorites even before that news broke. It's clear that Rashee Rice adds a different element to this offense, but the key stat to know is that Washington is allowing an NFL-high 8.3 yards per pass attempt this season. That's concerning. This is a massive number, but I can't bring myself to back the Commanders …  Prediction: Chiefs 27, Commanders 14Taranto (Chiefs -11.5): Jayden Daniels' injuries notwithstanding, the Commanders regressing to the mean and Daniels going through a sophomore slump was easy enough to project. They're capable of putting themselves around the .500 mark, but they're still not ready to truly contend, despite being hyped as having Super Bowl potential. The Chiefs will likely serve another reminder of that, as Kansas City is on a two-game winning streak and rounding into championship form. I don't expect Washington to hang with them unless Marcus Mariota can channel whatever he had in the 2017 Wild Card Game against them. … Prediction: Chiefs 35, Commanders 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas --  The Dallas Cowboys (3-3-1) were fresh off their best offensive performance of 2025 under first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer in Week 7, and they had plenty to celebrate after a 44-22 win over the Washington Commanders.Quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 264 yards and three touchdowns without a turnover on 21-of-30 passing. Running back Javonte Williams ran for 116 yards and a score on 19 carries. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb totaled 110 yards and a touchdown on five catches, fellow wideout George Pickens added 82 yards on four receptions, and tight end Jake Ferguson caught two touchdowns.Through seven weeks, Dallas leads the NFL in total offense (390.6 yards per game) and ranks second in scoring (31.7 points). Naturally, Schottenheimer was asked postgame about how potent the offense looked with all its playmakers healthy -- but his mind went elsewhere: how he can be a better play-caller for Prescott.\"Dak's playing really well. You know, I'm not trying to not make a big deal about [how] he's playing great, but that's what we expect from Dak, and he's got incredible weapons. … You see the trust that he has in these guys,\" Schottenheimer said Sunday. \"He got hit a lot today, and I didn't like that, and he didn't like that. Probably needed to get him a few more completions midway through the second quarter, because he was getting popped pretty good. I think I got a little bit aggressive. I was getting pissed with the penalties and [focused] on too many deep shots, and that's on me. I told him that, and I said, 'Hey, I'll be better,' and that's what we did.\"\nPrescott's 3% sack rate is the second-lowest in the NFL, but he was hit four times Sunday -- tied for the third-most he's absorbed in a game this season. That had Prescott a little hot, but the two talked it out during the game, helping him shake off the bigger hits on longer-developing plays and lock in for the rest of the afternoon.Accountability fueling rare consistencySchottenheimer's willingness to take accountability -- both publicly and directly to his quarterback -- has gone a long way. Prescott has thrown at least three touchdowns without an interception in each of his last four games, tied for the second-longest such streak in NFL history. The only longer stretch belongs to Russell Wilson (five games in 2015). Prescott now shares company with Drew Brees (2019), Aaron Rodgers (2014), Peyton Manning (2013-14), Tom Brady (2007) and Wilson.\"Yeah, I appreciate that accountability, and honestly, that's just being a good coach,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"That's being a good reader and kind of gauging the temperature, I guess you could say. My temperature at times maybe isn't always right. Maybe I just got a little upset over this or that, and that's just being an elite coach and knowing your players.\n\"And whether it is his fault, when he's taking accountability, what he's saying is, 'Hey, you're not doing this by yourself. Relax. I've got you. We've got you.' I had a little moment in this past game, and that's exactly what he did. I appreciate it most definitely.\"Their trust didn't form overnight. Schottenheimer joined the Cowboys in 2022 as a consultant, working mostly with then-defensive coordinator Dan Quinn. When Kellen Moore departed for the Chargers in 2023, then-head coach Mike McCarthy took over play-calling and elevated Schottenheimer to offensive coordinator -- the moment his relationship with Prescott truly began to grow.\"I think I was able to show more of my true personality to Dak, and he showed his as well. That's part of building relationships. We still laugh and butt heads at times,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Like I said, I called a bunch of shots last game, and he's getting the shit knocked out of him. He's like, 'Really?' So we can have those disagreements, but it's been more so the last two years as coordinator than the years before.\"\nThe Prescott-Schottenheimer partnership has the Dallas quarterback climbing the 2025 NFL MVP odds leaderboard, sitting at +2200 on FanDuel Sportsbook (tied for seventh-best).Prescott was the 2023 NFL MVP runner-up in his last fully healthy season in 2023 when he led the league with 36 passing touchdowns. This year, he ranks among the league's top five in nearly every key category:Passing touchdowns: 16 (second)Completion percentage: 71.4 (fourth)Completions: 185 (first)Explosive passes (25-plus yards): 19 (first)EPA per play: 0.26 (second)\"I think you nailed it right there saying 'partnership,'\" Prescott said. \"Just the communication throughout the week of why this play's going in and what we're looking for to how we're trying to attack them. From every level. Why this protection is in. Why this run game is in. What's this run plan? [Schottenheimer] just allows you to go out there and truly know the why. \"When you do that, it just makes you feel better. You feel better about throwing the ball away, playing clean football and understand, 'Hey, they got the best on that one. Let's move forward.' Just great communication.\"\nCeeDee Lamb adds another voice to the offensive dialogueThat open and direct line of communication isn't just reserved for Prescott. Lamb has also developed an appreciation for his head coach's openness to listening to his suggestions. Schottenheimer certainly doesn't mind dialing up shot plays to Lamb like he did on No. 88's 74-yard catch-and-run touchdown Sunday against the Commanders. \"As for Schotty, you give us an opp[ortunity], I'm pretty sure he's going to take it. We talk a lot on the sideline and just kind of give him our eyes because sometimes he can't see what we see. So shout out to him for that and just being open to us and understanding we have a different POV than maybe the quarterback because he has the D-line in front of him. Just us seeing how things play out, it's amazing. Shout out [to] Schotty for trusting in us.\"Lamb said he's learned how to communicate more productively with his head coach, which he feels has only helped strengthen their connection. \n\"Being able to communicate, and I feel like there's a way to communicate professionally and not really just getting mad at the simple fact that you're not getting the target that you want. Or the game is not going your way. But as far as getting your message to him, just going up and having a talk. 'Hey, they're playing cloud [coverage] here, or on this down, they're doing this. Guys have tendencies. You just expose those tendencies.\" So what do those sideline conversations between Prescott, Lamb and Schottenheimer sound like? Here's a peek behind the proverbial curtain.\"Shout out honestly to Schotty for listening, and not only just listening but asking those guys, 'Hey, bring me what you see. Bring me what you feel. We'll make adjustments and we'll attack that,'\" Prescott said. \"We have in multiple games. For CeeDee, it's experience. It's experience, and it's confidence in your own game and understanding you've seen all these different looks, they're only going to play you so many ways. So when you get in that, to be able to tell the coordinator confidently, 'Hey, this is what's happening if you give me this route.' Or maybe, 'Hey, maybe if you give GP [George Pickens] or the tight end this route because of the way they're playing me, I think it will work.' \n\"There's as many adjustments happening on the sideline or things at least being discussed and put in motion than ever before. That's credit to CeeDee. That's credit to really all of the receivers, them having confidence in what they're saying. I'm sure it comes from their film study and them feeling it.\"Next test: The Broncos' dominant defenseThe Cowboys' offensive flow state will be challenged tremendously at the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos (5-2) and their stout defense.

    "body": "\n        The month of October has been a rough one for the Buffalo Bills. The Bills haven't won a single game this month and if that drought continues on Sunday in Carolina, Buffalo will make the kind of history that no team wants to make. Although the Bills started the season 4-0, they're now on a two-game losing streak and if they lose to the Panthers, they'll become just the seventh team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to lose three straight games after a 4-0 start. It's a situation that's so rare that it's only happened exactly one time over the past 20 years and that came in 2012 when the Arizona Cardinals lost nine in a row after a 4-0 start. Let's take a quick look at the six previous teams that started 4-0 only to have things go down the drain with a three-game losing streak following their hot start. TeamLosing streak after 4-0 startFinal recordPlayoffs1979 BrownsThree games9-7No1989 BearsThree games6-10No1993 EaglesSix games8-8No1995 DolphinsThree games9-7Yes2002 RaidersFour games11-5Yes2012 CardinalsNine games5-11NoIf there's any team on this list that's comparable to the Bills, it would probably be the Raiders. Back in 2002, they had the fifth-best preseason Super Bowl odds and they were hot coming out of the gate with their 4-0 start, but it looked like their season was going to fall apart after they lost four straight games, which dropped them to 4-4. Instead, they rode the back of the 2002 NFL MVP, Rich Gannon, who led the Raiders to a 11-5 record and a Super Bowl appearance. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 bold predictions: Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens both top 100 yards receiving\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJosh Allen will likely have to put the team on his back if the Bills are going to turn things round, but even if he plays well, the Bills still need to get two things fixed quickly. First, they can't stop the run. Heading into Week 8, the Bills are giving up 156.3 yards per game on the ground, which is the second-most in the NFL. Although the Bills are favored by 7.5 points this week, this game certainly won't be a cake walk and that's because their run defense is going to get a stiff test from a Panthers rushing attack that ranks third in the NFL with 140.1 yards per game. \nNo team has been better at running the ball over the past few weeks than the Panthers. Behind Rico Dowdle, the Panthers are averaging 193.3 yards per game on the ground since Week 5, which is the highest number in the NFL over that span. The 4-3 Panthers are also undefeated at home this season (3-0). The Panthers will also be starting Andy Dalton, who will be stepping in for an injured Bryce Young. Dalton also had to fill in for Young last season and during his first game of the year, he threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns, so the Bills better not take him lightly. The other issue for the Bills is that their once explosive offense hasn't looked so explosive. They've averaged just 17 points per game during their two-game losing streak and their lack of a No. 1 receiver is starting to show. Josh Allen has only topped 255 yards passing once this season and that came back in Week 1. In their most recent game, Allen threw for just 180 yards in a 24-14 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. If there's any good news for Buffalo, it's the fact that they have Allen and that they're coming off a bye: \nAllen has never had a three-game losing streak in his career. The 2024 NFL MVP has made 116 straight starts without losing three in a row, which is the second-longest streak in NFL history to start a career, trailing only Patrick Mahomes. Allen has also never lost coming off a bye, going 7-0, which is tied for the fourth-longest streak in NFL history by a quarterback. As a team, the Bills have been unbeatable off a bye. The've won 10 straight games off their bye, which is the second-longest streak in NFL history, trailing only the Eagles, who won 13 straight from 1999 thru 2011. With the Kansas City Chiefs on deck in Week 9, the Bills can't afford to overlook the Panthers. Buffalo still hasn't beaten a single team this year that currently has more than one win -- they've beaten four teams that are a combined 3-24 heading into Week 8 -- so a win in Carolina could be exactly what they need to get their season back on track. \n            ",

Dating back to last season, Portis has cleared his total points prop line in six of his past 10 games.

    "body": "\n        Arguably the most interesting matchup in Week 8 pits the 4-1-1 Green Bay Packers against the 4-2 Pittsburgh Steelers on 'Sunday Night Football.' While both teams have playoff aspirations, it's also the first time that Aaron Rodgers has faced his former team since leaving Green Bay before the 2023 season. Rodgers has thrown for 1,270 yards with 14 touchdown passes and five interceptions thus far. His replacement for the Packers, Jordan Love, has tossed 10 touchdowns to only two interceptions, while throwing for 1,438 yards. Rodgers can become the fifth quarterback to defeat all 32 teams with a victory.With emotions running high on Sunday in Pittsburgh, which team is worth backing? Green Bay is a 3-point road favorite with the over/under at 45.5 points. Week 8's 13 game slate should tell us plenty.

One of the most improbable NFL results you'll ever see. How their defensive coordinator still has a job is beyond me. While they crushed Philadelphia two weeks ago on Thursday night, look for the Eagles to exact some revenge in Week 8. Though Saquon Barkley has looked like a shell of himself this season, the passing game is showing signs of life with Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, and Devonta Smith having big games in Week 7. Look for them to cover the touchdown spread on Sunday. Eagles 28, Giants 18\". See his other Week 8 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 8 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 8 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

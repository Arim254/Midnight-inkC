    "body": "\n        NFL DFS players will have their final multi-game slate of the year as Championship Sunday brings both the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. The Broncos and Patriots play at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. Rams at 6:30 p.m. ET. Injuries will play a big part in both matchups with Bo Nix (ankle) out for Denver and Zach Charbonnet (ACL) out for Seattle. Denver, especially, will have a new look on offense and daily Fantasy football players will have to craft a strategy around how to value backup Jarrett Stidham and the rest of the that offense without Nix. The latter's absence could affect the likes of Courtland Sutton, Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Sunday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel?

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- A true crossroads fight takes place on Saturday in the main event of UFC 324 when Paddy Pimblett meets Justin Gaethje with the interim UFC lightweight title on the line. It's a fight that represents Pimblett's first opportunity to grab a piece of UFC gold, while it seems almost certain this is Gaethje's final crack at a title.Gaethje has held the interim title once before, as well as a brief stint with the symbolic BMF championship, but a stint as undisputed champion has eluded the 37-year old. By comparison, Pimblett is just seven fights into his Octagon career and is getting a chance to capture a belt in large part because of lightweight champion Ilia Topuria taking a step back from the sport amid a tumultuous divorce.The fight represents a chance for Pimblett to make good on the hype that has surrounded him since he made his Octagon debut in 2021.Subscribe now to Paramount+ to get access to UFC 324 for just $8.99 per monthFor the most part, Pimblett has lived up to that hype, with a 7-0 record in the UFC, including five wins by stoppage, in addition to flashing a big personality that can help draw attention and sell tickets. But it hasn't all been smooth sailing for the Liverpool, England native.\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 324 fight card: Paddy Pimblett getting chance to become face of new era among biggest storylines to follow\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPimblett likely should have a UFC loss on his record, with only one media scorecard tracked by MMA Decisions giving him the victory in his December 2022 fight with Jared Gordon at UFC 282, compared to 23 scorecards for Gordon. Despite what most observers felt, the three official scorecards all went to Pimblett for a unanimous decision victory.To give Pimblett some grace for the performance against Gordon, he suffered damage to ligaments in his ankle in the first round of the fight and was forced to undergo several surgeries that kept him out of the Octagon for more than a year.In addition, Pimblett spent much of his career putting on significant weight between fights and having to make large weight cuts to get down to the lightweight limit. As Pimblett told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell, changes in his life and his growth from a boy to a man have spurred him on to a more mature place in his career.\n\"I underestimated Jared a bit and obviously got a very bad injury in the first round that a lot of other fighters would have stopped fighting from,\" Pimblett said. \"But I had to switch things up. Obviously, I fought Jared, and then I got married a couple of months later and then my wife was pregnant like two months later, so that changed a lot, becoming a father.\"\nPimblett's growth has been very much on display in his two most recent fights. At UFC 304, Pimblett ran through King Green, putting the veteran to sleep with an arm triangle choke in the first round. Pimblett followed up that win with a third-round TKO of Michael Chandler at UFC 314. Both of those performances earned Pimblett Performance of the Night bonuses and showed that he was ready to be placed firmly in title contention.\"I feel like every time you have somebody who has a bigger than life personality, the fans don't always take them seriously,\" UFC president and CEO Dana White told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Paddy is one of those guys. Yet every time he's the underdog, he doesn't just win, he wins impressively.\"\nA win over Gaethje would leave Pimblett waiting to see what's next. Topuria will return at some point, but there has been talk that the lightweight champ could decide to jump to welterweight for a fight with 170-pound champ Islam Makhachev rather than stay at lightweight to unify his title with the interim belt.That would be disappointing for Pimblett, who has exchanged words with Topuria several times.\"I think [Topuria] is a very good fighter, but I think I'm going to punch his head in,\" Pimblett said of a potential fight with his rival. \"Once I beat Justin, I'll beat Ilia and then I'll beat whoever is next.\"\nWhether the Topuria fight materializes or not -- which, of course, requires Pimblett to get past Gaethje on Saturday -- Pimblett's self-belief shows when he speaks of getting the call to headline the first card of the UFC's Paramount era, with UFC 324 serving as the first event of the landmark seven-year broadcast rights deal between the two companies.\"You know, I show up every single fight and I'm entertaining,\" Pimblett said. \"They probably thought I'm a good choice for the first main event. ... I'm prepared for anything and I always have been. Things like this I've envisioned in my future, and I've spoken into existence and that's what happened.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Seattle Seahawks have a perfect record in three NFC Championship Game appearances. The Los Angeles Rams have emerged victorious in each of their last four trips to the conference title game. One team's winning streak is about to come to an end.The top-seeded Seahawks (14-3) look to earn a berth in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 seasons when they host the No. 5 seed Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in the 2025 NFC Championship Game at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Lumen Field.Seattle lost its only appearance in the conference championship game when it resided in the AFC from 1977-2001, falling to the Los Angeles Raiders in 1983, but the Seahawks haven't been beaten in the contest since shifting to the NFC. The Seahawks defeated the Carolina Panthers in 2005, the San Francisco 49ers in 2013 and the Green Bay Packers the following year. All three of those games were in Seattle at Lumen Field.The Rams lost six of the first seven times they reached the NFC Championship Game but have won their last four appearances, including two when they called St. Louis home. Most recently, the club beat San Francisco in 2021 before going on to edge the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 for the second Super Bowl title in franchise history.The NFC West champion Seahawks and Rams split their two meetings this season, with each club winning at home. Los Angeles posted a 21-19 victory in Week 11 even though MVP finalist Matthew Stafford threw for only 130 yards, while Seattle rallied from a 16-point deficit in Week 16 to defeat the Rams 38-37 in overtime.Los Angeles prevailed in both of the previous playoff matchups between the division rivals, winning 27-20 in 2004 and 30-20 in 2020. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 46.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for the Los Angeles vs. Seattle NFC Championship Game showdown.Rams vs. Seahawks odds\nOpening spread: Seahawks -2.5Opening money line: Seahawks -155, Rams +130Opening total: 47.5The point spread for this matchup hasn't budged at DraftKings. There's only a one-point difference from when these teams met in Seattle on Dec. 18, when the Rams covered as 1.5-point underdogs. Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 14-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-7 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-8 (Including playoffs)The Rams covered the spread in five of their final seven regular-season games but have yet to do so in the playoffs. They were favored by 10 points on the road against the Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card Round but only managed to escape with a 34-31 victory. As 3.5-point road favorites in the Divisional Round, Los Angeles advanced with a 20-17 overtime triumph in Chicago.All five of the Rams' regular-season losses were by one score, but only the setback in Seattle was by fewer than three points. Stafford was superb in that Thursday night contest, throwing for 457 yards and three touchdowns -- including a pair to Puka Nacua, who finished with 12 receptions for 225 yards. Stafford put up those numbers without the presence of Davante Adams, who missed the game with a hamstring injury.Stafford had 304 passing yards and three scoring tosses in the Rams' playoff opener against Carolina but failed to throw for a TD versus Chicago, marking the first time he has gone without a touchdown pass since the team's 13-9 victory against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17 last season. Nacua made 10 catches for 111 yards and a TD while also running for a score versus the Panthers but was kept out of the end zone by the Bears as he hauled in five passes for 56 yards. Seahawks betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 15-3 (including playoffs)ATS record: 13-5 (including playoffs)O/U record: 10-8 (including playoffs)The Seahawks covered the spread in their final two regular-season contests after failing to do so in their previous two and did so with ease against the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round. Seattle followed a 10-point victory as a 2.5-point favorite at San Francisco in Week 18 with a 41-6 rout of its NFC West rival at home last week while favored by seven points.Seattle covered as a three-point underdog in its first meeting with Los Angeles in 2025 but defeated the Rams by just one point as a 1.5-point favorite in the second encounter. Sam Darnold had a performance he'd like to forget in the Week 11 clash as he had 279 passing yards but threw four interceptions without a touchdown in a two-point loss. The 28-year-old was picked off by Los Angeles two more times in Week 16 but had a pair of TD tosses and threw a game-winning 2-point try in overtime.Darnold entered the Divisional Round against the 49ers nursing an oblique injury but wasn't required to do much as he completed 12-of-17 pass attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown. Kenneth Walker III provided most of the offense for the Seahawks, rushing 19 times for 116 yards and matching Shaun Alexander's franchise playoff record with three TD runs.Walker ran for a score in both regular-season meetings with the Rams and gained 100 yards on the ground in the Week 16 victory. The 25-year-old will be asked to come up with another big effort Sunday as Darnold still is showing up on the injury report and running mate Zach Charbonnet, who led Seattle with a career-high 12 rushing touchdowns, suffered a season-ending torn ACL versus San Francisco last week.Rams-Seahawks prop pick: Kenneth Walker III Over 19.5 carries\nWith Charbonnet out and Darnold unlikely to do any running because of his oblique issue, Walker likely is in for a busy day. Velus Jones Jr. rushed six times in mop-up duty last week but was ineffective, gaining only 10 yards. Jones, who had only four carries -- all in one game -- during the regular season, was placed back on the practice squad. George Holani (hamstring), who is likely to be activated from injured reserve, had 22 carries for 73 yards this season. Former Ram Cam Akers appeared in three games after being signed in late November but did not have a rushing attempt and is on the practice squad. That leaves me thinking Walker will have a heavy workload. He matched his season high with 19 carries in the Divisional Round victory and has had 20 or more attempts just three times over the last three campaigns after having at least 21 on six occasions as a rookie in 2022. But he had 25 carries against the Rams last year and set a career high with 29 versus Los Angeles in his debut season. What's more, Walker was rested last week after his third TD run early in the fourth quarter. With head coach Mike Macdonald having very few options, I expect the two-time 1,000-yard rusher to carry the ball at least 20 times with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n            ",

Now, the FBI is reportedly looking into the matter.Officials are investigating the death of Irsay and the doctor that provided him with prescription pain medication as well as ketamine towards the end of his life, according to The Washington Post. The FBI is researching Irsay's \"substance [illegal and prescription] use,\" and his \"relationship with Dr. Harry Haroutunian,\" who is a prominent addiction specialist. Agents reportedly visited Indianapolis this month and interviewed multiple people who were close to Irsay before his death.Irsay died at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California on May 21, 2025. Haroutunian was reportedly staying at the hotel overseeing Irsay's treatment, and signed his death certificate stating the cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by pneumonia and heart issues. Los Angeles County's medical examiner did not conduct an autopsy, saying the death was not considered sudden or unexpected.\nIn August, The Washington Post published an extensive report citing multiple people maintaining that Irsay, who claimed to have defeated his addiction to pain meds, had not only relapsed, but overdosed multiple times in the last five years. The Post acquired images of pill bottles that showed Haroutunian had prescribed Irsay more than 200 pills days before the Colts owner had two overdoses in less than two weeks back in 2023, including one episode that left him hospitalized for four months. According to multiple people who witnessed the injections, Haroutunian then added ketamine to Irsay's treatment plan.\nIrsay was one of the most recognizable owners in the NFL at the time of his death. He became the youngest general manager in NFL history at the age of 24 back in 1984, then became the youngest NFL owner at 37 when he took over the franchise following his father's death in 1997. Under Irsay's leadership, the Colts made 16 playoff appearances, took home two AFC titles and won Super Bowl XLI.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After 13 NFL seasons, Travis Kelce still hasn't decided if he's going to come back for another year, but he may have offered a small hint about his future plans during the most recent episode of \"The New Heights\" Podcast, which he hosts with his brother, Jason. During this week's episode, Jason brought up the fact that Eric Bieniemy will be returning as the Chiefs' offensive coordinator. Bieniemy was originally hired by the Chiefs in 2013, which just happened to be Travis' rookie year in the NFL, so the two spent 10 years together before Bieniemy moved on in 2023 to take the Commanders' offensive coordinator job. After one year in Washington, Bieniemy moved on to the college ranks as the offensive coordinator for UCLA. In 2025, he returned to the NFL as the running backs coach for Ben Johnson in Chicago. Now, Bieniemy is returning to Kansas City and Travis definitely sounds excited. \"I love that, shit. I think it's great,\" Kelce said on the podcast. And now, we get to the part where Kelce may have hinted at a possible return. The 11-time Pro Bowler mentioned that he's already excited at the thought of seeing Bieniemy back at the team facility.  \n\"I can't wait to see him back in the building,\" Kelce said. \"He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.\"If Kelce retires, then he won't be in the building anymore, so he wouldn't see Bieniemy there, but if he sticks around for one more season, then it would give him a chance to play one more year with one of his \"favorite\" coaches of all-time. On the podcast, Kelce certainly sounded excited about Bieniemy's return. Retirement speculation aside, Travis seems pretty confident that bringing Bieniemy back into the fold was a smart move for the Chiefs. \n\"I think it's a marriage that's gonna pick up right where it left off,\" Travis said. \"E.B. and who he is as a coach, you can see kind of his personality, what he brings to the table in that Chicago team. I know Ben Johnson has his own version of that, he's a very tough guy, and what he did in Detroit, he brought over as well. And you can see those running backs over in Chicago and their body of work was definitely an Eric Bieniemy style of football.\"Although Kelce's future is still up in the air, he'll almost certainly be making his retirement decision before the start of free agency so that the Chiefs can make their offseason plans. Earlier this month, Travis made it sound like he wanted to see how his body feels before making a decision. \"Right now it's just finding that answer and seeing how the body feels after this [final] game and kinda when it all settles down,\" Travis said at the end of the 2025 season. \nOne of his teammates in Kansas City isn't buying any of the retirement speculation. Chris Jones thinks that Travis will definitely be returning to play at least one more season. \"I'm not buying it, he'll be back next year,\" Jones said in early January. \"I can't promise you anything about another man. This was a tricky year for us. I have faith in my dawg coming back.\"Although Kelce is 36, he showed in 2025 that he still has some juice left in the tank, catching 76 passes for 851 yards and five touchdowns, leading the Chiefs in all three of those categories. \nThere are a lot of reasons why Travis would potentially want to return for one more year. For one, he likely won't want to end his career on a low note, which is what would happen if he calls it quits after a season where the Chiefs went just 6-11. The 2025 season marked just the second time in 13 seasons that Kelce has missed the playoffs. Also, you'd have to think that Patrick Mahomes would love to have Kelce back. The Chiefs quarterback tore his ACL in December and he's going to be motivated to return with a vengeance in 2026 and he's probably love to see Kelce on the field with him when that happens. Kelce actually has a lot to think about this offseason. Not only does he have to consider his football future, but he also has to start planning for the rest of his life. He's currently planning a wedding with his fiancée, Taylor Swift, and the two are expected to tie the knot in June, according to Page Six. If Kelce does return, the Chiefs start their offseason workouts in April, so he'd definitely be staying busy until the wedding rolls around. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. Ski & Snowboard has announced the names of the 97 individuals who have made the Winter Olympics team that will be competing in Italy next month. The list includes former Olympic gold medalists Mikaela Shiffrin, Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn, who is back after retiring several years ago.Shiffrin, a two-time Olympic champion and three-time Olympic medalist, is the most decorated alpine skier in history with 107 victories. Vonn retired in 2019, but has worked towards a comeback in the sport after successful knee surgery that helped ease the pain that forced her to stop her career. In December, the 41-year-old became the oldest downhill skiing World Cup winner, her 83rd World Cup win and her first victory since 2018.Another household name making a return is Kim, a snowboarder who gained popularity for her success at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. At 17, she was the youngest woman to land two 1080-degree spins in a row at the Games and was the youngest woman to win gold in the halfpipe.The Milano Cortina Games, spread across Northern Italy, will run from Feb. 6-22.Snowboarder Jamie Anderson, who was looking to make a comeback of her own after having two children in the last two years, did not make the team. Anderson said she was motivated by seeing others have families and continue their sports careers and sees it as a win that she had the opportunity to compete for a spot. Injuries also impacted her season. \"In many ways, making this team is even harder than the Olympics themselves,\" said snowboard program director Rick Bower. \"The depth of our field is incredible, and selection truly came down to the wire.\"On the men's side of alpine skiing, Olympic silver medalist Ryan Cochran-Siegle will be competing. Olympic champion and three-time Olympic medalist in cross country Jessie Diggins made the team for what will be her fourth and final Games. Red Gerard and five-time Olympian Nick Baumgartner are competing on the snowboard team.\"The athletes we are sending to the Games represent a large portion of Team USA and I am confident about the impact they will make in Italy,\" U.S. Ski & Snowboard president and CEO Sophie Goldschmidt said. \"More than the results, our athletes are also bringing some of the most captivating story lines to Milano Cortina, and we are so excited to see the impact they will have while representing their country in February.\"Here's a full breakdown of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard team by event.2026 U.S. Olympic Alpine Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenMary Bocock* Keely Cashman (2022)Katie Hensien (2022)AJ Hurt (2022)Breezy Johnson (2022)Paula Moltzan (2022)Nina O'Brien (2022)Mikaela Shiffrin (2014, 2018, 2022)Lindsey Vonn (2002, 2006, 2010, 2018)Jacqueline Wiles (2014, 2018, 2022)Isabella Wright (2022)MenBryce Bennett (2022)Ryan Cochran-Siegle (2018, 2022)Sam Morse* Kyle Negomir* River Radamus (2022)Ryder Sarchett* 2026 U.S. Olympic Cross Country Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenRosie Brennan (2018, 2022)Jessie Diggins (2014, 2018, 2022)Lauren Jortberg* Julia Kern (2022)Kendall Kramer* Novie McCabe (2022)Samantha \"Sammy\" Smith* Hailey Swirbul (2022)MenJohn Steel Hagenbuch*Zak Ketterson* Zanden McMullen* Ben Ogden (2022)James \"JC\" Schoonmaker (2022)Gus Schumacher (2022)Hunter Wonders* Jack Young*2026 U.S. Olympic Freeski Team(Past Olympic teams)HalfpipeWomenKate Gray* Svea Irving* Riley Jacobs* Abby Winterberger* MenAlex Ferreira (2018, 2022)Nick Goepper (2014, 2018, 2022)Hunter Hess* Birk Irving (2022)Slopestyle & Big AirWomenMarin Hamill (2022)Rell Harwood*Grace Henderson*Avery Krumme* Men\nMac Forehand (2022)Alex Hall (2018, 2022)Troy Podmilsak*Konnor Ralph*2026 U.S. Olympic Freestyle Ski Team, Moguls & Aerials(Past Olympic teams)AerialsWomenKyra Dossa* Kaila Kuhn (2022)Tasia Tanner* Winter Vinecki (2022)MenConnor Curran* Quinn Dehlinger* Derek Krueger*Chris Lillis (2022)MogulsWomenOlivia Giaccio (2022)Tess Johnson (2018)Jaelin Kauf (2018, 2022)Elizabeth \"Liz\" Lemley*MenCharlie Mickel* Nick Page (2022)Dylan Walczyk (2022)Landon Wendler* 2026 U.S. Olympic Nordic Combined Team(Past Olympic teams)MenBen Loomis (2018, 2022)Niklas Malacinski* 2026 U.S. Olympic Ski Jumping Team(Past Olympic teams)WomenAnnika Belshaw* Josie Johnson* Paige Jones* MenKevin Bickner (2018, 2022)Jason Colby* Tate Frantz*2026 U.S. Olympic Snowboard Team (Past Olympic teams)HalfpipeWomenBea Kim* Chloe Kim (2018, 2022)Maddie Mastro (2018, 2022)Maddy Schaffrick*MenAlessandro Barbieri* Chase Blackwell* Chase Josey (2018, 2022)Jake Pates (2018)Parallel Giant SlalomWomenIris Pflum*MenCody Winters (2022)SlopestyleWomenLily Dhawornvej* Hahna Norman* Jess Perlmutter* MenJake Canter* Sean FitzSimons (2022)Red Gerard (2018, 2022)Ollie Martin* Snowboard CrossWomenStacy Gaskill (2022)Hanna Percy* Brianna Schnorrbusch*Faye Thelen (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022)Men\nNick Baumgartner (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022)Nathan Pare* Jake Vedder (2022)Cody Winters (2022)*Denotes first-time Olympian \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Texas Rangers and Washington Nationals pulled off a six-player trade on Thursday that sends left-handed starter MacKenzie Gore from the District of Columbia to Arlington. In return, the Nationals netted five prospects, including shortstop Gavin Fien, the 12th pick in last summer's draft.Whenever there's a notable trade during Major League Baseball's offseason, I pop up to break down every player involved in the swap. I also render judgement by handing out a letter grade to each team, a summation of how well (or poorly, in some cases) I perceive them to have done in the deal. The letter grade is, without question, the least important part of this exercise. Keep that in mind.Before getting too far down the road, here again is the trade in its entirety. Rangers receive: LHP MacKenzie GoreNationals receive: SS Gavin Fien, RHP Alejandro Rosario, 1B/OF Abimelec Ortiz, INF Devin Fitz-Gerald, OF Yeremy CabreraLet us proceed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rangers grade: BWell, this is a surprise. The Rangers, coming off a .500 season, spent most of the winter doing not much. They non-tendered outfielder Adolis García and catcher Jonah Heim; they traded Marcus Semien (for Brandon Nimmo); and their only free-agent additions to date have been catcher Danny Jansen and relievers Alexis Díaz, Jakob Junis, and Tyler Alexander. On paper, they didn't seem likely to come in with the best bid to secure Gore's services. Yet here they are, standing tall in the end.You needn't work too hard to figure out Chris Young's thinking. The Rangers should now be able to trot out one of the finer one-two-three punches in the American League, in Jacob deGrom, Nathan Eovaldi, and Gore. Texas' lineup ranked 22nd in runs scored and 25th in wRC+ last season, but they almost have to get more from DH Joc Pederson and first baseman Jake Burger than they did in 2025. It's not out of the question that infielder Sebastian Walcott, one of the best prospects in the sport, finds his way into the majors before the year is out, either, potentially giving them another lift. \nThere are other questions to ask about that Rangers club -- how about the rest of the rotation? Can the bullpen hold its own? -- but in the three wild-card era, any team with the potential for 80-plus wins has a real chance of making it to October. This trade, though damaging as it may be to an already sketchy farm system, certainly boosts the Rangers' odds for the next two years.Gore, 27 in February, has had an eventful run in pro ball. He was the third pick in the 2017 Draft, at the time eliciting superficial comparisons to Clayton Kershaw because of their shared handedness and feel for breaking balls. Gore then nearly had his career derailed by a bout with the yips, but he's since recovered to compile a 4.19 ERA (98 ERA+) and a 2.64 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 105 big-league starts to date. He made his first All-Star Game appearance last summer, but his performance cratered down the stretch and he finished with a 6.75 second-half ERA and an average of more than five walks per nine innings.\nYou may look at those statistics and wonder why the Rangers -- or any other club for that matter -- valued Gore so much. Put simply: how a pitcher fared in the past doesn't always inform how they'll perform in the future. Not anymore, not with all the accessible data, technology, and training available these days. Once you look beyond Gore's statline, you'll find it easier to spot the meat left on the bone.\nIndeed, Gore throws five different pitches: a mid-90s fastball, three breaking balls (curve, slider, hard cutter), and a changeup. His fastball doesn't just come in hot for a lefty, it also features more induced vertical break than is typical for someone with his release height (5-foot-7). The rest of his arsenal, meanwhile, each generated whiff rates exceeding 35%. So, why isn't Gore better? Part of it has to do with his command, as he's walked nearly four batters per nine innings for his career, and he almost never throws his cutter or his changeup within the strike zone. Part of it may also have to do with his overall pitch selection (he threw 52% heaters to right-handed batters, or close to 18 percentage points above the lefty starter average). The Rangers can tinker around in pursuit of a more optimized Gore. If they find it, then the best is yet to come.That's a pleasing thought for the Rangers to hold. Should it come to fruition, they ought to benefit not only from Gore's performance, but, if the club falters, from the possibility of again moving him -- be it this summer, next winter, or the summer thereafter -- to recoup some of their sacrificed prospects. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Nationals grade: BHere it is, the first notable move from the new Nationals front office. It's a big one, in terms of structure and potential intent about what else is to come (or, perhaps, who else is to go). Don't mistake this for a case of the Nationals taking quantity at the expense of quality. They successfully snagged three of the most interesting prospects in the Rangers system (Fien, Rosario, and Fitz-Gerald) while also grabbing two hitters in Ortiz and Cabrera who have a little something working in their favor. Fien, 18, was held as one of the top prep bats in last year's draft. He went 12th overall and subsequently appeared in 10 games in the Carolina League, hitting .220/.267/.341 with four extra-base hits. That sample size makes his line of no real concern, and it's more encouraging to note that scouts believe he can grow into above-average offensive production with time thanks to his projectable frame and feel for the strike zone. Those same scouts have pegged Fien for an eventual move from shortstop to third base, adding some pressure to the development of his offensive game if he's to validate his pre-draft hype. Rosario, 24, is a former fifth-round pick who enjoyed a successful introduction to pro ball in 2024, posting a 2.24 ERA and a 9.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 88 innings split across the A-ball levels. He hasn't pitched since after injuring his elbow last spring and he won't pitch anytime soon either. Rosario delayed undergoing Tommy John surgery until earlier this calendar year, putting him on schedule to return sometime in spring 2027. There's above-average starter promise here if he's able to return to full form after a two-year layoff.\nFitz-Gerald, 20, is a switch-hitting infielder who was drafted in the fifth round in 2024. He hit .302/.428/.482 with six home runs, eight stolen bases, and more walks than strikeouts in 41 games last season, albeit with most of them taking place in a complex setting. Fitz-Gerald has the chance to develop into an above-average hitter thanks to his feel for contact and the zone alike, as well as the aptitude he's shown in pulling and lifting the ball (something that would allow him to slug more than his raw power indicates). He's also considered an instinctual player, an attribute owed in part to his father, long the coach at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Fitz-Gerald isn't the most dynamic player otherwise, but those positives could provide him with a pathway to a starting role. Ortiz, 24 in a matter of weeks, will be the first member of this group to reach the majors. He hit .257/.356/.479 with 25 home runs across Double- and Triple-A in 2025, setting himself up to debut at some point in 2026. Ortiz has shown legitimate thump (his 112.7 mph maximum exit velocity is on par with the likes of Teoscar Hernández and Corey Seager) and an above-average feel for contact. He does expand his zone with regularity, however, and he's been ineffective against left-handed pitchers. Add in his defensive limitations (he's a first baseman or he's a DH), and he'll need to hit to stick.Cabrera, 20, spent last year batting .256/.364/.366 with eight home runs and 43 stolen bases in the Carolina League. He's a quality runner and outfield defender, but his future will be dictated by if and how he matures at the plate. On the plus side, he made strides with his contact rate, bumping it by more than seven percentage points without altering an already patient approach. On the minus side, his power output has been inconsistent and he hasn't performed well when facing left-handed pitchers (.205/.333/.339 over the past two seasons), suggesting that he may be ticked for a platoon role. \nAs suggested in the introductory paragraph, the main question in D.C. is now what comes next? If they're heading toward another large-scale teardown, they could attempt to trade shortstop CJ Abrams. Doing so, though, would raise questions about outfielder James Wood's future in the District. If that last part feels a little familiar, well, it's only been a few years since the Nationals were sorting through a similar mess with Juan Soto. This time, they can only hope to get it right.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. So far nine NFL teams have fired their coaches and one, Mike Tomlin, has stepped down. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris right after their season ended. And on Black Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Then the Miami Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel. Tomlin stepped down from his post as the Pittsburgh Steelers head coach after 19 seasons last week. Following a playoff loss to the Broncos in the divisional round, the Buffalo Bills entered the coaching hunt after firing Sean McDermott. In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. BillsThe Buffalo Bills have arguably the best player in the league at the most important position in the sport in Josh Allen. That alone makes this the most coveted job of this cycle, after the Bills fired Sean McDermott after their latest playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. Pairing yourself next to Allen has championship potential, so every head coach who hasn't already accepted a job will almost certainly stop what they're doing and see if they can align themselves with Allen. \nOutside of the elite QB, Buffalo does have other things going for it. James Cook is coming off a 2025 regular season where he led the NFL in rushing, the defense allowed a league-low 156.9 passing yards per game, and they are just about to move into a brand new stadium. That said, whoever is hired will need to help improve a horrid run defense and get the most out of a lacking pass-catching group to truly help Allen get over the hump in the postseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers have a patient ownership group under the Rooney family: they've only had three head coaches since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. Their defense remains stout led by All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt with the Steelers generating three takeaways -- an interception and two fumbles recoveries -- off of Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud in an eventual defeat thanks to their crumbling offense around Aaron Rodgers. This is an organization headed for a rebuild after five consecutive seasons with 9 or 10 wins with four of those years ending with wild card round defeats. \nPittsburgh does have $23.6 million in effective cap space according to OverTheCap.com, but this offseason doesn't have a great free agency quarterback class, notable considering the Steelers haven't had a long-term quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement after the 2021 season. The best options are Daniel Jones coming off of a torn Achiles, Rodgers entering his age-43 season or Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis who shined in relief of Jordan Love the last two seasons. On the trade market, Kyler Murray is likely the best choice. Whoever takes this job will be tasked with helping the Steelers build around that elusive franchise quarterback, rebuild a stale offense and manage what's becoming a quickly aging defense.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

The Rockets covered the spread as 4.5-point home favorites against San Antonio on Tuesday, as Alperen Sengun narrowly missed a triple-double. Second-year guard Reed Sheppard scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and has knocked down 11 triples over the last three games. Philadelphia has lost three of its last four games, so SportsLine's model has Houston covering the spread in 70% of simulations. Back the Rockets at bet365 here:Over 224.5 in Lakers vs. Clippers (-110)The Clippers have won 13 of their last 16 games, but they are coming off a 138-110 loss at Chicago on Tuesday, marking the third-most points they have allowed in a game this season. They have scored at least 110 points in six of their last seven games, while the Lakers have reached that mark in six straight games.

Penn State surrenders a staggering 57% shooting on two-point attempts. Furthermore, with leading scorer Freddie Dilione limited by an ankle injury, Penn State lacks the firepower to trade baskets in a high-efficiency game. This is a revenge spot for Wisconsin, who were upset as 11-point home favorites by the Nittany Lions last March.

The Nuggets have the second-best Over record in the NBA at 27-17, as the total has been eclipsed in 61.4% of their games. That includes their matchup versus the Wizards on Saturday, which saw 236 total points scored, surpassing the game's O/U of 228.5, which is the same as Thursday's contest.Each of the last four meetings between these teams have seen at least 235 combined points, with them averaging 240 points. This season, both teams struggle on the defensive end, with Denver ranking 20th in points allowed, while Washington sits 29th. With that, both squads are forecasted to score more points than their season averages.

The 76ers are 11-12 at home this season, which is the same record as Houston has on the road. The 76ers are 10-13 against the spread at home this season. They are set to play Game Five of a six-game homestand, and the 76ers are 1-3 straight up and ATS at home during this homestand. Meanwhile, the Rockets have won three straight games. Kevin Durant is averaging 25.9 points per game this season for Houston, along with Alperen Sengun at 21.5 ppg and Amen Thompson at 18.5 ppg.

However, they had less than 24 hours to emotionally react and mentally and physically prepare for the loss of one of their most important players heading into a matchup against a team with a winning record. With more time to accept and adjust to their new-look lineup, the model expects a better performance from the Warriors (25-20) against a Mavericks team with an 18-26 record. Dallas has won three straight games, but two of those wins came against a 15-win Jazz team. The Warriors had a 126-116 win over the Mavericks on Christmas Day in a game where Butler scored only 14 points. The Warriors still have Stephen Curry, who is 10th in the league in scoring at 27.1 ppg, and the model projects Golden State to cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Warriors at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-1.5) vs. Lakers (+100)The Clippers defeated the Lakers at home, 103-88, on Dec. 20 in their last meeting, and the Clippers will host from Inglewood again on Thursday. The Clippers are coming off a 138-110 loss to the Bulls on Tuesday, but that was the second half of a back-to-back and that loss snapped a six-game winning streak. Kawhi Leonard (knee) missed that game, and although he's officially questionable, there is optimism that he'll play on Thursday. Although the Clippers are 19-24 overall, they are 11-9 at home this season. Leonard is averaging 28.2 points per game this season, with James Harden adding 26 points and eight assists per contest.

    "body": "\n        American soccer's most electrifying superstar finally has a new club contract and is staying put. U.S. women's national team winger Trinity Rodman signed a three-year contract extension with the Washington Spirit, the club announced on Thursday. Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang and club president Haley Carter made the special announcement at a media event in Los Angeles on Thursday. Rodman's salary will be over $2 million annually, her agent Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group told CBS Sports, making her the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world.\"I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" said Rodman in a press release. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"     The 23-year-old Rodman spent several weeks in contract limbo following the 2025 NWSL Championship in November. Her previous contract with the Spirit was through the 2025 season, and as the offseason kicked into full gear, attention and interest in her playing future hit warp speed. What began as standard contract negotiations eventually escalated into crisis mode for the NWSL.Here's what to know:An ending to unprecedented contract negotiationsRodman's new contract brings an ongoing back-and-forth of negotiations to an end. She burst onto the pro athlete hemisphere with an impressive rookie season in 2021, where she won NWSL Rookie of the Year honors and the 2021 NWSL Championship. Her fearless efforts in taking on defenders, unselfish assists, and a signature \"trin-spin\" move are all things that highlight her athleticism.\nHer unique style, appreciation for American chain restaurants, and endearing TikToks are just some of the other traits that take her from pro soccer player to celebrity for others. After winning an Olympic gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, her profile reached beyond the international stage and into casual tournament viewership. It's a win for the player who ultimately wanted to stay in the United States and play in the league that she helped carry into its next decade. For the NWSL, it means the league avoids another blow to its ability to retain star players and maintains its competitive appeal. \n        \n            \n                Trinity Rodman's contract saga timeline: NWSL reportedly approves changes in an effort to keep star?\n                \n                    Sandra Herrera                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRocky road between league and RodmanThe pathway to a new contract presented a balancing act for the league between its signature parity and the urgent need to ensure its marquee players are compensated as global transfer fees for players rise at a rapid pace. At one point in negotiations, Rodman and the Spirit did agree to a contract, a four-year deal reportedly worth a record-setting amount valued at over $1 million a year, but the deal was vetoed by NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman.  \nThe commissioner rejected the contract for allegedly violating the spirit of the league rules due to its backloaded structure. In response, the NWSL Players Association filed a formal grievance on Dec. 3, arguing that the veto was a \"flagrant violation\" of Rodman's free agency rights under the collective bargaining agreement. The added layer of legal challenges created a stalemate in the new year. Spotlight on the NWSL centered on the salary cap, a financial system that the league credits as the central component to its parity, as Rodman remained unsigned to any club following Berman's veto of the previous deal. Out of the discourse, the league board voted to implement a new financial mechanism known as the High-Impact Player-rule. The HIP rule allows teams to utilize extra funds beyond the salary cap for players who meet specific \"star\" player criteria, which raised questions about which players were considered stars to the league. The newly created mechanism in December offered no immediate resolution to the contract pendulum, and though it was referred to as the \"Rodman Rule,\" Denver Summer FC indicated that Lindsey Heaps could be the first player signed with the HIP funds as the NWSLPA filed an additional grievance following its passage.  \nThe players' union is challenging the rule. The NWSLPA is seeking immediate rescission of the rule, claiming \"a player compensation rule implemented without bargaining and in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and federal labor law.\"A lightning rod of optimismDespite the initial roadblock in the rotating contract cycle between player, club, and the league, the finality of Rodman's contract means looking ahead. For Rodman, navigating the highs and lows of managing injuries through her career, her resume to date shows she can not only produce, but can also come back and produce some more. Rodman's decision to stick through negotiations with the league of her choice carries a symbolic weight for the future of the league's identity. Her staying proves crucial as she's the best example of an NWSL product and its potential -- a current star who is shaping the league and national team for the present and the future.\nAs she steps into the next era as a Washington Spirit player, Rodman wants to shape this next phase of her career a little differently, with an emphasis on community.\"I think my next steps with Spirit are just tapping more into community and youth,\" Rodman told CBS Sports during the contract announcement event. \"I think I [already] do that through games and TikToks and all the funny stuff. But I think just being more involved moving forward, I do want to be involved with youth that are less fortunate, because I know, even just speaking from experience, I was not financially stable growing up. So it's very difficult for those [who] are naturally gifted, or even not naturally gifted, to have the ability to play sports and get to where I'm at, because again, it's a dream, and I think everyone should have that opportunity. So I think that would be my first thing, because kids are kind of everything to me, and I once was that little kid that wanted this, and now I'm here, so I want to take advantage of everything that I can do.\"\nWhat's next?Trinity Rodman is currently in the USWNT January training camp as the national team prepare for a pair of upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Chile. \n            ",

Payton's quote was brought to Boutte's attention by media members on Thursday. \"I ain't seen it,\" Boutte said. \"They can rest in Cancun, too, at the end of the day. It is what it is.\" Never one to hide his feelings, Boutte said that the Texans are \"not too complicated on defense\" prior to New England's 28-16 win over Houston in the AFC divisional round. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, however, didn't take the bait when he was asked about Payton's comments. \"I think we're plenty motivated for the game,\" Vrabel said. \nWhile he risked giving the Patriots bulletin board material, Payton's comments may have been made in an effort to raise the confidence level of not only Denver's fans, but its players, too. The Broncos, after all, will try to beat the Patriots with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center after Bo Nix sustained a season-ending ankle injury during the end of last week's win over the Buffalo Bills. Payton's comments are a clear indication that he isn't giving his players a pass or a built-in excuse if Sunday's game doesn't go their way. It's clear that Payton still has the same expectations for his team. Payton wants Broncos fans to have the same expectations, too. As the AFC's top-seeded team, the Broncos are hoping that their fans can provide a home field advantage while making things difficult when Drake Maye and the rest of the Patriots' offense is on the field. Denver's home crowd certainly made its impact felt when the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC title games after the 2013 and 2015 seasons. \nIf Denver wins, Payton's comment will likely become part of Broncos' history. If the Patriots win, rest assured that New England players and fans will make sure that he never lives it down. \n            \n    ",

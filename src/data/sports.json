He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards.

The Gaels are 4-2 in their last six games against Gonzaga and have covered this number five times over that span. Sometimes past results don't matter, but I look at trends more when the coaches don't change. Randy Bennett and Mark Few know each other well, so recent results hold more weight. Saint. Mary's is the top free-throw shooting team in the WCC at 81.4 percent, while Gonzaga ranks last at 64.6 percent. That big edge for the Gaels could come into play if the game is competitive late.\" Bet St. Mary's to cover at DraftKings here:Rockets (-10.5) vs. Mavericks (-110)Houston enters off a 104-86 victory against the Hawks in Atlanta, improving to 29-17 overall this season. Meanwhile, Dallas has lost three straight games, all at home, including a 123-121 loss to the Hornets on Thursday to drop to 19-29 on the year. The Rockets host on Saturday, and they are 16-4 in Houston this season. The Mavericks remain without their veteran superstars in Anthony Davis (finger) and Kyrie Irving (knee), and Kevin Durant is coming off scoring 31 points for the Rockets against Atlanta. The 37-year-old future Hall of Famer is 11th in the league in scoring at 26.5 points per game, including scoring more than 30 points in four of his last five games. The model projects the Rockets to cover in 62% of simulations. Bet the Rockets to cover at DraftKings here:Diego Lopes (+120) to defeat Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 325After Volkanovski won their first title fight in April, SportsLine MMA expert Daniel Vithlani expects a different result at UFC 325. \"Lopes had the cardio and aggression to give Volkanovski a tough fight, but he struggled to cut off the cage and find his opponent in the later rounds,\" Vithlani said. \"Lopes admitted that he fought with his ego in his first title shot and promised to come back with a better game plan. While I don't think he can beat Volkanovski in a pure kickboxing fight, I do believe that he can hurt the champion again, especially if he mixes in his lethal grappling attack. The odds seem curiously short on Volkanovski, considering he won four of five rounds in their first fight. Lopes' incredible durability and explosiveness make him a live underdog for every moment of this fight.\" Bet Lopes and UFC 325 at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball and UFC 325 on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

Ortega announced on Instagram that a series of injuries has forced him to take time to recover, as well as receive physical therapy.  The fight with Moicano was to be Ortega's lightweight debut, a move he has been planning for more than a year. Now, that move will need to wait until later in 2026.\"Obviously, the news is coming out that no longer am I fighting March 7 in Vegas,\" Ortega said in an Instagram story. \"I'm OK. Health is good. No surgeries, nothing crazy like that, but I do need to take a little bit, some time off to nurse these injuries that I have right now. It just sucks. It's not crazy like where I need to have surgery, but I have to rest it and let it heal and chill and do some physical therapy. I'm going to be on that mission. That's it.\"But it's just a little bit delayed. Nothing crazy. I'm still planning on fighting twice this year. Look out.\"Ortega holds a submission win over Moicano, though that victory came at UFC 217 in July 2017.\nLengthy stints on the sidelines have plagued Ortega's career over the past decade. He previously was out of action from December 2018 to October 2020, and again from July 2022 to February 2024.The move to lightweight came after a 2-5 stretch at featherweight beginning in December 2018. Over that stretch, Ortega came up short in featherweight title bids against Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski, with both bouts receiving Fight of the Night honors.Ortega has also badly struggled to make the featherweight limit in recent years. He had to withdraw from a UFC 303 bout with Diego Lopes the day of the fight after missing weight, and then experienced complications cutting weight for his most recent fight, a loss to Aljamain Sterling, which had to be contested at a 153-pound catchweight. Ortega claimed he passed out for an extended period of time during the weight cut for the Sterling fight.\nUFC 326 takes place March 7 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The card is headlined by a BMF title bout between current ceremonial titleholder Max Holloway and challenger Charles Oliveira.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The slumping Purdue Boilermakers, who began the season No. 1 in the AP Top 25 and who have lost three consecutive games in Big Ten play, are in action Sunday looking to snap their skid with a road tilt on CBS vs. the struggling Terrapins of Maryland. Maryland (8-12) has lost 11 of its last 13 games and is only 1.5 games out of last place in the Big Ten, while Purdue is competing in a different way -- sitting just 2.5 games out of first in the league despite its recent losing streak.  The potential best in the league vs. the potential worst in the league should be excellent theater given the recent developments from both programs. All signs point to a get-right spot for Purdue -- it is favored by double digits -- but Maryland has had moments where it is fiesty at home this season under first-year coach Buzz Williams.     Where to watch Purdue vs. Maryland live    Date: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 1 p.m. ET  Location: Xfinity Center -- College Park, Maryland   \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  Streaming on Paramount+ Premium        Purdue vs. Maryland: Need to know  Purdue's 3-point defense: Look no further than Purdue's defense -- or lack thereof -- from distance to find the root of its struggles. During its three-game losing skid it has allowed UCLA, Illinois and Indiana to shoot a combined 39-of-91(42.9%) from distance. Coach Matt Painter has insisted throughout the recent slump that Purdue's defensive issues are largely effort-based, not scheme-based.  \nPurdue's strength: It's ironic that Purdue's struggles can in part be attributed to its inability to defend the 3 -- because its ability to make shots from 3 consistently is a huge reason it is among the most formidable offensive teams in college basketball. The Boilermakers lead the Big Ten in 3-point shooting percentage at 38.2% this season -- 21st nationally -- and also lead the conference in assists per game.  Maryland meltdowns: Maryland is coming off a 91-48 loss at Michigan State last Saturday, which marked its largest loss by margin since a 63-point loss to Army in ... 1944. It is 1-6 in its last seven games and all six losses are by double digits. At 1-8 in conference play, the Terps are off to their worst start since 1992-93.      Purdue vs. Maryland prediction, picks  \nAll signs point to a Purdue bounceback -- and perhaps a resounding Purdue bounceback, at that. The Terrapins have been terrible on both ends of the floor vs. every top-100 opponent for almost the entire year. That doesn't seem likely to change Sunday. Purdue and its efficient offensive attack can and will meticulously shred this Maryland team in blowout fashion. Pick: Purdue -13.5 Boone  \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            PURDUE -13.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the Golden State Warriors somehow swing a trade-deadline blockbuster for Giannis Antetokounmpo, the two-timeline plan will turn back into one and it will have all been worth it. For years, the Warriors, like plenty of other potential suitors, have regarded Giannis as the \"white whale\" catch for which they were hoarding a boatload of assets. Well, that's not entirely true. The Warriors have also been hoarding assets because Joe Lacob believes he has been the author of this dynasty all along, and when the day comes, he's obsessed with proving he can write an equally successful sequel. But if ever there was a player that would convince him to back off this save-for-the-future stance and go all YOLO, it's Giannis. And now that he's actually available, the Warriors, according to ESPN's Anthony Slater, are willing to go all in to get a blockbuster done ahead of next Thursday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline. \n        \n            \n                Ranking Giannis Antetokounmpo trade packages: Who can make best deadline offer?\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat means, potentially, unprotected first-round picks in 2026, 2028 and 2032, a top-20 protected pick in 2030 and a 2031 swap. On top of that, Jonathan Kuminga, who Slater reports the Bucks have expressed interest in since the summer, and Brandin Podziemski, who, again according to Slater, could \"nudge the needle\" in the direction of a deal. \nIt's a major package. Probably better than any other realistic deadline suitor can offer. Those future picks, particularly in 2030, 2031 and 2032, could become very valuable in a post-Curry world. He'll be well past 40 by then. Maybe retired. Giannis, even if he stays with the Warriors longer, would be out of his prime, too. Sure, the Warriors would have money with Curry and Draymond Green potentially off the books and could, theoretically, build another winner via free agency in Giannis's later years. But all future picks are a bet, and all things considered, this would be a pretty good one for the Bucks to take. The Warriors have to evaluate their risk in a deal like this, too. Give up all your picks and fire the Kuminga bullet and then an aging Curry or Giannis or Green gets hurt, just like Jimmy Butler did? It's over. Not just now, but for the future, too. It's a big bet. But it's worth it, as Curry and Antetokounmpo would be a once-in-a-lifetime pairing. \nOn their own, Giannis is the fiercest rim attacker in the world, as Curry is the greatest 3-point shooter to ever live. Those two gravitational forces together -- Giannis sucking defenses in, Curry pulling them out -- present what might be an unsolvable defensive dilemma. The same was thought of the Giannis-Damian Lillard pairing, but the difference between Lillard and Curry is that Curry operates off the ball. That wasn't natural for Lillard. He's not the mover Curry is. Nobody in the history of the game has been. It was, in hindsight, a backwards pairing. Maximizing Lillard meant taking Giannis off the ball, where his shooting deficiencies become a greater handicap. Giving the ball to Giannis marginalized Lillard. There would be no such tradeoff with Curry and Giannis. Curry is a rim attacker's dream, dragging paranoid defenders everywhere he moves in bunches. Good luck building that Giannis wall in the paint without Curry killing you from deep. And vice versa. It's the same model that made Curry and Butler so good together, the driver and the shooter sitting shotgun. Giannis is just several levels up from Butler. \nTo be fair, there would be issues. Giannis and Green together are a spacing cramp. You don't have to guard either of them on the perimeter. The Warriors do not want to devolve into a give-it-to-Giannis-and-let-him-bulldoze-his-way-to-the-rim offense, but how comfortable, and ultimately effective, would Giannis be in a movement-based system that requires the highest of anticipatory and improvisational instincts? Giannis' feel for the game has grown greatly. He can make the 4-on-3 reads if he's in two-man actions with a double-teamed Curry. But he's certainly not the most natural of short rollers. And where would that leave Green? If he's not the one orchestrating offense, he holds zero value as a floor spacer and would be left to impact possessions in the cracks with screens and cuts. He's smart. He can do it. It's not optimal for him. \n        \n            \n                Warriors' Draymond Green not concerned about possible trade as Giannis rumors swirl: 'I ain't losing no sleep'\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the end, however, the power of the Curry-Giannis pairing would be so overwhelming that nothing else might matter. Let Draymond run the defense, which has been a top five unit for stretches of the season. Quentin Post and Al Horford can space the floor as centers. Kuminga wasn't playing anyway. The depth would still largely be there. \nRemember, the Warriors were very possibly headed for the conference finals last season before Curry got hurt. They went 22-5 with Curry and Butler in the lineup together down the stretch. This sort of inside-out dynamic has already been proven, and, again, Butler, for all the connectivity he brings to the table, isn't anywhere near the sheer physical force that Giannis is. Who knows if this will happen? The Bucks can probably spark a bigger bidding war in the summer, when more teams have more ammo to fire. But it's clear that Giannis wants to get this done now, and if you think that doesn't matter, then you haven't been paying attention to how the NBA works. Golden State has a serious offer. The Bucks are likely mulling it, and others, over as we speak. If it actually happens and Curry and Giannis end up in the same uniform, a Warriors season that looked like it ended with Butler's injury will start anew with the beginning of a marriage made in basketball heaven. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is currently preparing for the biggest game of his life, Super Bowl LX, but not everything is going as smooth as he probably would've liked. The starting QB and one of this year's MVP favorites showed up on the team's injury report just over a week before they face the Seattle Seahawks in the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Maye was limited on Thursday with a shoulder injury and did not practice on Friday, with his coach Mike Vrabel saying No. 10 would've been out there if not for the illness.Backup Josh Dobbs took first team reps in Maye's place on Friday. \n        \n            \n                Patriots QB Drake Maye could become 'one of the best to ever play,' ex-UNC coach Mack Brown believes\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMaye and Vrabel have both addressed the injury this week and the overarching messaging from both is at this time of the year, no one is at 100 percent, but the expectation is he will be ready to go on Sunday, February 8.The 2024 No. 3 overall pick admitted he was dealing with \"bumps and bruises\" after the AFC Championship road win against the Denver Broncos and this week said \"I feel good.\"\nOn Thursday, Vrabel was asked how much concern he has about Maye's health to which he responded, \"not much.\"The severity of the injury is not known, so there is no need to hit the panic button just yet, but way-too-soon overreactions are what football fans are best at. One concern Patriots Nation has is whether Maye's shoulder will be able to last all game. As a mobile quarterback and going up against an elite defense, their concerns are certainly legitimate.If Maye does need to take a play, series or longer on the sideline, the next man up is Joshua Dobbs. So let's dive into his career and the path he took to get to New England.\nThe 31-year-old joined the league in 2017, when the Pittsburgh Steelers selected him in the fourth round at No. 135 overall. He remained in the Steel City until 2019 and since then has bounced around the league. He was with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019, was back with the Steelers from 2020 to 2021 and in 2022 went from the Cleveland Browns, to the Detroit Lions to the Tennessee Titans. He went back to the Browns in 2023, but only as a member of the practice squad. In 2023 he was also with the Arizona Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings, before joining the San Francisco 49ers in 2024.He signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Patriots in March of 2025, marking his ninth NFL team.\nDobbs has not started a game this season with his most recent start coming in 2024, a 47-24 loss against the Cardinals. In that game he had 29 completions, a 67.4 completion percentage, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He is 3-12 in starts in the NFL. In his nine year career he has 351 passes for 3,346 yards and a completion percentage of 62.8. He has 17 touchdowns, with 15 interceptions along with 515 rushing yards and 8 rushing touchdowns. The Patriots went from back-to-back 4-13 seasons to a Super Bowl bid thanks to a new head coach, bulking up their defense in the offseason, improving their offensive line and one of the biggest reasons was the arm of Drake Maye. He was fourth in the league in passing yards (4,394), was third in passing touchdowns (31), fourth in rushing yards (450) and fifth in rushing touchdowns (5).\nWhile Maye's numbers have shrunk over the playoffs, that in part can be attributed to going up against top five defenses, playing in two bad weather games and inexperience in the postseason. Having Maye at as close to 100% is crucial for a New England team who are already coming in as 4.5-point underdogs.The team's third string quarterback is Tommy DeVito, who went viral during his time with the New York Giants. Super Bowl LX will kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET and halfway through the game Bad Bunny will take the stage for the halftime show. \n            ",

This season, No. 15 Arkansas and Calipari will host Kentucky in the second meeting since he departed Lexington during the 2024 offseason.Arkansas and Kentucky both advanced to the Sweet 16 last season under their new coaches. Calipari and Arkansas lost to Texas Tech in the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament, while UK coach Mark Pope guided his alma mater to its first appearance in the Sweet 16 since 2019.Year 2 of the Pope era at Kentucky has been a mixed bag. While the Wildcats have staged some dramatic comeback wins lately, UK sits at 14-7 (5-3 SEC) heading into the final day of January. Arkansas is tied for second (6-2) in the conference with Florida and trails Texas A&M by 0.5 games.Here is everything you need to know ahead of Arkansas' matchup with Kentucky on Saturday.\nKentucky vs. Arkansas: Need to knowCalipari faces his old team: Last year's clash between Kentucky and Arkansas was the anticipated game of the regular season. After roaming the sidelines for 15 years at Kentucky, Calipari returned to Rupp Arena. Arkansas entered the game as an underdog after struggling in SEC play and walked away with a 89-79 win. That game helped change Arkansas' season after starting 1-6 against conference competition. The Razorbacks would go on to finish 8-10 in SEC play and received a bid to the NCAA Tournament.Kentucky remains without projected lottery pick: The injury bug hasn't been kind to Kentucky this season. Star point guard Jaland Lowe underwent season-ending shoulder surgery after appearing in just nine games. The best draft prospect on this Kentucky team, however, is big man Jayden Quaintance. The former Arizona State forward underwent surgery earlier this spring on a torn ACL, which forced him to miss the first several weeks of the season. Quaintance made his debut against St. John's last month, but has been limited to just four games. On Thursday, Pope said that his star has been \"full shutdown in terms of his on-court work.\" When healthy, he is one of the best defenders in the sport.Darius Acuff Jr. has been stellar for Arkansas: It's no secret that this freshman class in college basketball has been special. One of the stars of it is Acuff. He is a true floor general who can do everything you need from a point guard at the NBA level. He is averaging 20.2 points and 6.3 assists this season. Calipari has been as good as any coach at producing guards ready for the NBA. Acuff is on track to be next.\nWhere to watch Kentucky vs. Arkansas liveDate: Friday, Jan. 31 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Bud Walton Arena -- Fayetteville, ArkansasTV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free) Kentucky vs. Arkansas prediction, pick\nLast season, it was Arkansas that stunned Kentucky as a road favorite. This time around, the script feels like it might get flipped. Kentucky has been struggling. The Wildcats are coming off an ugly loss against Vanderbilt. A win over Calipari's Razorbacks has a chance to flip the season around.

Roberts said Ohtani made the call and that the Dodgers would have supported him if he had chosen to pitch for Japan. (WBC pool play is slated to begin on March 4.)It's worth noting that Roberts' comments came shortly after Ohtani painted a different picture of his pitching status. Ohtani told reporters he remained undecided, reserving judgment until he begins ramping up over the coming weeks.Ohtani is still expected to suit up for Team Japan as a designated hitter, with Dodgers teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto slotting in as the staff ace.\n\"Wearing a Japanese uniform once again fills me with a deep sense of pride and responsibility,\" Yamamoto said in a Team Japan-issued statement. \"I've trained hard this offseason to be in the best possible condition for the WBC. Together, with great teammates and a dependable coaching staff, we'll unite as one and aim for the top.\"The Dodgers' other Japanese star, right-hander Roki Sasaki, was not named as part of Team Japan's roster. Sasaki had an uneven rookie season in MLB, including a prolonged absence due to injury. However, he did find success in a relief role during the playoffs.\nOhtani, 31, is coming off an eventful season that saw him hit .282/.392/.622 (179 OPS+) with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. He tallied 6.6 Wins Above Replacement as a hitter alone. He also made his return to the mound following elbow surgery. In 14 regular-season starts, he compiled a 2.87 ERA (145 ERA+) and a 6.89 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions as a pitcher were worth an estimated 1.1 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nEnglish Premier League leading scorer Erling Haaland and Manchester City are back in action on Sunday with a road matchup with Tottenham on tap. Man City sit second in the EPL table entering the weekend, while Tottenham have not won an EPL match since late December and sit 14th in the standings. Kickoff from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London is set for 11:30 a.m. ET. Manchester City are -140 favorites (wager $140 to win $100) in the latest Tottenham vs. Manchester City odds at DraftKings Sportsbook while Tottenham are +350 underdogs (wager $100 to win $350). A draw is priced at +310 and the total is set at 2.5 (Over -155, Under +120). You can find the latest projections for Tottenham vs. Manchester City at SportsLine but before locking in any bets, you should see what soccer expert Jon Eimer has to say for this Premier League showdown.Eimer finished 2023 as SportsLine's No. 1 soccer expert, posting a 248-234-12 (+25.93 units) record on SportsLine article picks.

Anyone following his soccer betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.  Here are Eimer's best bets and analysis for Tottenham vs. Manchester City on Sunday.Tottenham vs. Manchester City best betsUnder 2.5 goals (+115, BetMGM) -- 1uTottenham Double Chance (+110, BetMGM) -- 1uManchester's offense has cooled offManchester City for the last few years have been an absolute wagon when it comes to betting on goals. With players like Erling Haaland at the helm, it was easy to blind bet the Over for many years for Pep and his men. We are, however, seeing a bit of a different side out of Manchester City this season. Whether it's because of injuries, the congested schedule or drama off the pitch, this side just isn't firing at the same level we're used to seeing. They've now gone Under 2.5 goals in their last six straight EPL fixtures, which included a 0-0 draw to Sunderland, 1-1 draws to Brighton and Chelsea and a 2-0 loss to Manchester United. Factor in the fact that they'll be tired after hosting Galatasaray and this match has me leaning on another cagey Under. Tottenham's unpredictabilityTottenham continue to be one of the most bizarre teams in the league. One week they're getting put through the wringer by West Ham and Bournemouth, the next they're smacking down Dortmund and Frankfurt in UCL play. This team has a fairly talented side of strikers, but they're struggling with injuries and consistency alike. They also tend to be a bit of a bogey team for Manchester City at times. They've played Man City four times in the last two years, and Tottenham have won three of the four, and they're only loss over those four was a 1-0 loss. I'm going for a low-scoring, cagey match that could very well result in a draw.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Don't let the goofball theatrics or any of Teofimo Lopez Jr's attempts to get inside Shakur Stevenson's head this week distract you from the fact that Saturday's junior welterweight showdown is a showcase of everything that's right about the sport of boxing. Lopez (22-1, 13 KOs) will defend WBO 140-pound title against the three-division champion Stevenson (24-0, 11 KOs) inside a sold-out Madison Square Garden in New York (DAZN PPV, 6 p.m. ET) in the main event of a must-see \"Ring 6\" card presented by Turki Alalshikh. This sizzling matchup between two of the top 10 pound-for-pound fighters on the planet has also featured no love lost between the two competitors. Follow live updates of Teofimo Lopez Jr. vs. Shakur Stevenson with our live blogA native of Brooklyn, New York, who now fights out of Las Vegas, the 28-year-old Lopez spent most of Thursday's final press conference clowning Stevenson with childish verbiage in an attempt to get inside his head. It was par for the course for Lopez, who has longed relied upon mental warfare to convince opponents and critics that he's unfocused or mentally unfit before delivering the kind of breakthrough performances -- often as a betting underdog, which he is once again on Saturday -- that his legacy has been built upon. Despite his glossy record, Lopez can be wildly inconsistent inside the ring, especially when facing opponents not up to his level. But it has been his ability to step up his game when the lights are the brightest, including victories over lineal champions Vasily Lomachenko at lightweight (2020) and Josh Taylor at junior welterweight (2023), that have made the athletic counterpuncher so dangerous. \nIn a rare moment of clarity on Thursday, Lopez talked openly about how important the addition of new trainer Stacy McKinley, who will assist his father, Teofimo Lopez Sr., in the corner, was to his camp.   \"No media, no documentaries this time around. No cameras, no people,\" Lopez said. \"I tried to change that around this time just to see how it would do and I kid you not, so much more work has been done. I've been switching things around. I feel very good, excited and determined. I can't wait to display it Saturday night.\"The 28-year-old Stevenson, a native of nearby Newark, New Jersey, who now fights out of Houston, took Lopez's antics in stride, save for a crass comment that Stevenson inadvertently interpreted as a joke about his mother caused him to get out of his seat and attempt to attack Lopez on the dais until security intervened. Stevenson, however, brought his own ammunition to the event in the form of a brown-bag bottle of alcohol meant as a gift to Lopez's father, who was absent at the press conference, in reference to members of Stevenson's team claiming to have seen him inebriated the night before in the hotel lobby.\n\"No, it ain't nothing personal, it's all business,\" Stevenson said. \"When it gets personal, it's when people get emotional and I haven't really felt that way. I'm 100% focused, I'm ready and Saturday night he's going to see.\"Make sure you all tune in because I'm going to beat this boy's ass.\"Let's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings Sportsbook before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookShakur Stevenson -300 vs. Teofimo Lopez (c) +230, WBO and Ring junior welterweight titleKeyshawn Davis -700 vs. Jamaine Ortiz +450, junior welterweightsBruce Carrington (c) -800 vs. Carlos Castro +500, WBC featherweight titleWhere to watch Lopez vs. StevensonDate: Saturday, Jan. 31 | Location: Madison Square Garden -- New York Start time: 6 p.m. ETWhere to watch: DAZN PPV | Price: $69.99PredictionWith advantages in speed, footwork and technique, it's understandable why the southpaw Stevenson, who has been viewed for years as a future P4P king in waiting, is a 3-to-1 betting favorite coming in. That doesn't mean, however, that the result of this fight is a foregone conclusion. \nFor as much as Stevenson has been brilliant to date in outclassing the biggest names he has shared the ring with, he has yet to fight an opponent of Lopez's size, experience or athleticism as a quick-twitch puncher with legitimate pop. Stevenson is also moving up in weight to a fourth division against an unorthodox and explosive opponent who is anything but slow and plodding. The big question will become whether Stevenson can have success in boxing Lopez from the outside or whether he will field the pressure -- similar to the Zepeda fight -- of being expected to be exciting. Lopez, due to the threat of his leaping counter shots, can often lower the output of his opponents, which can make rounds more difficult to score for ringside judges due to the lack of compelling shots landed. Either way it goes, this matchup brings together two of the most skilled and physically gifted fighters of this era, similar to how we now view, in retrospect, Lopez's 2020 victory over Lomachenko. The difference between the southpaw Lomachenko, who was giving up size to Lopez, and Stevenson, however, is that Stevenson throws much more volume and likely won't wait until the midpoint of the fight to start making adjustments, which was what ultimately hurt Lomachenko when he ran out of time after rallying back.\nWhile few boxers in history can claim to be as unique and dynamic as Lomachenko, Stevenson might be in a class of his own from the standpoint of a pure and complete boxer and the closest boxing has seen to follow in the lineage of great thinkers and technicians like Floyd Mayweather, Andre Ward and Terence Crawford. And it's pure boxing that remains the only part of Lopez's game, especially when he abandons his jab, that sometimes allows inferior opponents to hang with him on the scorecards. Even with Lopez's advantage in power, Stevenson will likely prove to be too skilled to find himself in any trouble and too smart to get lured into any attempts at short-range trading that might favor Lopez. Stevenson, like Lopez, is the type of boxer who looks and performs better when he's facing elite and dangerous competition. The biggest difference, however, is that Stevenson is more complete.Pick: Stevenson via UD12Who wins Teofimo Lopez vs. Shakur Stevenson on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday, Jan. 31, super lightweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Milwaukee Bucks have been backed into a corner when it comes to the inevitable Giannis Antetokounmpo trade all season. Had they acted sooner, they likely would have received a historic haul for their two-time MVP. Asset-rich teams like the Spurs and Rockets might have been interested last summer. They've since moved on, and that has left the Bucks to sift through lesser offers. Trading Antetokounmpo for, say, Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges would do little for Milwaukee's long-term outlook. Golden State's draft picks are potentially valuable, but ultimately a mystery box. Kel'El Ware is a promising young big. You'd expect someone with a clearer path to stardom to be the centerpiece of an Antetokounmpo package. But what could the Bucks do? Antetokounmpo is set for 2027 free agency. They had no leverage. They could trade him for 50 cents on the dollar or let him leave for nothing.The Portland Trail Blazers have entered the chat.On Saturday, Marc Stein and Jake Fischer reported that Portland \"has also expressed its own interest to the Bucks that it would like to acquire Antetokounmpo ... even as the Blazers realistically understand that it would be an extreme long shot to convince Giannis to sign a contract extension that keeps him in the Pacific Northwest.\"\n        \n            \n                Ranking Giannis Antetokounmpo trade packages: Who can make best deadline offer?\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNow, there are quite a few caveats here. For this to matter for the Bucks, Portland either needs to be able to convince Antetokounmpo to agree to a long-term extension or be willing to trade for Antetokounmpo without those assurances. At this stage, neither seems especially likely. If either of those conditions is met, however, it changes everything for the Bucks and the other teams hunting for Antetokounmpo. If the Blazers are really willing to do this, that's checkmate. They win the Giannis sweepstakes, and the Bucks walk away with a better package than any of the other parties known to be interested can offer. So let's get into why Portland is such a critical variable in these trade talks, what a deal could look like, and what obstacles need to be cleared in order to make this happen.\nSo... why are the Blazers so important?Most of the time, the most valuable thing a team gets when it trades away a superstar is extra lottery balls. Consider the Chris Paul trade in New Orleans. The then-Hornets technically got a package centered around Eric Gordon and Al Farouq-Aminu... but practically speaking, the trade netted them Anthony Davis because it made them bad enough to tank for him in the first place. Houston trading James Harden set the Rockets up to draft Amen Thompson and Jabari Smith. The Spurs got three first-round picks for Dejounte Murray, but it also kickstarted the tank that led to Victor Wembanyama. I could go on and on. It was incidental, but remember, even the Mavericks last year likely wouldn't have gotten Cooper Flagg without the Luka Dončić trade. That wasn't the plan, but with Dončić, Dallas probably makes the playoffs and doesn't have the 1.8% chance it needed to secure Flagg.This is problematic for Milwaukee because the Bucks no longer have their own picks. Between the Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard blockbusters in 2020 and 2023, the Bucks owe control over their first-round picks through 2030 to other teams. Their 2026 pick technically belongs to Atlanta, but that's not the end of the world. Milwaukee will either have its own pick or it will swap with New Orleans, whichever pick is lower. As the Pelicans and Bucks are both bad, the Bucks will land somewhere in the lottery either way. Their 2027 pick is probably unobtainable. It's tied to a separate trade with the Hawks, and for New Orleans to give the Bucks control over it again, they would either have to make a side deal with Atlanta or they would have to surrender control of their own 2027 pick. That feels unlikely considering all of the bad press they got for giving away their 2026 pick.But 2028 through 2030? Those all belong to Portland through the Lillard trade. There are some strings attached to those picks through follow-up Portland trades we'll cover shortly, but the Blazers broadly have the ability to give the Bucks control of their picks back in all three seasons. There had been some assumption that teams might try to use Portland as a facilitator in a Giannis trade for exactly this reason, but if the Blazers want him themselves, they can jump the line and make the best offer rather easily.\nLook at it this way. One of the hypothetical trade packages widely regarded as among the best Milwaukee could get for Antetokounmpo would be a collection of four first-round picks and a first-round swap from Golden State. Warriors' picks, especially deep in the future, do hold a fair bit of value. Stephen Curry is about to turn 38, after all. But those picks are a bit of a mystery box. The Bucks don't know what the Warriors will look like in 2032, and they have no control over that. You know what the Bucks can control? How bad they are. They can essentially guarantee themselves high draft picks by stripping their roster of valuable players in years in which they actually have control over their own first-rounders. Trading for Warriors picks, or Heat picks, or whoever else's picks, doesn't come with that layer of security. The Brooklyn Nets just did this in the summer of 2024, trading control over a number of valuable future draft picks from the Suns and Mavericks to the Rockets to regain control of their own picks in 2025 and 2026.\n        \n            \n                Once-in-a-lifetime pairing: Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a match made in basketball heaven\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is even a model Portland could adopt as a hedge. Houston had three future Nets picks remaining when they made that trade. They gave the Nets two of them and kept the third, in 2027, betting that Brooklyn's tank in 2025 and 2026 would make the Nets worse in 2027 and thus give them a higher pick. Portland has more than enough young talent and draft capital from other sources (including its own) to potentially send the Bucks, say, control over their 2028 and 2029 picks, along with other assets for Giannis while keeping the 2030 pick. The exact structure of the trade would of course be subject to negotiation with the Bucks, but overall, this is what Portland's involvement is a best-case scenario for Milwaukee. They gave the Blazers their ability to traditionally rebuild in the Lillard trade. Now they could use Giannis to get it back.So what would a trade look like?First things first: We have to address matching salary. This seems pretty straightforward. We can assume Jerami Grant and his $32.4 million contract would be in the deal. It would make sense for Scoot Henderson, the No. 3 overall pick in 2023, to be in the trade as well. He hasn't played this season due to injury, and if Antetokounmpo got to Portland, he'd just never have the ball enough to develop properly. Milwaukee might actually be a perfect situation for him. He'd be surrounded by shooting, including a shooting center in Myles Turner, and he'd have little competition for touches and shots. Maybe the Bucks could turn him into the star Portland hoped it was getting when it picked him third.\nFrom there, again, it's a matter of negotiation. Portland would probably make likely first-time All-Star Deni Avdija off limits. Aside from being their best player, he's on a preposterously cheap contract that would be critical in building a deep team around Antetokounmpo. There's still plenty of other interesting young talent here for Milwaukee to consider. The Bucks are depleted on the wings. Maybe they'd want 25-year-old reigning All-Defense pick Toumani Camara. Maybe they'd want Donovan Clingan, an imposing defensive center. Maybe they'd want a lottery ticket on No. 16 overall pick Yang Hansen. Maybe they'd like Shaedon Sharpe's scoring punch. Some combination of these young players, Milwaukee's own picks and other draft assets from the Blazers would make up this package.However, we have to talk about those Milwaukee picks that Portland controls. The 2030 pick is simple. Portland just has swap rights. Therefore, the Blazers could simply renounce those rights. Easy enough. The 2029 pick is a bit more complicated. Portland has control over three picks: its own, Milwaukee's and Boston's. However, Washington is owed the second-most favorable of those three picks from the Avdija trade. Again... no problem. Portland can just agree to give Milwaukee the best of the three. Milwaukee could tank on its own, and if Portland or Boston happens to be worse than them organically, that's just a pleasant surprise for the Bucks.But 2028? Yeah, 2028 is a mess. There are two major reasons as to why.Milwaukee traded Portland's first-round swap rights in 2028 as part of the Lillard trade. However, it proceeded to trade secondary swap rights on that same first-round pick to Washington at last year's deadline in the Kyle Kuzma trade. This matters because it means Portland cannot simply renounce the swap rights it has with Milwaukee, because then Washington would just get unfettered access to Milwaukee's pick.Portland currently owes Chicago a lottery-protected 2026 first-round pick. It remains lottery protected through 2028. This means that if the Blazers miss the playoffs in 2026 and 2027, but make them in 2028, Portland will not have its own pick to swap with Milwaukee in 2028, once again setting Washington up for unfettered Bucks swap rights in 2028.So, can the Blazers clean this mess up? Yes, it would just be a complicated, multi-step process. The first step would be settling its business with Chicago to ensure that it has control over its own 2028 pick. The easiest way to do this would be to call the Bulls and offer to remove the protections on the pick this season. That would mean Chicago would get Portland's pick in 2026, no matter what, setting Portland up to keep its pick in 2028. The alternative would be to offer the Bulls some other draft compensation to get the 2026 pick back. Portland happens to have an unprotected 2028 pick from the Magic from a draft-night trade last year. Would the Bulls rather have that pick than this protected Blazers pick? If so, we're in business.\nNow, once Portland has its own pick back, it would have to trade it to Milwaukee. This would give the Bucks both their own pick and Portland's, allowing them to keep the better one while still honoring Washington's right to swap for the lesser one. Essentially, this means that if the Blazers and Bucks could successfully bribe the Bulls, there's a path to Milwaukee getting its 2028 pick back. It would just mean Portland losing control over its own. But hey, they'd be getting Giannis Antetokounmpo. They'd surely assume their own 2028 pick wouldn't be that valuable.Would Giannis really re-sign with the Blazers?Everything we've covered means nothing if the Blazers don't believe they can secure an extension with Antetokounmpo. If Antetokounmpo tells them directly that he's in, great, we can get the ball rolling. If Antetokounmpo directly tells them that he absolutely would not re-sign under any circumstance, Portland's out. They're not trading the farm only to watch Giannis walk into the Lakers' open cap space in the summer of 2027.Where this gets more interesting is if Antetokounmpo is non-committal in either direction. If he says he'd keep an open mind but wouldn't agree to an extension right away. Technically, Antetokounmpo is not eligible for an extension until October, three years after he signed his last one. This is a vital detail, though, because that window falls in the offseason. If Antetokounmpo is traded before the deadline, he's still eligible to sign a four-year, roughly $275 million extension before next season starts.\nHowever, if this drags into the offseason, he'd lose that eligibility. His max extension goes beyond the league's extend-and-trade guidelines, meaning he'd have to wait six months after the trade to get the most possible money. Say he's traded on July 1. That means he would have to wait until Jan. 1, 2027, to sign that extension. Antetokounmpo has dealt with calf injuries all year. He might not want to risk going into next season without having that extension signed.So his motivation would be to get traded by Thursday's deadline. However, Milwaukee's preference would probably be to execute a trade over the summer. At that point, the pool of possible suitors for Giannis expands. Maybe a team like the Spurs, Rockets or Pistons has a disappointing postseason and reconsiders pursuing him. Maybe a team's financial circumstances change in such a way that enables a pursuit. Orlando checks this box. The Magic can't seriously pursue Giannis right now, but once Paolo Banchero's rookie extension kicks in over the summer, it gets much easier for them to offer their former No. 1 overall pick for Antetokounmpo. If nothing else, teams like the Knicks, Heat, Warriors and Timberwolves would all gain access to their 2033 first-round pick just by virtue of the league year turning over.So here's the scenario in which Antetokounmpo might become more amenable to Portland. We get closer to the deadline. The Knicks, Heat, Wolves, Warriors and whoever else make underwhelming offers. The Bucks approach Antetokounmpo and say, \"Look, none of these other teams have made an offer we're willing to accept right now. If you want to go to one of them, you're going to have to wait until the summer. If you absolutely have to get traded right now, the only offer we're prepared to accept today is Portland's.\" \nIn that scenario, Antetokounmpo would have to decide whether getting traded now, and therefore having extension eligibility in the offseason, would be worth going to a destination he might not have originally considered one of his preferences. He might still elect to say \"wait until the summer.\" But maybe he decides at that point that Portland makes sense, and even if he couldn't technically put pen to paper on an extension until October, if he gave the Blazers his word that he would re-sign, they'd likely accept that as enough. This would, in essence, be a compromise between Giannis and the Bucks. Milwaukee agrees to trade him without scoping out the market more fully over the summer. Antetokounmpo goes to a team he might not have originally chosen in order to get traded faster.In basketball terms, at least, the Blazers actually would make some sense. Portland, after all, employs his former championship teammate, Jrue Holiday, as well as his more recent Milwaukee teammate, Damian Lillard. If Antetokounmpo is still close with them and interested in a reunion, as some reporting has suggested, Portland can offer it. The Blazers also have more roster optionality than most of the teams in the hunt here. Those Milwaukee picks should allow the Blazers to make a compelling offer without giving up everything they have, giving them room to make further roster adjustments afterward to suit Antetokounmpo's needs or desires. Say Portland made Avdija off-limits in the Antetokounmpo trade. If there was a specific teammate Antetokounmpo wanted that was somewhere else in the league, Portland could offer Avdija to get that player. There might even be permutations of the Giannis trade itself that allow the Blazers to bring back Myles Turner as well, an ideal center fit for Giannis, thanks to his shooting, by sending back some more draft value and a few of their expiring contracts. \nThe market is a concern here. There has been reporting indicating that Antetokounmpo would prefer to live in a warm-weather city. Portland is also about as far away from his offseason home in Athens as any NBA market. If that's a consideration, well, there's little Portland can do about it. Moving from the Eastern to the Western Conference would obviously make it harder for him to contend as well. Without knowing what Portland's roster would ultimately look like, it's hard to say where it would fall in the Western Conference hierarchy. Odds are, it would be behind the defending champion Thunder at least. Especially since Lillard almost certainly won't play this season, and we have no idea what he'll look like next year coming off a torn Achilles.In other words, it's probably unlikely that Antetokounmpo is willing to commit to a future in Portland. If he's not, well, I've wasted 3,000 words worth of your time. But Portland registering any degree of interest does matter here. Even if that doesn't necessarily mean he's going to the Blazers, it does give the Bucks a shred of leverage. It means there is at least one team, however unlikely it might seem, that is both capable of making the Bucks an appropriate offer and potentially willing to do so. That puts pressure on the more aggressive, but asset-poorer suitors to step up their own offers as the deadline approaches. And hey, it's not impossible that he'd be willing to play in Portland. There's been some reporting stating his interest in Minnesota, a similarly small and cold market. If Holiday and Lillard recruit him, if they convince him they have a path to putting a contender around him, or even if he's just eager enough to get that next contract from a team besides Milwaukee to force the issue now, there is a path, however narrow, to Giannis wearing red and black this season.\n            ",

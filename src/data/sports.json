    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers in the Sony Open field as the first tee times in Round 1 come at 12:10 p.m. ET.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite who begins at 12:54 p.m. ET in Round 1 on Thursday, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: Ben Griffin, who is +1700, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. \"One of the best values on the board,\" McClure told SportsLine. \"My number is meaningfully shorter than the market, which is exactly what you want when laying a shorter outright.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model's best bets also include five longshots of +3500 or higher in outright bets, including an enormous +40000 underdog. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Sony Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Move over, Wilt Chamberlain, you have company. A high school basketball player in Arizona became the latest to join the 100-point club, and he needed just three quarters to do so.Adrian Stubbs, a guard at Phoenix (Ariz.) Maryvale, became the first player in Arizona high school basketball history to score 100 points in a game with his historic effort in a 109-25 victory over Yuma (Ariz.) Kofa on Tuesday. He scored 70 points in the first half and added 30 more to his tally in the third quarter before taking a seat on the bench for the final period.Stubbs shattered the 6A record, which belonged to recent Arizona Wildcats standout Nico Mannion at 57 points. He surpassed the state record of 75 points, which had stood since the 1965-66 1A season, early in the third quarter. Stubbs' previous career high was 56, one point shy of the 6A record.\"This kid doesn't cease to amaze me,\" Maryvale coach Jeremy Smith said to The Arizona Republic. \"His will to win and fight and grit are second to none. He's got a lot of people backing him, wanting the best for him. He's a gamer. Before the season started, we had team goals. And we have individual goals. One of his individual goals was to beat Nico Mannion's record of 57.\"\nIt was a remarkably efficient performance for Stubbs, who entered the game averaging 24 points per game and hardly missed a shot in Tuesday's contest. The majority of his conversions came on mid-range jumpers, and he connected on only six 3-pointers. He went 16-for-23 from the free throw line.Stubbs got off to a hot start with 35 points in the first quarter, and his teammates got out of the way as he continued to drill seemingly every shot he put up. He scored every single one of Maryville's points in the first half before Travis Dean and Meqhi Teutsch contributed two points apiece in the third quarter.\"I think I had 35 at the end of the first quarter and my coach gave me the green light,\" Stubbs said. \"I was going to go. That was probably the most unselfish game (from teammates) I've ever seen in my life. Without them, this would not be possible. All of those passes. All the steals. It's a huge shout out to them.\"\nStubbs is an unranked recruit in the 2026 class, per 247Sports. His only scholarship offers to date are from junior colleges.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't expect to surpass their loss total from last season more than a month before the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, but coming off a 64-18 season is a tough standard to maintain. The Cavaliers haven't been nearly as dominant over their 22-19 start to the 2025-26 NBA season, but the SportsLine projection model expects them to pick up a quality Eastern Conference win over the Philadelphia 76ers as a part of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Cavaliers vs. 76ers is 235.5 points, down three from the opening line. The model has also locked in a college basketball best bet, backing No. 14 North Carolina to cover as 3.5-point favorites against Stanford in California. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on Iona vs. Rider at 7 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 13 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 34-15 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Wednesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookCavaliers (-108) to defeat the 76ersNorth Carolina (-3.5) vs. Stanford (-108)Iona (-7.5) vs. Rider (-110)Combining the three picks into a Wednesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +608 (risk $100 to win $608, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nCavaliers (-108) to defeat the 76ersThe injury report gives the impression that both teams will likely be at near full strength, which makes for one of the best matchups on the Wednesday NBA schedule. The Cavaliers are coming off a 123-112 upset loss to the Jazz on Monday, but they were 5-2 over their prior seven games before that result. Cleveland travels to Philadelphia, but the Cavaliers have won two of their last three road games, including knocking off the Spurs. The Cleveland lineup features the majority of the same pieces from last year's 64-18 season, leading the model to consider the Cavaliers a better team than their current 22-19 record indicates. The 76ers have lost two of their last three home games, and the model projects the Cavaliers to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at their current odds. Back the Cavaliers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:North Carolina (-3.5) vs. Stanford (-110)The Tar Heels had the No. 5 freshman class this season, according to rankings by 247Sports, highlighted by 6-foot-10 freshman forward Caleb Wilson. Wilson was the No. 8-ranked Class of 2025 player by 247Sports, and he's justified that position with four 20-point double-doubles over his last five games. He's averaging 19.5 points and 11 rebounds per game this season. The Tar Heels also have experience, though, with senior center Henri Veesaar (16.9 points, 9.2 rebounds) and senior guard Seth Trimble (15.7 ppg). North Carolina (14-2, 2-1 ACC) is No. 14 in the nation and 8-1 over its last nine games, including a road victory over Kentucky. Stanford (13-4, 2-2) is coming off a 70-55 loss to No. 23 Virginia on Saturday. The model projects North Carolina to cover in 57% of simulations. Back North Carolina at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iona (-7.5) vs. Rider (-110)\"Things aren't going too well for Rider, which might have a case as the worst-shooting team in America,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"To wit: only four teams out of 361 shoot less accurately from the floor than the Broncs' 38.6%, and there isn't one team that shoots triples worse than Rider, whose at 24.7% from beyond the arc are bottom-of-the-barrel nationally, with second-worst East Carolina not even that close. The plight is reflected by All-Name soph guard Flash Burton, who followed up his recent 27-point game vs. Fairfield by getting blanked on Sunday by Marist. Meanwhile, Iona has steadied since scoring just 38 in a recent lopsided loss vs. that same Marist, blowing out Niagara and Canisius last week while allowing just 50 ppg in the process.\" Back Iona at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants are working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh to be their next coach, ESPN has reported. The deal is not done just yet, and contract numbers are still being negotiated. However, it appears Harbaugh has chosen his suitor.Harbaugh was fired by the Ravens on Jan. 6 following Baltimore's season-ending loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the winningest coach in franchise history, going 180-113 during his 18 seasons, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 and was named Coach of the Year in 2019.While Harbaugh won 10 playoff games in his first seven seasons with the Ravens, he won just three postseason matchups over the last 11 years. Harbaugh was reportedly confident he would return to Baltimore to chase a Lombardi Trophy in 2026, but the Ravens made the decision to search for another coach that can get the most out of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. When the Ravens made the surprising decision to fire Harbaugh, his agent said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in his client 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There were only six other head coach openings at the time. Harbaugh formally interviewed with the Giants on Wednesday with team owners John Mara and Steve Tisch reportedly in attendance, along with quarterback Jaxson Dart, per NFL Media.Harbaugh is set to replace Brian Daboll, who went 20-40-1 in his four seasons as lead man. The former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator went 9-7-1 in his first season back in 2022, won NFL Coach of the Year and upset the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs. However, the Giants took a step back the next season with a 6-11 record, and went 3-14 in 2024 before Daboll was finally fired 10 games into the 2025 season.\nOverall, the Giants have struggled ever since Tom Coughlin resigned following the 2015 season. All four full-time head coaches finished with losing records. The Giants have the second-worst record in the NFL (55-109-1) in the 10 seasons since the Coughlin era ended. Only the New York Jets have been worse.Giants' coaches since Tom Coughlin (2016)*denotes interimCoachYearsRecordMike Kafka*20252-5Brian Daboll2022-2520-40-1Joe Judge2020-2110-23Pat Shurmur2018-199-23Steve Spagnuolo*2017*1-3Ben McAdoo2016-1713-15For all of the struggles, the Giants were still considered to be one of the most attractive open jobs this offseason. \nNew York owns the No. 5 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, has a prospective franchise quarterback in Dart, a talented running back with Cam Skattebo, a star wideout in Malik Nabers and then plenty of talent on the defensive line with Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence II and Abdul Carter. Now, they have new hope that comes in the form of an experienced coach that knows how to not only find success, but sustain it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After two years of constant calls from coaches and college sports administrators for change to college basketball's transfer portal window protocols, the NCAA made a surprising announcement Wednesday afternoon.Effective immediately, men's and women's basketball players will not be able to enter the portal until the day after the NCAA Tournament ends in their respective sports. Additionally, the portal will be open for 15 days from its onset, the shortest window for entry yet. (There is no deadline for a player to commit to a school after they enter the portal.)This is a drastic switch from 2024, when the portal was open for 45 days and the process began the day after Selection Sunday. That year, eventual champion UConn hosted virtual interviews on Zoom in the team locker room during while at the Final Four. NC State even hosted a potential transfer on its campus before flying to the Final Four. Auburn faced a similar situation last year while it made its run to the final weekend of the season. (In 2025, the window to enter the portal was cut to 30 days but still opened after March Madness' opening weekend.) Moving forward, a more practical transfer window will be in place, with college basketball's \"free agency\" period waiting to commence until after all the games have been played. The decision was made amid the NCAA's annual convention, which is being held this week in Washington, D.C.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Kansas' upset of Iowa State could be turning point for Jayhawks\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe change won't stop players from announcing their intentions to transfer — and seeking traction/attention on social media — but it will stop the formal and necessary process of being registered in the transfer portal. Until that step happens, a player can't transfer nor commit elsewhere in an official capacity. \nMost importantly, the change should reduce a lot of the auxiliary noise off the court in college basketball and bring a return to most of the attention where it belongs: The NCAA Tournament.There are still special circumstances that will allow a player to go into the portal even after the window closes.\"When a head coaching change occurs, a 15-day period will open five days after the new head coach is hired or publicly announced,\" per the NCAA's press release. \"If a new head coach is not announced within 30 days of the previous head coach's departure — and the 31st day after the head coach's departure is after the championship game — a 15-day window will open. The additional head coach departure window is available only after the basketball transfer window opens through Jan. 2.\" \nThis year's NCAA Tournament will begin with the First Four in Dayton, Ohio, on March 17. The Final Four will be held in Indianapolis on April 4 and 6, meaning the portal free-for-all will begin on April. 7.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The home of former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, who died in a December plane crash, was burglarized around Jan. 7-8, according to the Associated Press. The alleged burglary was reported to the Iredell County Sheriff's Office on Jan. 8, and the Mooresville, North Carolina, home was last known to be secure on the afternoon of Jan. 7.According to the report, someone allegedly forced their way into the home and stole $30,000 in cash in addition to a backpack, guns and memorabilia. No one was home when the alleged crime occurred, and no arrests have been made although police are investigating.\"We're working the case,\" said Sheriff Darren Campbell. \"We are waiting on some digital evidence.\"On Dec. 18, Biffle was among six people killed in a plane crash at nearby Statesville Regional Airport. Three of Biffle's family members -- wife Emily and children Emma and Ryder -- also died in the accident. The plane took off from the airport around 10 a.m. before returning just 15 minutes later, when it crashed while attempting to land.\nAt this time, the exact cause of the crash is unknown. Biffle and two others on board had a pilot's license, but authorities are still uncertain about which one was flying the plane that day.\"NASCAR is devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash,\" NASCAR said in a lengthy statement. \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"\nBiffle, 55, totaled 515 races in his 16-year NASCAR Cup Series career. He piled up 19 wins and 175 top-10 finishes. Biffle competed numerous times for the Cup Series championship, and his best series finish came in 2005 when he finished second behind Tony Stewart.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After more than three decades of seeing Christian Laettner's buzzer-beating game-winner in Duke's win vs. Kentucky in the 1992 Elite Eight replayed on national TV, it must have been nice for UK fans to be on the winning side of a similar play. But Malachi Moreno's turnaround jumper at the final horn was only part of the story from the Wildcats' 75-74 win at LSU on Wednesday. UK dug itself a 19-3 hole and trailed by as much as 18 in the second half before rallying to win a road tilt featuring plenty of tension for both teams.Kentucky (10-6, 2-2 SEC) would likely have fallen to First Four Out territory in CBS Sports Bracketology with a loss. Instead, the Wildcats are expected to rise from a No. 11 seed to a No. 10 seed. LSU (12-5, 0-4) needed a win to get onto the right side of the bubble and to alleviate some of the mounting pressure on fourth-year coach Matt McMahon.In a battle between desperate league foes figuring out life without injured starting point guards, it was Kentucky that found a way in the end. So how did the Wildcats surge back from their second straight abysmal start for their second straight win?\nHere's the anatomy of a comeback that may go down as a season-saver for Kentucky.Riding the star guardsKentucky coach Mark Pope rode his star guards in the second half, keeping Otega Oweh and Denzel Aberdeen on the floor for all 20 minutes as the Wildcats sought to replicate a formula that worked for them on Saturday in a 92-68 win over Mississippi State.In that win over the Bulldogs, which featured a similarly ugly start, the duo combined for 38 points, including 23 in the second half. Oweh and Aberdeen were encouragingly efficient (15 of 26 from the field) in that game. But could they stack back-to-back strong performances? Early on at LSU, the answer appeared to be a resounding no.\nOweh missed his first four shots as Kentucky got bogged down in directionless half court possessions against the Tigers. But he bounced back to finish 6 of 13 from the field and 6 of 10 from the free-throw line. Of Oweh's game-high 21 points, 15 came after halftime. All 17 of Aberdeen's points came after halftime as the duo combined to hit 5 of 7 attempts from beyond the arc.\nEven before this week's announcement from Pope that starting point guard Jaland Lowe will miss the rest of the season because of a lingering shoulder injury, the Wildcats needed more from Oweh and Aberdeen. They are finally getting it.More Williams and MorenoSix of Kentucky's 10 most-effective two-man combinations against high-major opposition entering Wednesday night involved Kam Williams. Pope must have seen the data, because he finally put the sophomore wing in the starting lineup against LSU for the first time since Dec. 5. Though he scored just five points, Williams continued to provide a critical element of floor-spacing while logging 16 minutes in the second half.\nThe Tulane transfer also provided a massive defensive lift with his steal and flush that gave Kentucky its first lead of the game with just under four minutes remaining.\nWilliams was key in lifting UK out of a slow start against Mississippi State on Saturday and continues to look like the sort of connector piece the Wildcats need to keep things moving offensively. Williams also gives Pope some lineup versatility, as he's big enough to play in a small-ball four role.Moreno has reentered the starting lineup for the past two games amid the absence of Jayden Quaintance. While the status of Quaintance, a center with potential first-round NBA Draft potential, remains an uncertainty, Moreno continues to blossom. The freshman seven-footer finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and one memorable buzzer-beater against LSU.\nThe No. 27 overall prospect from the Class of 2025 is a local product from nearby Georgetown, Kentucky, who looks like a potential long-term building block for Pope. Even if Quaintance can't consistently be part of the UK rotation, the Wildcats have a great alternative with Moreno who could factor in to the future in a way that Quaintance likely won't.Andrija Jelavic gets a startThere wasn't much underlying data to suggest that Croatian newcomer Andrija Jelavic's performance warranted a promotion to the starting lineup. But the 6-foot-11 stretch big played well in his first career start, finishing with 11 points and five rebounds. He was on the floor for 11 straight minutes to begin the second half as UK trimmed a 16-point halftime deficit to six.We'll see whether Jelavic remains a fixture in the starting lineup from here on out for Kentucky, but he was good enough against the Tigers to deserve another opportunity. His increased role has come with a price for others.\nWith Jelavic and Moreno heavily featured against LSU, Brandon Garrison logged just five minutes in the second half. One game after logging a season-low 13 minutes against Mississippi State, Mo Dioubate set another season-low with just 12 minutes. During UK's two-game SEC winning streak, the uncomfortable truth is that the Wildcats have been better with those two former starters in reduced roles. While both bring physicality in the frontcourt, neither are particularly skilled on offense.With Lowe out and Kentucky struggling to execute in half-court situations, the floor-stretching ability of Jelavic and Williams -- along with Moreno's development as a passer -- is forcing Pope to reimagine how he allots minutes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A major reinforcement could be on the way for the San Francisco 49ers defense. Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. And, shockingly, he is not ruling out availability for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.\"We're taking it day by day,\" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. \"I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.\"Warner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.\nDespite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.If Warner returns to the lineup this weekend, he would bolster a defense that seems to be rounding back into prime form. The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale. But things have not always been so bright in Warner's absence.\"I feel amazing,\" Warner said. \"Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.\"\nWhile the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if he suits up before the postseason run is over.\"Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,\" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. \"Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.\"Warner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury. If he does not play again this year, he will finish with a career-low 51 tackles, two tackles for loss and three passes defended.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        An arrest warrant has been issued for WBA lightweight champion Gervona \"Tank\" Davis. The warrant, issued by Miami Gardens Police Department, stems from an alleged domestic violence incident in October. MGPD executive officer Emmanuel Jeanty held a press conference in Florida on Wednesday. The police department is working with the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force to locate Davis. The warrant was issued on charges including attempted kidnapping, battery and false imprisonment.\"At this time, the Miami Gardens Police Department is actively working  with the United States Marshal's fugitive task force to locate and  apprehend Mr. Davis,\" Jeanty said. \"Domestic violence is a serious  crime, and the Miami Gardens Police Department remains committed to  holding offenders accountable and protecting victims.\" A planned exhibition fight between Davis and Jake Paul was canceled after Courtney Rossel, Davis' ex and the mother of his children, filed a domestic violence lawsuit against him. The lawsuit, acquired by ESPN, claims that Davis attacked Rossel at a gentlemen's club in Miami Gardens on Oct. 27. Police corroborated Rossel's story after reviewing surveillance footage.\n\"The investigation determined that Mr. Davis used force to restrain in  an attempt to remove the victim from the location against her will,\"  Jeanty said in the MGPD briefing.  \"What the police said is exactly in line with our lawsuit,\" Jeff Chukwuma, Rossel's attorney, told  ESPN. \"So whatever  investigation they did, they determined it was enough to get a judge to  sign off on an arrest warrant. The state attorney had to make the determination before, which  coincides exactly with our civil complaint.\" \nDavis has a history of legal issues. 'Tank' was sentenced to a 90-day house arrest and three years of probation for a 2023 hit-and-run case in Baltimore. In August, a separate domestic violence charge against Davis was dropped.\n            \n    ",

UFC 324 takes over Las Vegas with a headline-grabbing main event: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim lightweight title. It all goes down from the T-Mobile Arena as the first numbered event of 2026.UFC CEO Dana White's announcement of the card during halftime of the Cowboys vs. Chiefs on Thanksgiving garnered widespread attention. Gaethje and Pimblett have been campaigning for a lightweight title shot. In the aftermath of 155-pound champion Ilia Topuria announcing he'd step away to deal with personal matters, Gaethje and Pimblett will fight for the interim title.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April. Gaethje represents by far the biggest test of Pimblett's young career.\nThe rest of the main card is loaded with interesting and important matchups within each division. The co-main event sees former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley look to get back on track -- and hold his position in the division -- when he takes on rising contender Song Yadong. Plus, powerful heavyweights are set to collide when veteran and fan favorite Derrick Lewis returns to take on fast rising contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta. Former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas also looks to hold on to her position in the women's flyweight division when she takes on Natalia Silva. And the opening fight on the main card is sure to produce fireworks when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight.Subscribe to Paramount+ now to get access to the UFC fight library and get ready for UFC 324\n        \n            \n                UFC Fan Guide: A playlist of some of the most exciting fights in history to get ready for the Paramount+ era\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is the complete fight card for UFC 324, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\nIn a span of just over 12 months, Bo Nix went from guiding Oregon to a 45-6 victory against Liberty in the Fiesta Bowl to helping lead the Denver Broncos to their first playoff appearance in nine years. Things didn't go well for Nix against the Buffalo Bills in his NFL postseason debut, but he and the Broncos have an opportunity to even the score this weekend.The top-seeded Broncos look to avenge last year's defeat and record their first playoff victory since winning Super Bowl 50 when they host the No. 6 Bills in the AFC Divisional Round at 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday at Empower Field.Selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Nix had an impressive rookie season under head coach Sean Payton, throwing for 3,775 yards and 29 touchdowns as Denver posted a 10-7 record -- its first winning mark since going 9-7 in 2016. The Broncos were thoroughly defeated in the Wild Card Round by the Bills, however, losing 31-7 as they scored less than 2 1/2 minutes into the game but were blanked the rest of the way while Nix completed just 13-of-22 pass attempts for 144 yards and a TD.Denver went 14-3 this campaign, ending the Kansas City Chiefs' nine-year reign atop the AFC West while earning the No. 1 seed in the conference and a first-round bye. The Bills posted a 12-5 record but had their streak of five consecutive AFC East titles snapped and were resigned to playing on the road for as long as it remained the postseason. They began with a 27-24 wild-card triumph over the Jacksonville Jaguars as Josh Allen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game with 1:04 remaining in the fourth quarter to erase a four-point deficit and help Buffalo advance.Despite being the top seed in the conference, Denver is not one of the favorites at DraftKings to win Super Bowl LX. The Broncos are fifth overall and third in the AFC to capture the Lombardi Trophy with odds of +700, while Buffalo is just ahead of them at +650.The Broncos are 1.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 45.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Buffalo vs. Denver in the Divisional Round.Here is a look at the Bills vs. Broncos matchup from a betting perspective.Bills vs. Broncos odds\nOpening spread: Bills -1.5Opening money line: Bills -122, Broncos +102Opening total: 46.5The Bills opened as 1.5-point favorites at DraftKings but now are 1.5-point underdogs. In addition to there being heavy play on the Broncos in the early going, the swing likely has something to do with Buffalo's thin receiving corps, which lost Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers for the remainder of the postseason in last weekend's wild-card victory at Jacksonville as both wideouts suffered a torn ACL. That leaves the team with only three healthy wide receivers, although Curtis Samuel (elbow) could be activated from injured reserve as he has been practicing this week. Samuel hasn't played since Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but had a 55-yard touchdown reception in Buffalo's rout of Denver last postseason.Bills betting profile\nOpening win total: 11.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 9-9 (including playoffs)O/U record: 9-9 (including playoffs)The Bills initially were 1.5-point favorites against the Jaguars last week before several major sportsbooks were compelled to flip the spread. Either way, they covered as they ended their eight-game road losing streak in the postseason with their first such win since 1992.Buffalo is 8-1 against the spread in its last nine meetings with the Broncos. The Bills were 7.5-point favorites at home in last year's wild card matchup and cruised to a 24-point victory as Allen threw a pair of touchdown passes while James Cook ran for 120 yards and a score.However, the Bills have been on the road seven previous times in the Divisional Round since 1970 and covered only once, rolling past the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-3 as 1.5-point underdogs in 1992. Most recently, they were getting 2.5 points in 2021 but lost 42-36 in overtime at Kansas City.Including last year's playoff showdown, Buffalo has won six of the last eight meetings between the teams. Two of those victories occurred in Denver, where the Bills posted a 30-23 triumph in 2008 and routed the Broncos 48-19 in 2020 as Allen threw for 359 yards and two TDs while also running for a pair of scores.Broncos betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 7-10 O/U record: 7-10The Broncos have had difficulty covering the spread of late, doing so only twice in their last six contests. One of those covers came when they were 1.5-point underdogs against the Green Bay Packers in Week 15, when they posted a 34-26 victory at home.Denver was just 5-4 against the spread at Empower Field during the regular season and went 3-9 ATS as the favorite. The Broncos failed to cover in each of their last five Divisional Round appearances, going 0-4 ATS in the first four before pushing as 7-point favorites against the Steelers in 2015 with a 23-16 victory.Bills-Broncos prop pick: Josh Allen anytime TD scorer (-120)\nThe Broncos were fourth in the NFL during the regular season with only 11 rushing touchdowns allowed. But Allen was third in the league with 14 TD runs, which was more than the entire total of 11 teams and nearly three-times as many as the Las Vegas Raiders (five). The reigning NFL MVP ran for multiple scores five times during the regular season and had a pair of rushing touchdowns against the Jaguars last weekend. Allen made his way to the end zone in two of his last three meetings with the Broncos and five of his past seven playoff games. Since Cook hasn't had a TD run in his last two full contests and Ty Johnson may miss his second straight game due to an ankle injury, I expect the Bills to call Allen's number when they get close to the goal line. I also expect Allen to be successful in his attempt to score at least once. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Alvaro Arbeloa era at Real Madrid has gotten off to a rocky start with the club getting knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the hands of second-tier Albacete 3-2 on Wednesday. Mired currently in LaLiga 2, Albacete are closer to being relegated than they are in pushing for a place in LaLiga, but cup matches can be the great equalizer in soccer. Real Madrid were without Kylian Mbappe in the squad, as he has been dealing with a knee injury, and there was rotation everywhere, but it was Albacete who struck first with Javi Villar scoring in the first half. Franco Mastantuono equalized before halftime, but at no point did Real Madrid seem comfortable away from home. The match would be a deadlock until the 80th minute, with Real Madrid regulars such as Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Carvajal entering the match, but by then, Albacete felt the belief, with substitute forward Jefte Betancor scoring. \nLos Blancos equalized again via Gonzalo Garcia in stoppage time, but yet again, Bentancor struck back to ensure that this match wouldn't go into extra time. With the Real Madrid job being Arbeola's first foray into top flight managment, this match was an important test for a side with sky-high ambitions, and it's one that he fell flat in. In a match like this, even if Madrid don't have their preferred starting XI available, they're expected to emerge with a victory, and instead, despite having 78% of possession, Madrid allowed three goals from only five shots on target.\nAfter falling to Barcelona in the Supercopa de España and moving on from Xabi Alonso as the manager of the club, things need to turn around sooner rather than later for Real Madrid as they're four points behind Barcelona for the LaLiga lead while also still being alive in Champions League play. But for Albacete, this is a moment to celebrate.Who are Albacete?Founded in 1939, this is a team that hasn't been in La Liga since the 2004-05 season. They've been mainstays in the second division, only rarely threatening to make the playoffs for a shot at the top flight, and this season is no different, with the club sitting in 17th place. There is an American on the books in left back Jonathan Gomez, who has been bouncing around Spain since leaving Louisville City FC in 2021, and he came on in the second half as a substitute to help bring fresh legs to the match. He has been far from a regular starter for the club but has still made 20 appearances this season. A club with no notable top-flight trophies, this is a night that will go down in history in Albacete as they now have a place in the Copa Del Rey quarterfinals, and who knows, they could go further and win the whole thing.\nMore worries for Real MadridOn one hand, Arbeloa's inexperience can be looked past due to being a former Real Madrid player, but starting off management on this foot couldn't bring more pressure onto the new Real Madrid manager. A weekend match with Levante would seem like a bounce-back moment for Los Blancos, especially with them being at home at the Santiago Bernabeu, but after losing this match, it's hard to have confidence in what Real Madrid will do. After that, the difficulty level only picks up, closing out January with Champions League matches against Monaco and Benfica (live on Paramount+), along with a LaLiga match against Villarreal. Dropping more points will only make it harder to claw back space in LaLiga before the next Clasico with Barcelona in May, but to even have that chance, Arbeloa will need to establish his style on the squad sooner rather than later. Alonso only lasted seven months on the job, and if things spiral more, there's a real possibility that Real Madrid could see three managers in one season as time waits for no one at the club.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just eight teams remain in the NFL playoffs, and bids to advance to Championship Sunday are on the line this weekend during the divisional round. The league is coming off a wild Wild Card Weekend, where a bulk of the games came down to the final moments. That's shaping these playoffs into one of the most memorable runs to the Super Bowl in recent memory, so this upcoming divisional round has a lot to live up to.As much as we'd like to focus solely on the games themselves and the individual matchups that'll help determine who advances and who goes home, we also have to keep an eye on injuries. For as entertaining as Wild Card Weekend was, there were several notable injuries. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the year due to a torn Achilles, while Texans receiver Nico Collins and Patriots corner Christian Gonzalez each departed their matchups with concussions.With teams getting back onto the practice field this week to gear up for the upcoming playoff slate, we'll take the temperature of those injuries and more by dissecting the injury reports.Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)\nBills: After conducting a walkthrough practice on Tuesday that saw Josh Allen listed as a limited participant, Buffalo's Wednesday injury report saw the quarterback improve to a full participant. Allen is listed with foot, knee and right finger injuries. \nMeanwhile, three Bills players were missing on Wednesday: cornerback Maxwell Hairston (ankle), safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) and receiver Tyrell Shavers (knee). Shavers is out for the year with a torn ACL. Linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf), defensive end A.J. Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf), linebacker Matt Milano (ankle), defensive tackle Ed Oliver (biceps), defensive end Greg Rousseau (back) and linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck) were limited.Broncos: Denver's injury report on Wednesday mirrored its initial report of the week. Linebackers Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) and Drew Sanders (ankle), along with tight end Lucas Krull (foot), were limited. Defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers was listed with a hip injury but practiced fully.San Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\n49ers: One of the more fascinating developments for the 49ers is the looming return of linebacker Fred Warner. He returned to practice last week as he works his way back from an ankle injury he suffered in October. San Francisco listed Warner as a limited participant for the second day in a row, so it does seem like a return this week is in play. Joining Warner as a limited participant were defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), guard Dominick Puni (ankle), defensive end Keion White (groin, hamstring), and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle). Safety Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) and linebacker Luke Gifford (quad) did not practice. \nSeahawks: Seattle offensive tackle Charles Cross (hamstring, knee) was downgraded from a full participant on Tuesday to limited on Wednesday, so his status will be worth monitoring the rest of the week. Along with Cross, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and corner Tariq Woolen (oblique) were limited. Linebacker Ernest Jones did not practice on Wednesday due to an illness. Houston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN, ABC | Fubo, try for free)\nTexans: Houston did not have standout receiver Nico Collins to begin the week of practice on Wednesday. He left Monday's win over the Steelers with a concussion. The Texans also listed defensive end Denico Autry (knee), offensive tackle Trent Brown (ankle) and receiver Justin Watson (concussion) as nonparticipants. Linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (knee), offensive lineman Tytus Howard (ankle), guard Ed Ingram (ankle), running back Jawhar Jordan (ankle), corner Kamari Lassiter (ankle, knee) and defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (elbow) were limited.\nPatriots: Christian Gonzalez left New England's wild card victory over the Chargers with a concussion, but the star corner was out at practice on Wednesday, albeit on a limited basis. Along with Gonzalez, tight end Hunter Henry (knee), linebacker Anfernee Jennings (knee), running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and defensive lineman Khyiris Tonga (foot) were limited. Offensive tackles Morgan Moses (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) were held out of the week's opening session.Los Angeles Rams at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\nRams: Corner Darious Williams was the lone Ram missing from practice on Wednesday, with the team noting his absence was not injury related. Offensive lineman Kevin Dotson (ankle) and nose tackle Poona Ford (elbow) were limited. Meanwhile, Matthew Stafford, who appeared to have injured his throwing hand during the playoff win over Carolina, was listed with a right finger injury on the initial report, but practiced fully. \nBears: Chicago held a walkthrough on Wednesday, so the initial injury report is an estimate had the team gone through a full practice. With that said, the club listed defensive back Nick McCloud as the lone player not participating due to a groin injury. Receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Rome Odunze (foot) were limited, along with linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin (back).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the Seattle Seahawks take the field on Thursday night, the team will be wearing a new uniform that it has never worn before in franchise history. The uniform was actually unveiled back in August as part of the NFL's \"Rivalries\" program, but the Seahawks haven't gotten a chance to wear it just yet. There were a total of eight teams that got a new \"Rivalries\" uniform this year and the Seahawks will be the seventh one to debut their new look. The plan behind the \"Rivalries\" program was to design a uniform based on a theme that's local to each team. The Seahawks decided to honor their fans by by incorporating the \"12s\" into their uniform. Let's check it out: \nThe tiny marks in the shoulder area are sound waves, which were put there to \"represent the noise and reverberation of the 12s.\" The sound wave pattern is also used on the pant leg instead of a stripe. On top of that, every player has a patch with the No. 12 on the back of their neck line. \n\n        \n            \n                Rams vs. Seahawks prediction: Can Los Angeles tighten its grip on NFC West and No. 1 seed?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne unique thing about the uniform is that the numbers are an Iridescent green color that changes depending on the lighting. This is the first time in NFL history that a team has incorporated the unique iridescent material into their uniform. The numbers are also embedded with dozens of tiny 12s to once again honor the 12s in Seattle. \nThe Seahawks are wearing the uniforms for the first time ever in their showdown against the Rams, which kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime.And now, let's take a closer look at the helmet. \nThe helmet, which has a metallic chrome finish, has an iridescent green base just like the jersey numbers, so the helmet will appear to change color slightly depending on the lighting. \nThe Rams unveiled their \"Rivalries\" uniform back in Week 11 in a win over the Seahawks, and now, Seattle will be looking to return the favor. The Seahawks are one of eight teams that will be participating in the \"Rivalries\" program this year,  but eventually, the program will expand to all 32 teams. Over the next four seasons, one NFC division and one AFC division per year will get to debut a new \"Rivalries\" uniform, so not every team got a new uniform this year. \nHere's when each division will be getting their \"Rivalries\" uniform: 2025: AFC East and NFC West (See all the 2025 uniforms here)2026: AFC South and NFC North2027: AFC West and NFC East2028: AFC North and NFC SouthAfter the Seahawks wear their new uniform on Thursday night, we'll be getting one more \"Rivalries\" game and that will come in Week 18 when the San Francisco 49ers show off their new look. Here's the the full \"Rivalries\" schedule for 2025 (The team listed first is the \"Rivalries\" uniform team):Week 4: Cardinals vs. Seahawks (See the uniform here)Week 4: Dolphins vs. Jets (See the uniform here)Week 5: Bills vs. Patriots (See the uniform here)Week 11: Patriots vs. Jets (See the uniform here)Week 11: Rams vs. Seahawks (See the uniform here)Week 14: Jets vs. Dolphins (See the uniform here)Week 16: Seahawks vs. Rams (Thursday, Dec. 18)Week 18: 49ers vs. Seahawks (Jan. 3 or Jan. 4)The NFL approved a new rule in April that will allow each team to wear an alternate uniform in four different games, which is up from three. That means that any team with multiple alternate or throwback uniforms will now have an extra opportunity to wear those during the regular season. The \"Rivalries\" uniforms will only be worn once this season by each team. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's an all-SEC showdown in the first round of the College Football Playoff as No. 9 Alabama travels to play No. 8 Oklahoma on Friday night. These two programs have become familiar foes since Oklahoma's move to the SEC ahead of the 2024 season. The Sooners are 2-0 against the Crimson Tide in that span, including a 23-21 triumph this season that solidified Oklahoma's status as a legitimate playoff team. Oklahoma also knocked Alabama out of playoff contention last season when it pulled off a 24-3 upset of the Crimson Tide. This will be Oklahoma's first playoff appearance since 2019. The Sooners, who won just six games in 2024, turned things around with a 10-2 record in 2025 to earn their spot on college football's biggest stage. Alabama, meanwhile, is making its first playoff appearance under coach Kalen DeBoer, who is no stranger to the CFP; he led Washington to the national title game in 2023 before departing Seattle to succeed legendary Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban. \nWhere to watch Alabama vs. Oklahoma liveDate: Friday, Dec. 19 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Oklahoma: Players to watchTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Alabama needs Simpson to be at his best, and he's been far from it since Alabama's first loss to Oklahoma. In the Crimson Tide's last four games, Simpson tossed five touchdowns to four interceptions. He's averaging 201.8 yards per contest in that span with two games under 200 yards passing. His completion percentage also dipped below 50% for the first time all season in Alabama's SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia. Simpson once looked like a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender, so the potential for a resurgence is there. Germie Bernard, WR, Alabama: Having a weapon like Bernard could help Simpson get back on track. Ryan Williams gets most of the attention after a breakout true freshman campaign, but Bernard is Alabama's best playmaker. He's a YAC monster that leads the Crimson Tide with 57 catches for 762 yards and seven touchdowns. Bernard is also the ideal safety valve for an ailing offense. The coaching staff likes to get him involved in multiple ways, be it as a route runner or on jet sweeps, so defenses have to account for that versatility. \nBray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has emerged as one of the nation's premier ball-hawking safeties while anchoring Alabama's defensive backfield. The junior defensive back was an All-SEC First Team selection after tying for the conference lead with four interceptions. He is also the only player in the SEC with at least five pass deflections and four interceptions. Oh, and don't discount the three fumbles that Hubbard has forced. It's rare that one player creates that much havoc. Isaiah Sategna III, WR, Oklahoma: If there is one player that Alabama needs to have circled, highlighted and underlined on its defensive gameplan, it's Sategna. He is the engine behind Oklahoma's offense, and he's also one of the best big-play threats in college football. Sategna finished the regular season with 65 catches for 948 yards and seven touchdowns. His 14.6 yards per catch ranked second among SEC receivers with at least 60 receptions on the year. R Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma: Thomas' status is worth monitoring. He missed three games in November due to a quad injury, and his playoff outlook is up in the air. Even with the lost time, he was still an All-SEC selection after logging 6.5 sacks and 9.5 tackles for loss. He's a game-wrecking talent and Oklahoma's defense is obviously significantly better with him out there. \nTaylor Wein, EDGE, Oklahoma: Regardless of whether Thomas is unable to go, Wein has earned his spot on Oklahoma's defense. He stepped up in a major way in the wake of Thomas' injury and emerged as one of the SEC's most effective pass rushers down the stretch. He had 2.5 sacks and three tackles for loss in Oklahoma's last three games, and he had seven pressures in key victories against Alabama and Missouri. Alabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nWe've already seen this movie before. Oklahoma went on the road and beat Alabama in the regular season. The Sooners seem like a matchup nightmare for a Crimson Tide offense that has plummeted off a cliff since the start of November. Playing in a hostile environment certainly won't help Alabama. Alabama also has a solid defense, but Oklahoma has a key edge: the Sooners are great at forcing timely turnovers and producing points in multiple ways. Oklahoma consistently sets its offense up in ideal positions. The Sooners should be able to win pretty comfortably here. Pick: Oklahoma -1.5 (-105) \n            ",

    "body": "\nWe again saw a decent amount of line movement this past week, and only some of it tied to injuries to players such as Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons. As we've talked about in the past, the 1.5-point line is the one most ripe for movement. The Rams-Seahawks game on Thursday, for example, flipped from Seahawks -1.5 on the lookahead to Rams -1.5 early in the week before coming back to Seahawks -1.5 on gameday.Other 1.5-point lines have also shifted off that number, with the Buccaneers and Vikings growing to three-point favorites and the Bengals going even further following the benching of Tua Tagovailoa by the Dolphins. The Cardinals, on the other hand, shifted from 1.5-point favorites to 2.5-point underdogs in one of the biggest non-injury adjustments of the week.What line moves can we predict this week? Let's take a look at the Week 17 lookahead lines at DraftKings and then share our best bets to lock in early.Week 17 lookahead linesCowboys (-3) at Commanders, 52.5Lions (-3.5) at Vikings, 48.5Broncos (-5.5) at Chiefs, 39.5Texans (-1.5) at Chargers, 39.5Ravens at Packers (-3), 46.5Patriots (-9.5) at Jets, 44.5Seahawks (-7.5) at Panthers, 42.5Steelers (-3.5) at Browns, 35.5Jaguars (-5.5) at Colts, 44.5Saints (-1.5) at Titans, 39.5Cardinals at Bengals (-5.5), 51.5Giants (-3) at Raiders, 43.5Eagles at Bills (-3), 46.5Bears at 49ers (-3), 50.5Rams (-8.5) at Falcons, 48.5Week 17 lookahead picksSaints at Titans\nWe're starting out with the most-likely-to-move spread at 1.5, and I'm going with the team catching the points here. The Saints have won two straight and host an awful Jets team as moderate favorites, but are they a team people will be willing to back on the road in an outdoor environment? Plus, the Titans have the chance to make a major statement by upsetting a Chiefs team that doesn't have Patrick Mahomes, and they've trended toward increased scoring in recent weeks against notable defenses like Seattle, Cleveland and San Francisco. I'm predicting the Titans will reopen as favorites here.Eagles at Bills\nThe Eagles are coming off a dominant win, but it came against the league's worst team. A win on Saturday against the Commanders could lock up the division, and then there will come a question of whether the team considers resting some key players or pushes to try and win the No. 1 seed, which is going to take a lot of help as they're going to be two back of whichever team wins on Thursday if they beat the Commanders. If they somehow lose to Washington but the Cowboys lose to the Chargers, Philly is out of the running for the top seed. I would make the Bills more than three-point favorites even without the potential rest factor, so any value that scenario can add is a bonus.Patriots at Jets\nLast week, I thought the Browns were decent value hosting the Bills as 8.5-point 'dogs, but after the Bills won a close game and the Browns looked terrible, the line moved up to 10. This feels like a similar situation, though I'd say the Jets are well behind the Browns, in my opinion, considering they don't have nearly the upside on defense. The Pats play on Sunday night, so the initial move upon rerelease will only reflect how the Jets look against the Saints, but with it seeming like it'll be Brady Cook under center again, I don't like their chances to impress.Other notes: Texans-Chargers is another 1.5-point line with Houston favored, but I think that's about the right number and both teams should continue to have playoff motivation, so I didn't want to include it in the pick set above. I'd lean toward backing the Texans and expecting their edge in the trenches when L.A. has the ball to win out. ... If the Panthers come out and upset the Bucs at home, I could see them closing on the other side of seven after the Seahawks opened as 7.5-point favorites. I can't see Seattle moving higher than that even with a win on Thursday, so this feels like a situation with more upside to play the 'dog.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Four 2025-26 college football bowl games in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP first round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane, with both games taking place on Saturday, Dec. 20. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, as Michael Van Buren Jr. will make the start. Those four TDs are the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-3.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio.

    "body": "\n        Blue Jays manager John Schneider still hasn't processed the World Series. Not when his club came two outs from its first title in more than 25 years and instead opened the door for what has arguably become a Dodgers dynasty. He had just started to unpack Game 7 when Miguel Rojas gave the Dodgers a jolt with his game-tying homer in the ninth off closer Jeff Hoffman. Schneider still hasn't watched everything. He can't. Every time he goes down one rabbit hole of what could have been, of what might have lifted his team to a title, another one appears. So he does his best to stay away.\"I think I'll think about it until the day I leave this earth,\" Schneider said last week in Orlando at MLB's Winter Meetings.There's no guarantee Toronto will make it back to the pinnacle of baseball. The sport doesn't work like that. Only the Dodgers seem able to snap their fingers and make a World Series run every season. For everyone else, it takes luck, health and timing. The team that gets hot has a chance.\nFor Toronto, that pain of loss remains. Yet so does the perspective it created. There has been a different tenor surrounding the Blue Jays that has rung throughout baseball. Players noticed. Executives and agents, too. And Schneider as well. \"You can see it swinging to the other end of not just, wow, you guys have some cool stuff and some bells and whistles and you've won,\" Schneider said. \"I think you can kind of see it going to people kind of seeking you out a little bit. The resources and the finances obviously help, and I think that word spreads.\" \nAdded agent Scott Boras: \"When organizations find that myopic direction, you can kind of tell they're very close to achieving something that's taken years to get to. They know that their questions are few and their answers are many.\" The Blue Jays capitalized early this offseason, signing starter Dylan Cease to a seven-year, $210 million deal. Though viewed as an overpay by some, it set the tone for a club with money to spend and its sights set on another October run.Cease affirmed what the world had thought once the lights shut off for the final time at the Rogers Centre following Game 7. \n\"The biggest part really was being able to be a part of a championship team,\" Cease said. \"Obviously with the run last year, they've proven that they have championship-caliber players and obviously a good process. That was probably the number one thing.And then from there, it was also how they would help me maximize and develop and basically reach my potential more often.\" Don't expect the Blue Jays to stop with Cease. That would run counter to what they have built. The club has been, and remains, connected to free agent Kyle Tucker, the most coveted player on the market and one entering his age-29 season. Tucker would slot in as Toronto's right fielder for years to come. Interest has been mutual, and the fit would be natural, giving the Blue Jays a longer runway toward sustained contention.\nThen there is Bo Bichette, the homegrown talent who still has a chance to return north of the border. Bichette has told teams he would be open to a move to second base, sliding off shortstop if needed, a flexibility that would address a need for the Blue Jays.Some months ago, it felt likely that Bichette would leave Toronto. Now, that might not the case. And all that was made possible about the run they had and more importantly? Their culture. \"Having an elite culture that guys can be brought into, I think resonates with the players,\" Schneider said. \"You can definitely feel a difference this off-season going back to last year and the year before.\" \nIt's a group crafted meticulously by its homegrown stars. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is the blueprint.  A player who has blended superstardom with an embrace of a country that, like most, was not originally his. His tears, both in victory and defeat during the club's run last season, were palpable.\"We tried to build the best organization we can, of course,\" said Ryan Mittleman, the Blue Jays' vice president of player personnel. \"I think generally around the league people thought we were building really good teams. I think with the organization we've built and the way we played, it's amplified our profile. But I don't think you're ever feeling like your chest is out. Especially not in the American League East. We don't feel like these teams are going to hand it over to us.\" The AL East should be better this year, at least at the top. Gerrit Cole is expected to return, giving the Yankees one of the best rotations in baseball. Baltimore has also pushed itself back into the conversation after a down 2025, adding Pete Alonso to what should be one of the league's most dangerous lineups.\nTitles are hard to predict. The Yankees have been chasing one since 2009. The Orioles since 1983. The Red Sox still appear stuck between directions, or perhaps settled into one they cannot escape spearheaded by an owner who guards his pockets. And the Rays, long the model for consistency and efficiency, seem to have lost some of the edge that once defined them.Winning is arduous. Championships are even harder. But the Blue Jays believe they have something to build on. A franchise that has established its footing as one of the game's greats. Schneider walks around differently now. So often at the Winter Meetings he was stopped. Sometimes congratulated. Other times by those that wanted to rub shoulders with him delivering their elevator speeches.The rabbit holes Schneider dug are painful to visit. Hurtful to fathom. The World Series loss still lingers. Yet what has changed is how the Blue Jays are positioned because of it.\n            ",

    "body": "\nJaxon Smith-Njigba is having a historic season for the Seattle Seahawks, and he'll be a focal point in arguably the biggest game in the NFC West this season when they host the Los Angeles Rams for Thursday Night Football. First place in the division will be on the line, and Smith-Njigba had nine catches for 105 yards in Seattle's first meeting with Los Angeles, but failed to get into the endzone in a 21-19 defeat. However, he's scored at least once in seven of his last 11 games, and he's priced at +115 in the latest Seahawks vs. Rams anytime touchdown scorer odds from DraftKings. That's why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top TNF anytime TD scorer picks. Smith-Njigba's over/under for total receiving yards against the Rams is 88.5.\nTargeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 16. With NFL props available for almost every player in Rams vs. Seahawks at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Seattle vs. Los Angeles NFL picks. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Seahawks vs. Rams.Best Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Blake Corum, Rams (+240)\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (+115)In addition to having a fighting chance of breaking Calvin Johnson's record for receiving yards in a single season (1,964), Smith-Njigba leads Seattle with nine touchdowns this year. Despite only playing in 74.8% of Seattle's offensive sets this season (44th among qualifying WRs), Smith-Njigba leads the NFL with a 35.0% target share, and his 23 deep targets (20 yards or more) also leads the league. The model predicts that he scores 0.54 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 46.5% chance to find the endzone.\nZach Charbonnet, Seahawks (+170)Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker III continue to split time in the Seattle backfield, and Walker has probably been the more efficient Seahawks running back this season. However, Charbonnet has been the preferred goal-to-go option and has scored seven of his eight touchdowns on the year from inside the 10-yard line. He's scored in seven of Seattle's 13 games this season, so finding significantly plus-money odds here is a potential boon. The model predicts 0.48 TDs on average, while the odds imply a 37% chance to score.\nBlake Corum, Rams (+240)Kyren Williams is still one of the most effective running backs in the NFL, but Blake Corum has forced his way into a more meaningful role in Sean McVay's offense. He's carried the ball 30 times for 280 yards and four touchdowns in his last three games and his snap share rose to a season-high 45.8% last week against the Lions. Corum has even pilfered some of the goal-to-go work that Williams has dominated this season, scoring three short-yardage touchdowns and five overall. The model predicts 0.30 touchdowns on average, while the odds suggest a 29.4% chance to score.\nWant more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Rams vs. Seahawks.

    "body": "\n        Context matters for every situation, but one fallacy that's starting to fall by the wayside is the notion that you can't win with freshmen in this era of college basketball.That's simply untrue.They just have to be the right freshmen. Making the right roster-building moves on the margin are essential to maximizing a team with a freshman as the fulcrum, but this class of diaper dandies has been awesome through the first six weeks of the season. There are 101 freshmen averaging north of 10 points, an even more impressive feat in an ecosystem that features tons of NBA-level talent returning to college to cash in on lucrative NIL deals.It won't be easy, but there is a very real chance that a team with a freshman as its best player could win the national championship. That hasn't happened since 2015 Duke and it speaks to the heavy hitters in this freshman class who have flexed their muscles early.Let's dive into the early impressions from each of the top 10-rated 2025 recruiting hauls, according to 247Sports.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 1 DukeCameron Boozer is everything you could want and then some. The five-star forward has been the engine fueling Duke's 11-0 start. He is the rightful favorite for National Player of the Year, posting video-game-like numbers.Which counting stat is your favorite? Boozer is averaging 23.3 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists while shooting 35% from 3-point range and 68% at the rim. Oh, and he owns a 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, even after a six-turnover aberration against Lipscomb.Maybe more importantly, Boozer has given Duke's coaching staff peace of mind that in big moments, he will create a terrific shot for himself or others. Boozer is Duke's fearless closer, and the stats back it up. He's shooting 5-for-10 from the floor with four assists and just one turnover in 15 minutes of clutch time (score within five points in the final five minutes), per CBB Analytics. Last year's late-game offensive woes that hurt Duke early and ended its season in the Final Four may not be as much of a hot-button topic because of Boozer's brilliance.\nThe rest of Duke's glitzy recruiting class hasn't produced a star, but that was to be expected. Nik Khamenia's 3's and rebounding will help Duke become the best version of itself. Dame Sarr is an excellent defender, who looks shot out of a cannon in transition, but there have been some growing pains offensively as he works through the hitch in his jumper. Cayden Boozer has not been a better option at PG1 than Caleb Foster, but he has multiple dimes in nine of 11 games as a second-unit floor general. It is what it is. Duke gets a high mark because it has one freshman superstar and a few specialists who could grow into so much more. Grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    No. 2 ArizonaTommy Lloyd made a bet last spring that Koa Peat and Brayden Burries would be better than anyone Arizona could realistically land in the transfer portal.\nThrough 10 games, Lloyd's wager has proved wise.Peat (14.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists) and Burries (13.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.3 assists) have started every game for the Wildcats. Arizona didn't need Peat and Burries to be the saviors, but they give the Wildcats an influx of next-level juice that every championship hopeful needs. Peat's physicality transforms Arizona's front line into a total battering ram. Burries has been humming lately after a bit of a slow start, providing a barrage of jumpers that serve as the hot sauce on top of the paint dominance that Arizona brings to the table every night.But Burries and Peat aren't alone. Ivan Kharchenkov, a German product, has earned a spot in the starting lineup with his ability to pass, dribble, shoot, defend and rebound. He does a little bit of everything, and Dwayne Aristode is another jumbo shooter that has become a real piece of this rotation.Four freshmen becoming trustworthy rotation players? In this economy? Lloyd might be good at this. Early grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 3 HoustonKingston Flemings is a blast of rocket fuel for this Houston attack. The 6-4 freshman guard has been a phenomenal paint-touch machine for this Houston offense, which allows Milos Uzan and Emanuel Sharp to play off the ball and attack the advantages Flemings generates. Flemings has soared into the lottery mix for good reason, and he's been Kelvin Sampson's second-best player through the first 11 games.But Houston does not look like Houston yet, especially with all the scouting report mistakes that pop up defensively. Five-star freshman big man Chris Cenac has tools that you can't teach, but he's been Houston's worst defender by a wide margin. Fellow prized freshman Isiah Harwell has also had a bit of a slow ramp-up period. Part of that is the depth chart (good luck playing over Sharp and Uzan), but it feels like only a matter of time until the 6-6, 220-pound freshman asserts himself as the no-doubt, fourth-best guard on this roster.Overall, it's been a bit of a mixed bag for Houston's best recruiting class in school history, but there's a sky-high upside with this group once Cenac and Harwell find their stride. Grade: B\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 4 ArkansasDarius Acuff and Meleek Thomas give Arkansas a mix of thunder and lightning. Acuff's big-boy drives are the thunder. Thomas' slippery heaters are the lightning. Together, they've combined for 33 points, 7.1 rebounds and 9.5 assists a night. They've comfortably transformed into two of Arkansas' best three players, and even though they do not start together, John Calipari always has Thomas and Acuff on the floor to close games. Why? Because they play clean basketball. Acuff has a 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, and Thomas has coughed it up just 11 times this season. They've been exceptional at taking care of it, and Arkansas may need to consider ramping up its pick-and-roll rate offensively because good things keep happening when Acuff and Thomas put weak defenders into the action. Acuff, specifically, is dousing the overblown concerns that he is a ball-stopping, \"after me, you come first\" guard. Acuff is the leader in the pack for SEC Freshman of the Year, and Thomas should join him on the All-SEC Freshman team. They've been terrific. Grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 5 North CarolinaCaleb Wilson waltzes onto the floor trying to put defenders on a poster. The power, athleticism, effort, joy and IQ that he brings to the game has been a breath of fresh air for North Carolina basketball.It's not always pretty, but Wilson is a walking double-double who makes this UNC defense hum. The Tar Heels have a top-five defense in America when Wilson is on the floor, holding opponents to a meager 89.9 offensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions), according to Hoop Explorer.Wilson is the face of the program, but fellow freshman Derek Dixon has been a welcome addition. The 6-5 guard delivered some enormous buckets in the final minutes to help UNC knock off Kentucky on the road. He's shooting over 46% from downtown and looks like a safe bet to stay in this rotation even when Seth Trimble returns because of his ability to knock down open shots and steady defense. He pestered Georgetown star point guard Malik Mack into a 3-for-17 showing in UNC's 20-point romp over the Hoyas.\nYou can't ask for anything more from these UNC freshmen. Grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    No. 6 SMUSMU has not gotten a ton from its freshmen so far. The Mustangs are 9-2 largely thanks to their three senior guards: Boopie Miller, Jaron Pierre and BJ Edwards. But don't be surprised if Jaden Toombs becomes a massive piece for SMU in the thick of ACC play. The freshman big man was sidelined with a wrist injury for the first month. He's still working out the kinks, but he made a strong impression with a 16-point showing in Saturday's loss to LSU. I'd expect SMU to start uncorking a heavy diet of double-big lineups, featuring Samet Yigitoglu and Toombs in the not-so-distant future. Grade: C\n    \n                                        \n    No. 7 KentuckyIt's been far from perfect, but Malachi Moreno has brought more good than bad to the floor for Kentucky. The Wildcats' rim protection has been much better when the 7-footer is on the floor, and he is the best passing 5-man on the roster. It'll be fascinating to see how Mark Pope adjusts Moreno's minutes when Jayden Quaintance is back in the fold. I think playing them together in some matchups could firmly be on the table, but TBD on that front.\nThe Jasper Johnson situation does not appear to be close to being rectified yet. The fearless lefty is unafraid and can be a second-unit bucket-getter, but it's been choppy in the early going. Johnson's erratic shot selection has not helped his case for more minutes. He is shooting 6-for-24 from the field with just one assist in five games against high-major competition, so other guards are ahead of Johnson in the pecking order right now.Kentucky's freshmen haven't been the problem, but they haven't looked like the solution, either. Grade: C+\n    \n                                        \n    No. 8 TennesseeThere were some warning signs in the preseason that Nate Ament could struggle in this Tennessee offense that leans heavily on floppy actions to create advantages. Off-movement shooting wasn't a real huge asset in his toolbox, and so far, the talented five-star has been more miss than hit in the first 11 games while he plays the 3 (he will be a 4 in the NBA) in a halfcourt offense that can be clunky. \nThe interior finishing is certainly concerning. Ament has just two dunks and is shooting 43% on layups. That can't be sticky moving forward. One lesson with freshmen is it's never as bad as it looks or as great as it seems. For Ament, the truth is probably in the middle. The 6-10 forward needs to play with more physicality and become more of a terror as a downhill driver.Tennessee may be a bit of a hot-or-cold team while its hot-or-cold freshman simplifies his game.But Rick Barnes may have a gem in DeWayne Brown. The big man's similarity score on KenPom is … former Tennessee big man Tobe Awaka. The fouls? The brute-force effort on the glass? It's a perfect path for Brown to follow. Grade: B-\n    \n                                        \n    No. 9 KansasWhen Darryn Peterson is on the floor, this extremely hard game looks so ridiculously easy. Even when defenders are draped onto him, Peterson is unfazed. He has been absolutely tremendous, but the lingering hamstring injury is scary.If Peterson can get right, Kansas can be a second-weekend team with room for more because of his brilliance. But he has to get his body right. Tyrese Haliburton had a calf strain and then tore an Achilles tendon. Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum both had calf issues before suffering Achilles' injuries, too. Leg injuries aren't anything to be trifled with, especially for a prospect like Peterson, who has millions on the line if he can be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft.The rest of Kansas' freshmen class has not been major needle-movers. Paul Mbiya does not look ready yet. Kohl Rosario, predictably, has been passed by some of Kansas' other guards in the pecking order. KU's entire outlook hinges on Peterson's status. Grade: Incomplete\n    \n                                        \n    No. 10 AlabamaNate Oats' portal class has been underwhelming, but this freshman haul sure hasn't. Amari Allen is a keeper. The 6-8 wing can guard multiple positions, make open 3s, attack closeouts and initiate the offense in a pinch. He's tough, reliable and Alabama's defense has been 10 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor. Fellow young wing London Jemison has made a case for more minutes with a trio of treys against Clemson and a 20-point showing in 18 minutes against UTSA. The 6-8 wing is up to 39% from downtown, but there's a lot of mouths to feed on the perimeter so the little things like defense and rebounding could determine just how many minutes he can steal.Allen and Jemison look like pieces Alabama needs to keep out of the portal this spring. Grade: B+\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The battle for the NFC West has felt like a two-horse race between the Rams and Seahawks for most of the season, but don't forget about the San Francisco 49ers, because they are very much still in it. With the Rams and Seahawks facing each other on Thursday night, not only will the 49ers likely be paying very close attention to the game, but there's a good chance that they'll actually be rooting for Seattle to win. So why would the 49ers want the Seahawks to come out on top? The answer to that is simple: If the Seahawks win, the 49ers would suddenly control their own fate for both the NFC West title and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. That's right, a win by the Seahawks would actually kick the door wide open for the 49ers to come in and steal the top seed in the NFC. \n        \n            \n                Which NFC team has edge for No. 1 seed? Rams lead way but six teams have real shot to rise up\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf Seattle wins, the 49ers would just need to win out to earn both the NFC West title and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. Of course, winning out won't be easy, because the 49ers face a brutal schedule over the final three weeks: Week 16: at Colts (8-6)Week 17: Bears (10-4)Week 18: Seahawks (11-3)That's a remaining strength of schedule of .690, which is tied with the Colts for the hardest in the NFL. \nThere are only four teams in the NFC with 10 wins or more: The Rams, 49ers, Seahawks and Bears. If the 49ers win out, they will have the head-to-head tiebreaker over both the Seahawks and the Bears. If the Rams were to win their final two games after losing to the Seahawks, they would be 13-4, the same record the 49ers would have if San Francisco won out. The 49ers and Rams split their season series, so the next tiebreaker would be division record and that's where the 49ers would win: They'd have a division record of 5-1 while the Rams would be 4-2. It's a simple path, but the oddsmakers don't seem convinced that the 49ers are going to be able to pull it off. Here are the current odds for each team to win the division heading into Thursday night: 1. Rams (11-3): -1602. Seahawks (11-3): +2003. 49ers (10-4): +700All NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nIf the Rams win on Thursday, they'd have the inside track to the No. 1 seed: They'd need to win out to get the top spot in the NFC (Their final two games are against the Falcons and Cardinals). With a Rams win over Seattle, the 49ers' only path to the division title and No. 1 seed would be for L.A. to go 1-1 in its final two games, but that one loss would have to be to Arizona in Week 18. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, winner of the last two American League Cy Young Awards, was named to Team USA's World Baseball Classic roster on Thursday. Skubal's inclusion ensures the Americans can now deploy a rotation fronted by both reigning Cy Young Award winners, as Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Paul Skenes joined the roster earlier this winter.Add in several other notable arms, including Minnesota Twins righty Joe Ryan and New York Mets standout rookie Nolan McLean, and one thing is for certain: manager Mark DeRosa will have better starting options now than he did back in 2023, when Team USA finished second in the tournament. \nIndeed, the success of that squad (which lost to Japan in the Championship Game) makes it easy to forget that they fielded a less-than-impressive rotation. The Americans gave at least one start to four different pitchers, none of them on the level of Skubal or Skenes: Merrill Kelly, Lance Lynn, Adam Wainwright, and Nick Martinez. Comparatively, next spring's squad could have enough rotation options that the likes of Matthew Boyd and Clay Holmes, both quality starters themselves, may have to work out of the bullpen.The names alone might tell the difference between the rotations. But, just to drive home the point, here's how the top four starting options stack up based on their prior regular-season performances:\nRotationIP ERASO/BBWAR 2023 (Kelly, Lynn, Wainwright, Marinez)6203.613.087.82026 (Skubal, Skenes, Ryan, McLean)6022.475.4520.5While next spring's rotation falls short on innings (and only because of the inclusion of McLean, who did not make his big-league debut until mid-August), they have large advantages in every other listed category -- even Wins Above Replacement, a counting stat that should favor the innings leader.Of course, there are no guarantees in baseball, least of all in a tournament setting. On paper, though, the Americans would seem poised to make another deep run on the strength of their rotation. In fact, they're the favorites to win it all (+130, per Caesars), ahead of Japan (+300), the Dominican Republic (+450) and Puerto Rico (+950).\nThe next iteration of the WBC, the sixth since the international tournament was forged a few decades ago, will commence next March. The Americans have won just one of the first five WBC, with that victory coming in 2017.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Don't know about you, but I sure enjoyed the NBA Cup semifinals and final -- won by the Knicks on Tuesday -- because it was some seriously high-level basketball that we don't normally see in early December in the Association. Why was that? Because cash money was at stake to all the players involved. New York's players and head coach Mike Brown each earned $530,933, for example. The runner-up San Antonio Spurs and coach Mitch Johnson each earned $212,373. What does that have to do with NFL Week 16? There are a lot of guys on the precipice of cashing big on some season-long statistical incentives. I promise you that the players themselves are aware of this and so are their teammates and coaches. It's not their money, so they want guys to get paid.One of the most memorable recent examples of a player going out of his way to get his teammate some cash was the final game of the 2021 regular season when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were routing the visiting Carolina Panthers. There was no reason for Tom Brady to still be in the game with about seven minutes left and his team up 31-17 -- and with a playoff game the following week -- but he refused to leave until he helped good buddy, tight end and fellow future Hall of Famer Rob Gronkowski earn two incentives worth a combined $1 million. Gronk reminded Brady on the sideline before the Tampa Bay offense got the ball back: \"Let's go, I need one more,\" Gronkowski told Brady. \"One more catch?\" Brady replied. With 6:29 left, Brady found Gronkowski for his seventh catch of the day and 55th of the season to trigger a $500K bonus. And actually Gronk earned another $500K for reaching 750 yards on the year. Two plays after that Brady-to-Gronk pass, Blaine Gabbert replaced Brady.\nSo that's what I'm talking about, and here are a few players I believe can cash in Week 16, along with the full list courtesy of the CBS Sports research team. Rico Dowdle: $1M for scrimmage yards, $250K for TDsI have already played Carolina tailback Rico Dowdle priced +110 for an anytime touchdown for Sunday's huge home game vs. Tampa Bay with solo first place on the line in the NFC South. The Buccaneers are -3 and via the SportsLine Projection Model would shoot up with a victory from 75.2% to capture the South to 90.8%. Carolina would rise from 24.8% to 48.1% with the minor upset. The teams play again Week 18 in Tampa.Dowdle is making \"only\" $2.75 million this season on a one-year deal, so he could potentially make half his salary in bonuses on Sunday in Charlotte. Dowdle has seven total touchdowns (six rushing, one receiving) and an eighth gets him the $250,000. Tampa Bay is pretty good against the run -- allowing 101.4 yards per game -- but has allowed among the most rushing TDs in the league with 16. Dowdle is averaging just 47.5 rush yards per over the past four after 117.5 YPG in the prior six.\nThe 27-year-old Dowdle gets a $1 million bonus for reaching 1,350 scrimmage yards and is currently at 1,237. The model forecasts him for a combined 88 scrimmage yards (62 rushing) and 0.63 TDs between rushing and receiving. Dowdle isn't a huge factor in the pass game, as his lone receiving score came Week 6 vs. Dallas.\nKeenan Allen: $250K each for TDs, catches, yardsCould these be the final few regular-season games for the future Hall of Fame receiver Keenan Allen? The 33-year-old doesn't have a contract after this season with the Los Angeles Chargers, but he's still playing at a high level with 60 catches for 680 yards and four touchdowns. He's making $3.2 million this year but has up to $2.25 million in incentives. And he might hit a few Sunday in Dallas.Allen gets $250K for the following benchmarks: six total touchdowns, 71 receptions, 750 receiving yards and then again at 875 yards. He also gets $750K for 80 receptions and another $750K if he reaches 1,000 yards. That one is obviously unlikely as Allen has just a single 1,000-yard season in the past three season, but he also never came close to playing in every game those years. Allen hasn't missed one in 2025. \nThe Cowboys are last in the NFL against the pass in allowing 254.8 YPG and tied for last with Cincinnati having allowed 31 TD passes. Allen will want to get as many incentives Sunday as possible because the Chargers have two terrific defenses up next in Houston and Denver. Both are top 11 against the pass. The model has Allen at 3.7 catches for 45 yards and 0.28 TDs for Sunday. He has gone seven straight games without finding the end zone but did lead the Chargers in targets in Week 15. Allen obviously needs 70 yards to reach 750 for that incentive but hasn't reached at least 70 since a season-high 119 yards Week 7 vs. Indianapolis. That's the only game Allen topped 68 yards this year.I do believe Allen can get 70 on Sunday against that bad defense. No price on that yet at DraftKings due to the uncertain status of fellow wideout Quentin Johnston. He missed last Sunday's upset win in Kansas City and is questionable for this game. Allen is +1300 for two TDs to hit that benchmark.\nMore NFL player contract incentives to knowCalais Campbell (Cardinals)$1M for 7.5 sacks (Currently at 5.5)Dre'Mont Jones (Ravens)$700K for 7.0 sacks

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff is (almost) here. This is what the entire 2025 season has been leading towards. Over the next month or so, the 12 best teams in the nation will battle it out for the sport's top prize. This will be the second year of the 12-team format, though it will look a little different. The playoff is transitioning to a straight-seeding model where the top four teams -- regardless of if they won a conference championship or not -- earned a first-round bye. Even so, No. 2 Ohio State is the only top-four seed without a title to its name. No. 1 Indiana, No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Texas Tech all won their respective conferences. That's a testament to how strong the Buckeyes, who will be defending their 2024 national title, were this season. They're still seen as a favorite to repeat. But you play the games for a reason. Though the College Football Playoff isn't as wild as other tournament formats around the world of sports, it can still lend itself to chaos. \nSo, with the first round approaching, it felt appropriate to take a stab at predicting some overreactions we will have once the dust from this weekend settles. The Group of Five belongsThis may seem silly to include as an overreaction, especially since the current College Football Playoff format encourages Group of Five participation. There's a spot reserved for at least one Group of Five school and, thanks to some ACC tomfoolery, we even get to see two programs from that level test their luck on college football's biggest stage this season. But the arguments are already starting. On social media and even on television, you will find a fair few fans and pundits alike arguing that No. 12 James Madison and No. 11 Tulane do not belong. They cite an apparent talent gulf between the Group of Five and the Power Four. \nThat gulf does exist. It's why a true Cinderella run, the likes of which we see during March's NCAA Tournament, seems improbable in college football. Group of Five schools don't have the same resources that Power Four programs do and, thus, have a more difficult time acquiring and retaining talent. That alone isn't sufficient reason to bar them completely from competing for the sport's biggest prize. Just because a James Madison or Tulane national title seems improbable, that doesn't mean it's impossible. The crowd against Group of Five teams in the playoff will likely grow this weekend. Both the Dukes and the Green Wave are three-score underdogs in their respective first-round games. \nThe Group of Five deserves a chance, regardless. It should not be completely eliminated because of a handful of blowouts or hypothetical projections. If those are the criteria for a playoff, only a select few elites should make it on a yearly basis, and the actual accomplishments leading up to the playoff don't matter. \n        \n            \n                Don't expect College Football Playoff first-round blowouts like last year. Format tweaks should even the field\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKalen DeBoer's seat gets scorching Alabama fans are already uncertain about coach Kalen DeBoer. The Crimson Tide were, frankly, lucky to make the College Football Playoff after an embarrassing performance against Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. That 28-7 defeat put a bow on a rough close to the 2025 campaign for Alabama. The Crimson Tide went 2-2 in their last four games against FBS opponents. Both of their losses came against currently ranked opponents. The wins -- against LSU and Auburn -- were largely uninspiring. \nNow Alabama has to travel and play an Oklahoma team that it lost to at home on Oct. 25. The Sooners are a nightmare matchup for Alabama's ailing offense. The rematch will go about the same way as the first game, which will make the noise surrounding DeBoer's future at Alabama even louder. He's a very good coach with a proven track record and perhaps a change of scenery could benefit both sides if things go south Friday night. Maybe Michigan provides a lifeline for DeBoer. Ole Miss won't miss Lane Kiffin...... for now, at least. Look beyond the playoff and things look more perilous, especially since a majority of Ole Miss' offensive staff will follow Kiffin to LSU at the end of the season. It's seems like almost a sure thing that some prolific players will tag along, as well. \nOle Miss fans will happily watch Kiffin go if it means a deep playoff run. He got them to this point. Now it's up for those left behind -- including new coach Pete Golding -- to finish the job. The Rebels are capable of doing that. They'll come out Saturday and get another statement win to set the tone for what could be a deep run. Ole Miss shouldn't have any trouble against a Tulane team that it beat 45-10 in the regular season. From there, the Rebels get Georgia. The Bulldogs are good, but they aren't as unstoppable as they have been in the past. Ole Miss had a 35-26 lead against Georgia entering the fourth quarter of their Oct. 18 showdown. The Rebels crumbled in the fourth quarter, but perhaps Golding and Co. learned some crucial lessons that could help them this time around. \nOle Miss' roster is still in tact, including star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and All-SEC running back Kewan Lacy. Most of the coaches are staying in place, for now.Pull a couple wins and Kiffin will be a distant memory.  Round 1 sets stage for SEC embarrassment This writer has long predicted that the 2025 College Football Playoff will be rough for the SEC. Nothing about the last month or so has changed that projection. Texas A&M whiffs of fraudulence. The Aggies got exposed a bit in their regular season finale, as they were eliminated from SEC contention with a 27-17 loss to Texas. Though that was their first setback of the year, it did shine a light on A&M's flaws. \nAll seven of their conference wins came against teams with a losing record. They beat four SEC opponents that fired their coaches midseason. A&M could have a tough time against Miami. It probably doesn't matter who wins between Oklahoma and Alabama. Neither looks like anything more than fodder for top-seeded Indiana. Ole Miss will probably get to the quarterfinals and, in that scenario, the SEC would be guaranteed a semifinal team since the Rebels would play Georgia. At least the SEC has that going for it. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fittingly, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one win away from breaking a record that they currently share with a franchise that they have long been linked to. Pittsburgh is closing in on setting a new NFL record for the most consecutive non-losing seasons in league history. It currently shares the record with the Dallas Cowboys, its opponent in three previous Super Bowls. If the Steelers win at Detroit on Sunday (4:25 ET on CBS), it would secure the league's new mark.The Steelers beat the Cowboys in two Super Bowls during Dallas' 20-year run without a losing season. Pittsburgh recorded a 21-17 win in Super Bowl X before winning the rematch three years later in the first Super Bowl ever played between two franchises that had already each won the big game twice.Most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history FranchiseSeasonsYearsChampionships wonT1Pittsburgh Steelers212004-Present2T1Dallas Cowboys 211965-8523New England Patriots 19 2001-196T4Oakland Raiders161965-802T4San Francisco 49ers 161983-9866Chicago Bears 151930-445Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is also one win away from recording his 19th consecutive non-losing season, which would tie him with former Patriots coach Bill Belichick for second all-time behind Tom Landry, who was the Cowboys' coach throughout the team's 20-year non-losing streak. Most consecutive non-losing seasons for an NFL coach CoachSeasonsYearsChampionships1Tom Landry (Cowboys)201965-8522Bill Belichick (Patriots)192001-1863Mike Tomlin (Steelers)182007-2414George Halas (Bears)161933-42; 1946-5145Marty Schottenheimer (Browns/Chiefs)141984-870The Steelers' current streak started in 2004, when they won a franchise-record 15 regular-season games. That season also saw Ben Roethlisberger win each of his first 13 career starts, an NFL record. \"It legitimized the fact that we can play with the big boys,\" former Steelers safety Troy Polamalu once said of the '04 Steelers. \"Midway through the season, we had beaten two unbeaten teams, which were Philadelphia and New England. ... Philadelphia had Terrell Owens, who was extremely talented, and Donovan McNabb. Obviously, everybody knows that Tom Brady is a pretty good quarterback as well (laughs) that we lost to (in the AFC Championship Game). \"That year was a very significant year because we [realized] we were good enough to play with everybody.\"The following season, the Steelers became the first six seed to win the Super Bowl after they defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL. That would be the second-to-last season on the sideline for Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher, whose 15 seasons with the Steelers included tying Paul Brown's record by leading Pittsburgh to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons as coach. Pittsburgh continued its success upon Tomlin's arrival in 2007. The Steelers won the AFC North title that year before capturing the franchise's sixth Super Bowl title in 2008 after defeating the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII. In 2010, the Steelers reached the Super Bowl again before falling to Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, the Steelers lost to Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos in the AFC wild-card round in what is considered one of the most shocking playoff losses in franchise history. What followed were consecutive 8-8 seasons as many of the central figures on Pittsburgh's championship teams began to depart. Behind an explosive offense, the Steelers enjoyed a successful four-year run from 2014-17 that included three division titles, four consecutive playoff berths and the franchise's most recent AFC Championship Game appearance at the end of the 2016 season. In 2017, the Steelers went 13-3 before suffering another upset loss in the playoffs, this time at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars. After closing the 2010s with two non-playoff seasons, the Steelers made the playoffs four times over a five-year span from 2020-24. But while they've continued to remain competitive, Pittsburgh has yet to win a playoff game since defeating the Chiefs in the 2016 divisional round. That drought has, in some people's eyes, diminished the team's record of non-losing seasons. Here are some of the essential figures during the Steelers' recent run:Former head coach Bill CowherCurrent head coach Mike TomlinFormer general manager Kevin ColbertLate owner Dan RooneyHis son and current team president Art Rooney IIFormer defensive coordinator Dick LeBeauTwo-time Super Bowl champion Ben RoethlisbergerPro Football Hall of Fame safety and 2010 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu2008 NFL Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year T.J.

They are hoping to cap off the regular season with their first division title since 2020, which would lead to the franchise's first home playoff game in five years.\n            ",

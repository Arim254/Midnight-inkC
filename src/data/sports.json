The Giants (2-10) have a streak of their own -- a six-game losing streak -- with the last of those being a 34-27 overtime loss to Detroit in Week 12. Jaxson Dart has been cleared to return after missing the last two games with a concussion.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The all-time series between the franchises is tied 7-7, with the Giants winning the last matchup in 2023.

Jameis Winston had the same number of turnovers (three) as touchdowns during his two starts, compared to Dart who had 13 total touchdowns versus just two giveaways over his previous five starts. The Giants have gone 6-3 against the spread over their last nine games, with Dart the signal caller for most of that stretch.

He's complemented by rookie RB, TreVeyon Henderson, who has come on strong as of late, averaging 108 scrimmage yards with five total touchdowns over his last three games. The Patriots' defense is also miles ahead of New York's, as the former ranks second in run defense and fourth in points allowed.

With Denver bringing an elite defense into this game and Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out, the over/under is down to 43.5 after opening at 45.5. Further making life difficult for Washington receivers, Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) is back in the lineup for the Broncos.How should those injury updates impact your NFL DFS picks for 'Sunday Night Football,' and which sleepers should you insert into your NFL DFS lineups?

Nix is not a quarterback known for putting up Fantasy numbers, but he is coming off a 295-yard day against the Chiefs in his last game. The Commanders, meanwhile, have given up the third most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season, making this an ideal spot for Nix to return value. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also building his 'Sunday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Washington receiver Terry McLaurin. He does not have an injury designation, clearing the way for him to play for the first time since Oct. 27. He's a veteran presence that backup quarterback Marcus Mariota can depend on. With the Commanders listed as underdogs, there's a great chance they'll need to throw late, giving McLaurin plenty of opportunities to pile up production. McLaurin had 54 yards and a touchdown in the last game he played, and he also had the same stat line of 54 yards and a score when he last played the Broncos. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Broncos vs. Commanders NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        Teams coming off byes but going in opposite directions will meet in the 'Sunday Night Football' NFL Week 13 matchup as the Denver Broncos visit the Washington Commanders. Denver (9-2) has won eight in a row and defeated Kansas City, 22-19, in its last game. Meanwhile, Washington has lost six in a row, most recently falling to Miami, 16-13, in the first-ever NFL Madrid Game on Nov. 16. Jayden Daniels (elbow), who has been out since Week 9, has been ruled out. However, Terry McLaurin will return for Washington, as will reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Patrick Surtain II, for Denver. Broncos safety, Talanoa Hufanga, who was originally listed as questionable with an illness, is active.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. The teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight matchups, with Washington prevailing in the last meeting in 2023. The latest Commanders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 6-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via SportsLine consensus. Denver is 5-6 against the spread this season, while Washington is 3-8 ATS. The Under is a combined 14-8 for the two squads in 2025.

That contrasts with Washington which has not only lost six in a row straight up, but the Commanders have also lost versus the spread in all six of those. The Broncos possess an elite defense, leading the NFL in sacks, having allowed the fewest passing touchdowns, and holding opponents to a league-low in yards per rush. The defense gets another boost with cornerback Surtain II (pectoral) cleared to play. At the other end of the spectrum is Washington's defense, which has bottom-five rankings in points allowed, yards allowed and turnovers forced. Washington has allowed an average of 34 points over its last five games, while the Broncos haven't given up 34 points in any game this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Commanders can coverWashington HC Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties prior to the team's last game, and the results were instant as the Commanders gave up just 16 points and a season-low of 142 passing yards. That's a promising sign heading into SNF, especially facing a Broncos offense that does not travel. The Broncos are averaging just 18 points over their last four road games, and they've failed to rush for more than 100 yards in three straight games overall.

    "body": "\n        UFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall does not know when he'll fight next. Aspinall remains sidelined after two eye pokes from Ciryl Gane, whom he called a cheater, cut their UFC 321 main event short.Aspinall provided several notable updates about his health and the Oct. 25 fight over the weekend. On Sunday, Aspinall uploaded a YouTube video revealing that there's no timetable for his return despite UFC CEO Dana White's interest in booking a rematch.\"I  think right now, we've got to focus on the path back to normal and   following doctors' orders,\" Aspinall said. \"That's all I can control   right now. We'll cross the bridge [of my future with the UFC] when I'm   feeling better and everything is right. \"If you were sidelined from doing   your job for 15 months, not allowed   to do anything, then train your ass off for six months for a fight to   get double eye-poked and left with no vision for nearly six weeks   because of an illegal move, how do you think I feel? I'm not feeling   fantastic, am I?\"  UFC 321's disastrous main event spawned a swathe of reactions. Some people called Aspinall a quitter, while others labelled Gane a serial rulebreaker. Those siding with the champion dug up numerous examples of Gane eyepoking others; meanwhile, Aspinall's detractors pointed to Gane's early success before the eyepoke. Aspinall initially thought the illegal moves were an accident, but, upon further inspection, accused Gane of intentionally breaking the rules. Count Aspinall among those calling Gane a \"big cheater.\"\n\"When it  happened initially, I didn't really think much of it,\"  Aspinall said. \"I  thought it was an accidental eye poke. When I watch  the fight back,  that's when I really get the gist of what's going on.  The guy was trying  to f---ing poke my eyes out all the way through that  round. Multiple  exchanges, nearly every exchange, I could have put him  in danger; he had  his fingers out, pointing towards my eyes. The guy  was cheating from the  first second. The way that he wanted to win that  fight was to have me  compromised by cheating.The fight was ruled a no-contest with Aspinall unable to continue after 4:35 of Round 1. The heavyweight champion stands by his decision not to fight compromised.\"I didn't continue, and I'll tell you why,\" Aspinall said. \"Because I'm  not a f---ing dummy. I'm not going to go  out there and fight one of the  best strikers in the world when I can't  see with one eye. I know, as  an MMA fighter, things are going to happen  in a fight that compromises  you. If it's a legal move, you have to fight  through it. That's what we  do as a fighter. But if it's illegal, why am  I going to put my health  at risk when I can't see at all?\" \nEarlier, Aspinall posted a medical diagnosis of his injury on Instagram.\"Following a bilateral eye-poke injury  sustained during a UFC fight in October 2025, the patient has been  diagnosed with bilateral traumatic Brown's syndrome, indicating  significant disruption to the superior oblique tendon-trochlear complex.  Clinically, he presents with:Persistent diplopia in multiple gaze positions, including lateral gaze and upgaze.Blurred vision and photophobia following the trauma.Marked restriction of elevation in adduction in both eyes, confirmed on orthoptic assessment.Reduction in visual acuity bilaterally.Severe bilateral visual field depression on Humphrey visual field testing.Imaging and investigations demonstrated:Findings  requiring continued monitoring, with no definitive structural  explanation identified for the degree of functional deficit.CT imaging initially raised concern for a medial orbital wall abnormality.MRI demonstrated no acute structural abnormality to account for motility impairment or visual symptoms.Intraocular pressures and anterior segment findings did not identify the source of functional limitation.\"\n            ",

However, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh revealed after the game that quarterback Justin Herbert broke a bone in his left hand, his non-throwing hand, and will undergo surgery on Monday. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. \nThe first question Chargers fans will have is when will Herbert return? That remains unclear right now, although Herbert did tell reporters he's treating this week as if he's playing, per ESPN. The Chargers' next game comes in eight days against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on \"Monday Night Football.\" Herbert will surely be pushing to play, and will need to wear a protective device on that injured hand, but it's possible Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Just minutes before the current collective bargaining agreement was set to expire, the WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association agreed to a 40-day extension, the league announced Sunday night. The new expiration date for the current CBA is Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. Either party can terminate the extension at any point with a 48-hour notice. This is the second time that the current CBA has been extended. It was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but days before that deadline the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension that pushed the expiration date back to Nov. 30. There was little movement -- at least publicly -- over the last 30 days, and it seemed as though the two sides may be heading for a status quo period until their last-minute extension late on Sunday night. Extensions are not a new phenomenon in CBA negotiations. In fact, the two sides needed a 60-day extension to come to terms on the current CBA, which was not ratified until January of 2020. It appears as though the ongoing negotiations could follow a similar timeline. WNBA's most recent offer didn't move the needleIn November, the WNBA made a new offer to the players that included substantial salary increases, including a new minimum salary (more than $220,000) that would be more than the 2025 regular max salary ($214,466), according to the Associated Press. However, the players did not believe that offer moved negotiations forward, per ESPN. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: League's latest offer would raise minimum salary above 2025 maximum, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share [and] salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. \nCurrently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the WNBA's latest offer reportedly included a revenue sharing component, ESPN's report indicated that the players were still not satisfied with how the salary cap, and thus player salaries, would grow. What happens next?There are four paths forward from here. Let's quickly run through them:1. A new CBAThe ideal outcome would be a new CBA. The sooner the two parties can come to terms on a new CBA, the sooner the offseason can commence. While the draft lottery was finally held late last month -- the Dallas Wings won the No. 1 pick for the second year in a row -- none of the other major offseason activities can take place until a new CBA is ratified. \nA new CBA by Jan. 9 would also ensure that the 2026 season can start on time, which is extremely important for the continued growth of the league. 2. Another extension to the current CBAIf, for some reason, the two sides still cannot agree to a deal by Jan. 9, they could negotiate another extension. While that would not be ideal, it would be better than the risk of a work stoppage. 3. A status quo periodIf Jan. 9 passes without a new CBA or another extension, there would not automatically be a work stoppage. Instead, the two sides would enter a status quo period, which appears to be the most likely next step. \nPer the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoid committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"The key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).4. A work stoppageAt any point during a status quo period, either side could enact a work stoppage. That would most likely come via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. \nIn the event of a lockout, all league business would cease and players would be prevented from accessing team facilities. That would mean no expansion draft, no free agency, no trades, no 2026 WNBA Draft, nothing until a new CBA is in place. Depending on how long the lockout lasted, it's possible that the 2026 season could be delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, cancelled. The WNBA has never lost games due to a work stoppage. \n            ",

However, Rodgers briefly left Sunday's eventual 26-7 loss following the first play from scrimmage in the second half after taking a violent hit.Rodgers was sacked from behind by Joey Bosa, and fumbled the ball. It was picked up by Bills cornerback Christian Benford who returned it 17 yards for Buffalo's first touchdown of the game. Rodgers was seen cradling his injured wrist on the ground, and also sustained a cut on his nose, which drew blood.Check out what happened, here:\nRodgers was replaced by Mason Rudolph for one series, who threw an interception to Benford. That turnover led to another Bills touchdown, which extended Buffalo's lead to nine points.The sack-fumble of Rodgers was truly the turning point of this game. The Steelers led the Bills at halftime, 7-3, but the Bosa hit on Rodgers sparked a 23-0 run the Bills ended on.\nRodgers completed 10 of 21 passes for 117 yards in his return to the field.

After the news broke, Meyer posted his seal of approval on social media.Meyer praised Sumrall for his ability to win everywhere he's been. In four seasons, split evenly between Troy and Tulane, Sumrall has compiled a career record of 42-11 with two Sun Belt Conference championships. He can add an American Conference title to his resume this weekend.\"What a special day for Gator Nation,\" Meyer said. \"Welcome head football coach Jon Sumrall, one of the top five coaches in winning percentage in college football. I've studied coach Sumrall. I got to spend some time with him over the last few months. His teams are tough, they're physical and he creates a competitive environment. If he wins the conference championship this year, it'll be the third conference championship over the past four years.\"\nMeyer knows what it takes to win in Gainesville. He put together a 65-15 record at Florida, which included two SEC championships and two national championships. Throughout his 17-year coaching career at the college level, Meyer went 187-32 with seven conference championships and three national titles.Since Meyer stepped down at Florida following the 2010 season, the Gators have struggled to regain their status as national championship contenders. Florida hasn't won more than eight games since 2019, and Sumrall will be the program's fifth coach since Meyer's departure.\nOne of the team's biggest issues in recent years has been the lack of explosiveness on offense, a staple of Florida football under coaches like Meyer and Steve Spurrier. In his first statement as the Gators' next head coach, Sumrall said it's \"mandatory\" for the program to have a high-powered offense.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 13, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 14 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Adonai Mitchell, WR, JetsWhen the Jets traded Sauce Gardner, they made sure the deal included not just two first-round picks but also a former second-round pick in Mitchell. Coming out of Texas, Mitchell proved a 1-on-1 matchup winner when isolated on the outside with the length and speed to burn over the top. That's exactly what he did in Week 13 when he caught a long touchdown. His rapport with Tyrod Taylor was evident right away. What has Fantasy managers even more excited is the fact that Mitchell finished the game with a whopping 12 targets in Week 13. He turned those 12 into 8 receptions, 102 yards receiving and a touchdown.Dontayvion Wicks, WR, PackersWicks has been a frustrating asset for Fantasy managers for two seasons now because his advanced metrics are typically electric and he breaks out every once in a while with an explosive scoring output. That happened for Wicks in Week 13 as he racked up 94 yards and two touchdowns on six receptions from Jordan Love. As Love continues to heat up heading into the Fantasy playoffs, Wicks is worth stashing.Brenton Strange, TE, JaguarsStrange was on his way to a breakout season earlier this year before landing on injured reserve. After spending time out of the lineup, Strange found himself on waiver wires in most leagues. Make sure that is not the case any longer. Strange has returned as arguably Trevor Lawrence's favorite red zone solution and a player he looks to in key third-down situations. Strange finished Week 13 with 45 yards and a touchdown on three receptions.Devaughn Vele, WR, Saints \nThe Saints shocked the NFL world this offseason when they trade a mid-round pick for a what appeared to be a back-end roster receiver in Vele. Fast forward to Week 13 and Vele finally made his mark with 93 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions. He was also targeted eight times. Vele is only worth stashing in deep PPR leagues. Jakobi Meyers, WR, JaguarsMeyers is most likely not a free agent in your leagues, but just in case a fellow manager panic-dropped him after his slow start with the Jaguars following the trade, we want to make sure he's on your radar. Meyers racked up 90 yards and a touchdown on six receptions in Week 13. As we enter the stretch run, Meyers may prove to be Lawrence's No. 1 target in the pass game as Brian Thomas Jr. continues to struggle to make an impact. Meyers will improve his rapport with LawrenceJalen Coker, WR, PanthersCoker has found lightning in a bottle with Bryce Young before -- last season his per target metrics were through the roof -- and he might've found some again in Week 13. Coker had 74 yards receiving and four receptions. He was also targeted six times. Chuba Hubbard, RB, Panthers\nHubbard was likely dropped in your leagues after the Panthers turned the offense over to Rico Dowdle midseason, but the veteran worked his way back into the rotation in a big way in Week 13. Hubbard is an explosive playmaker and could be worth a desperation FLEX play down the stretch in the right matchups for Carolina. At the very least, he's a stash in case Dowdle gets hurt. \n            ",

Once 3-5-1, Dallas has strung together three straight wins thanks to a defensive turnaround, and now, more defensive help is on the way. On Sunday, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters that the team has designated cornerback Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve, and opened his 21-day practice window. Diggs has missed the past six games after he was placed on injured reserve following an accident in his home that landed him in the concussion protocol. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones referred to it as a \"fluke situation.\"\"I don't know the combination of the injury and how it impacted, regarding concussion issue, I'm not sure that I know the detail of how that happened,\" Jones said last month. \"He said what happened, and I'm not saying that didn't happen, but a lot of times, you're not the best viewer of what happened to you. … Yeah, no I won't get into that [what Diggs said happened], but the bottom line is that I do expect him back.\"\nIn six games played this season, Diggs recorded 18 combined tackles with zero passes defensed or interceptions. Diggs is a two-time Pro Bowl player, and was named a First Team All-Pro in 2021 when he led the league in interceptions with 11.The Cowboys are off this weekend after defeating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving, 31-28. With that win, the Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to defeat both of the previous year's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. In Week 12, the Cowboys overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. \nEntering NFL Sunday, the Cowboys are the No. 9 seed in the NFC, one spot above the 6-6 Carolina Panthers, and one behind the 7-5 Detroit Lions. Dallas is also 1.5 games back of the 8-4 Eagles in the NFC East, who lost to the Chicago Bears Friday. Up next for the Cowboys are the Lions in Detroit this Thursday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Our plate was filled to the brim in Week 13, which is fitting as the action coincided with the Thanksgiving holiday. Beginning on Thursday, the NFL took us on a wild ride, chock-full of upsets no matter which way you looked. The Thanksgiving/Black Friday slate not only featured underdogs keeping games within the spread, but all four pulled off outright upsets. As we migrated to the Sunday slate, the upsets didn't subside as the Carolina Panthers pulled off a stunning win at home over the Los Angeles Rams, and the New York Jets kicked a game-winning field goal to edge out the Atlanta Falcons. Pure pandemonium. Given all of these surprising results, there are naturally going to be some major takeaways from Week 13. Below, we're going to examine some of the top storylines from this Sunday slate and determine which we need to take seriously and which we can cast aside as an overreaction. Matthew Stafford's MVP bid is overOverreactions or reality: OverreactionStafford came into Week 13 as the betting favorite to win NFL MVP, as the Rams quarterback had been on an absolute tear. He had thrown 28 straight touchdowns without an interception, which was the longest streak in NFL history. However, that streak was snapped with a first-quarter interception, which began a downward spiral for Los Angeles that resulted in them falling to the Carolina Panthers. In all, Stafford had three turnovers (two interceptions and a fumble) in the losing effort. Stafford's second interception was returned 48 yards by corner Mike Jackson for a touchdown, and his fourth-quarter fumble following a sack effectively iced the game for Carolina. \nNaturally, this puts a dent into Stafford's MVP bid and could cost him his standing as the betting favorite. However, it'd be a step too far to say that his pursuit is over. Los Angeles is still 9-3 on the season and very much still in play for the top seed in the NFC. If Stafford bounces back with strong performances over the next few weeks against opponents like the Lions (Week 15) and Seahawks (Week 16), his stock could be back up. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: Who's in, who's out and who's in the hunt after Colts and Rams go down in Week 13\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexans are the team to beat in the AFC SouthOverreactions or reality: RealityThe Houston Texans may not be atop the AFC South at the moment, but they are a force to be reckoned with. Houston went into Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday and handed the then-first-place Colts a 20-16 defeat. That pushed Indy out of first place in the division and helped launch the Jaguars (who beat the Titans) to the top spot. However, the Texans are now in spitting distance as they are a game out in the loss column to both the Jaguars and Colts for first place. After splitting the season series with Jacksonville, the next tiebreaker between those two would be division record, which the Texans currently have the advantage (4-1 vs. 2-1). When it comes to leaping over the Colts, they could complete the season sweep in Week 18 when they host them at NRG Stadium. That creates a viable path for the Texans, especially after getting C.J. Stroud back this week to pair with arguably the best defense in the NFL. \nShedeur Sanders played his way out of extended lookOverreactions or reality: OverreactionCleveland's offense managed just eight points in a double-digit loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in Sanders' second career start. The rookie quarterback completed 16 of his 25 passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. It wasn't a performance that'll knock anyone's socks off, so some may take this opportunity to suggest that Sanders no longer deserves a longer look under center by Cleveland. That'd be a silly step to take at this juncture. There's still more to examine with Sanders as the Browns starting quarterback, and he did have some encouraging moments in Week 13, particularly his 34-yard touchdown to Harold Fannin Jr. in the second quarter. It'd be wise for Kevin Stefanski to continue riding it out with Sanders so that the franchise can get a crystal clear view of what they have in him, and the head coach has already announced they'll give him the start next week against Tennessee. Panthers are the biggest surprise team of 2025Overreactions or reality: RealityIn a season where the Chicago Bears are the No. 1 seed in the NFC at the end of Week 13, and Daniel Jones has resurrected his career in Indianapolis, there are plenty of teams you can point to as the biggest surprise of 2025. However, none hold a candle to the Carolina Panthers. No one expected this team to do much of anything in 2025, but they are suddenly in the thick of the NFC playoff conversation entering their Week 14 bye. After beginning the year at 1-3, Carolina has ripped off a 6-3 record, which includes a stunning upset victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 13. At 7-6, the Panthers are hot on the heels of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5) for first place in the NFC South with both head-to-head matchups still on the horizon (Week 16 in Carolina and Week 18 at Tampa). They are also just two games back in the loss column for a wild-card spot. Again, nobody had this on their 2025 bingo card, which is a credit to Dave Canales and Bryce Young. Steelers are going to miss the playoffsOverreactions or reality: OverreactionThe Steelers are once again on the outside looking in on the playoffs after their loss to the Buffalo Bills. They burned a golden opportunity to create some breathing room between themselves and the Baltimore Ravens, who fell to the Bengals on Thanksgiving. Instead, Baltimore jumps back up to first place in the AFC North and as the No. 4 seed in the AFC, while the Steelers are the No. 9 seed. Yes, things aren't exactly rosy at the moment, but this isn't a death sentence just yet. The Ravens -- specifically Lamar Jackson -- have looked shaky in recent weeks, making them ripe for the picking down the stretch. Moreover, the Steelers host the Ravens next week in the first of two matchups over the final five weeks of the season. If Pittsburgh can hold up, the playoffs are still very much on the table. \nJ.J. McCarthy's job as Vikings QB1 for 2025 is safeOverreactions or reality: RealityWell, any thought of a potential quarterback controversy in Minnesota went out the window real fast. Coming into Week 13, there was a line of thinking that the Vikings could be thrust into a controversy under center if backup Max Brosmer played well while J.J. McCarthy was sidelined due to a concussion. While McCarthy hasn't impressed in his time as Minnesota's starter, Brosmer couldn't heat up his seat whatsoever. The undrafted rookie recorded four interceptions in a 26-0 loss to the Seahawks. This effectively ends any idea that McCarthy's job in 2025 is at risk. If he's healthy, he should be the starter for the rest of the year with no true threat anywhere on the roster. As for beyond 2025, that's a different question entirely. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 13 has already produced lots of drama.The Carolina Panthers took down the Los Angeles Rams, who entered Sunday as the NFC's projected No. 1 playoff seed, thanks to another dose of late-game poise from Bryce Young, who continues to be one of the game's most volatile performers.The Chicago Bears vaulted up to the top spot in the NFC playoff picture as a result of that Rams defeat, making their Black Friday rout of the reigning champion Philadelphia Eagles that much merrier.The Houston Texans handed the rival Indianapolis Colts their second straight loss, turning the tide of the AFC South race, and pushing the Jacksonville Jaguars to the top of that division as a result of their own Week 13 win.That's not even accounting for the New York Jets upsetting the Atlanta Falcons or the San Francisco 49ers cruising past Shedeur Sanders and the Cleveland Browns, who managed just eight points on the day.Which players, coaches and teams were the biggest winners and losers of Sunday's games? Here goes:Winner: Bryce Young\nThis guy is ridiculous. As soon as everyone comes around to the fact he just might not be cut out for the NFL stage, the former No. 1 overall pick showcases elite composure on a slew of late-game fourth downs to guide a stunning upset. The Rams should've cruised past his Panthers on Sunday. Instead, Young's three scoring passes brought Carolina to 7-6 in a tightly contested NFC South.\nLoser: Shane SteichenSteichen was a Coach of the Year favorite earlier this year, breathing new life into Daniel Jones while enjoying an MVP-level breakout by Jonathan Taylor. After starting 7-1, however, his Colts have now dropped three of their last four, surrendering a clear AFC South lead to the mercurial Jaguars. Jones, meanwhile, is operating on a bad leg, and the defense's new prize, Sauce Gardner, is also hurt.Winner: DeMeco RyansC.J. Stroud was back under center for Houston against Indianapolis, but at this point, it hardly matters who's throwing passes for the Texans, because this group is propelled by Ryans' defense. While the unit surprisingly managed just one sack of Daniel Jones, it bottled up Colts star Jonathan Taylor to seal a low-scoring affair, securing the Texans' sixth win of the last eight weeks.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 overreactions: Matthew Stafford's MVP bid over? Texans new team to beat in the AFC South?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Raheem MorrisMorris isn't exactly calling the shots with a full deck, with Michael Penix Jr. and Drake London sidelined on offense. But the Falcons had little business letting Tyrod Taylor lead a come-from-behind victory for the Jets. Atlanta clearly outgained and out-possessed its competition, only to drop to 4-8 on the year thanks to a walk-off field goal. Nothing's come up right for this regime.\nWinner: 49ersOn the same day the NFC West-leading Rams dropped a stunner to the Panthers, San Francisco enjoyed one of its most decisive wins of the year, with Brock Purdy keeping his head high against the Myles Garrett-led Browns defense and Robert Saleh's own \"D\" bottling up Cleveland's attack. Despite lacking full health for much of the year, Kyle Shanahan's squad won't stop fighting.Loser: SteelersThe AFC North is there for the taking with the Baltimore Ravens all kinds of sloppy, and yet Pittsburgh doesn't look capable of putting up much of a late-season fight. The defense was scrappy early against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but then the aging, ailing Aaron Rodgers took more big hits en route to another quiet outing, and Mike Tomlin's defense couldn't finish. Talk about ugly.Winner: Mike MacdonaldThe Seattle Seahawks coach didn't get a masterclass from Sam Darnold on the day his quarterback matched up with his old team, the Minnesota Vikings. But Macdonald's defense completely wrecked the Vikings anyway, with Ernest Jones IV and Co. ruining undrafted rookie Max Brosmer's first career start under center to the tune of five takeaways in a 26-0 shutout.\n            ",

There weren't many highlights from this matchup, as both teams did not cross 254 yards of total offense, but there were some fireworks after the final whistle. When Browns defensive lineman Maliek Collins went down with an injury in the third quarter and was carted off the field, 49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings apparently took the opportunity to talk some trash. At least, that's what Browns defensive lineman Shelby Harris said. And he wants the world to know that Jennings \"Is a hoe.\" \"He's a hoe, and I want that known,\" Harris told reporters in the locker room. \"Like I see why he got punched in the nuts, because he said some things that you should not say to another man, ever. But, like, I don't respect it because you say that then run behind your O-line. That's some real soft shit, and I want that known. I see exactly why they punched him in the nuts, I'm surprised nobody punched him in the jaw yet.\"\nIf you recall, Jennings was punched below the belt by Carolina Panthers defensive back Tre'von Moehrig last Monday night. After the game, Jennings chased Moehrig down and struck him across the face. Moehrig was suspended one game without pay for his low blow. \nBrowns superstar Myles Garrett also addressed the Jennings matter during his postgame press conference, saying, \"I can't speak for how he was raised.\" His take on the issue was much more measured. \"He had a lot to say that was demeaning and disparaging towards some of our players,\" Garrett said.\nJennings caught four passes for 39 yards and a touchdown during Sunday's victory. He also apparently made a few enemies as well. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Despite the Cleveland Browns scoring just one touchdown in a 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Shedeur Sanders will get another look as the starter next week against the Tennessee Titans. Coach Kevin Stefanski declined to comment on whether he locked up the role for good or if he remains in a week-to-week competition with Dillon Gabriel.The announcement came after an ESPN report stated the Browns are open to giving Sanders an \"extended look\" in the starting job. They previously gave Gabriel a six-game opportunity, but after he suffered a concussion in the last of those starts, he ceded the job to his fellow rookie.Sanders made his second career start in the loss to the 49ers and completed 16 of 25 passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. He also ran once for a 6-yard gain.\"He's battling like all of our guys are battling,\" Stefanski said of Sanders. \"I know there's plays he wants back, but we'll look at it and we'll correct it.\"\nAlthough it came in a losing effort, Sanders at times looked more comfortable running the offense than in his previous two outings. He was more accurate than in his starting debut against the Las Vegas Raiders when he went just 11 for 20, and he was dramatically more effective than his 4-for-16 relief appearance against the Baltimore Ravens.\"Obviously we lost, so I ain't play well,\" Sanders said. \"It's definitely things on film I'm gonna look back and want to get back and want to see, but at least moving forward I know what we could do differently going about the week and being able to get fully prepared for every possibility.\"Sanders, Cam Ward set for rookie duelIt will be a rookie-versus-rookie battle next week when the Browns host the Titans' No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward. Tennessee (1-11)  heads to Cleveland (3-9) on the heels of another blowout loss, this time a 25-3 defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nSanders and Ward were often compared in the pre-draft process as first-round prospects. Ward lived up to expectations when he came off the board at No. 1, but Sanders experienced one of the most dramatic draft slides in recent memory when he slipped all the way to the fifth round. Neither found much success in the early going of their NFL careers.PlayerComp-AttYardsTDINTShedeur Sanders31-61 (50.1%)40522Cam Ward246-412 (59.7%)2,35176One of the quarterbacks will earn his second win of the year. A victory would give Sanders a winning record as a starter, while Ward is already in a much deeper hole with his larger sample size of 12 starts. If Sanders improves to 2-1 in his role, he could strengthen his grip on the job and distance himself from Gabriel, who logged just one win in his six opportunities atop the depth chart.\"In the midst of everything that's going on -- wins, losses, anything -- I remember when I wasn't playing,\" Sanders said. \"So I never forget that feeling. I try my best to not let that happen again, for me to be in that position.\"\n            ",

With its undrafted rookie quarterback leading the way, Minnesota lost 26-0 at the Seahawks. It's the first time the Vikings have been shut out since Nov. 11, 2007, ending a 294-game streak with at least one point. Entering Sunday, it had been the third-longest active scoring streak in the NFL.Longest active NFL scoring streaks entering SundayGamesRavens382Steelers308Vikings294<<49ers246>> Ended SundayBrosmer, starting because Week 1 starter J.J.

For reference, throwing an incompletion on every pass carries a passer rating of 39.6The situation -- an undrafted rookie facing one of the league's best defenses on the road in his first start -- had all the makings for a disaster, and it ended up being even worseMinnesota punted on each of its first four drives but trailed just 3-0 in the second quarter when Dallas Turner strip-sacked Sam Darnold and Jalen Redmond recovered. That put Brosmer and the offense in business at Seattle's 22-yard line, in seemingly sure scoring distance. Instead, Brosmer threw a fourth-and-1 interception to Ernest Jones IV, who went 84 yards the other way for a touchdown.\nBy the end of the half, Minnesota trailed 13-0 and had just three first downs.\nIt got worse in the second half. The Vikings worked their way into the edge of field goal range when Aaron Jones Sr. lost a fumble and got injured in the process. On their next possession, the Vikings again got into Seattle territory, but Brosmer threw high for Jalen Nailor, and Coby Bryant picked it off.\nBrosmer threw another interception to Jones and then a fourth interception, this time to Riq Woolen. Woolen lost a fumble on the return, though, giving Minnesota yet another short field. Again, the Vikings failed to cash in, beset by a holding penalty and a pair of Brosmer sacks, including one on fourth downThat sequence sealed Minnesota's first time failing to score a point in a game since a 34-0 loss to the Packers more than 18 years ago. That game similarly included a third-string quarterback starting; with both Tavaris Jackson and Kelly Holcomb hurt, Brooks Bollinger got the call. Bollinger had more succes than Brosmer -- 16 for 26 for 176 yards and just one interception -- but was unable to generate any points.\nThe Vikings face the Commanders in Week 14.\n            ",

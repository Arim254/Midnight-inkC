The Volunteers have lost three straight contests, but none of those came at home in either road or neutral site losses to Kansas, Syracuse and No. 14 Illinois. Before that streak, though, Tennessee knocked off No. 3 Houston, 76-73, in Las Vegas. The Vols are 5-0 at home this season as they return to Knoxville to take on Louisville, which lost its only road game this season. Tennessee has won two straight against the Cardinals, including a 77-55 final in Louisville last year, as the model projects the Vols to win and cover in 64% of simulations. Back Tennessee at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Knicks (-2.5) vs. Spurs (-110)The Knicks have made it known that winning the NBA Cup means something to them. Despite winning at least 50 games in back-to-back seasons, the Knicks aren't oftten discussed among the elite NBA teams, and that opinion may change with an in-season tournament title. Jalen Brunson has scored at least 30 points in four straight games, including 40 points against the Magic in the semifinals, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 29 points and eight rebounds against Orlando. Victor Wembanyama returned as the Spurs upset the Thunder in the semifinals on Saturday, but he only played 21 minutes after missing a month with a calf injury, so his minutes will likely be limited again. The Knicks have won five straight and are 9-1 over their last 10 games, and the model projects the Knicks to win and cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Knicks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Queens (NC) vs. Arkansas: Over 173.5 total points (-105)\"As Queens plays at only one speed, fast, the Royals might as well have Lando Norris as coach,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Formula 1 style preferred by Grant Leonard puts up lots of points (85 ppg) but gives them up just as fast (86 ppg), and Queens is even less inclined to touch the handbrake against power conference opposition, most recently throwing caution to the wind on Sunday at Wake Forest. The result was a 111-73 loss, the fourth time in six games that someone in a Queens game hit the century mark. We suppose many Razorbacks have eyes as big as saucers at this chance to score points, which John Calipari won't discourage, as the Porkers score even more rapidly (88.1 ppg) than the Royals.\" Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors have gone 4-6 in their last 10 games, and are now under .500 after a demoralizing 136-131 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. Stephen Curry poured in 48 points and yet it still wasn't enough to beat a Blazers team that had lost six of seven entering that matchup.The loss puts the Warriors (13-14) further behind in the Western Conference standings, as they sit eighth with 4.5 games separating them and the sixth-placed Minnesota Timberwolves. With the team struggling, fans are not only airing their grievances on social media, but taking it to the top of the ladder. \n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Paolo Banchero's blemish is getting bigger; Stephen Curry can't save Warriors\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJustin Dutari, a 27-year-old fan from Panama, emailed team owner Joe Lacob about his frustrations with the team. In speaking with SF Gate, Dutari said he searched to find Lacob's email, and shot him a message.\"Please do something about this team,\" Dutari's email said. \"What [does] Steph need to do every night to win? Drop 50 points? Team is [in] need of a real second option. Jimmy [Butler's] tools are being underutilized because he is playing as a power forward due to the small position players. We have no true center. I am so frustrated.\"To Dutari's surprise, Lacob replied within two minutes.\n\"You can't be as frustrated as me,\" Lacob wrote in response. \"I am working on it. It's complicated. Style of play. Coaches desires regarding players. League trends. Jimmy is not the problem.\"It's not every day a team owner responds to a fan's email with actual sincerity. And while he only called out Butler by name and said his play has not been the problem, it doesn't take a genius to guess who Lacob is referencing with his \"coaches desires regarding players\" line. The Warriors have had a tumultuous relationship with Jonathan Kuminga for quite some time, and a contract standoff this past summer only heightened things. \n        \n            \n                Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga eye needed breakup, but they still have to wait another month\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough the first 12 games of the season, it looked like things had been smoothed over between Kuminga and Golden State's coaching staff. He started every game, was averaging nearly 15 points and while the Warriors only went .500 during that stretch, it appeared as though Kuminga found his place in Steve Kerr's lineup.Since then, Kuminga's registered more DNP-CD's than games played and could find himself once again the subject of trade rumors before the Feb. 5 deadline. Trading Kuminga, though, isn't a cure all for the Warriors, unless they're getting someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo in return. That's no guarantee, but it's clear that change has to happen if Golden State wants to be more than just a first-round exit, regardless of how well Curry is playing.\nPerhaps Lacob will take Dutari's words and be more aggressive on the trade market as the deadline approaches. Until then, the Warriors will have to hope they can find a temporary solution to stay afloat in the gauntlet that is the Western Conference.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work. The Spurs-Thunder semifinals matchup felt like a playoff game, and we should be in store for another high-intensity matchup between the Knicks and Spurs Tuesday night. Tip off is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET on Prime.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday felt like a significant moment in NBA Cup history. San Antonio's upset over Oklahoma City didn't just punch a ticket to the tournament final. It was a message to the rest of the sport. The Spurs are no longer just a young team on the rise. They're here, now, ready to compete with any team in the league. And after taking down the Western Conference favorite on Saturday, they'll get their shot at the Eastern Conference favorite on Tuesday against the KnicksThe Knicks took the quieter path to the final. They didn't have to slay Luka Dončić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to get here. But New York has waited 52 years for a pro basketball championship of any kind. This isn't the one they've spent five decades waiting for, but you can bet the Knicks still want to bring this trophy back home to New York as NBA Cup champions, and they, too, want to make a statement. If you can't beat the champ, beating the team that beat the champ is the next best thing.Bet Spurs vs. Knicks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:So let's dig in on Tuesday's NBA Cup final and make some best bets for the marquee game of the regular season thus far.\nNew York Knicks vs. San Antonio SpursTime: 8:30 p.m. ET | Date: Tuesday, Dec. 16Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las VegasLive stream: Amazon Prime VideoOdds (via FanDuel): NYK -136 | SA +116 | O/U: 232.5\nThere isn't much separating the Knicks and Spurs at this point. They have the same record (18-7). New York's net rating is meaningfully higher, but that makes sense when you consider Victor Wembanyama's lengthy absence. The Spurs with Wembanyama are roughly even with the Knicks when Jalen Brunson plays. They haven't played this season, so there's no template here. We're just betting on styles here. San Antonio allows the second-most mid-range shots in the NBA, and the sixth-highest mid-range field goal percentage. That sort of aggressive drop-coverage can be very problematic against Jalen Brunson, specifically. He loves walking into mid-range jumpers as bigs hang near the basket, and in a big game, he's going to be willing to take and make as many of those shots as it takes. In a game this even, that little matchup advantage gives New York the slimmest of edges. The Pick: Knicks -2.5It's a simple pick, but I almost always lean toward the under in single-elimination games. Game 7s almost always see low scores, so the bet here is that the players start out tight and miss some early shots. Remember, most of these Spurs are young and reasonably inexperienced in big-game settings. The Knicks aren't, but this is also one of the NBA's slowest teams, and should therefore be eager to turn this into a half-court slugfest rather than a track meet with the younger, faster Spurs. The Pick: Under 232.5\nWe covered the sort of shots San Antonio gives up. What about the Knicks? They're near the top of the league in 3-pointers allowed, specifically out of the left corner. Why does this matter? Because Harrison Barnes takes the second-most left corner 3s per game in the entire NBA, and he's made over 47% of them this season. You're paying a big vig here, but I think it's worth it. The Pick: Barnes Over 1.5 3-pointers (-190)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.This past summer, a friend of mine presented the scenario in which we could end up in statistical quagmire. I'll go with it in my own words, but thanks go out to my boy Rodney for inspiring this Soapbox.Let's say a pitcher someone allows zero baserunners through nine innings; 27 up, 27 down. We know that as a perfect game. But the score is 0-0 and heads to extra innings. Let's imagine that the team sends this pitcher back out for the 10th inning -- impossible to imagine in this day and age, I know, but just humor me, will you?As we all know well by now, the regular-season extra-innings rules in Major League Baseball say that an automatic runner will start on second base in extras. This means that, despite our pitcher here having allowed nary a baserunner though nine innings, he now has to deal with a runner. The opposing team bunts the runner to third. Then a sacrifice fly plates the run. \nThis pitcher has been the victim of awful support from his team today, for sure, so we'll stick with theme. The bunt wasn't very good, but the defense did a poor job in execution without making an error. The sac fly wasn't deep, but the outfielder made a poor throw home, again, without it being ruled an error. Our pitcher strikes out the next hitter. Then the team of this pitcher goes back out for the bottom of the 10th and fails to score. Our pitcher here faced 30 batters and got all of them out. And he took the loss while having allowed an unearned run. \nThe question is ...Was this a perfect game?Remember, in the 2020 season, MLB ruled that in those seven-inning doubleheaders, any no-hitter thrown wouldn't officially be counted as a no-hitter, which obviously extended to perfect games. This means that MLB is well aware that arguments will occur over stuff like no-hitters or perfect games when weird rules get in the way. Rule 9 in the official MLB rulebook for 2025 covers all the statistics and how they should be figured and ruled. It is extensive, clocking in at 40 pages. It says nothing about ruling on perfect games. Same with the \"definition of terms\" section. Rule 7.01(C) says the following regarding the automatic runner on second base: For purposes of calculating earned runs under Rule 9.16, the runner who begins an inning on second base pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be a runner who has reached second base because of a fielding error, but no error shall be charged to the opposing team or to any player. For purposes of Rule 9.02, the Official Scorer shall keep records of the number of times each batter and runner is placed at second base in accordance with this rule.If the runner is ruled to have reached on error, it's not a perfect game, except the team isn't actually charged with an error. Basically, there's no rulebook guidance here, which leads me to believe that if this actually happened, the office of the commissioner would be forced to weigh in. One of my pet peeves is the league being reactive instead of proactive and here's another case. \nOf course, none of this matters until it happens, and then it'll really matter. Imagine recording the final out and not knowing if it counted as a perfect game or not.Since there isn't a rule laid out for us, we can run with vibes. It's a perfect game. C'mon. The pitcher faced 30 hitters and got every single one of them out. Of course, I can easily see the rebuttal, right? The team lost. We know what the word \"perfect\" means. Here's a paradox for you, then: How could it be possible for a pitcher to throw a perfect game and also be saddled with a loss? Doesn't the \"loss\" next to his name make the game less-than-perfect? \nWe can go in circles with this one. Discuss among yourselves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night, as they were defeated by Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 28-15. The Dolphins entered this prime-time matchup riding a four-game winning streak, but were simply beat down by a better team. The status of starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is again being questioned, as he completed 22 of 28 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on Monday night. The box score doesn't tell the entire story. Tagovailoa's two passing touchdowns came in the fourth quarter when Miami was already trailing by double digits, and the Dolphins went a putrid 2 of 8 on third downs.Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was asked by reporters on Tuesday if he was considering a quarterback change. McDaniel confirmed he was.  \"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said.Who would McDaniel start if he were to bench Tagovailoa?\n\"Well I think that we are in the process of game-planning for the Cincinnati Bengals, so in that process, we are trying to determine who will give us the best chance to win and I'll probably give you more clarity on that tomorrow, as we are 14 hours removed from the game,\" McDaniel responded. The Dolphins have two other quarterbacks on roster: Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. If Tagovailoa were to be benched, it may be Wilson who is handed the keys to the offense, as Ewers was the designated QB3 on Monday night.In 14 games this season, Tagovailoa has completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The former Pro Bowler has appeared to have regressed this season. In 2022, Tagovailoa led the NFL in yards per attempt and passer rating. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,624. That led to him signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. \nThe Dolphins cannot easily move on from Tagovailoa if they choose to do so this offseason. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, it's possible this week could mark the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The festive period of the European soccer season is in full swing, and with the World Cup around the corner, this is also a period with higher stakes than usual. Those were felt in Bournemouth's 4-4 draw with Manchester United on Monday, where the Cherries held their own at Old Trafford. But at what cost? There was concern as American midfielder Tyler Adams went down with yet another injury. It's thought to be an MCL injury for Adams, and it's one that has manager Andoni Iraola worried.Adams was withdrawn in the ninth minute of play, and the change to Bournemouth's setup, no longer having a defensive midfielder, was immediately apparent as it went from a soccer match to to chaos. Bournemouth conceded 25 shots and four goals, showing the impact of Adams' leaving the match, and after already spending time without Adams this season, Iraola didn't mince his words on his condition.\"It's the worst news from the game,\" Iraola said in his post-match interview. \"The knee, twisted, I think it's MCL, but we'll check him and see if it is a small strain or something else. It is not what you want in the second or third minute. To lose a player like him is massive. It's bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us.\"Adams has already missed significant time this season with a back injury, which sidelined him for 10 games while missing two more due to muscular injuries. Depending on the grade of this injury, Adams could miss anywhere from a few weeks to months, which could put his participation in critical United States men's national team friendlies in March, facing Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta. in doubt.\nDuring Adams' time in the Premier League, injuries have continued to take a toll, with his hamstring and muscle injuries causing him to miss critical matches for club and country. Even if he does make those friendlies for the USMNT, a bigger question will be at play of if Adams can get back to his best ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Captaining the United States men's national team at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Adam's defensive work rate and leadership were major driving forces behind a midfield that was able to grab a 0-0 draw against England before falling in the round of 16. The progression of that entire midfield trio has been stunted, but for different reasons. Weston McKennie is in and out of the XI at Juventus, Yunus Musah is trying to fight for a starting role at Atalanta, and Adams can't stay on the pitch.This has also forced a rethink for Mauricio Pochettino, as while the Argentine has tried different defensive midfielders, it has only highlighted that no one can replace Adams, and the USMNT have had to shift things to play with a back three in order to give the defense enough cover for when Adams isn't present.\nBut having a healthy Adams is the best option for all parties. There's a reason why both Iraola and Pochettino make sure that he's included in their squads when healthy, but to keep him healthy for the World Cup and beyond, there's a situation where managing minutes could be needed. Everyone wants Adams to be on the pitch as it raises the ceilings of what Bournemouth and the USMNT can accomplish, so this latest injury will force a rethink of how to make sure that can happen for all of 2026.\n            ",

    "description": "\nWhen the Colorado Avalanche suffered their second regulation loss of the 2025-26 NHL season on Dec. 4, some thought the team would begin coming back ",
    "body": "\nWhen the Colorado Avalanche suffered their second regulation loss of the 2025-26 NHL season on Dec. 4, some thought the team would begin coming back to Earth after its 19-1-6 start. But head coach Jared Bednar's club is proving it has no intention of taking its foot off the gas.Colorado has followed its 6-3 setback against the New York Islanders with a five-game point streak, winning four contests while dropping the other in a shootout. The Avalanche opened Week 10 with that 4-3 defeat in Nashville, earning the point after defenseman Cale Makar scored the game-tying goal with eight seconds remaining in the third period, but returned home to post wins against the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers and Predators to keep the train rolling.The Avalanche top the NHL with 53 points but are only four in front of the Dallas Stars, who split their four contests last week. Three other teams are climbing the ladder thanks to strong performances, however, as the Carolina Hurricanes won all four of their games to increase their point total to 44 while the Minnesota Wild and New York Islanders both went 3-0-0 to give them 43 and 41 points, respectively.Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Kings failed to record a victory in Week 10, losing overtime decisions to the Seattle Kraken and Calgary Flames before falling to Dallas in regulation to drop out of this week's top 10 ratings. Los Angeles has lost nine of its last 13 contests, although it earned a point in five of those setbacks.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings entering Week 11 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 11 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (2-0-1 in Week 10; 23-2-7 overall)The Avalanche earned five out of a possible six points last week, and it still boggles my mind that they've failed to record one only twice in their first 32 games of the season. The Boston Bruins set NHL records with 65 wins and 135 points in 2022-23 but suffered four regulation losses in their first 26 contests. The 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens finished with a league-record eight regulation losses but dropped two of their first seven games and were 9-3-1 over their first 13 outings. Nathan MacKinnon posted three two-point performances in Week 10 and leads the NHL with 26 goals and 52 points. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner has been kept off the scoresheet just five times this season, as has Cale Makar. A two-time Norris Trophy recipient, Makar is riding a six-game point streak and is first among all defensemen in assists (28) and points (38) while ranking second in goals (10). Meanwhile, Martin Necas was held without a point by Nashville on Saturday, ending a five-game streak during which he racked up a goal and nine assists.2. Carolina Hurricanes (4-0-0; 21-9-2)Carolina's 4-0-0 week might be a bit misleading, as each of its last three victories came in a shootout. But the Hurricanes won the games nonetheless and enter Week 11 atop the Metropolitan Division. And they recorded all four wins without any offensive contribution from Sebastian Aho, who is tied with Seth Jarvis for the team lead with 26 points but is in the midst of a five-game drought. Taylor Hall and Alexander Nikishin were the only three players to land on the scoresheet in three of Carolina's four contests, and the latter is carrying a three-game point streak into the new week. Jarvis was a factor in three of the victories as well, scoring in regulation against the Columbus Blue Jackets and Philadelphia Flyers while netting the decisive shootout goal versus the Washington Capitals.3. Minnesota Wild (3-0-0; 19-9-5)Minnesota is riding a four-game winning streak during which it allowed fewer than three goals in each triumph. Marcus Johansson has been involved offensively amid the run, notching three goals and three assists during a four-game point streak that has followed a five-game dry spell. Joel Eriksson Ek also got on the scoresheet in all four victories after a five-game drought, netting three tallies and setting up four others. Matt Boldy collected two goals and three assists last week to increase his point total to 37 and forge a tie for the team lead with Kirill Kaprizov, who recorded two of each and is tied for third in the NHL with 20 tallies. The 28-year-old Russian left wing became one of only four players in the league to reach the 20-goal plateau thus far this season by converting twice against the Boston Bruins on Sunday. The Wild also received an immediate contribution in that win from 2024 Norris Trophy winner Quinn Hughes, who scored a goal in his team debut two days after being acquired from the Vancouver Canucks.4. Dallas Stars (2-2-0; 22-7-5)One of Minnesota's victories in Week 10 was a 5-2 triumph over the Stars, who split their four games and dropped a few spots in the ratings. Dallas followed that defeat with its first shutout loss of the season, a 4-0 setback against the Panthers, but ended the week with a 4-1 win versus the Los Angeles Kings. Mikko Rantanen racked up three assists in a 4-3 victory over the Winnipeg Jets to extend his point streak to seven games but was blanked in back-to-back outings before netting a tally and setting up another against the Kings. The 29-year-old Finnish right wing is tied for fourth in the NHL with 44 points, while Jason Robertson shares third in goals with 20 after scoring twice last week. Wyatt Johnston also had a solid week offensively, recording a tally and four assists. Meanwhile, Matt Duchene made his presence felt versus Los Angeles as he registered a goal and an assist. The veteran was held without a point in his first four games back from a concussion that kept him sidelined for 24 contests.5. New York Islanders (3-0-0; 19-11-3)After making their season debut in the ratings prior to Week 9, the Islanders climbed five spots by defeating three strong teams in the Vegas Golden Knights, Anaheim Ducks and Tampa Bay Lightning. Emil Heineman has gone eight games without a point and has notched just one in his last 12 contests but was the team hero last week, as the 24-year-old Swedish left wing scored the decisive goal in shootout wins against Vegas and Tampa Bay. Bo Horvat came up with a two-goal performance versus the Golden Knights but missed the meeting with the Lightning due to a lower-body injury and will begin Week 11 on the sideline. Mathew Barzal notched an assists in all three games last week, while captain Anders Lee scored two goals and set up two others in the Isles' 5-2 triumph over Anaheim.6. Vegas Golden Knights (2-0-1; 16-6-9)Even though captain Mark Stone was kept off the scoresheet for the first time this season on Saturday, the Golden Knights still extended their point streak to seven games (6-0-1) with a 3-2 triumph over the Blue Jackets. The 33-year-old right wing, who missed 16 contests this campaign with an upper-body injury, recorded at least one point in each of his first 14 outings of 2025-26 and ranks fourth on the team with 24. Stone did register a pair of two-point performances in Week 10, setting up two goals in Vegas' shootout loss to the Islanders last Tuesday before scoring twice against the Flyers two days later. Columbus also halted Jack Eichel's run of four straight multi-point efforts, but the 29-year-old center notched an assist in the win to extend his overall point streak to five games. Mitch Marner finished the week with five points after collecting three assists versus the Blue Jackets, whie Pavel Dorofeyev (two goals, one assist) landed on the scoresheet in all three of Vegas' contests last week. 7. Anaheim Ducks (2-2-0; 20-12-1)The Ducks began a five-game road trip last Tuesday with a shootout win over the Pittsburgh Penguins but suffered three-goal losses against the Islanders and New Jersey Devils before posting a 4-1 victory against the New York Rangers. Leo Carlsson netted the decisive tally versus the Penguins and notched a point in each of Anaheim's next three games, while Troy Terry recorded three goals and an assist over the team's first three contests of the week. Cutter Gauthier scored twice against the Rangers to end his four-game drought and take over the team lead with 18 goals, and 19-year-old right wing Beckett Sennecke picked up an assist in the triumph after going back-to-back games without a point for the first time since a four-game dry spell from Oct. 23-31. Defenseman Jackson LaCombe, who netted two tallies and set up another in Week 10, has registered a point in five of his last six outings.8. Detroit Red Wings (2-1-0; 18-12-3)The Red Wings continued to pick up points last week, winning two of their three games over a span of four days. The club has earned at least one point in seven of its last eight contests (5-1-2) after suffering four regulation losses in five outings. Alex DeBrincat registered a pair of three-point performances to grab the team lead with 37 points, while Patrick Kane notched two points twice. DeBrincat scored two goals and set up another in a 4-3 triumph over the Flames last Wednesday and repeated the feat in a 4-0 win against the Chicago Blackhawks three days later as Detroit wrapped up a 4-1-1 road trip. Kane set up two tallies in Calgary before recording a goal and an assist at Chicago.9. Washington Capitals (0-1-1; 18-10-4)Washington only played twice in Week 10 but did not post a victory, losing to Carolina 3-2 in a shootout before falling 5-1 to Winnipeg. Connor McMichael recorded a goal and an assist against the Hurricanes after notching just one point (assist) over his previous five games. Defenseman Rasmus Sandin ended his nine-game point drought with a pair of assists in that contest, while Alex Ovechkin also set up two goals last week. Meanwhile, Jakob Chychrun netted his 12th tally in the loss to Winnipeg, putting him two ahead of Colorado's Makar for the NHL lead among blue-liners.10. Tampa Bay Lightning (2-1-1; 18-12-3)The Lightning endured a miserable Week 9 as they scored a total of four goals while suffering four regulation losses. They recovered by earning points in the first three of their four games last week, defeating the Montreal Canadiens and Devils by a combined score of 14-5 before dropping a 3-2 decision to the Islanders in a shootout, but finished with a 5-2 loss to Florida. Nikita Kucherov collected a goal and seven assists, Jake Guentzel netted a tally and set up four others and Oliver Bjorkstrand doubled his point total for the season with two goals and three assists. Brayden Point landed on the scoresheet in all four of Tampa Bay's contests, registering two goals and five assists, and defenseman Darren Raddysh did the same with four tallies and a pair of assists. The 29-year-old Raddysh is having a tremendous season offensively as he already has set a career high with seven goals and ranks fourth on the team with 24 points.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        USC quarterback Jayden Maiava will bypass the 2026 NFL Draft and instead return to school next season, the team announced Tuesday. The Trojans have \"re-signed\" several players in recent days, with Maiava and running back Waymond Jordan among the most important as the program looks ahead to Year 5 under coach Lincoln Riley. With the Alamo Bowl against TCU ahead, Maiava has had an impressive 2025 season, throwing for 3,431 yards and 23 touchdowns to just eight interceptions with six rushing touchdowns while providing stability at the position in his first year as the Trojans' full-time starter. \nMaiava began last season as the backup to Miller Moss before being inserted into the starting lineup for the final three games of the regular season and the Las Vegas Bowl win over Texas A&M. In the 35-31 bowl victory, Maiava impressed with 295 yards passing and four touchdowns.By starting Maiava and benching Moss -- who went on to transfer to Louisville -- Riley was taking a risk. If he didn't play the UNLV transfer down the stretch of the 2024 season, he ran the risk of Maiava walking away before he started in a single game. Riley's gamble paid off, and Maiava will enter next season as USC's undisputed starter -- and potentially one of the best quarterbacks in the country.\nUSC is set at quarterback entering 2026While USC can comfortably say Maiava is the undisputed starter heading into next season, his return logically takes the Trojans out of the transfer market for a starting-caliber quarterback. There have been multiple quarterbacks who have announced their intentions to enter the transfer portal, including Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby and Florida's DJ Lagway. While Riley has used the transfer quarterback market to his advantage throughout his career (see Maiava, Caleb Williams, Jalen Hurts, etc.), it would be surprising to see the Trojans make a splash at that position this time around.\n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPart of the reason is the presence of Husan Longstreet, USC's prized quarterback recruit from the 2025 cycle. Longstreet, rated a five-star prospect by 247Sports, appeared in four games this season and got extensive run during USC's opener against Missouri State, completing all nine of his pass attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown. Because he appeared in just four games, this will be a redshirt year for him. USC also signed four-star quarterback Jonas Williams in its 2026 class. \nHigh expectations for USC heading into 2026Maiava returning coupled with the fact that USC just finished with the No. 1 overall recruiting class in the 2026 cycle by 247Sports, the pressure is on Riley to produce results -- more specifically, a berth in the College Football Playoff. USC has never participated in the CFP since the four-team format was introduced back in 2014, but Riley was plucked away from Oklahoma to push the Trojans back into the top tier of the sport. So far, he has under-delivered with a 35-17 overall record across his four seasons. The Trojans won 11 games in Riley's first season at the helm before dropping to 8-5 in 2023 and 7-6 in 2024, USC's first year as a member of the Big Ten. With a win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30, Riley can secure his second 10-win season with USC.While Maiava will be back in the fold, USC will likely have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season as wide receiver Ja'Kobi Lane and tight end Lake McRee have already declared for the draft, while Makai Lemon -- this year's Biletnikoff Award recipient -- projects as a first-round pick. Looking ahead to next season, could Tanook Hines emerge as a go-to target? Hines, a freshman, has 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns this season and should be in line for a larger role in 2026 as Maiava tries to boost his stock among a 2027 NFL Draft crop that is projecting to be full of star power.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The third NBA Cup has come and gone with Tuesday's championship game. The New York Knicks have joined the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers as champions. The San Antonio Spurs fell just short, but still managed to take home more than $200,000 as the second-place finisher. And now, the season moves on as teams turn their attention back to the far more important chase toward June's championship trophy rather than December's.While the NBA Cup will never hold as much sway over teams and fans as the Larry O'Brien Trophy, the purpose of this in-season tournament was to create a secondary event that could energize the early portion of the season enough to at least give teams out of the running in May and June something else to compete for. Has the NBA Cup done so? Let's go through what's working and what isn't three years into the conception of this tournament.What's working: The elimination gamesIt's a lesson we learn and re-learn every April when the NBA's Play-In Tournament rolls around. If you put NBA players in any sort of winner-take-all format, regardless of who those players are, the results tend to be positive. Even without stakes that affect the pursuit of the end-of-season championship, these single-elimination games produce high drama year after year after year. What's more, they do so for unexpected teams.One of the defining features of the NBA Cup thus far has been its ability to serve as a launching pad for younger teams. The Pacers came out of nowhere to reach the Cup championship game in 2023, but then made the Eastern Conference finals and the NBA Finals in consecutive postseasons. Houston was last year's breakout team, and now the Rockets are a championship contender. San Antonio's run this season was the latest example.\nThe single best thing the NBA Cup does is take young teams without playoff experience and give them a slightly toned-down simulation of what playoff basketball is like. It gives them high-leverage reps that seemingly do translate to the playoffs afterward, and in the process, it introduces more casual fans to teams that they should expect to see quite a bit more of in the years to come. No matter what changes the Cup makes in the coming years, that has to be the heart of the event.What's not working: The tournament structureThe way the tournament ends is by and large a positive. Everything that leads up to that ending? Not so much. The group stage, no matter how they've tweaked it, has generally been a failure. Nothing about it feels like a familiar tournament structure for fans. Simply telling them that games count differently on different nights doesn't cut it. It all feels arbitrary. Why are certain teams in certain groups? Why does point-differential matter? There are answers to these questions. They aren't connecting with the casual viewers the league is trying to attract.At the very least, the tournament games need to be played consecutively. Somehow, the league needs to carve out a section of its calendar to devote fully to this event, because otherwise, it's just too much to expect the average fan to know in advance which nights count, especially since that keeps changing. This year, it was Fridays with a Tuesday and Wednesday thrown in during the week of Thanksgiving. In the past, it was Tuesdays and Fridays. \nThe real solution here is a single-elimination tournament. The problem is numbers. The NBA has 30 teams and it would need 32 for a proper five-round knockout event. The league could sidestep this issue by giving the two reigning NBA finalists first-round byes, advancing 14 other teams and going with a 16-team bracket from there, but as these games need to count in the regular-season standings, everyone probably needs to play the same number of games. Perhaps bringing in foreign teams could work, but expansion is the easiest solution. In an ideal world, 32 teams would compete with loser's brackets being created after each round. Eventually, every team would place between No. 1 and No. 32, with tournament placement serving as the only postseason tiebreaker.Hey, speaking of postseason tiebreakers, it is patently absurd that the Cup champion receives no benefit in the standings for winning the final game. The Spurs and Knicks are both near the top of their respective conferences. They had to play an extra game on their schedules, one that the tournament's early history suggests could hamper them in the coming weeks, when they have to play games that count. To not even give the winning team an extra victory in the standings is frankly a farce. It's conceivable for a Cup winner to lose a tiebreaker in April to a team that it is not, in fact, tied with in reality. If a team wins a game between opening night and the beginning of the postseason, it has to count. How can you expect fans to take these games seriously when you won't even award the winner with a win?What's working: The moneyThere were a number of questions before the tournament began about motivation. How do we get the players to care? Should winning teams get another draft pick? A guaranteed playoff slot? Nope. Turns out, the NBA got it right from the start. Players will play hard when they are financially incentivized to do so -- for themselves and for their teammates. The level of effort and quality of basketball has stood out even against the backdrop of what has been an excellent regular season thus far.\nEven the stars seem invested in winning amounts of money that wouldn't even represent a full game check for them. Why? Because they understand that many of their teammates, especially rookies and two-way players, aren't earning as much. That's been the secret sauce for these payouts. They've become a team-bonding issue. The stars want to take care of their less famous teammates, and that's benefitting everyone even after the tournament ends.What's not working: The venueThe pure concept of finishing the tournament in Las Vegas made some sense. It's an event town, after all, and one the NBA knows quite well thanks to Summer League. They wanted flash for these final games, but they also put an unrealistic burden on fans to create it.Fans didn't know whether their teams would make it to Vegas until Tuesday or Wednesday of last week. They played there on Saturday. That's a shorter turnaround than college basketball fans get from the Elite Eight to the Final Four, which are also far more important games that fans would be much more motivated to travel for.\nAnd then there's the matter of timing. Christmas is in nine days. Most people with the means to travel already had plans to do so elsewhere later in the month. Asking them to figure out the logistics for an impromptu Vegas trip under those conditions was always going to be a stretch. The atmosphere in the arena has reflected that. The crowds, especially in the early games on Saturday, have been pretty lifeless.The NBA, to its credit, seems to have recognized that. Next year, the semifinals are set to be played at home venues. The future of the championship game has reportedly not been decided, and it could possibly move out of Vegas as well. What's working: The cup on the courtThis tournament has one pretty simple aesthetic saving grace: the trophy works. It's distinct from the Larry O'Brien trophy, and it's so simple that it works as a design concept all across the court. The center-court logo obviously works, but adding it into the paint is a very nice touch that again helps these games stand out. That's a concept worth retaining, though considering the slipping issues some of these courts have created, there seems to be more work to be done when it comes to execution.\n\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            What's not working: Everything else about the courtsThe colorful courts were a miss. Even the lighter gold-ish court in Vegas is a bit of a distraction. It was an admirable concept, but fans have certain aesthetic expectations when tuning into a basketball game and a neon green or blood red court just don't meet them. They're more distracting than appealing. Keep it simple next year. Retain the trophy. Ditch the colors.\n            ",

New Ole Miss coach Pete Golding is expected hire Wilson as an assistant coach, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer.During a meeting on Tuesday, Wilson informed LSU players and staff that he will be joining the Rebels after the Tigers' matchup against Houston in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. After Brian Kelly was fired, Wilson was elevated to the role of interim coach and led the team to a 2-2 record with wins over Arkansas and Western Kentucky.While this may be a new gig for Wilson, there is plenty of familiarity with both Golding and Ole Miss. After landing the UTSA job in 2016, one of the first hires made was bringing in Wilson to be his defensive coordinator. Roughly a decade earlier, Wilson served as the running backs at special teams coach for Ole Miss from 2005-07.Wilson, 52, started his coaching career back in 1996 as a graduate assistant at Nicholls State, his alma mater. Wilson then worked his way up the ranks of Louisiana high school football before joining the Ole Miss coaching staff in 2005. He also made stops at Southern Miss, Tennessee and LSU before getting hired by UTSA.\nIn his four years with the Roadrunners, Wilson's record was 19-29 with one bowl appearance. UTSA fired Wilson following the 2019 season, and he spent the next two years as the coach at McNeese State where he went 7-11.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free-agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. D-backs in on Bregman?There have been whispers about a possible trade of Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte for weeks, even as Arizona aims to compete in the tough NL West. As such, if they do deal Marte, where might they turn? Enter free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. The Diamondbacks are \"kicking the tires\" on Bregman, reports USA Today.There's some shuffling to be done here, but it could work. If the D-backs find a taker for Marte -- who has five years and $91 million left on his team-friendly deal -- Bregman could take his place as one of the stars of the team. Bregman plays third and Marte plays second, but infield prospect Jordan Lawlar has experience at both second and third base. It might seem like a lot of effort when they already have Marte locked up long term, but there have been rumors of clubhouse issues around Marte since late in the summer.\nThe Imai marketRight-hander Tatsuya Imai profiles as one of the top starting pitchers on the market this offseason and, with a Jan. 2 signing deadline as part of the posting rules, he's expected to pick his MLB employer soon. Imai has already signaled that he's not inclined to sign with the Dodgers, and instead the Wall Street Journal reports that the Yankees, Cubs, and Phillies are the teams that seem to have the strongest designs on Imai's services. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Imai as the No. 12 free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.King could decide soon\nMichael King's two-season stint in San Diego established him as a frontline starting pitcher, at least when health permits, and that's made him a coveted presence on the free-agent market. Speaking of which, Mark Feinsand of MLB.com reports that King may be the next starting pitcher to make his decision and that the Yankees, Red Sox, Cubs, Orioles, and Mets are at present the strongest contenders for his services. King, 30, transitioned from reliever to starter after the Padres acquired him from the Yankees. Over 45 starts and one relief appearance for San Diego, he put up an ERA+ of 134 and an FIP of 3.65. \nMets eyeing more tradesOut are Pete Alonso, Edwin Díaz, and Brandon Nimmo, and in are Jorge Polanco, Devin Williams, and Marcus Semien. The Mets under David Stearns this winter may not be done churning the roster. Specifically, the rotation could be poised for significant turnover, and said turnover might be achieved via trades. Speaking of which, David Peterson and Kodai Senga are available in trade, Jorge Castillo of ESPN reports, on a contract-for-contract basis with the goal of adding frontline talent to the rotation to accompany promising youngster Nolan McLean. However the specifics shake out, upgrading the rotation in Queens is probably the most essential order of business before the offseason is up. Weaver return on Yanks' radar\nOver the last two seasons and change, right-hander Luke Weaver, 32, has emerged as a lockdown presence in the Yankees bullpen. Weaver's now a free agent, and the Athletic reports that there's mutual interest in a reunion. The Yankees have already lost Devin Williams to the Mets this winter, so re-upping with Weaver could be a bullpen priority for GM Brian Cashman. Giants, Houser agree to dealThe Giants and right-handed pitcher Adrian Houser have agreed to a two-year, $22 million deal with a club option for a possible third year, according to ESPN.\nHouser, 32, has mostly been a starter throughout his career, but he has done some relief work too. Last season, he was excellent in 11 starts for the White Sox, going 6-2 with a 2.10 ERA and 3.0 WAR before being traded to the Rays. With the Rays, in 10 starts, he was 2-3 with a 4.79 ERA and 0.3 WAR. The Giants' rotation is fronted by a pair of All-Stars in Logan Webb and Robbie Ray. Past them, there could well be competition for the last three spots, as things are currently shaping up. Landen Roupp probably did enough to earn another shot in the rotation for 2026, but it's possible he isn't a sure thing. Houser will also be in the mix along with Hayden Birdsong, Kai-Wei Teng, Carson Whisenhunt and Trevor McDonald.Reds add relief helpLeft-handed reliever Caleb Ferguson has agreed to a one-year deal with the Reds, per Cincinnati Enquirer. The 29-year-old Ferguson started his career with the Dodgers but has been well-traveled his last two seasons, having pitched for the Yankees, Astros, Pirates and Mariners. Last year he made 70 appearances, pitching to a 3.58 ERA and 1.16 WHIP with 51 strikeouts in 65 ⅓ innings. He made three appearances in the playoffs for the Mariners. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        North Texas quarterback Drew Mestemaker is likely to enter the transfer portal once the window opens in January, sources tell CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Mestemaker will not make his final decision until after North Texas' Dec. 27 showdown against San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl. Though it makes sense to think that Mestemaker would follow former coach Eric Morris to Oklahoma State if he enters the transfer portal -- especially after he emerged as one of Morris' latest diamond-in-the-rough success stories at quarterback. But the Mean Green star is expected to garner robust interest from quarterback-needy teams, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Mestemaker, who didn't start as a varsity quarterback and instead played defensive back at Vandegrift High School in Austin, Texas, joined North Texas' roster as an unheralded walk-on in 2024. He spent most of his true freshman season as a backup but earned his first career start in the 2024 First Responder Bowl after former North Texas quarterback Chandler Morris transferred to Virginia. Mestemaker wowed in his postseason appearance, as he tallied 448 total yards and three touchdowns in a narrow loss to Texas State. He also solidified himself as North Texas' quarterback of the future. \nIt didn't take long for Mestemaker to prove that his bowl start wasn't a fluke. In North Texas' 2025 season opener against Lamar, Mestemaker threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns while completing 75% of his passes. He also logged a touchdown on the ground. That was the first of three games this season in which Mestemaker had at least three touchdowns passing and one touchdown rushing. Mestemaker guided the Mean Green to an 11-1 regular season record and their first appearance in the American Conference Championship Game, where he accounted for 294 yards and two touchdowns through the air. Mestemaker's 4,129 yards led the FBS -- in fact, he was the only FBS quarterback with at least 4,000 yards passing on the season -- and his 31 touchdowns passing tied with Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin of Ohio State and Baylor's Sawyer Robertson for second-most in the nation. \nThe 6-foot-4 and 211-pound Mestemaker still has three years of eligibility, which adds to his appeal as a potential multi-year starter with more room to develop. \n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMestemaker comes from good stock Mestemaker could be the latest former Eric Morris protege to have success in the transfer portal. A former assistant at Texas Tech, where he tutored Patrick Mahomes, Morris was the head coach at Incarnate Word from 2018-21 and the offensive coordinator at Washington State in 2022. At Incarnate Word, he discovered a lightly recruited quarterback prospect named Cam Ward. Ward signed with UIW in 2020 and won the Jerry Rice Award as the most outstanding freshman in the FCS. He followed Morris to Washington State, where he threw for 3,735 yards and 25 touchdowns. \nWhen Morris left to become the coach at North Texas, Ward transferred to Miami. He finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting and was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after leading the FBS with 39 touchdowns passing in his lone season with the Hurricanes. Morris also recruited John Mateer, who is gearing up for a College Football Playoff run with Oklahoma, and Emmett Brown, who threw for 16 touchdowns at San Jose State last season, while he was at Washington State. Morris' first starter at North Texas, Chandler Morris, transferred to Virginia ahead of the 2025 season. Chandler Morris guided the Cavaliers to their first 10-win regular season since 1989 with 2,802 yards and 18 touchdowns passing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a new Bradley taking up a Major League Soccer coaching gig as Michael Bradley will lead the next era of the New York Red Bulls after winning the MLS Next Pro title in 2025 with their youth squad, RBNY II. Bradley has been on the fast track, rising through the coaching ranks with this appointment coming only six months after he began his tenure with Next Pro side.The son of legendary American coach Bob Bradley, Michael isn't far removed from his playing career, which ended in 2023 with Toronto FC. He followed that by joining his dad as an assistant with Stabaek in Norway before coming back stateside to join the Red Bulls system. For a team that has been set for years in the Red Bull global playing style, Bradley will offer a breath of fresh air to a system that needs it after seeing a 15-year streak of consecutive appearances in the MLS postseason come to an end, one year removed from losing in the 2024 MLS Cup to the Los Angeles Galaxy.\"I am excited for the opportunity to be head coach of the club that I started my professional career with and also in the state that I call home,\" Bradley said. \"I'm looking forward to working alongside everyone here and doing my part to help this club achieve the success our fans deserve.\"The team that Bradley began his playing career with, the New York MetroStars, may not exist in name, but becoming the head coach of the club long after its change to Red Bulls is a significant step in Bradley's coaching career after a 20-year playing career. It may be early on in his coaching journey, but with him taking charge in MLS, it's also hard not to think about what could be next if Bradley does well with the Red Bulls.\nDue to the global system of the Red Bulls, success here could see Bradley end up at RB Salzburg in Austria to continue to grow as a coach in the European Leagues in a similar path that led to Jesse Marsch eventually moving to the Premier League, but there's also another path that even one successful season in MLS could open for the American.Mauricio Pochettino is out of contract with the United States men's national team following the 2026 World Cup, and if he ends up going back to Europe to coach a club team, there's no reason why Bradley wouldn't enter the conversation. Jim Curtin and Steve Cherundolo are both experienced American coaches who are free agents at the moment, but with each having personal reasons for not taking certain jobs, it's unknown if they would be in a position to take the role if it were to open.If U.S. Soccer wanted to take a look at an American to undergo a long-term role, there would be worse places to look than with someone who has 151 caps for the national team, the third most in history, while also representing the USMNT at two World Cups in 2010 and 2014. \nBefore any of this can be considered, what Bradley does with the Red Bulls in 2026 will be critical, but there's no reason why his coaching star won't continue to rise if he's able to oversee a rebuild with the squad and lead them back to the MLS Cup Playoffs. Coaching is in Bradley's blood, and now, with a new MLS season upcoming, it'll be a chance to see what he can do under pressure with the stakes even higher.\n            ",

I wouldn't say it is a bad week, but it is certainly a strange week. On my first run of projections, Jacoby Brissett came out as QB3, and last week's QB1, Trevor Lawrence, is not in the top 12. There are four QBs I have projected for at least 22 Fantasy points; if you have one of them, you don't have much to think about. They are Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, Brissett, and Jared Goff. Then the fun starts. I have 12 QBs projected between 20 Fantasy points and 21.6. One of the most challenging is Matthew Stafford.Stafford is QB2 on the season. I understand if you are starting him without reservation. But he is also at Seattle, on a short week, likely without Davante Adams. Those three circumstances don't exactly inspire confidence. The Seahawks have given up seven combined Fantasy points to the last three QBs they have faced. Stafford had 17 points when he faced this defense at home in Week 11. At the very least, I would certainly start the four QBs above over him. I would also start Jaxson Dart, Dak Prescott, Brock Purdy, and  Drake Maye over him without thinking much about it. The two difficult choices that came out higher in the projections are Justin Herbert and Bo Nix.Herbert is facing a Cowboys defense that has given up the most Fantasy points to opposing QBs. Nix is at home against Jacksonville, and he has been a much better Fantasy QB at home than on the road. Neither of these are easy calls and ultimately come down to your personal preference. Part of that is your preference in terms of who you think will perform better. Part of it is who will cause you to lose more sleep if you bench them and they go bananas.Let's get to the rest of the Week 16 preview:\n\n        Week 16 QB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            26.6 -- The 26.6 Fantasy points Jacoby Brissett scored against the Texans in Week 15 is the most any QB has scored against them all season.6.1 -- Joe Burrow is averaging 6.1 yards per pas attempt, the lowest mark of his career.23.97 -- Bo Nix is averaging 23.97 FPPG in seven home games this year.

There is not a QB available in even 30% of CBS leagues that ranks inside my top 18 this week. You do not want to stream a quarterback in Fantasy playoffs. But I understand some of you lose Patrick Mahomes last week and still advanced. If you have no other options, I would stream Tyler Shough before Gardner Minshew or Marcus Mariota. Shough has scored 20 Fantasy points in three straight starts, and he has a home game against the Jets, who just gave up 53 points to Trevor Lawrence.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n

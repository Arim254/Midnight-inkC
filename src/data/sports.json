    "body": "\n        The 2026 NFL playoffs kick off on Saturday with an NFC doubleheader, starting with the Carolina Panthers (8-9) hosting the Los Angeles Rams (12-5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by the Chicago Bears (11-6) hosting the Green Bay Packers (9-7-1) at 8 p.m. ET. Despite having a losing record, the Panthers are the home team as the NFC South champions, and despite not winning their division, the Rams have the second-shortest odds at the majority of sportsbooks to win the 2026 Super Bowl. The Rams are 10-point favorites over the Panthers in the latest NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, while the over/under is 45.5. The Packers are 1.5-point favorites against the Bears in an NFC North battle, with an over/under of 44.5 in the latest NFL odds. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL Wild Card Weekend, specifically on Rams vs. Panthers and Bears vs. Packers on Saturday. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Panthers vs. Rams and Packers vs. Bears on Saturday, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Sportsbook offersBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets instantlyCBSBET365CaesarsFirst bet matched up to $250 as bonus bets, win or loseCBSSPORTS250BMFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash CBSFANThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

SportsLine's proven computer model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.Saturday Wild Card Weekend betting preview, picksRams (-10) vs. PanthersThe Panthers defeated the Rams, 31-28, in Carolina in Week 13. However, a one-of-17 regular-season game and a win-or-go-home postseason contest are two completely different situations, and the model expects two completely different results. The Rams have the No. 1 scoring offense at 30.5 points per game this season, and the No. 10 scoring defense at 20.4 ppg allowed. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is the betting favorite to win the NFL MVP this year after leading the league in passing yards (4,707) and touchdowns (46) while throwing eight interceptions. Two of those eight interceptions came against the Panthers, and those are mistakes the 37-year-old quarterback is unlikely to make in a postseason game. The Panthers lost back-to-back games to end the season and made the playoffs after the Saints defeated the Falcons on Sunday, after Carolina lost to Tampa Bay the day before with the chance to lock up the division themselves. The model projects the Rams to cover in 53% of simulations. Bet on the Rams at FanDuel, where new users get $200 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Bears (+1.5) vs. PackersThe Bears host the Packers on Saturday, and although it came via a fourth-quarter and overtime comeback, Chicago defeated Green Bay at Soldier Field, 22-16, less than a month ago. The Bears erased a 10-point deficit in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter to force overtime, and then defeated the Packers on a 46-yard touchdown from Caleb Williams to D.J. Moore in the extra period. Although it came late, Chicago showed how it can score points in bunches, and the Bears have the No. 9 scoring offense at 23.9 ppg in Ben Johnson's first season as the team's head coach. The Packers have lost four straight games in a streak that started the game in which Micah Parsons tore his ACL. Parsons was a significant defensive loss for the Packers, hindering the entire unit. The model projects the Bears to cover in 54% of simulations. Bet the Bears at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get your first bet up to $250 in bonus bets, whether it wins or loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are here as six matchups are set to unfold over the course of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists the Rams at -10 vs. the Panthers and the Packers at -1.5 vs. the Bears on Saturday. On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at +1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -6 vs. the 49ers, and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. The highest over/under on Sunday's NFL schedule is 51.5 points in Bills vs. Jaguars. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3 points on the road against the Steelers. SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 13Green Bay Packers (-1.5) at Chicago Bears\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Jacksonville Jaguars (-1.5) vs. Buffalo Bills\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24Philadelphia Eagles (-6) vs. San Francisco 49ers\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 14Los Angeles Chargers (+3.5) at New England Patriots\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 19Houston Texans (-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\nNFL Wild Card Weekend 2026 has arrived, and a dozen teams are set to take the field over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday. You'll have the option of making NFL picks and crafting a Wild Card NFL parlay on games with large spreads, like Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) or ones with slim lines, such as Bills vs. Jaguars (-1.5). Meanwhile, Steelers vs. Texans on Monday has Houston favored by 3 points, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. The Steelers have lost six straight postseason games -- five coming by double-digits -- which could make playing the alternate lines intriguing with an NFL longshot parlay.Pittsburgh's average margin of defeat across these six losses is 13.7 points, and you could make NFL prop bets on the winning margin for this matchup. Predicting Houston to win by 13 to 18 points would return +650, as that could be one leg of a massive payout for the opening week of the 2026 NFL playoffs. Before making any Wild Card NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Wild Card NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.2 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Wild Card Weekend NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a six-leg NFL parlay that could pay out $1.2 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Wild Card NFL parlay picksFor Wild Card Weekend, one of the picks featured in the six-leg parlay is Brock Purdy as an anytime touchdown scorer (+650) in 49ers vs. Eagles on Sunday. Only one team has allowed more rushing touchdowns to opposing quarterbacks than Philly, which has given up three rushing scores to quarterbacks over the last two games alone. Philly has also allowed the second-most rushing yards to opposing QBs this year, and Purdy is much more mobile, and willing, to run than many realize.He has two rushing touchdowns over his last two games, and Purdy's scored eight touchdowns on the ground since the start of last season, despite missing 10 games. That's more rushing TDs than Lamar Jackson (six) or Kyler Murray (six) and is as many as Jayden Daniels. Additionally, the Eagles have given up the fewest passing touchdowns in the redzone, which could force Purdy to scramble towards the endzone in these situations. That makes these long odds worthy of investing in as one leg of a longshot parlay. See the rest of the picks in the Wild Card NFL parlay here.You can bet Purdy as an anytime touchdown scorer at using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.2 millionThe parlay also includes five additional picks from SportsLine's computer model, including a pair of first touchdown scorer props that return at least +1000.

    "body": "\n        Arman Tsarukyan will be ready to replace Paddy Pimblett or Justin Gaethje at UFC 324, whether the promotion wants him to or not.Tsarukyan finds himself in no man's land as UFC's first event on Paramount+ approaches. On Jan. 24, Pimblett and Gaethje will fight for the interim lightweight title amid reigning champion Ilia Topuria's absence. No. 1-ranked lightweight Tsarukyan is notably omitted from the conversation. Tsarukyan says the promotion has not contacted him about being the backup fighter for UFC 324's main event. While Tsarukyan isn't keen on cutting weight without a guaranteed fight, he'll do it if the promotion asks. \"I haven't talked to them, and I wouldn't cut weight just for money because it's hard,\" Tsarukyan told CBS Sports before his freestyle wrestling debut at RAF 5 on Saturday. \"If they ask me, I'll do it, but they didn't ask. It's better for me not to cut weight. If I cut, I want to fight.\"Cutting weight takes a significant toll on the body. Tsarukyan served as the backup fighter for the vacant lightweight title fight between Topuria and Charles Oliveira at UFC 317. Tsarukyan put his body through a grueling weight cut but never fought, though he was paid. \n\"I already cut weight last June, and nothing happened,\" Tsarukyan said. \"I spent my energy on the training camp and weight cut. It's always stressful to cut weight.\"If something happens, I'll be there. If not, I'll wait for my shot.\"His willingness to support UFC 317 appeared to mend his relationship  with the promotion. It's believed matchmakers soured on him after he pulled  out of a main event title fight with Islam Makhachev on 24 hours'  notice. Yet he was once again passed up for a title shot this year. Tsarukyan claims he doesn't know why the promotion picked Pimblett and Gaethje over him, but after this interview was recorded, UFC CEO Dana White shed light on the situation. White told Barstool Sports that Tsarukyan's headbutting of Dan Hooker during their final face-off in November was a factor.Tsarukyan hopes to compete again in June, if not as a late replacement for UFC 324. For now, he remains incredibly active between UFC fights. Eleven days after grappling Shara \"Bullet\" Magomedov in Armenia, Tsarukyan competes in freestyle wrestling. His appetite for a last-minute title shot at UFC 324 perfectly intersects with RAF 5. \n\"There is a big UFC fight on Jan. 24. I need to be in shape. That's why I took the freestyle wrestling match with RAF...\" Tsarukyan said. \"It's good that I'm here. In case UFC needs me, I'm in shape. I'm always training so I can jump in.\"Tsarukyan takes on four-time NCAA Division I All-American folkstyle wrestler Lance Palmer, who is also a two-time PFL featherweight champion. Palmer, albeit smaller than Tsarukyan, is a far more decorated grappler than the recent names Tsarukyan has outgrappled, such as Benson Henderson and Patricky Pitbull.\"I haven't competed in freestyle wrestling since I was young,\" Tsarukyan said. \"I have no experience. Lance is a good name to beat in wrestling...\n\"It's a good experience. I want to see how good my freestyle wrestling is. I train a lot with the Russian and Armenian national wrestling teams.\"Check out the full interview with Arman Tsarukyan below.  \nTsarukyan is in a frustrating position, but he's approaching it with extreme patience publicly. Tsarukyan is confident he'd thrash the two men competing for the interim title and that his ascent is inevitable. \"There  are no names I should beat. UFC knows I'm the No. 1 contender,\"  Tsarukyan said. \"They know I'm a big problem for everyone. They know I  can beat Gaethje, Paddy and Topuria. That's why they give others a  chance. I had my chance, I lost my chance, unfortunately. It is what it  is. Soon, I'll get my belt.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 1 seed Indiana is emerging from the College Football Playoff semifinals looking like one of the most dominant teams of the modern era and a potentially inevitable national champion. However, No. 10 seed Miami will have something to say about it on Jan. 19 inside Hard Rock Stadium, when the teams collide with a national championship on the line.The Hurricanes rattled off their third straight CFP win over a higher-seeded opponent on Thursday night with a 31-27 Fiesta Bowl win over No. 6 seed Ole Miss. It wasn't a perfect performance from the 'Canes, but it brought out the best in sixth-year senior quarterback Carson Beck and the Miami offense.It will take a complete effort from all units for Miami to contend with the Hoosiers, who obliterated No. 5 seed Oregon 56-22 in Friday night's Peach Bowl. The Hoosiers have now won 10 of their 15 games by 24 or more points, including 30+ point victories over Alabama and the Ducks in the CFP. IU refuses to beat itself and then punishes opponents for miscues. That was the story against the Ducks, who committed three costly turnovers while turning in a dud of a performance.Against that backdrop, here are the grades for the four CFP semifinal competitors.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 1 seed IndianaGrade: A+  Result: 56-22 win vs. No. 5 seed OregonWhat Indiana did to Alabama and Oregon in back-to-back games -- beginning its CFP run with an average victory margin of 34.5 points -- would be stunning even if it was a program with the brand cache of Georgia or Ohio State. In just two years, Curt Cignetti has developed the Hoosiers from a doormat to become as overpowering as any recent title-winning team. A 3-0 edge in the turnover battle along with 10 tackles for loss helped tell the story against the Ducks. So did a 17-for-20 passing performance from Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who tossed five touchdowns to bring his season tally to 41.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 5 seed OregonGrade: F  Result: 56-22 loss vs. No. 1 seed IndianaOregon collapsed under the weight of three devastating first-half turnovers that left it in a 35-7 halftime hole. The Ducks' misery began with a pick-6 on the first play from scrimmage to start a nightmare showing for quarterback Dante Moore. The redshirt sophomore also fumbled deep in Oregon territory twice in the second quarter to essentially hand the Hoosiers a pair of touchdowns. It was an absolute nightmare for a Ducks team that failed miserably in its quest to redeem a regular season loss against Indiana. The defense sacked IU quarterback Fernando Mendoza just once and struggled mightily in the red zone.\n    \n                                        \n    No. 6 seed Ole MissGrade: A-  Result: 31-27 loss vs. No. 10 seed MiamiOle Miss struggled out of the gate offensively with a pair of three-and-outs and didn't convert on a third down until the fourth quarter. The result was five drives ending in field goal attempts and a lackluster time of possession. Defensively, the Rebels did an admirable job of bending without breaking until the final seven minutes. That's when Miami finally broke the dam with a pair of long touchdowns rives against a fatiguing Ole Miss group. It was still a gutsy effort from the Rebels, who stayed in it until the end and represented themselves well in concluding a wild and historic season with a heartbreaking defeat.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 10 seed MiamiGrade: A-  Result: 31-27 win vs. No. 6 seed Ole MissMiami's offense is somewhat surprisingly the unit carrying this grade after the Hurricanes dominated time of possession and then broke Ole Miss with two late 75-yard touchdown drives. Quarterback Carson Beck rewrote his collegiate legacy by capping those possessions with a touchdown pass and then a decisive 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds left. He also got tons of help from receivers Malachi Toney and Keelan Marion, running back Mark Fletcher Jr. and a strong offensive line. The grade isn't a clean \"A\" because Miami committed 10 costly penalties and was less disruptive than usual on defense. Even after a big win, there were plenty of coaching points for Mario Cristobal.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fourteen seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, an NFL MVP, a place in the team's Ring of Honor and holding every passing record in franchise history just weren't enough for Matt Ryan. Now, the legendary Falcons quarterback has been named the first-ever president of football for the organization.Falcons owner Arthur Blank named Ryan to the post Saturday in what had been a move widely expected around the league for more than a week. Ryan, who has spent the past three seasons as an NFL analyst for CBS Sports, will be considered the primary football executive with the Falcons, a designation usually granted to a person holding the general manager title. Atlanta will now embark on its dual searches for a new head coach and GM.\"His EQ and IQ when it comes to football is extraordinarily high,\" Blank said of Ryan this week. \"I've known Matt personally since 2008, and his family, and he's an outstanding individual, great community leader and kind of person we certainly would want to consider in that position.\"Ryan covered NFL games for CBS Sports in 2023 before serving on \"The NFL Today\" studio panel in 2024 and 2025.\n\"We couldn't be happier for Matt. Becoming the President of Football with the same organization he once guided as an MVP quarterback is an incredible opportunity,\" said CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson. \"Matt is an outstanding teammate, leader and friend, and we thank him for his time at CBS Sports. We know he'll bring the same level of excellence to this new role that defined his playing career and his time with us.\"\"I want to thank the incredible team at CBS Sports,\" Ryan said. \"I loved my three years there and I am truly grateful for their support in pursuing this opportunity. The CBS Sports culture is amazing, and I have made teammates and friends for life.\"The Falcons interviewed four other candidates for the president of football position: Carolina's Brandt Tilis, Detroit's Mike Disner, San Francisco's Josh Williams and Chicago's Ian Cunningham. All four men are now theoretically candidates for the GM role under Ryan.\nSources tell CBS Sports the Falcons general manager role will be a traditional post with the person holding it having control of the draft and roster; however, Ryan will have the final say in his position as president of football.The unique setup in Atlanta offers a challenge to a league-directed interview and hiring process as the Falcons take their next step.Last year, the Tennessee Titans elevated Chad Brinker, who had previously served as assistant GM to Ran Carthon, to president of football operations without a formal interview process. Brinker then led the search to hire general manager Mike Borgonzi.\nThe gray structure did not align with the steps the league had previously laid out as sports teams across the country continue to evolve their front offices. As such, the NFL league office recently took greater control over who has the final say on the \"primary football executive\" across the 32 clubs. Last week, the Titans announced a more \"straightforward\" structure between Brinker and Borgonzi.What the Titans did over the past year makes this move a bit more complicated for the Falcons. On paper, the vacant Atlanta general manager job is considered a \"secondary football executive\" position with the league office, akin to an assistant GM position on a team. So, even though the Falcons general manager will be a true GM in practice, the job is subject to league rules regarding a position akin to assistant GM at this time.That means the Falcons do not actually have to interview anyone for their vacant general manager job. Although highly recommended by the league, teams can fill secondary football executive positions without a formal process. However, someone as thorough as Blank, who is proud to represent the NFL shield, will likely follow through with an interview procedure nonetheless.\nDue to the Falcons' general manager role now being seen as secondary, they cannot hire someone whose current team remains in the playoffs, according to league rules. (This differs from the Dolphins, who hired Packers executive Jon-Eric Sullivan for their general manager position because it is their primary football executive role.) If Atlanta wanted to hire either Cunningham, Tilis or Williams, it would have to wait until the Bears, Panthers or 49ers, respectively, are done with their postseason runs. Disner's Lions did not make the playoffs.The Falcons' change in structure creates another issue: The current employers of these candidates can now block them from accepting interviews. Those four men originally interviewed for a primary football executive role as secondary executives with their teams. Now that Atlanta's GM job could be considered a lateral move due to its hierarchy, if a current employer wishes to halt further conversations for that position, the team has the right.Still, sources do view the Falcons' job as much closer to a traditional GM job than anything else.\nAtlanta can interview others for the general manager role in the coming days and weeks and may well do that now that Ryan is installed at the top of the food chain. Cunningham, the Bears' assistant GM, has been considered a top candidate for the job with his background and resume. Williams, the 49ers' director of scouting and football operations, is the only person to have interviewed for both available top personnel gigs this cycle.Ryan will immediately begin his search for the head coach of his franchise. There is clear interest within the team in former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, though sources believe Atlanta will not go all-in on the hot candidate too early.One early tell is the Falcons' blocking of defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich from interviewing for other defensive coordinator positions. Atlanta did not block offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from interviewing with the rival Buccaneers, but it is clear Blank and others value Ulbrich at defensive coordinator. That may signal the team will not choose a defensive-minded coach.\nAtlanta has until Monday to virtually interview coaches with the Seahawks and Broncos. Beginning early next week, it can virtually interview coaches from wild-card teams, and the Falcons can interview coaches on teams not in the playoffs at any point. In-person interviews with candidates currently employed cannot begin until Jan. 19, though out-of-work coaches can be interviewed at any point.The Falcons have not made the playoffs in eight seasons, their longest drought since the 1980s. They now turn to the man responsible for the franchise's greatest on-field success for more of it in the future.\n            ",

The Bears have defensive issues that have shown up lately that Jordan Love, who will be back, can exploit. The Packers will go after Caleb Williams like they did in the two other meetings. That could lead to a lot of big plays and a lot of points for both teams -- if the weather isn't a disaster. In the end, the Packers and Love will get the best of it.Pick: Packers 27, Bears 24Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis young Jaguars team is one of the bigger surprises in the league, but they do a lot of things well. They finished as the top run defense and no back ran for over 75 yards against them during the season. That will be big against James Cook, who led the league in rushing. If they can stop Cook, that will put a lot on Josh Allen, who is more than capable. On the other side, the Bills have had defensive issues, while the Jaguars have played well on offense with Trevor Lawrence. Look for that to continue. This will be fun to watch as both quarterbacks light it up with Lawrence winning it late.Pick: Jaguars 32, Bills 28San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-5.5)Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles come in with a dominating defense, while the 49ers have a good offense. That's the matchup that will decide the game. The 49ers defense has struggled all year, while the Eagles offense has as well. Something has to give. I think the Eagles offense will get it going some here against the 49ers defense. Look for a big game from Saquon Barkley. On the other side, I look for the Eagles to limit Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense. The Eagles get it going some on offense and advance to the next round.Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 17Los Angeles Chargers (+3.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 8 p.m. ET on NBC\nThis is a long trip for the Chargers. It's also a big game for quarterback Justin Herbert, who has yet to win a playoff game. The problem is the offensive line in front of him has issues. The Patriots defense should be able to limit the Chargers' run game and pressure Herbert. On the other side, the Chargers have a top 10 defense and that could challenge Drake Maye. The Patriots have averaged 168.6 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per carry over the last five games, so look for them to run it early and often. If Herbert isn't protected on the other side, it could be a long night for the Chargers. But this is Maye's first playoff game and the Chargers defense is good against the pass. It's close, but the Pats win it late.   Pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 23Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans have one of the best defenses in the league and that can be a problem for a Steelers offense that is just OK. Aaron Rodgers does have a lot of playoff experience, which matters. He also gets back DK Metcalf in this one, which is big. The Steelers offensive line has also been good as of late. The Texans offense has been better during a nine-game winning streak, but this will come down to Houston's offensive line against the Steelers' front. That's a problem. Look for the Steelers to force some mistakes by C.J. Stroud as Pittsburgh advances behind its defensive front in a playoff upset.Pick: Steelers 23, Texans 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The condensed nature of college football's 2026 transfer portal cycle has turned the midway point of the window into a full-blown sprint. With just 15 days to evaluate options, players and programs alike have been cramming visits into back-to-back-to-back days, often hopping from campus to campus with little downtime as decisions loom. The urgency has been reflected in the sheer volume of movement: 4,760 Division I players entered the portal during the first week alone.That early surge has already reshaped the board. More than half of the top 50 players in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports transfer portal rankings have either committed or signed, thinning the market at several positions. Still, the cupboard is far from bare. A strong group of high-level talent remains available, including impact players in the trenches and a handful of quarterbacks capable of immediately altering a program's trajectory.Unlike previous cycles, there will be no spring transfer window to provide a second chance at roster correction. Once the clock expires, that's it. No more entries. The current window runs through Jan. 16, leaving programs only days -- not months -- to close on their top targets. \nAs the cycle hits its midpoint, here's a quick look at the five top available transfers.\n        \n            \n                Washington QB Demond Williams Jr. returning to Huskies days after controversial transfer portal announcement\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. Sam Leavitt, QB, Arizona StateThe most wanted man in portal town with top teams in need of an experienced quarterback for the 2026 season in hot pursuit. The former Arizona State star continues to take visits a week into this transfer window with a trip to Miami expected following stops at LSU and Tennessee, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Lane Kiffin is making Sam Leavitt a top priority, pulling out every stop to ensure the Tigers remain firmly in the race for the portal's No. 1 overall prospect.Leavitt spent the past two seasons at Arizona State, posting a 16-4 record as a starting quarterback while leading the Sun Devils to a Big 12 Championship and CFP berth in 2024. He threw for 4,513 yards and 34 touchdowns with nine interceptions, adding another 749 yards and 10 scores rushing in 20 games. Leavitt has two years of eligibility remaining.\n2. Cam Coleman, WR, AuburnThis is a strong portal class when it comes to receivers, but none are more talented than five-star prospect Cam Coleman. After two seasons of inconsistent quarterback play at Auburn, the 6-foot-3, 200-pounder needs a fresh start to reach his potential -- and there's no shortage of options. It started with a trip to Texas where he remained in the Lone Star State with visits to Texas A&M and Texas Tech. Coleman was also expected at Alabama on Friday, according to CBS Sports Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz.Coleman's production at Auburn was solid. Over the past two seasons, he has accumulated 1,306 yards receiving and 13 touchdowns on 93 catches across 25 games. He ranks as the No. 1 wide receiver and No. 4 overall prospect in Cooper Petagna's 247Sports transfer portal rankings. Coleman has two years of eligibility remaining, but would be a candidate to enter the 2027 NFL Draft with a strong season.3. Chaz Coleman, EDGE, Penn StateChaz Coleman saw limited action during his first and only season at Penn State, but the upside of the former four-star recruit remains sky-high. The No. 1 edge rusher and No. 5 overall prospect in this transfer cycle, Coleman opened his visit slate with a trip to LSU before heading to Tennessee, where his former Nittany Lions defensive coordinator and several familiar staffers are now on staff. He also made a stop at Ohio State earlier this week, according to Hummer and Zenitz.\nIn nine games during the 2025 season, Coleman totaled eight tackles, including three for loss, added a sack, forced a fumble and recovered two more -- production that only hints at his long-term ceiling.4. Damon Wilson II, EDGE, MissouriAfter just one year at Missouri, Damon Wilson II is back in the transfer portal. He went through this process last cycle following two seasons at Georgia, which is currently suing Wilson for $390,000 in alleged damages tied to a disputed NIL buyout clause. Wilson is now searching for his third school in four years.In 39 career games played, the 6-foot-4, 250-pound pass rusher has 49 total tackles, including 15.5 for loss with 12.5 sacks, an interception and two fumble recoveries. He had his most productive campaign in 2025, posting the third-highest sack total (9) in the SEC. Wilson has one year of eligibility remaining.\n5. James Smith, DL, AlabamaTransfers from the defensive front account for half of Cooper Petagna's 247Sports top 10 transfer portal rankings. The top interior defensive lineman in this cycle is James Smith, who appears to be a package deal with former Alabama and high school teammate Qua Russaw. The duo took visits to Georgia, LSU, Missouri, Ohio State and Tennessee with others involved as well, according to Zenitz.Smith is the No. 1 defensive lineman and No. 7 overall prospect in the portal. In the past two seasons, he combined to make 48 total tackles, including 10 for loss with 3.5 sacks, three pass breakups and a fumble recovery for the Crimson Tide. Smith has two years of eligibility remaining.\n            ",

You can watch it on CBS and streaming on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports App and  Paramount+ Premium.The Wolverines are 14-0 overall, 4-0 in the Big Ten, with 10 of those victories coming by at least 25 points. They beat Gonzaga by 40 and Auburn and USC by 30. Because each of those teams had a number next to their name at the time of the game, Michigan became the first team in AP poll history to win three straight games against ranked opponents by at least 30 points. Moreover, the Wolverines are now the clear favorite to win the 2026 NCAA Tournament, at +380, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Their net rating of +37.46 is higher than any net rating any national champion has recorded in the history of the KenPom.com database that dates back to the 1996-97 season.\n\n        \n            \n                Michigan vs. Wisconsin prediction, pick, odds, spread: Wolverines' undefeated record on the line vs. Badgers\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYaxel Lendeborg is Michigan's leading scorer.

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include J.J. McCarthy (hand) being out and Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion/shoulder) being day to day.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $250 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 17 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 17: The model is fading Jags wideout Brian Thomas Jr., a Pro Bowler last year who finished third in receiving yards. Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 17 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising quarterback could lead you to victory?

The Lions have won five of the last six matchups, but their spread success goes back beyond that. Detroit sports a 9-1 ATS record versus Minnesota over their last 10 meetings. Additionally, there's no greater discrepancy between these teams than what's arguably the most important statistic in football, and that's turnovers. The Lions have the fewest giveaways (eight) in the NFL, while the Vikings have the most (29). See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Vikings can coverMinnesota has found its groove as it has both outright won and covered in three straight games. The defense has been the catalyst as it had a season-high-tying of five sacks in Sunday's win over New York. Minnesota's defense also didn't allow a touchdown in that game, which came two weeks after pitching a shutout of Atlanta. The Vikings are on an amazing run of six straight games without giving up a passing score, and Justin Jefferson finally got going to help out the offense. He's coming off an 85-yard game, which is as many yards that he had over his previous four games combined and is his most yards since Week 5. His success could continue versus Detroit's No. 25 pass defense that has given up the fourth-most passing TDs. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Lions vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Lions 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL Christmas schedule concludes with a \"Thursday Night Football\" AFC West battle of teams in a surprising position as the Kansas City Chiefs host the Denver Broncos. The Broncos (12-3) lead the entire AFC and are chasing a top seed and a bye in the NFL playoffs. Kansas City, meanwhile, has been eliminated from the playoff picture. Kansas City is starting Chris Oladokun at quarterback after losing Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew to knee injuries in consecutive weeks. Chiefs LB Nick Bolton (illness) is listed as questionable.Kickoff from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The latest Broncos vs. Chiefs odds have Denver favored by 13.5 points, according to DraftKings Sportsbook. Meanwhile, the over/under for total points scored is 38.5, which is a 2-point increase from opening at 36.5. Denver is at -1064 on the money line (risk $1,064 to win $100). Before making any Chiefs vs. Broncos picks, check out the NFL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Kansas City has been decimated by injuries at quarterback, but still has star power in tight end Travis Kelce, defensive lineman Chris Jones, receiver Xavier Worthy and others. Even in a the midst of a lost season, they'll be highly-motivated to avoid a blowout at the hands of their division rivals in the national spotlight. Denver is just 2-5 against the spread on the road and it only has two double-digit wins this season. The Broncos are also coming off a poor showing against the Jaguars, losing 34-20 despite being 3.5-point favorites in that Week 16 matchup. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverDenver has more to play for as the Broncos have the inside track for the top seed in the AFC side of the NFL playoff bracket. The Broncos already beat the Chiefs 22-19 last month, and that was when Kansas City had Mahomes and was still in contention, so a much bigger margin could be in play in this one. The Chiefs are just 5-10 overall this season against the spread. They are also just 1-7 ATS against quality opponents (teams that have won 55% or more of games) 0-7 ATS against teams that give up fewer than 21 points per game. Denver ranks fifth in the NFL in scoring defense (19.7 ppg), fourth in the NFL in total defense (291.6 ypg) and leads the league in total sacks (63) by a wide margin, making life extremely tough on a quarterback with virtually no experience. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Chiefs vs. Broncos picksSportsLine's model has simulated Broncos vs. Chiefs 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 36 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe NFL Christmas Day tradition is a relatively new one, but most fans won't complain about spending another holiday watching football. One could make a Christmas NFL parlay from the three games on this year's slate, featuring Cowboys vs. Commanders (+8.5 at DraftKings) at 1 p.m. ET, Lions vs. Vikings (+7.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET and Chiefs vs. Broncos (-13.5) at 8:15 p.m. ET. A football parlay could consist of NFL player props, spread picks, over/under bets, money line predictions, or some combination of those. Players one could target with anytime touchdown NFL props include CeeDee Lamb (+115), George Pickens (+125), Aaron Jones (+150), Courtland Sutton (+140) and Travis Kelce (+400).The Chiefs are used to being favored by double-digits rather than underdogs, but that's their reality with backup quarterback, Gardner Minshew, now out after injuring his knee a week after Patrick Mahomes did the same. Underdogs of 13-plus points are 1-10 straight up this season but are 7-4 against the spread. Thus, making NFL bets that back the Broncos to win but the Chiefs to cover could be two legs of your NFL Christmas Day parlay. Before locking in any Christmas NFL picks or NFL parlays, be sure to see the NFL predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer model.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Lamb as an anytime touchdown scorer.

No team has eclipsed the total quite like Dallas this season as the Over is 11-4 for the team, the best Over percentage in the league. The Cowboys have gone over in each of their last four games, while four of their last five matchups with Washington have also gone over. That includes their Week 7 contest, which was one of the highest-scoring games of the season with 66 total points.The Commanders have also leaned over this year, as it's gone 5-2 over their last seven games. The Over is also 4-0 when the Commanders are home underdogs in 2025. With both teams out of the playoff picture, there's no reason to play conservatively as the simulations forecast the teams combining for 56 points. Thus, the Over hits almost 60% of the time. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Over at to hit at DraftKings:How to make Christmas NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Christmas NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Christmas Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 9-1 payout?

    "body": "\n        Eleven 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are around 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31 as Kyle Whittingham will coach his final game for the Utes. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL Christmas Day tripleheader kicks off with Cowboys vs. Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Lions vs. Vikings at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Chiefs vs. Broncos wrapping things up at 8:15 p.m. ET. Even with some notable quarterback injuries removing notable names like Patrick Mahomes, Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy from the NFL DFS player pool, the slate is still loaded with high-quality options to target for NFL DFS lineups. Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Jahmyr Gibbs, Justin Jefferson and Travis Kelce are just some of the stars you could consider for your daily Fantasy football lineups.Big names, however, come equipped with big price tags, so you'll have to find balance with more affordable players as well. Those aforementioned QB injuries could make the likes of Josh Johnson, Chris Oladokun or Max Brosmer value-based Christmas NFL DFS picks. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Christmas, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Prescott going over 1.5 passing touchdowns using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Christmas DayPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for Christmas is rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs at $8,300 on DraftKings and $9,400 on FanDuel. Gibbs ranks third amongst all running backs in Fantasy points for the second straight season. He ranks eighth in scrimmage yards (1,662) and second in total touchdowns (17) ahead of a matchup with a team he has historically dominated. Gibbs has nine touchdowns in five career games versus Minnesota while averaging 97.6 scrimmage yards. The Vikings have also been unable to stop any RBs from hitting paydirt recently as each of the last six offensive TDs that Minnesota has allowed have been to running backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Gibbs to go Over 113.5 rushing + receiving yards at DraftKings:\nAnother one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Cowboys wideout George Pickens ($8,800 on FanDuel, $7,300 on DraftKings), who is coming off a 7-130-1 stat line and ranks third in the NFL with 1,342 receiving yards on the season. He's been as consistent as any receiver and has at least 78 yards or a touchdown in 12 of 15 games. He also has a salivating matchup against Washington, which has the No. 26 passing defense, and just two teams have allowed more passing touchdowns. Pickens had 82 yards against the Commanders earlier this year after having 91 yards and a score versus them last season. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Pickens to go Over 79.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Christmas Day NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Christmas.

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-3) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (+6.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 17 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 17 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 17 NFL picks is that the Steelers (-3, 33.5) cover versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 17 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which seven picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        The Denver Nuggets sit third in the Western Conference at 21-8, but their depth will be put to the test once again after seeing starting forward Cam Johnson suffer a knee injury. Johnson sustained a bone bruise in his right knee in a loss to the Mavs on Tuesday and while an MRI revealed no structural damage, he will be re-evaluated in 4-6 weeks with the injury, the team announced on Thursday. Johnson is averaging 11.7 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game on 46.1/42.9/81.0 shooting splits in 28 starts this season. With Johnson out, the Nuggets are now down three starters. Aaron Gordon remains sidelined with a hamstring strain and Christian Braun is still a week away from his re-evaluation after spraining his ankle earlier this season. Despite the absences of Gordon and Braun, the Nuggets have managed to stay near the top of the Western Conference thanks to the sensational play of Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray, as well as getting strong contributions from their bench after bolstering their depth this offseason. With Johnson out, that depth will be put under even greater stress, as will Jokić and Murray to continue producing the majority of Denver's offensive production.\nWithout Johnson, the Nuggets will have to ask more of their wing rotation and lose some more size and versatility at the forward spot. Johnson has played more power forward than small forward this season due to Gordon's extended absence, and the likes of Peyton Watson and Spencer Jones may see more time at the four -- with Zeke Nnaji and Hunter Tyson also options there from deeper down the bench. Everything in Denver starts with their two stars, and as long as Murray and Jokić are healthy, the offense will operate at an elite level. However, their defense was already on shaky ground without Braun and Gordon and losing Johnson will make them even weaker on that end of the floor. Braun and Gordon are both nearing their timetables for re-evaluation, but will still need time to ramp up to game shape once eventually cleared. \nIn the meantime, the Nuggets will look to hold on to strong position in the hotly contested Western Conference playoff race. They're only 1.5 games up on the Lakers and Timberwolves and three games ahead of the Rockets in sixth. They'll face that Minnesota team in the nightcap of the Christmas slate in their first game without Johnson before a lengthy East coast road trip that starts in Orlando and goes to Miami, Toronto, Cleveland, Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Boston. \n            ",

They played each other on Christmas as members of the Heat and Thunder. They did so again when James moved to the Cavaliers and Durant joined the Warriors. When James flew West for Hollywood, he faced Durant's Warriors in yet another holiday showdown. Were it not for an injury, Durant would have joined his Nets against the Lakers in 2021. Now, we're here again. The Lakers and Rockets represent the fifth unique matchup of their teams on Christmas Day.Well... \"their\" teams isn't quite the descriptor it used to be. While James and Durant are still stars, they are now supported but younger marquee players. This isn't just James vs. Durant. It's Luka Dončić vs. Alperen Sengun. It's Austin Reaves vs. Amen Thompson. It's two of the Western Conference elite slugging it out with major playoff standing implications at stake.So let's prepare for one of the best games on the Christmas slate with some best bets. Below are our picks against the spread and for the game's best prop bet.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRockets at Lakers: Where to watchTime: 8 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Crypto.com Arena -- Los AngelesTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Rockets -3, O/U: 230.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Rockets at Lakers: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Lakers are very banged up right now. Luka Dončić missed Tuesday's game. DeAndre Ayton just came back from a brief injury absence. So did Austin Reaves, and LeBron James is nearly 41, so it's safe to assume he's never quite at 100% anymore. That's exactly where you don't want to be heading into a matchup against the ultra-physical Rockets. The Lakers have had trouble with bigger, athletic teams all season. That's their weakness. Until they prove that they can overcome it, I'm expecting the Rockets to bully them in this one. The Pick: Rockets -3\nThe Lakers have holes all over their defense, but nowhere is it more glaring than in the backcourt. They are incredibly vulnerable against smaller, fast guards, and only the Clippers and Jazz are allowing a higher 3-point percentage on above-the-break 3s. In other words, I'm expecting the Lakers to build their game-plan around stopping the Rockets in the paint, and in the process Reed Sheppard will have a field day from deep. The Pick: Reed Sheppard Over 2.5 3s\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The second matchup of the NBA Christmas schedule is one that is growing increasingly familiar for fans. The San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder played perhaps the game of the year in the NBA Cup semifinals. They played again on Tuesday, just two days before Christmas. The Spurs won both games, handing the Thunder (26-4) half of their losses to this point in the season. Now they'll square off for the third time this month on Christmas itself.Somehow, I doubt any fans are complaining. The Thunder and Spurs represent what most expect to be the defining rivalry of this era of NBA history. Oklahoma City already has a championship to its name along with one of the deepest rosters in NBA history. Victor Wembanyama represents arguably the greatest threat to their impending dynasty in the NBA as an impossibly skilled giant with a seeming distaste for Thunder big man Chet Holmgren.So how are we gearing up for Thunder-Spurs Round 3? With best bets, of course. Below is our pick against the spread plus a prop bet headed into what might be the day's marquee game.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpurs at Thunder: Where to watchTime: 2:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Paycom Center -- Oklahoma CityTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Thunder -9.5, O/U: 235.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Spurs at Thunder: Odds, prediction, best bets\nLook, we're basing this off of vibes. Oklahoma City's first loss to San Antonio was a close, marquee game. Their second turned into a blowout in the fourth quarter. For the first time in the Thunder's young run, people are starting to wonder if a team has their number. Wembanyama's disdain for Holmgren should only intensify Oklahoma City's resolve. Expect the Thunder to come out motivated on Christmas, and as big as this line looks, remember, the Thunder have played 14 games in Oklahoma City this season and haven't lost one of them. In fact, they only have one single-digit home victory, which came on Oct. 28 against the Kings. The Thunder blow everyone out in their building. This should be no exception. The Pick: Thunder -9.5\nWe're sticking with the motivational theme for our prop pick. Chet Holmgren scored only seven points in Tuesday's loss to the Spurs, but it's worth noting that he scored 17 in the NBA Cup loss and had reached this over in seven of the nine previous games that he played. He's gonna go at Wembanyama on Christmas in an effort to prove that there is in fact a rivalry between the two of them. The Pick: Holmgren Over 15.5 Points\n            \n    ",

The Dallas Mavericks haven't exactly been lighting the world on fire either, but they're trending in the right direction, and if he keeps growing as much as he has thus far this season, Cooper Flagg has a whole lot more Christmas basketball ahead of him.Given how far down the Western Conference standings both the Mavericks and Warriors have fallen, this is actually a critical game from a play-in and standings perspective. To get you ready, we'll post our best bets below, both against the spread and in terms of props.Mavericks at Warriors: Where to watchTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Chase Center -- San FranciscoTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Warriors -8, O/U: 227.5 (via FanDuel) \n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMavericks at Warriors: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Warriors have played nine games thus far in December. They've won just two of them by eight or more points. Draymond Green mysteriously disappeared after a heated exchange with Steve Kerr on Monday. Nobody on this team but Stephen Curry is scoring consistently. Golden State shouldn't be favored by eight points against anyone, let alone a Mavericks team that is frankly playing just about as well as they are. The Pick: Mavericks +8\nHere's a fun fact for you: Cooper Flagg already has 68 points in the clutch. That's almost halfway to the recorded rookie record (138 by Brandon Jennings). The point is that Flagg seems comfortable in big moments. He's going to relish the chance to put on a show against a living legend in Stephen Curry on his home court in a marquee Christmas game. I'm fully expecting him to meet the moment. The Pick: Flagg Over 19.5 Points\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        You've heard of \"Elf on the Shelf,\" but have you heard of \"Snoop on the Stoop?\" Yes, for those wondering, it is a real thing and involves a plush of rapper Snoop Dogg dressed as an elf. From creating his own Christmas tradition doll, to making his own version of holiday stories, the hip-hop legend is becoming a Christmas legend and that legacy continued with an NFL halftime show on Thursday. Titled \"Snoop's Holiday Halftime Party,\" the 54-year-old took the stage at U.S. Bank Stadium during the break in the Christmas Day game between the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. Martha Stewart, a longtime friend of Snoop Dogg, introduced the rapper with a Snoop-ified Christmas story. The performance began will chants of \"Minnesota knows how to party.\"\nSnoop Dogg, dressed in an all red outfit, performed a number of his biggest hits and welcomed some special guests across numerous genres. There were background singers, dancers, nutcracker dancers, sleighs and a giant \"Snoop on a Stoop\" decoration.\nHe began with a hip-hop classic, \"The Next Episode,\" before switching gears to a performance of \"My Favorite Things,\" to bring some holiday music in the mix, a theme the show would continue to follow.After the holiday tune, he went back to his own discography with \"Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang.\"The singers of the hit Netflix movie K Pop Demon Hunters, EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami, gave their rendition of \"12 Days of Christmas.\" The rings in that song are \"gonna be, gonna be golden.\"\nFor his last two original songs of the show, the West Coast rapper hyped up the crowd with \"Drop it Like It's Hot\" and \"Who Am I (What's My Name).\"Country star Lainey Wilson was introduced and performed \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" on a light-up sled, with Snoop nearby dancing to her rendition.Italian singer Andrea Bocelli and his son Matteo Bocelli wrapped up the show with \"White Christmas\" and the rest of the performers joined them at the end of the song.\n\"NFL, Netflix and your uncle Snoop on Christmas Day? We're servin' up music, love and good vibes for the whole world to enjoy. That's the kind of holiday magic Santa can't fit in a bag,\" Snoop Dogg said ahead of the performance.Before the game, award-winning artist Kelly Clarkson kicked things off with her hit \"Underneath the Tree.\"\nThis marked the second year of Netflix broadcasting an NFL game on Christmas. Last year, the halftime show was performed by Beyoncé during the Ravens-Texans game in Houston. The performance, called the \"Beyoncé Bowl,\" received four Emmy nominations. \nThe Lions currently sit at 8-6 and are third in the NFC North, while division rival Vikings sit at 6-8 and in last place in the NFC North. Minnesota has been eliminated from the playoffs, but Detroit still has a fighting chance. The Christmas Day games are broadcasted on Netflix and are airing on CBS affiliates in the competing team's cities.\n            ",

    "body": "\nLa Liga heavyweights Barcelona and Atletico Madrid face off on Tuesday, Dec. 2 with both teams looking to maintain their stellar domestic form. Barcelona have won their last four La Liga games while Atletico Madrid have rattled off six straight victories heading into Tuesday's showdown. Barcelona are at the top of the table with 34 points while Atletico Madrid sit in fourth place with 31 points.Kickoff from Camp Nou in Barcelona is set for 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Dec. 2. Barcelona are -130 favorites (wager $130 to win $100) in the latest Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid odds at DraftKings Sportsbook while the visitors are +310 underdogs (wager $100 to win $310). A draw comes in at +330 and the total is 3.5 (Over +100, Under -130). For the latest Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid game forecast, head to SportsLine.Before locking in your bets for Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, you need to see what SportsLine soccer expert Martin Green is betting on in this match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid picksBarcelona money line (-125): 1uBoth teams to score - Over 2.5 goals - Lamine Yamal Over 0.5 shots on goal (+100): 0.5uAtlético Madrid will try to extend their unbeaten streak to eight games when they take on Barcelona at Camp Nou on Tuesday. Los Rojiblancos moved up to third in La Liga after easing to a 2-0 win against Oviedo 2-0 at the weekend. Manager Diego Simeone rested several key players for that game, including star striker Julián Alvarez and defensive stalwart José Maria Giménez.However, Atletico Madrid still looked supremely comfortable, as two goals from Alexander Sørloth wrapped up a routine victory. That result left them three points below Barcelona in the league table, so this will be an important clash in the title race.Barcelona should be close to full strengthBarcelona suffered a humbling 3-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League last week, but their domestic form has been strong. They've won their last four La Liga games, scoring 14 goals in the process. A 3-1 win against Alavés on Saturday left Barça top of the table. Lamine Yamal scored in the ninth minute and Dani Olmo grabbed two goals to seal the win. They will now be determined to maintain the momentum. Barcelona should be close to full strength for the visit of Atlético Madrid. Frenkie de Jong has recovered from an injury, and he could partner Pedri in midfield. Forwards Yamal, Robert Lewandowski, and Raphinha are all available, while Ferran Torres and Marcus Rashford are also vying to start.Barcelona are the top scoring team in La Liga this season, with 39 goals in just 14 games. They have conceded 16 times, but the all-star attack continues to make amends for their defensive vulnerabilities. The sportsbooks make Barcelona the favorites for this game, and it's easy to see why. They have a perfect home record this season with seven wins from seven matches and 23 goals scored to only four conceded. They also have a strong recent record against Atlético. These teams played out a 4-4 thriller in Barcelona back in February, but Barça won the subsequent two meetings in March (4-2) and April (1-0). Both of those wins came on the road, so Barça will be keen to put on a show for their home fans on Tuesday.Atletico's away record is underwhelmingAtlético Madrid's preparations for this game have been ideal. They're on a seven-game winning streak in all competitions, and the players should be fresh. Giménez, Alvarez, Giuliano Simeone, Pablo Barrios, and Matteo Ruggeri can all come into the starting XI after enjoying a breather at the weekend.Los Rojiblancos have been underwhelming on the road this season. They've picked up two wins, three draws, and one defeat from six away games. Atlético did manage to win their last two away matches, beating Real Betis 2-0 and Getafe 1-0 but they'll face a sterner test of their mettle on Tuesday. Camp Nou is a daunting place to visit and Barcelona are in fine form right now. The likes of Alvarez, Sørloth, and Antoine Griezmann should cause problems for Barcelona's defenders. However, Atlético's defense is unlikely to keep Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski at bay for 90 minutes. It could be a tight game between two in-form teams, but home advantage should ultimately swing things in Barcelona's favor.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Six weeks after undergoing his latest back surgery, Tiger Woods was able to make a long trip to the Bahamas as host of his annual tournament, the Hero World Challenge. The major question on everyone's mind was how Woods has been progressing through his rehabilitation, a topic the 15-time major winner addressed when speaking with the media on Tuesday -- his first public appearance since his latest surgery.Woods detailed the \"slow\" recovery process from his disc replacement. After joking that he will play 25 events on both the PGA Tour and PGA Champions Tour next year, he offered a more sobering update than many were hoping to hear. Tiger noted that he does not have a timetable to get back on the course as he cannot yet take full swings with a club. \"I'm probably gonna play 25 events on both tours, and I think that should cover most of the year, right?\" said Woods with a laugh. \"No, I'm just looking forward to -- let me get back to playing again. Let me do that, and then I'll figure out what the schedule will be. I'm a ways away from that part of it and that type of decision and that type of commitment level. Unfortunately, I've been through this rehab process before as a step-by-step, and then once I get a feel for practicing, exploding, playing and the recovery process, then I can assess where I'm going to play and how much I'll play.\"\"I just got cleared last week to chip and putt,\" Woods added. \"So, it's good. It's been six weeks last Friday. So, it's been slow. Can't really do much on a disc replacement; you gotta let it set. Can't really do much. Now we got the OK to start cranking up in the gym and start strengthening and start doing a little bit more of the rotational component that I hadn't been able to do in letting the disc kinda set.\"\nIt would be fairly shocking to see Woods playing competitively any time soon. He will not be able to compete in the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie, this year, and he will miss at least the start of the TGL season, too.Tiger is not only making his return from back surgery, he was also working his way back from a ruptured Achilles suffered back in March. At 50 years old, even a supreme athlete like Woods must take a more conservative approach to his rehab and can't push for a quick return. Tiger admitted as much on Tuesday when he noted the process isn't going \"as fast as I'd like.\" Whether Woods commits to the Masters is always the most telling of where he stands physically. The five-time green jacket winner does everything in his power to play the first major each April, but the physical demands of Augusta National mean he must believe he's in good enough shape to play, walk and recover for 72 holes. \nThe Masters is six months removed from his latest back surgery and may give us an idea of whether we'll see Woods play at all during the 2025 PGA Tour season. In the meantime, he's not willing to put a timetable on anything and seems to understand the importance of getting his back to full strength before pushing for another return. \n            ",

The Green Wave will make their first College Football Playoff appearance with a victory and Sumrall plans to guide his former program through the remainder of its postseason run.\nSumrall is one of three coaches from the American hired this cycle within the SEC, joining Memphis' Ryan Silverfield (Arkansas) and South Florida's Alex Golesh (Auburn). Florida's power brass believes it landed the best of that budding group, according to Spurrier.\"His attitude, his emotion … teams take on characteristics of their coaches. This guy hates losing,\" Spurrier said. \"You can tell that, right? Jon's got that energy and enthusiasm. The guys will play their hearts out. It'll be a different sort of atmosphere, I think.\"Was that a subtle jab at Napier's tenure from Spurrier? The Head Ball Coach questioned Florida's previous coaching regime earlier this fall and shared immediate thoughts on the Gators' vacancy soon after Napier's firing in October.\nSpurrier said Florida's primary targets were going to be \"proven coaches\" with a \"winning record in the SEC or another major conference\" and many pointed to Lane Kiffin and Eli Drinkwitz. The Gators pursued the former Ole Miss coach, but went in a different direction once it became clear Kiffin was remaining with the Rebels or going to LSU.Two days prior to Florida's official welcoming, CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello reported the Gators had pulled ahead of Auburn in the Sumrall sweepstakes.\"(Florida athletic director) Scott Stricklin had to act quickly to get this guy, lot of teams wanted this guy,\" Spurrier said Monday.\nOne of Sumrall's first orders of business was hiring a general manager to lead the personnel department. Ex-Jacksonville Jaguars GM Dave Caldwell is the pick as he helps usher in a new era of Florida football.Sumrall said Monday roster retention, addressing transfer portal needs and securing the Gators' 2026 recruiting class are primary missions during his first month of the job. Somehow, he'll try to balance all of that while still preparing Tulane for a conference title game appearance and potential playoff run.\n            ",

But based off of how Dart played on Monday night and what he said afterward, Aikman probably shouldn't hold his breath.\"I understand the question, but this is football,\" Dart said. \"I'm going to get hit if I'm in the pocket or outside the pocket. I've played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn't be any shocker to anybody if you've followed along with my career. We're not playing soccer out here. You're going to get hit, things happen. It's just part of the game.\"Dart absorbed several big hits during New York's 33-15 loss to New England that included a nasty shot by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss on a running play during the first quarter. \nWhile Dart's talent and toughness can't be questioned, many, including Aikman, are questioning Dart's mentality in terms of taking care of his physical well-being when on the football field. Ironically, Aikman said that Dart's playing style reminds him of Jim McMahon, the former Bears Super Bowl-winning quarterback who enjoyed considerable success before injuries changed the trajectory of his career. It's safe to say that Aikman doesn't want to see the same thing happen to the Giants' promising young rookie. \"He's too valuable not to have on the field,\" Aikman said. \"I understand it. When the game's on the line, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. But when the game's not on the line, he just has to be able to protect himself a little better than he has. \n\"I love the toughness, I love the grit that he shows, but it doesn't help anybody if he's not out there.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When it comes to the College Football Playoff bubble, Miami and Texas are firmly on the outside looking in entering Tuesday night's penultimate rankings from the selection committee and coaches for each are doing everything they can to politic for their respective teams.Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian didn't appreciate Miami running up the score on Pittsburgh over the weekend after Carson Beck found CJ Daniels on a 33-yard touchdown pass with 41 seconds left during the Hurricanes' 38-7 win.He hurled a not-so-subtle jab in Miami's direction on Monday, this coming a few days after pounding the table for three-loss Texas as a playoff team following its season-ending win over previously-unbeaten Texas A&M.\"There's teams that are ranked in front of us that haven't played any top-10 ranked teams,\" Sarkisian said on SEC Network. \"My point to everybody is, is this about what your record is at the end? Or is this about beating quality teams and showing how good of a team you really are by beating quality teams on the field. Or is it don't play good teams, put up a bunch of yards, put up a bunch of points and make it look good. Throw fade route touchdowns with 38 seconds to go when you're ahead 31-7 so that the score looks better. \n\"Is the committee watching the games or are they looking at a stat sheet at the end of the game to say, 'Oh, well they won by this many points, they must've played really good.'\"Cristobal responded to Sarkisian's dig a few hours later.\"I get it, everybody's trying to posture themselves for their programs and whatnot, the great part about stuff like that when coaches try to speak about themselves like that, they also gotta take a look at the common opponent between us and that particular coach,\" Cristobal said on Canes In Sight. \"Seeing that we had the opportunity to really dominate that opponent while that opponent dominated them.\"Florida is common opponent to which Cristobal is referencing after Hurricanes beat the Gators earlier this season and Texas lost in Gainesville shortly thereafter. Florida went 4-8 this season and only won two games after beating Arch Manning and the Longhorns the rest of the way.\nMargin of victory isn't supposed to be incentivized by the committee, but it undoubtedly is when you consider the game control metric and what that entails. Ironically, this was the second straight week the Hurricanes scored a meaningless touchdown in the final minute of the game after Beck hit Malachi Toney on a 20-yard fade on fourth down at Virginia Tech during a 34-17 victory.Miami vs. Texas tale of the tapeStrength of recordStrength of scheduleGame controlMiamiNo. 14No. 44No. 6TexasNo. 12No. 8No. 16Miami's consecutive statements could leave a lasting impression on the committee, who slotted the Hurricanes at No. 12 last week -- two spots away from the final at-large bid. Also for the first time this season, the committee ranked Miami in the same tier -- or pod -- as No. 9 Notre Dame, which is significant given the Hurricanes' last two victories over common opponents that the Fighting Irish also dominated. Notre Dame is still ahead of Miami by a significant margin, however, despite its head-to-head loss to the Hurricanes in the opener.\"This is a College Football Playoff team,\" Cristobal said after Miami's win at Pitt. \"We've all seen it. We know it. Proud of the way our guys came out, dominated from start to finish. We left a lot of points on the board as well. We're really starting to click. Complete dominance. We've got great players in all phases, and we're playing great football in all phases. The best part about football is you get to settle it on the field, where head-to-head is always the No. 1 criterion.\"Per CBS Sports' latest playoff projection, the following teams are playoff locks entering conference championship weekend: Ohio State, Indiana, Georgia, Texas Tech, Oregon and Ole Miss. Two other seeds are going to the ACC and Group of Five winners, which leaves four at-large spots that are up for debate entering Tuesday night.Oklahoma, Notre Dame and Alabama were ranked in the Nos. 8, 9 and 10 spots last week, while BYU and Miami were essentially placeholders thereafter. Those seeds will go to the final two conference champions, leaving the No. 10 seed to receive the final, coveted at-large selection.Texas was at No. 16 last week and there doesn't appear to be a path for the Longhorns' to the final at-large position.\"I think we're absolutely a playoff team,\" Sarkisian said after the Longhorns' 27-17 win over the Aggies. \"We're the first team since the 2019 national champion LSU team to beat three top-10 ranked teams in the same season during the regular season. Let's just chew on that for a second.\"Each of these teams needed losses by others currently projected to make the playoff bracket to lose over the weekend, but it didn't happen. Alabama took out Auburn, Notre Dame annihilated Stanford, BYU took care of business against UCF and Oklahoma nipped LSU.If Texas Tech throttles BYU in the Big 12 Championship and Georgia beats Alabama by a couple of touchdowns, the debate heats up again in Miami's favor.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first month of the 2025-26 college basketball season is complete. With the calendar turning to December and conference play on the horizon for most, a clear favorite has emerged for National Player of the Year honors. That would be Duke forward Cameron Boozer, who is the favorite (+160 on FanDuel) to win the award ahead of Purdue's Braden Smith, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg, among others. Boozer has played like the best player in the sport during the first month of the season. The former five-star prospect and projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is coming off his best performance to date in one of his team's biggest nonconference games of the season. Boozer finished with 35 points in Duke's 80-71 win over Arkansas in the CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic.After that performance, Boozer earned heavy praise from his coach.\"He's been so coachable from Day 1,\" Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. \"You're lucky when you're coaching a guy where he's harder on himself more than anybody else could be. ... For me, the biggest difference, though, for a freshman, is learning how to play through contact and the decision-making, the decisiveness. He can do so many different things. Obviously, he's shown he can shoot the ball from three, right? He can create his own shot. But I thought tonight he was a great connector for us, with quick decisions, putting pressure on the defense and then really opening up a lot for other guys to drive, shoot and make plays as well.\"Let's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season.\n  Freshman of the Week: Cameron Boozer, DukeWelcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row, CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  Boozer finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and three assists during Duke's win over Arkansas. Once again, Boozer used his strength to overpower defenders in the post and finished with his second game this season with at least 35 points. Boozer finished 13 of 18 from the floor and attempted 11 free throws.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Draft: 10 observations from a loaded Players Era event in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat makes Boozer's performance that much more impressive is that he started slow and then went on an offensive tear to get his team back in the game. The one series of events that stood out against Arkansas was Boozer scoring eight consecutive points, which flipped the momentum back in Duke's favor. When Duke needed a bucket, Boozer was the guy.\nPrevious Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleNov. 25: Cameron Boozer, Duke Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n    \n                                        \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 22.9 PPG | 9.8 RPG | 3.9 APG Entering the month of December, Boozer is the favorite to win National Player of the Year.

The matchup against Arkansas is especially intriguing due to the amount of first-year talent on the court at once. Last week: 5\n    \n                                        \n    6.

    "body": "\n        Stuck in quarterback purgatory for years since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of several teams who tried to land Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford in a trade ahead of the 2022 season, but didn't offer enough in return, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.The Steelers have been unable to \"stumble into\" an unexpected star like former seventh-rounder Brock Purdy or select a future franchise player under center in the first round, according to Schefter, who believes the franchise could've signed Stafford had they been willing to give up a second-round selection.\"They were 100% in the mix for Matthew Stafford,\" Schefter said Tuesday on ESPN Radio. \"It's amazing to me, but the quandary was if you're the (New York) Giants, who were calling on them, the Steelers, the (Las Vegas) Raiders ... it's funny to me because at that time, those teams wanted the best value possible. You want to give up the least amount of compensation. Those teams would put together packages, but generally speaking, most of these teams I remember the conversation being the Rams wanted a second-round pick and then some. Teams were stuck on a third-round pick.\"Stafford, a potential future Hall of Famer given his career numbers, agreed to a four-year extension in March 2022 worth $160 million. He's having one of the best campaigns of his career so far in 2025 with 3,073 yards passing, 32 touchdowns and four interceptions.\nStafford won Super Bowl LVI with the Rams to cap his first season in 2021 following 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions as a former No. 1 overall pick. Stafford has taken Sean McVay's Rams to the playoffs in consecutive years and Los Angeles currently leads the NFC West with Seattle at 9-3 overall.\"Generally speaking from multiple conversations I had with multiple teams, Stafford was open to be traded (because) the Rams didn't know what he wanted,\" Schefter said. \"In our world, you're living certain stories at certain times. You remember the Rams announced they were bringing back Stafford on Friday at the (NFL Combine). Generally, the majority of these teams were tip-toeing around it and trying to get a value deal on Matthew Stafford.\"No team was interested in tossing a second-round pick to Los Angeles for its quarterback, much less a first-round request that the Rams were initially seeking. In hindsight, that trio of teams who were kicking the tires on Stafford -- the Giants, Steelers and Raiders -- would've been better off with the two-time Pro Bowler in tow from 2022 through the 2024 seasons, sans rookie Jaxson Dart's emergence with New York this fall.\nThe Steelers haven't won a playoff game since 2016, while the Giants' lone postseason victory since winning the Super Bowl with Eli Manning in 2011 came three years ago in a wild-card game. The Raiders haven't posted a playoff win in more than two decades.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Western Conference has been filled with extremes early in the 2025-26 season. Oklahoma City is barreling toward 70 or more wins. The Nuggets, Rockets and Lakers have all lived up to their preseason hype, and frankly, Victor Wembanyama (when healthy) and the San Antonio Spurs have exceeded theirs. There's no question that the top of the Western Conference, for what feels like the 30th consecutive season, will give us most of our true championship contenders.The bottom? Yeah, things get bleaker at the bottom. Whether it's injuries (Grizzlies), age (Clippers), idiotic moves coming back to bite them (Mavericks), or a combination of the three (Kings), there is some true misery lurking at the bottom of the Western Conference standings. The middle class here is relatively small.So as we grade the Western Conference through one quarter of the season, don't be surprised by the sharp divide between high grades and low ones. There will be plenty of As and Bs. There will be some Fs as well. The 2025-26 Western Conference has given us a little bit of everything, so let's dive into our team by team grades.\n        \n            \n                NBA quarter-season grades for every East team: Knicks, Cavs can improve, Pistons get 'A+' and one team fails\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Mavericks: DRecord:The basics: 30th in offense, 6th in defense, 22nd in net rating (-4.5)Reason for optimism: Cooper Flagg has been as advertised as of lateReason for pessimism: Trading Anthony Davis will be difficultThe offense has been terrible, but that's mainly due to the convoluted early season plan to have Flagg be the point guard. If you look at just the last five games, Dallas' offense has been middle-of-the-pack, suggesting this new lineup with Brandon Williams and Ryan Nembhard taking turns starting in the lead guard spot is working. Flagg's been able to get the ball on the move and attack the rim far easier now than at the start of the season, and he's starting to look like the guy that everyone was raving about heading into the draft. He's been far more comfortable, and the Mavericks are starting to play through him and give Flagg more of an opportunity to be the offensive engine on this team. He's put up 24 and 35 points in his last two contests, while shooting 55% from the floor. He's been more assertive and aggressive and isn't settling for 3s as much, which has been the weakest point of his offensive game so far. Flagg's being patient to see what the defense is giving him and attacking from there, and is on a trajectory to get back in the driver's seat for Rookie of the Year.\n\n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis' situation is a bummer, and so is the NBA trade landscape\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs great as Flagg has been, there's still a dark cloud hanging over the Mavericks. They finally fired Nico Harrison about nine months too late, but at least the conversation can be about basketball again and not who is in the front office. The issue, though, is that Dallas now has to undo the mess that Harrison made, and unfortunately firing him isn't going to bring Luka back. So now Dallas has to turn its attention to figuring out what to do with this roster of misfit puzzle pieces to clear a path forward. Trading Anthony Davis seems like priority No. 1, but finding someone willing to take on his contract and the injury risk that comes with him is going to be nearly impossible. There's other trade chips on this roster, but are the Mavericks ready to fully bottom out with hopes of landing a top-five pick? It's probably too late to do that anyway, because as currently constructed this roster is going to win too many games to give them a legitimate shot at landing one of those top lottery spots. The next few months will be paramount in telling us what path the Mavericks plan to walk. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver Nuggets: ARecord: 14-6The basics: 1st in offense, 16th in defense, 3rd in net rating (+8.8)Reason for optimism: After a slow start, Cam Johnson averaged 17.6 points on 58-61-89 shooting splits -- 77% true shooting! -- in the seven games preceding Monday's loss against DallasReason for pessimism: Their defense has fallen apart without Aaron Gordon, who might not return from his hamstring injury until the new year. (In their last seven games, a stretch in which Gordon played a total of three minutes, they surrendered 122.9 points per 100 possessions)Nikola Jokić is still the best player in the world, and this season is shaping up to be his finest yet. On a per-possession basis, he's scoring, assisting and getting to the line more often than ever before, and the Nuggets are scoring 127.6 points per 100 possessions with him on the court. His 72.8% true shooting percentage flat-out doesn't make sense for a player who creates his own shot with any regularity, let alone a primary playmaker.And there are plenty of other positives: Jamal Murray is on track to finally make an All-Star Game, Gordon was playing like an All-Star before his injury and the team is no longer totally hopeless in the non-Jokić minutes. Denver has been outscored by four points per 100 possessions with Jokić on the bench, but that represents a significant improvement, as it was outscored by 9.3 per 100 last season (and between 7.9 and 10.4 per 100 in each of the three previous ones). Before Gordon went down, the improved defense was a big story, too. If any team can stop the Thunder from repeating, it's this one. -- James Herbert\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Golden State Warriors: C-Record: 11-10The basics: 23rd in offense, 7th in defense, 16th in net rating (+1.3)Reason for optimism: Most of last season's defensive success has sustainedReason for pessimism: They couldn't score on a NERF hoop without Stephen Curry on the floorThe supporting cast isn't good enough. It's really that simple. They're getting 28 a game out of Curry. Draymond Green's defense remains stellar. Jimmy Butler gets to the line and does a little bit of everything. That's the best they could have reasonably hoped for out of a trio of stars who are between 35 and 37. But nobody else is doing their part. Remember when they thought Brandin Podziemski had All-Star upside? How about those Shawn Marion comparisons Jonathan Kuminga drew on opening night? Buddy Hield isn't making shots, and he's unplayable when that's the case. Al Horford's long overdue decline finally seems to have arrived. Having a bottom-10 offense with Curry on your team is borderline impossible. They need someone else who can dribble, and they need shooters who can actually make their shots. And while we're at it, they probably need a real big man as well. Golden State has always punched above its weight as a rebounding team, but with Kevon Looney gone, they've fallen all the way down to 25th this season. Considering the spacing issues Butler and Green present, that's not going to be an easy problem to solve. This team feels like a work in progress. The inevitable Kuminga trade will help, but the stars (and Moses Moody) are the only ones pulling their weight thus far. -- Sam Quinn\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Rockets: ARecord: 13-5The basics: 2nd in offense, 3rd in defense, 2nd in net rating (+10.9)Reason for optimism: Reed Sheppard is a foundational pieceReason for pessimism: They probably still need a point guardMonday's upset loss to the Jazz aside, the Rockets have stormed out to a 13-5 start, and possess the second-best offense in the league despite not deploying a traditional point guard through the first quarter of the season. Fred VanVleet's season-ending injury looked like it could spell misery for the Rockets, but Amen Thompson, Alperen Sengun, Kevin Durant and Reed Sheppard have been enough to plug up that glaring need for a more traditional lead guard. Thompson specifically has flourished as a point-forward, averaging career highs across the board, while Sheppard's proving to be one of the best 3-point shooters in the league this season. Despite being undersized at 6-foot-2, Sheppard's managed to crack Ime Udoka's rotation, and while he'll continue to get hunted defensively, Houston can more than cover for his lapses on that end of the floor.For as good as Houston has been, though, as we start to forecast how the playoffs will look, you wonder how Sheppard will hold up when opponents play more aggressive defensively. The same will go for Thompson as a lead ball-handler, too. Right now this point guard by committee plan has panned out well for the Rockets, but is it sustainable during the playoffs when team's employ elite point of attack defenders? That will be a question the Rockets will have to answer ahead of the trade deadline in February. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Clippers: F-Record: 5-16The basics: 20th in offense, 27th in defense, 24th in net rating (-6.3)Reason for optimism: James Harden still rulesReason for pessimism: How much time ya got?Even \"F-\" doesn't feel strong enough for this Hindenburg of a team. This is the worst grade we'll award today. We knew the Pelicans and Kings would be bad. The Clippers were supposed to be a win-now team. L.A. has the NBA's oldest roster, and yet the most notable thing about it is everything it has given away. The Clippers gave the Heat a potential All-Star in Norm Powell. They may be giving the Thunder, you know, that team that's only lost once all year, the No. 1 pick in next June's draft. They may be handing over several more draft picks depending on how this Kawhi Leonard investigation pans out. The highest compliment you can pay the Clippers is that they're roughly an average 3-point shooting team. That's it. They never score in the paint or rebound. They can't stop a nosebleed. Only the Nets and Hornets score fewer fast-break points, and those teams are trying to lose. Only the 76ers allow more of them. If Harden and Ivica Zubac weren't here, this would be the worst team in the NBA. Leonard is still quite good when he shows up to work, I suppose. The past three months really could not have gone worse. -- Sam Quinn\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Lakers: B+Record: 15-5The basics: 6th in offense, 18th in defense, 13th in net rating (+3.1)Reason for optimism: The stars are everything they hoped they'd beReason for pessimism: Unsustainable clutch performance is masking deeper concernsThe Lakers are great at the things they expected to be great at. Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves are currently on pace to become the highest-scoring duo in a single season (on a per-game basis) in post-merger league history, and while LeBron James hasn't posted gaudy numbers since returning, he's slid in comfortably, done a little bit of everything and injected some badly needed pace into an otherwise slow offense. As team, the Lakers are currently on pace to absolutely shatter the record for 2-point field goal percentage over a single season. Their free-throw margin is, as always, enormous. The Lakers are, by and large, who we expected them to be. That means they have the flaws we figured they would too. Despite JJ Redick's best efforts, this team isn't shooting enough 3s, and they aren't make the ones they're taking yet. The defense is a weak spot as we assumed it would be. Right now, the Lakers have the record of a genuine contender. Their net rating doesn't match it. They're the only NBA team that is currently undefeated in clutch games. They're dominant in close games, but they're not exactly blowing teams out yet. They're still just a hair behind the West's true juggernauts. The right trade, some internal improvements, maybe even a bit of luck and this team could go on a real run. For now, though, this is a good start with some room to improve. -- Sam Quinn\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Memphis Grizzlies: C-Record: 9-12The basics: 25th in offense, 15th in defense, 20th in net rating (-3.3)Reason for optimism: Cedric Coward is legitReason for pessimism: The Ja Morant situation may not be resolved by season's endIt wasn't too long ago that Ja Morant was considered to be one of the next faces of the league. But suspensions and injuries have derailed that path, and, as I write this, Morant is currently sidelined with a calf strain. Even when he has been healthy he's been a shell of himself. Morant and Grizzlies coach Tumoas Iisalo haven't seen eye-to-eye on things, and that friction resulted in a one-game suspension after Morant publicly questioned his playing time earlier this season. Naturally, all of this has led to trade rumors about the All-Star guard, but as with every expensive star player who has injury concerns, it's not going to be easy. There will surely be interest, but that doesn't mean Memphis is going to trade Morant at the February deadline. That means we could be in for a long, painful season for Memphis where we hear more stories of the disgruntled Morant before we get some sort of resolution. This might be something that gets dragged out into the summer, which is a shame given the Grizzlies have a stable of young talent that deserves the focus this season.\nCedric Coward, specifically, has been a pleasant surprise so far. He's playing himself into the Rookie of the Year conversation, and is reminiscent of what Desmond Bane provided the Grizzlies before he was traded in the offseason. He's a two-way guard who isn't shying away from guarding the league's top players. He fights over screens, is aggressive in the passing lanes, doesn't foul a ton and isn't easily fooled by even the best handle in the league. Coward's been a silver lining in a season that has otherwise felt like the ending of an era in Memphis. But if the Morant era is indeed nearing its conclusion, Coward, Jaylen Wells, Zach Edey and Scottie Pippen Jr., should give the Grizzlies hope for whatever comes next. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Timberwolves: B-Record: 12-8The basics: 8th in offense, 10th in defense, 8th in net rating (+4.7)Reason for optimism: Jaden McDaniels has bumped up his usage a bit, and because he has made 45.8% of his catch-and-shoot 3s, he has also bumped up his efficiencyReason for pessimism: They have multiple inexplicable losses and no particularly impressive winsOn the one hand, Anthony Edwards has been playing out of his mind lately -- he has averaged 37.2 points on 69.5% true shooting in his last five games -- and the Timberwolves should be pleased with how Julius Randle, Donte DiVincenzo and McDaniels have started the season individually. The team hasn't exactly stormed out of the gates, but last year it started 8-10 and wound up making the conference finals.On the other hand, nothing about the way Minnesota has played indicates that it is in the Western Conference's top tier. Mike Conley is now coming off the bench and playing a career-low 19.8 minutes per game and Rob Dillingham has not proven ready for a major role, so the Wolves miss Nickeil Alexander-Walker dearly. They seem like a type of team that should be looking at in-season trades, but they're over the first apron, close to the second and they don't have future first-round picks to trade. It's unclear what the next step is here. -- James Herbert\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans Pelicans: FRecord: 3-18The basics: 26th in offense, 28th in defense, 28th in net rating (-10.4)Reason for optimism: Derik Queen is the steal of the draftReason for pessimism: All this losing will have been for nothingI'm not sure what to make of the Pelicans. Zion Williamson has played in nearly half of New Orleans' games, and yet the team is no better with him in the lineup than when he sits. They've won just one of the 10 games Williamson has suited up for this season, which is so confounding given how poorly this team has been in the past without him on the floor. Dejounte Murray also being injured is certainly a factor, but the truth is the Pelicans -- who have the NBA's worst record as of Tuesday -- have a collection of talent that just isn't working anymore. It's a roster that should probably be sold for parts, but tanking really isn't an option because the Hawks own the Pelicans' 2026 first-round pick. So New Orleans can't even reap the benefits of all this losing next summer.The Pelicans traded their 2026 pick to the Hawks in exchange for the No. 13 pick in the 2025 draft, which they used to take Derik Queen. It's a double-edged sword, because Queen has looked like the steal of the draft and someone who could be a foundational piece for this franchise. Queen has been excellent and is showing shades of an elite passing big man who can score and rebound in the same vein as Alperen Sengun or Nikola Jokić. But it has the potential to be an incredibly short-sighted decision for the Pelicans if their pick lands anywhere in the top three and they lose out on a generational player. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oklahoma City Thunder: A+Record: 20-1The basics: 5th in offense, 1st in defense, 1st in net rating (+15.3)Reason for optimism: They've done all this without having their regular starting lineup available for a single gameReason for pessimism: In their last three games, SGA has actually had to play in the fourth quarter. The sky is falling!If I were running an NBA team, the mere existence of the Thunder would make rebuilding seem more appealing. Sure, you can upgrade your roster, but what are the chances that you can build a team that can take down this juggernaut in the next couple of years? There is \"depth,\" and then there is what OKC has: two-way talent at every position, with an army of elite defenders and an ability to play multiple styles on both ends. Jalen Williams, who made All-NBA and All-Defense last season, missed the first 19 games of the season, and the Thunder won 18 of them, with a historically dominant defense.\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander is again averaging almost a point a minute, and he's now making 43% of his pull-up 3s. Chet Holmgren is continuing to grow as an off-the-dribble scorer. Ajay Mitchell is already one of the best backups in the league. Beyond the individual storylines, though, the reigning champs have a collective understanding of what they need to do to win (virtually) every night. It's incredibly difficult to beat a team that forces tons of turnovers, almost never gets burned in transition, protects the paint, protects the glass, protects the ball and lives at the line. -- James Herbert\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Portland Trail Blazers: B+Record: 8-12The basics: 19th in offense, 21st in defense, 19th in net rating (-2.5)Reason for optimism: They've had the league's toughest early season scheduleReason for pessimism: They've scored an abysmal 101 points per 100 possessions without Deni Avdija on the courtOn defense, the Trail Blazers press more often than anybody in the league. On offense, they play faster than anybody outside of Miami and attack the rim like crazy. This is their identity, and it makes them an annoying team to play when they're anywhere near full strength. During Portland's 5-3 start, the team beat the fully healthy Nuggets and dealt the Thunder what is still their only loss. Even though the Blazers have lost seven of their last nine games, they should be encouraged by the first quarter of the season overall.In particular, they should be over the moon about the development of Avdija, who has been as aggressive a downhill driver as anybody in the NBA and is on track to make his first All-Star Game and win Most Improved Player. They should also be thrilled with how Jrue Holiday played before he strained his calf, which has sidelined him since Nov. 14. It's not awesome that they rank No. 27 in halfcourt offense, per Cleaning The Glass, but ideally that will improve when Holiday returns and Scoot Henderson makes his season debut. The Holiday injury, along with injuries to Matisse Thybulle and Blake Wesley, have set them back on the other end, too. -- James Herbert\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Phoenix Suns: B+Record: 13-9The basics: 13th in offense, 13th in defense, 14th in net rating (+2.9)Reason for optimism: Everyone actually seems to enjoy playing basketball togetherReason for pessimism: A laughably easy schedule may be overstating their early performanceThe vibes are immaculate. The Suns are above-average on both offense and defense. They're scoring more in the paint than they did when they had Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal on the team. They were one of the NBA's thinnest teams a year ago. Now they're deep enough to actually get better by net rating when Devin Booker rests. Most of the offseason additions are working out. Dillon Brooks has given them a defensive identity. Mark Williams is thriving on a team that actually wants him. The Suns owe Bronny James a thank you. The Lakers waived Jordan Goodwin because internal politics forced them to keep James instead, and Goodwin has been a solid all-around reserve for them. Overall, things are good. This is a solid, professional basketball team that holds its own in most areas, though it could stand to turn the ball over less. The only thing keeping them from an \"A\" is their schedule. Only the Thunder have played a weaker slate of opponents thus far. Let's see how the Suns far against better competition before we consider this season a major victory. Still, after the misery of the past two seasons, the Suns are understandably thrilled to just to be competitive. -- Sam Quinn\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sacramento Kings: FRecord: 5-16The basics: 27th in offense, 25th in defense, 29th in net rating (-10.4)Reason for optimism: This 2026 NBA Draft might be so good that it's Kings-proofReason for pessimism: They're bad at everythingSo... what are the Kings good at? I'm struggling to find anything. I suppose they don't turn the ball over much, but that's mostly because they rank near the bottom of the league in passes. Their players would rather miss shots than throw bad passes. They've done quite a bit of that. The Kings, as of this writing, rank 23rd in the NBA in effective field goal percentage. They're not getting good shots, as they ranked 29th in 3-point attempt rate, 24th in free-throw rate, and 27th in field goal attempts in the restricted area per game. Domantas Sabonis has led the league in rebounds three years in a row, yet this is still the worst rebounding team in the NBA. No one is really surprised by their No. 25 defense considering the best defender on the team, Keon Ellis, can't find consistent minutes for reasons that remain unclear to everyone outside of that building. The De'Aaron Fox trade represented a real opportunity to tear this team down, start over, and build it properly. Instead, a bizarre ownership mandate to remain competitive compelled them to add a number of contracts that no one else in the league wants. The lottery is really the only source of hope here. The Kings are so poorly run that even their attempt at building a halfway decent team led to the bottom of the standings. -- Sam Quinn\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Antonio Spurs: A-Record: 13-6The basics: 7th in offense, 14th in defense, 10th in net rating (+4.5)Reason for optimism: De'Aaron Fox is proving why it was a smart tradeReason for pessimism: Victor Wembanyama's healthThrough 19 games, the Spurs are a top-five seed in the West, have a top-10 offense, and a defense that ranks that high when Victor Wembanyama is playing. They've managed to stay afloat in a cutthroat Western Conference even with Wembanyama playing just 12 games so far due to a calf strain. That's because Fox is carrying the Spurs across the finish line first in most games in Wemby's absence. He's averaging 24 points on nearly 50% shooting from the floor -- far and away the most efficient he's ever shot the ball. Fox is performing at peak levels, and for as much as people talk about San Antonio's backcourt of the future in Stephon Castle and rookie Dylan Harper, Fox is a fully realized player that can help Wemby compete right now. He might not be San Antonio's long-term point guard, but he's been a great stopgap to have while Harper and Castle continue to develop.\nBut Fox's brilliance can only go so far, and without Wembanyama this team may start to slip as the schedule gets tougher. It's not a massive red flag yet, but Wembanyama's durability could be a topic of conversation throughout his career. He has the potential to be one of the all-time greats, but if he can't stay healthy we might not be able to see him reach the highest pinnacles. It's too early to make sweeping statements about the longevity of his career, but the Spurs may be better served building a title contender around Wembanyama right now than being patient and waiting for his prime. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Utah Jazz: BRecord: 7-13The basics: 22nd in offense, 26th in defense, 25th in net rating (-6.7)Reason for optimism: Keyonte George has been one of the league's most improved playersReason for pessimism: With Walker Kessler out for the season, no one is coming to save the Jazz's dismal defenseLauri Markkanen has cooled off a bit in the last couple of weeks, but he's still averaging a career-high 28 points on 60.6% true shooting. Regardless of whether the Jazz are going to trade him or build around him, this is exactly what they needed from him after a disappointing 2024-25 season. Markkanen is not, however, the Jazzman who has made the biggest leap -- that is clearly George, whose improved decision-making and finishing have made him into a totally different kind of threat with the ball in his hands.No team has turned the ball over more often than Utah, and, according to Cleaning The Glass, no team allows more transition opportunities. I can't judge the Jazz too harshly, though, because this is not a roster that was designed to win many games. Despite the fact that Kevin Love and Kyle Anderson are sometimes in the rotation and Jusuf Nurkic has started every game since Kessler went down, they're still extremely young. I like their movement on offense, and I like the way they're trying to develop Ace Bailey, who has been trending in the right direction lately. -- James Herbert\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky has named Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein its next coach. The move comes hours after the Wildcats fired all-time wins leader Mark Stoops.The move to Lexington would be Stein's first head-coaching job and represent the latest step in what has been a rapid rise for the 36-year-old Kentucky native. Stein spent 2008-12 as a quarterback at Louisville, appearing in 25 games for the Cardinals. He then spent two seasons on the Louisville staff, was with Texas as a quality control coach from 2015-17 and coached at Lake Travis High School in Texas -- a longtime powerhouse program -- in 2018 and 2019. Among the players under his tutelage was future Ohio State star and current New York Jets receiver Garrett Wilson.\n        \n            \n                Inside Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein's rise from Friday nights in Texas to the national spotlight\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I'm honored and excited to become the next head coach at Kentucky,\" Stein said in a statement. \"Growing up in Kentucky and sitting in the stands at UK games as a kid, I could only dream of one day leading the Wildcats. This is truly a dream come true. My goal is to lead with purpose and help young men grow on and off the field. I'm deeply thankful to president Capilouto, Mitch Barnhart, and Big Blue Nation for the trust they've placed in me. I also want to thank coach Dan Lanning and the entire Oregon staff for their support and mentorship, they've been incredible. Now, I can't wait to get started and make Kentucky proud.\"Stein then took the passing game coordinator and wide receiver coach roles at UTSA and was promoted to be the Roadrunners' co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach ahead of the 2022 season.\nUTSA produced one of college football's best offensive attacks, finishing 12th in yards per game and 15th in points per game. In December 2022, Dan Lanning hired Stein to become Oregon's offensive coordinator, a role vacated by Kenny Dillingham when he took the Arizona State job.\"Will Stein brings an outstanding track record of developing elite quarterbacks and leading some of the most dynamic and successful offenses in college football,\" Kentucky AD Mitch Barnhart said in a statement. \"His deep connection to Kentucky, having grown up attending games in our stadium, gives him a unique passion for this program and this community. We are thrilled to have him leading the Wildcats onto the field next fall, and I know Big Blue Nation will join me in giving a warm welcome to Will, his wife Darby and their children, Joey and Demi.\"The fit was an instant success. The Ducks scored a modern era program-record 81 points against Portland State in Stein's first game as offensive coordinator and averaged 43.7 points per game that season, second in FBS behind LSU. In 2024, the Ducks were the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff before losing to Ohio State. Overall, Oregon's offense has averaged 37.7 points per game over the past three seasons, second in FBS behind North Texas. The Ducks' 7.1 yards per play is first nationally.\nStein has shown a propensity to adapt to different quarterbacks well. In 2023, he helped Bo Nix take a massive leap; Nix completed an FBS record 77.4% of his passes and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting. Last year, Dillon Gabriel led the Ducks' attack, and this year, it's been Dante Moore. With Moore leading the offense, Oregon finished the regular season 11-1 and will likely host a first-round College Football Playoff game. Stein is expected to continue to call plays for the Ducks through their CFP run, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.Kentucky fired Stoops shortly after a 41-0 loss to Louisville; the Wildcats finished 5-7 and missed a bowl for the second straight year after making a bowl in each of the eight seasons prior. Kentucky's 20.7 points per game over the past two seasons rank last in the SEC, as do its 335.8 yards per game.At 9-15 (3-13 SEC) over the past two seasons, Stoops was mired in his worst run since taking over the job from Joker Phillips after the 2012 season. His final record of 82-80 (38-68 SEC) is heavily weighed down by a slow beginning and poor ending. In between came some of the program's finest moments. It took four seasons for UK to reach a bowl under Stoops, but 2016 marked the first of eight straight postseason trips for the Wildcats. \nStoops produced the program's first 10-win season since 1977 in 2018 and did it again in 2021 before a downward trend began, ultimately leading to Stoops' dismissal and the impending arrival of Stein. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Let's go back in time for a minute. Specifically, I want to bring you to the first day of training camp for the New England Patriots. It was a hot, muggy July day in Foxborough, where this 2025 squad reconvened for the first time after the summer break. It was on that day when Drake Maye made a declaration: \"[The Patriots] are tired of losing.\" \"I think that's what excites me most,\" the rising second-year quarterback said at the time about the upcoming 2025 regular season following a 4-13 rookie campaign. \"Guys want to win around here. I think the past two or three years, around here in the past year for me, I can only speak for myself, but I think there's guys around here that are tired of losing and want to win.\" Fast forward now to Dec. 1 with 13 weeks of regular season action under their belts, and the Patriots are not just tired of losing, they're allergic to it. After a 33-15 bludgeoning of the New York Giants on \"Monday Night Football,\" New England enters its bye week standing above every other team in the AFC. At 11-2, they are the No. 1 seed in the conference, hold a 2.5 game lead over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC East, and have rattled off 10-straight wins. \nThe Patriots are on this remarkable surge back to dominance on the shoulders of their young quarterback, who has rocketed to becoming an MVP frontrunner. \"I think he's realizing what he can be,\" head coach Mike Vrabel said of his quarterback, \"and what the impact that he makes on this offense and being the conductor. He's hard on himself. I think that he challenges himself as well as his coaches. He means a great deal to this football team.\" After completing 24 of his 31 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns against the Giants, Maye leads the NFL in completion percentage and passer rating. If that holds, he'd become just the third quarterback in the last 50 seasons to lead in each category, joining Tom Brady (2007) and Kurt Warner (2001). Both went on to win MVP. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            What makes Maye's completion percentage so impressive is that he's no Checkdown Charlie. The 23-year-old is not afraid to go long, owning a masterful deep ball that has gained the reputation of being the best in the NFL. The latest example came on Monday night on his perfectly placed 33-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Williams.\nPer Next Gen Stats, Maye completed 6 of his 8 passes beyond 10 air yards for 117 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. So far this season, he's completed 88 such passes beyond 10 air yards for 1,865 yards. That's over 200 yards more than any other quarterback. Maye's prime time showcase coincided with Matthew Stafford, the MVP favorite entering Week 13, turning the ball over three times in the Los Angeles Rams' upset loss to the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. Those developments have helped shift the odds at FanDuel Sportsbook, where Maye is now the favorite at -125 over Stafford (+130). And it doesn't feel like he's going to let go of the rope down the stretch. \nAlong with gaining the inside track at the MVP award, Maye's monster leap in Year 2 now has the Patriots not just building towards a Super Bowl window, but suddenly in one. \n            ",

Brent Brookhouse here to take you through the day's news you need to know in the world of sports.As a Bills fan since Super Bowl XXV, I woke this morning terrified after another dominating performance by the Patriots on Monday Night Football. To soothe my nerves, I'm looking forward to a long day of sports, from the soccer pitches of Europe to the college and professional basketball courts and ice hockey rinks of North America; there is plenty of action on the calendar to soothe my nerves as I try to forget those many years of Buffalo playing second fiddle to New England. FIrst, let's dive into the news you need to know to kick off your Tuesday.  🏈 Five things to know Tuesday The Patriots walloped the Giants. As scores go a 33-15 defeat isn't the worst -- but it's how it happened. Jaxson Dart returned for the G-Men after missing time for a concussion, yet the rookie quarterback seemed to spend more time putting himself in harm's way than not. This as New England's Drake Maye (282 yards, two TDs) put on another MVP clinic. But the game -- if not the season -- for these teams can be summed up in two special teams plays. Marcus Jones' 94-yard punt return TD tied the Pats' mark for the longest in franchise history. Meanwhile, Giants kicker Younghoe Koo had such a bizarre approach to a 47-yard field goal attempt that it elicited everything from stunned disbelief to open laughter. With the victory, the 11-2 Patriots moved back into first place in the AFC, while the 2-11 Giants moved up to second in the 2026 NFL Draft.NFL coach hot seats are getting toasty. College doesn't own all of the coaching drama. Two NFL coaches have already been fired, and that might not be the end of things when everything is said and done. CBS Sports' Zachary Pereles took a look at the five hottest seats in the NFL, including Pete Carroll, who could be one-and-done for the Raiders as the team sits at 2-10.Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid headlines an intriguing day of soccer. Tuesday features three Premier League matches, but the day's headliner is Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid in Spanish La Liga. We have a breakdown and prediction for that clash between two of Spain's top five clubs.College football rankings near year's end. As we head to conference championship weekend, the time for rankings has nearly come to a close. That said, we have our final CBS Sports 136, and Ohio State lands atop the nation one last time. The Buckeyes also topped our College Football Power Rankings, with Indiana nipping at their heels as a massive Big Ten championship game looms. But what of the raging debate over whether Miami should leap Notre Dame?College basketball season is just heating up. While football is winding down, basketball is just getting started. The first college basketball NET rankings have been released by the NCAA, and Michigan's thunderous run through the Players Era has them sitting at No. 1, while the Wolverines also moved up to No. 3 in the AP Top 25. On the women's side, Texas parlayed its own Players Era tournament win into the No. 2 spot in the AP Top 25 poll, just behind No. 1 UConn. 🐯 Do not miss this: The full drama of Lane Kiffin to LSU \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The story of Lane Kiffin's decision to leave Ole Miss on the edge of the team's trip to the College Football Playoff and take the top coaching job at LSU is still dominating the headlines. During Kiffin's introductory press conference in Baton Rouge on Monday afternoon, he credited Nick Saban with influencing his decision to leave Ole Miss. Meanwhile, another legendary coach, Bill Cowher, blasted Kiffin for his decision, saying Kiffin's actions depleted the program and proved Kiffin \"doesn't care about the players.\" \nCBS Sports' John Talty dove deep to tell the story of Kiffin's decision, from how he nearly landed at Florida instead of LSU before finally agreeing to take the helm for the Tigers. Talty: \"When he suddenly had two of the best jobs in the country, Florida and LSU, fighting over him, he couldn't resist. It seemed to color the way he viewed his current job, too, even though he publicly said he loved Ole Miss. He'd privately complain about the fanbase and whether the program's recent success was sustainable, especially compared to more historically successful programs like Florida and LSU. He locked in on what he thought were disappointing home crowds, telling some around him that didn't happen in Baton Rouge and Gainesville.\" More on Kiffin: Details of Kiffin's $91 million deal with LSUCould quarterback Trinidad Chambliss follow Kiffin to LSU?What Florida's athletic director had to say about being passed overThe complete Kiffin timeline 🎠 College coaching carousel chaos \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Kiffin's story may be dominating the headlines, but the coaching carousel kicked into overdrive on Monday. UCLA made a big move for the future with plans to hire Bob Chesney away from James Madison. Chesney stepped in at James Madison after Curt Cignetti left to kick off his highly successful stint at Indiana and led the Dukes to a 20-5 record over two seasons, including having the team on the verge of a spot in the upcoming CFP. Michigan State addressed its own coaching vacancy after firing Jonathan Smith, hiring former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald spent 17 seasons at Northwestern from 2006-22. He has not coached at the collegiate level since. \nThe biggest coaching vacancy in the country remains at Penn State, and the team appears to be targeting BYU's Kalani Sitake to fill that spot. Sitake has built BYU into one of the nation's most consistent programs since taking over in 2016 and said that he has asked his team to remain focused on their goals as they try and lock up a CFP bid when they face Texas Tech in the Big 12 championship game on Saturday. Kentucky fired Mark Stoops, the program's all-time wins leader, and hired Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein to fill the spot. Meanwhile, Ohio mysteriously placed coach Brian Smith on leave for an \"undetermined period of time\" while waiting for their bowl selection after an 8-4 season.  🏀 Grading the first quarter of the NBA season \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It's hard to believe that we're already a quarter of the way into the NBA season, but that is reality. As expected, the season has produced plenty of surprises and disappointments. Some teams are still finding their way, while others are soaring to hot starts, with dreams of an NBA championship either tantalizing or teasing their fans. \nWith that in mind, the CBS Sports squad of Brad Botkin, Robby Kalland and Jack Maloney sat down to hand out grades for every team in the East. Unsurprisingly, given their 16-4 start, the Pistons have earned an elusive \"A+.\" Maloney: \"Deee-troit basketball is back in a major way. Only the defending champion Thunder have a better record than the Pistons, who have already recorded more wins than they did in the entirety of their disastrous 2023-24 campaign, and boast a multi-game lead atop the East. Their 13-game winning streak tied a franchise record, they've won at least 16 of their first 20 games for the fourth time in franchise history and they're in first place in the East on Dec. 1 for the first time since 2005.  \"Cade Cunningham is putting up career-highs across the board -- 28.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 9.4 assists -- and playing like an MVP candidate, Jalen Duren has made a massive leap, they dominate the offensive glass and get to the line at will, they're tough as nails with a top-five defense and they have so much depth that it's creating a headache for coach JB Bickerstaff. It's fair to wonder how their bully-ball approach on offense will fare in the playoffs given their spacing concerns, but that's a long way off. For now, everyone in Detroit should enjoy the ride.\" 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            As the final CFP selections fast approach, Vanderbilt coach Clark Lea believes there is a bias against his team in at-large discussions.

    "body": "\n        From one glance at the Championship Week college football odds, there is a clear outlier amongst the Power 4 title games. That's over in the Big 12, which has Texas Tech favored by 13.5 points over BYU, per the latest Championship Week college football lines. Meanwhile, the other power conference championship games all have college football spreads of under 6 points. They include Georgia vs. Alabama (+2.5) in the SEC, Ohio State vs. Indiana (+4.5) in the Big Ten and Virginia vs. Duke (+3.5) in the ACC.Whether you prefer to make Championship Week college football bets on smaller lines or larger college football spreads is a matter of preference. However, having the proper college football betting advice will set you up for success during the conference championship schedule.

No team has a better point differential than IU (+401), which is 50 points greater than what Ohio State has. Indiana also has the Heisman favorite in Fernando Mendoza, who leads FBS with 32 passing touchdowns, while topping the Big Ten in total touchdowns and yards per attempt. His counterpart, Julian Sayin, has thrown picks in his last two games away from home, and the Buckeyes haven't won the turnover battle in five straight games. In addition to the Hoosiers sticking within the spread, the model also says the Under hits nearly 70% of the time in an A-rated pick. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Duke (+3.5, 57.5) covers versus No. 16 Virginia in the ACC Championship Game on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. The model projects the Blue Devils to cover almost 60% of the time. While UVA prevailed when these teams met on Nov. 8, the Cavs' offense is limping into this rematch. UVA averaged 36.4 points over its first nine games but is averaging over 13 fewer points over its last three. Meanwhile, Duke is coming off a season-high of 49 points in a victory over 8-win Wake Forest, as the Blue Devils have one of the most efficient offenses around. They rank 19th in the nation, and second in the ACC, with 34.6 ppg, and only two teams in all of FBS have thrown fewer interceptions. Virginia has as many turnovers (five) over its last three games as Duke has over its last nine games, and the turnover margin is one reason why Duke sticks within the spread. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Championship WeekThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every Championship Week matchup, and it's calling for three underdogs to outright win. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which three teams should you jump on?

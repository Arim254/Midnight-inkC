SportsLine's model has identified the Under (47.5) as an A-rated pick, and has also revealed NBA picks for Lakers vs. Spurs and Warriors vs. Kings. Combining all three of those picks into a multi-sport parlay at FanDuel results in a final payout of +581.

The Cardinals only had 136 passing yards in a 21-7 loss to Northern Illinois in their most recent game. Kent State has had offensive issues of its own this year, scoring 14 points or fewer in half of its eight games. The Cardinals have gone Under in 14 of their last 18 November games, and the model has the Under hitting in 65% of simulations on Wednesday. Bet on college football at FanDuel Sportsbook:Under 230.5 in Lakers vs. Spurs (-110)Los Angeles continues to play without veteran star LeBron James (back), and Austin Reaves (groin) is a game-time decision. The Lakers have had to lean heavily on Reaves and Luka Doncic early in the season due to James' absence, leaving them without a ton of offensive firepower. They are facing a Spurs team that leads the NBA in points allowed per game (108.2). The Lakers have been solid defensively so far as well, ranked 14th in points allowed (116.6), so the model has the Under hitting 57% of the time. Bet on the NBA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Warriors +3 vs. Kings (-110)Golden State will be without Stephen Curry (illness) on Wednesday night, but it still has enough firepower to stay with Sacramento. The Kings gave up 39 first-quarter points in a 130-124 loss to the Nuggets on Monday, falling to 2-5 overall this season. They are coming off a four-game road trip, leaving them potentially fatigued in this game. Golden State picked up a 118-107 win over Phoenix on Tuesday, improving to 5-3 this season. The Warriors will be shorthanded on Wednesday, but the model has accounted for that and still has Golden State covering in 64% of simulations. Bet on Warriors-Kings at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

They have gone Under in five of their last seven meetings with the Nuggets, who are difficult to beat at home. Denver has put together some impressive defensive showings at home this season, holding Phoenix to 111 points and New Orleans to 88 points.

But I'm not sure the Flashes are ready to win on the road. They are 0-4 away this year and have lost each by at least 35. Granted, three were at Texas Tech, Florida State and Oklahoma ... but also at Toledo,\" SportsLine handicapper Matt Severance said. \"Ball State is 3-0 at home, including an upset of MAC contender Ohio. BSU's Nathan Voorhis is second in the nation with 10 sacks. Kent State, meanwhile, has the MAC's worst scoring defense (36.5 PPG).\" Back Ball State at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Celtics -11.5 vs. Wizards (-115)\"We've seen hints of a Boston breakthrough when extending a couple of margins this season, and this would seem a perfect opportunity to do so again. Though the Celtics have been a bit streaky, they did recently put three wins together, and Jaylen Brown (26.8 ppg) continues to torment enemy defenses,\" SportsLine handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"The absence of Jayson Tatum is going to be felt all season, but the Celtics have found some serviceable replacements including Anfernee Simons vs. Portland, not quite Tatum-like but producing at a 14 ppg clip. Still, who are we kidding, the attraction here is to go against the sad-sack Wizards, on a five-game skid and having lost four of those games by 17 points or more.\" Back Boston at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Lakers -3.5 vs. Spurs (-105)The Spurs (5-1) are second in the West behind the Thunder (8-0) and the Lakers (6-2) are third, so both franchises are off to a solid starts despite battling some early injury issues. LeBron James (back) is out for at least a few more weeks and Austin Reaves (groin) is questionable. However, the Spurs might be even more banged up with De'Aaron Fox (hamstring) and Dylan Harper (calf) both ruled out and Jeremy Sochan (wrist) listed as questionable. Luka Doncic was rested for the second game of a back-to-back on Monday and will return to the lineup tonight.

    "body": "\n        In Manchester City's resounding 4-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, Erling Haaland may have stolen the show with City's second goal in the 29th minute of play, but it was a good moment to get him the ball by Jermie Doku as well. The Belgian floated the ball into space, and it seemed like he had a telepathic connection to pick out Haaland's run, but as he opened up to CBS Sports following the match, that wasn't the case.It's a bit of why Haaland is great because Doku explained that he saw the space and trusted that someone would find their way into it.\n\"I saw the defenders going to the post, and I saw a gap, and I said, 'Someone has to be there,'\" Doku said on the UEFA Champions League post-match show. \"I just play in the gap. I didn't have the time to see Erling. I just saw the gap, and I played in the gap, and he was there.\"That level of trust in the team's style is part of why the City attack is able to be so good. Doku has been finding his own footing with the team, already having two goals and four assists in all competitions as the 23-year-old is combining his devastating pace with his improving vision and ability to be able to pick out a pass. That's something that he was able to improve during his time with the Belgian national team, where he worked with Thierry Henry, who was an assistant coach with the squad.\n\"I just play free. I come to the ball and I don't care if I lose the ball or not, I play free and purely out of instinct. I go where the ball is, and I don't think about the consequences. If I think too much about the statistics, then I'm not going to do it. So it comes naturally, and I also speak with a legend that sometimes helps me as well.Doku is referring to what he's learned from Henry, which is something that he expanded on how Henry's guidance has helped him with his take ons.\"Nobody really talks to me about my 1v1s, but he was the first person ever that talked to me about my 1v1s and how, how I can be better and effective in the last phase,\" Doku said. \"Because a lot of people say Jeremy, have to be more statistics, more statistics, but how? They don't tell me how. Just do it, do it, do it, but how? And he really talks to me about how, and that's the first time, and I appreciate that.\"\nIn response, Henry went into what he talked to Doku about and it's clear how it came into his assist for Manchester City.\n\"He has zero limits but he needs guidance. When you explain something to someone, if there is no thought process behind it, they're not going to comprehend what needs to happen,\" Henry said. \"We all know that he can finish, but sometimes you need to slow down and re-accelerate to see the big picture. \"Do you see the solution or do you see the problem? When you put your head up, your eyes can be pretty deceiving. What do you see? Do you see the problem? We see the solution; the brain will make you see the solution. Sometimes eyes can be deceiving, and you see the problem; that's the difference.\"\nIn an age where analytics are growing, this feels like a throwback to where wingers got chalk on their boots and fired crosses into the box. A Guardiola system can be criticized for turning players into robots, but Doku is showing that there is individuality left at Manchester City, which can help push the team forward as they look to win another Champions League title. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Jacksonville Jaguars were \"buyers\" at this year's NFL trade deadline, as they sent a pair of draft picks to the Las Vegas Raiders for wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. Multiple teams were reportedly interested in Meyers, but it was first-year Jacksonville coach Liam Coen that landed him.   Meyers has just 33 catches for 352 yards this year, but he's registered four straight 800-yard receiving seasons -- including a 1,000-yard campaign in 2024. The Jaguars hope he can bring some stability to an inconsistent passing attack using his \"superpower.\"    \"We're looking forward to seeing how his skill set fits within the system,\" Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said, via ESPN. \"I think from afar it does. You think about where we're at in terms of volume of drops, what's his superpower? It's not dropping the football, right? So you just take it from the surface level, it seems fitting.\"   \n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers trade grades: Jaguars bolster WR room as Raiders collect future picks\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUsually catching the football is not a \"superpower\" for a wide receiver. But for the Jaguars, it is approaching that territory.   \nJacksonville plagued by drops   According to CBS Sports Research, the Jaguars are tied in having the most dropped passes (30) through eight games since 2000. Jacksonville has also not gotten much production from its top wideout, Brian Thomas Jr.    After a historic rookie campaign in which he caught 87 passes for 1,282 yards and 10 touchdowns, Thomas is averaging just 3.8 receptions and 52.5 receiving yards per game with only one touchdown. He had four 100-yard receiving games as a rookie, but has yet to cross that threshold in 2025.

No. 2 overall pick Travis Hunter, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner and Fred Biletnikoff Award winner, has just 28 catches for 298 yards and a touchdown -- and it's unclear when he'll see the field again. To put those numbers in perspective, he's averaging fewer receiving yards per game than tight ends Juwan Johnson and Harold Fannin Jr.    Overall, the Jaguars passing offense ranks No. 16 in the NFL with 215.3 passing yards per game, but if you take into account just the numbers from the receivers, it looks much worse.       Trevor Lawrence targeting WRs this season         NFL RankCompletion percentage 56% 30th Yards per attempt 6.9 26th TD-INT 5-6 28th Passer rating 73.0 30th Recent injuries led to Meyers tradeApart from acquiring a new weapon that can potentially bring some stability to a unit that desperately needs it, the Jaguars also needed a new wide receiver. Period.    Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury, Thomas did not practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury, Tim Patrick has a groin issue and Dyami Brown is working through a concussion. Parker Washington, who led Jacksonville on Sunday with 90 yards on eight catches in the overtime victory over the Raiders, has been earning Lawrence's trust, but the Jags needed to add more talent in this department. Meyers helps with that.      An important Week 10 showdown   Not many view the Jaguars' Week 10 tilt vs. the rival Houston Texans as the game of the week, but it's incredibly important when it comes to the AFC South. The 5-3 Jags defeated the 3-5 Texans earlier this year, and sweeping the season series would not only put more ground between them and Houston in the division, but also inch Jacksonville closer to the 7-2 Indianapolis Colts. The Jaguars are 1.5-point road underdogs for Sunday's matchup.This decision to add Meyers was made with contending in mind, and that begins on Sunday. Meyers himself is not going to revolutionize Jacksonville's offense, but if the veteran pass-catcher can quickly establish himself as a reliable target for Lawrence, it's something that could take this team to the next level.    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        More people watched Game 7 of the 2025 World Series than any game since the 1991 Fall Classic. The game drew 51 million viewers across the United States, Canada and Japan. Overall, the entire World Series was the most watched globally since 1992 and it was a 19% increase over last season. That same Game 7 had roughly double the number of viewers in the United States as Game 7 of the NBA Finals. In this day and age and in a non-football sport, that's staggering.Yes, NFL and college football people who love to scream at the other sports about ratings, we get it. You're the true monster of American sports. You dominate us. We get it. I'm a big football fan, too, so I have no problem with more people watching it. There's room to celebrate victories in other sports as well. We should still acknowledge that the 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays was a major success for Major League Baseball.Unless you're a network executive, you shouldn't care about TV ratings. But these numbers tell us more about baseball than just ratings.\nOne of the loudest arguments against MLB right now revolves around salary. The Dodgers, the first repeat champions since 2000, had the top payroll in baseball, which means the suggestion is that if a team just \"buys\" a championship -- it's never even remotely that simple, by the way -- then people will start to tune out the sport. In that narrative, it's imperative for the league to get control of spending in order to bring back all the fans who quit watching. You'll also hear nonsense like, \"it's just the same teams every year!\" The Blue Jays hadn't been to the World Series since 1993. Last year's runners-up, the Yankees, hadn't been since 2009. The 2023 World Series pitted a team that won its first-ever World Series against a team that hadn't been there since 2001. So that argument doesn't fly. Now we're back to the whole \"no one pays attention because it's not fair without a salary cap\" argument.\nAnd yet, the numbers speak for themselves, don't they? Not only did the Dodgers just win the World Series with the top payroll in baseball, but they are the repeat champions and 51 million people watched them win Game 7. Were they watching to root against the Dodgers? Possibly. Does it matter why people watched or does it only matter that they watched?Again, the entire structure of this pro-salary cap argument is that the product is bad without it and people will stop watching because they're bored. They want to see underdogs, not big spenders. And yet more people tuned in to watch the Dodgers and Blue Jays (who, by the way, had the fifth-highest payroll in MLB) than had in more than three decades.The more people watch, the more the league makes money. This is a business. From this perspective, the league just had its most successful World Series since at least 1992. Given the current media environment with so many other viewing options on different mediums, you could probably make the argument it was the most fruitful World Series, I don't know, ever? \nI do know this much: the whole \"MLB needs a salary cap to keep people interested\" argument really collapses on itself when you see these kinds of numbers. Put it this way, do you really think a Brewers-Rays World Series would've done this kind of business? It sets up an interesting discussion point for the owner side in front of the next CBA, coming next offseason. We know the players are very averse to a salary cap and the owners want one. I agree that it's unfair to have such a gigantic payroll disparity between the Dodgers and the lower third or so of those other teams. I just think the solution is for the lower-tier teams to spend more. There's already revenue sharing. The richest teams are giving money to the \"poor\" teams (psst: None of them are poor). \nWith the league as a whole seeing what kind of interest this World Series generated compared to a year like 2023, it'll be interesting to see how things unfold on the ownership side. We know they love making money. Will they really want to try and mess with what just happened in the name of satisfying some of the cheapest owners? Or will they tell the cheapest owners to start spending the money they get from the deep-pocketed ones?Regardless, the argument that \"baseball is dying\" or \"no one watches\" due to lack of a salary cap was just exploded like both Death Stars. There are 51 million reasons to get a new argument.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After breaking Wayne Gretzky's all-time record last season, Washington Capitals legend Alex Ovechkin is now the inaugural member of the NHL's 900-goal club. Ovechkin reached No. 900 with his tally in the second period against the St. Louis Blues on Wednesday night.Throughout his career, Ovechkin has scored goals in a variety of ways, and his 900th might have been one of the most unique. After a Jakob Chychrun shot bounced off the end board, Ovechkin scooped up the puck and snuck a spin-o-rama backhand past a sprawling Jordan Binnington.\nIt was another historic moment for Ovechkin, and Binnington tried to keep a piece of history all to himself. While the Capitals were mobbing Ovechkin, Binnington managed to sneak the puck into his pants, thinking no one would notice.Was Binnington going to flip it on eBay for a little extra cash? Was he going to keep it on his mantle? Maybe Binnington was simply going to chuck it in the garbage out of spite. Whatever plans Binnington had, they were spoiled when a linesman skated by and made him retrieve the puck.\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 NHL Draft, Ovechkin has been climbing the record books at a rapid pace since his rookie campaign in 2005-06. Ovechkin has hit the 40-goal mark 14 times, and he's surpassed 50 goals on nine different occasions. Ovechkin has won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the league's top goal-scorer nine times, far and away the most in NHL history.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Cardiac Canadiens keep producing one thriller after another as they soar into top five\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, Ovechkin finally surpassed Gretzky with his 895th goal and entered the 2025-26 season with 897 under his belt. After a somewhat slow start, at least by his standards, Ovechkin has earned another distinction with goal No. 900.There are still 70 games left in the season, and Ovechkin hasn't even indicated that this will be his last, though he is playing on an expiring contract. So, exactly how many goals can Ovechkin score before his career is over?\nHow many goals can Ovechkin score in his NHL career?Ovechkin has the chance to add a lot of cushion to his all-time goals record. And there aren't any major signs of him slowing down, at least offensively. Yes, Ovechkin is 40 years old, but he is built very differently from almost every other athlete.This is a player whose favorite pregame meal is an Italian feast fit for two or three. He also takes Pepsi in his water bottle and Dr. Pepper at intermission. Let's also not forget that, at the age of 39, he broke his fibula during the season and still managed to score 44 goals en route to breaking Gretzky's record.To this point in his career, Ovechkin has never scored fewer than 32 goals in a season. Let's at least give him that in 2025-26, which doesn't seem unreasonable considering he scored 44 in 65 games last year. That would put Ovechkin at 929 goals by season's end, but what if he decides to play another season or two? After all, the Capitals are a team on the rise with a good young coach, so maybe he wants to chase another Stanley Cup.\nIf nothing else, Ovechkin could extend his career to the age of 41 or 42 on the strength of his power play prowess alone. In 18 of his 19 full seasons, Ovechkin has scored at least 13 power play goals and as many as 25. If teams were going to stop his patented one-timer from the left circle, they probably would have done that at some point over the last two decades.If Ovechkin can stay on the ice for the rest of this season, plus 2026-27, it's well within the realm of possibility that he could eclipse 950 goals. It's probably fair to say 1,000 goals is probably out of range for Ovechkin, but it would not be wise to put his chances of getting there at zero because of the longevity, durability and consistency he's shown to this point.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the most basic terms Erling Haaland, Manchester City captain for the second time, led his team mates in much the same fashion that he has throughout his three years and change in England. Skippers can smash heads together, they can run themselves into the ground, but really there is no better way to set an example than by doing your job to the best of your abilities.Yet again Haaland did exactly that, a thundering back stick strike to cap an elegant City move, killing off any hopes his former club Borussia Dortmund might have had of overturning the lead Phil Foden had carved out seven minutes earlier. This was the Haaland that has obliterated defenses throughout his career. He holds court at the second post, waiting for the ball to come to him and knowing that when he does he will make no mistake. That is how you end up with 18 goals in 14 club games this season. That is what might win you the Ballon d'Or.Then again, if City are going to win trophies they are going to need that scintilla more from their best player than what he has delivered over the past few years. Even on a night where Foden scored a brilliant brace, this is the most heliocentric City have been under Pep Guardiola. Depending on your view of the final Lionel Messi Barcelona sides, this might be the most star reliant any elite club has been this century.In such circumstances it becomes incumbent on Haaland to make life easier for those around him, to do more than take up a scoring position and wait for the ball to come his way. Sometimes he has to go get it and exploit that gravity of his in different fashions. It would be a joy to see more of that iteration, there are few sights as exhilarating in any sport as Haaland playing the equivalent of a basketball point forward, the sort of barnstorming run he unleashed in the 27th minute tonight. After a quickly taken free kick by Nico Gonzalez, space opened up in front of the Dortmund back three. On Haaland drove, Felix Nmecha clinging onto his left shoulder and Waldemar Anton barely able to keep up with the marauding Norseman. The rest of the defense did what is only natural in such circumstances, they collapsed towards the ball, four bodies converging on Haaland, none alone able to slow the freight train flying at them. And then with a deft touch that you might not immediately associate with him, Haaland popped the ball off to his right. An unmarked Nico O'Reilly had perhaps gone a moment too soon, or maybe the pass was a smidge misplaced. Whatever the explanation, the shot was a slightly underpowered hook but it still took a fine save from Gregor Kobel to deny Haaland his assist.\nEven so, his team mates rushed over to the City captain, garlanding him with as much adulation as he would get for the winner a few moments later. They know how effective this Haaland can be, the Haaland who, as Thierry Henry put it pre-match, \"used to play the game,\" but is now \"thinking it.\"\n\"He understands that it isn't Kevin De Bruyne or Joao Cancelo delivering the crosses to him anymore. Haaland needs to make it easier for his team mates to find him.\" As Henry noted, that means runs across goal, a little more movement and a little less waiting for the ball to come. Haaland's movement isn't just creating chances for himself but space for others. That much was apparent for City's opener. When the ball came to Foden, his skipper could just have powered up the gut in expectation of a through ball. Instead he curled his run outside the right center back in Dortmund's back three. That defender had to follow Haaland which meant the one in the middle couldn't step up to the ball. The two yards of space that created were more than enough for Foden to spot his line and roll it into the far corner.\nPerhaps some of this is ascribing greater selflessness to Haaland than might be the case. The changing of his runs might be focused on making life easier for his teammates, or it might be about a striker hell bent on goals concluding that he is going to have to do a bit more himself now that De Bruyne isn't around to put chances on a plate for him. Ultimately it doesn't really matter. Haaland has not just made himself better this season. He has begun to make his team mates better. That is an intimidating prospect for those yet to face City.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        I want to let you guys in on a little secret. Big swings in Dynasty rankings are not that much fun for those of us who compile Dynasty rankings and update them regularly. Sure, they're a fact of life, but ultimately they mean that a week ago, or even a month ago, the person who put together the rankings was wrong. In the case of both Kyler Murray and Rico Dowdle, it appears I was very wrong. Let's start with the riser; at least he's not depressing.In Week 9, Dave Canales gave the backfield to Dowdle even though Chuba Hubbard was available. And what Dowdle did makes it unlikely that will change unless there is another injury. Dowdle produced 141 yards and two touchdowns against a very good Green Bay Packers defense. It was his third game since the start of October with at least 26 PPR Fantasy points. Since Week 5, he is one of three running backs to score at least 100 PPR Fantasy points. What does this mean? Well, for this year, it means that Dowdle is potentially a league winner. If you have him on your roster and you aren't a contender this year, it means you should see if any of the true contenders will give you a first-round pick for him. I would aim for a 2027 pick because the class looks better on paper and because true contenders are definitely going to have late picks in 2026, but they may fall off next year and give you a more valuable pick. For contenders, the first thing I would try to do is package two second-round picks and see if the team that has Dowdle will bite. If not, I would consider giving up a 2026 first if I really thought he was the piece that could put me over the top. On a recent episode of Fantasy Football Today, we debated whether Dowdle was a top 12 running back rest of season, and half of us thought he was. That is where the conversation starts.In the Dynasty rankings below, he ranks as RB34. Why so low? He's a 27-year-old on a one-year contract. There is no guarantee he will have a role with this much upside in 2026 or 2027. But the odds are growing every week.\nThis week on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty, I had Jacob Gibbs on to talk about the trade deadline and which slumping players we should have hope for. Check it out:One of the slumping players we talked about was Kyler Murray. He was first benched for Jacoby Brissett and then placed on Injured Reserve. We don't really expect him to start another game this year unless Brissett gets hurt. But in Dynasty, his situation is nearly the opposite of Dowdle's. He has $57 million in dead cap money after the conclusion of this season. Also, he's in the prime of his career, and a year ago, nearly everyone had him ranked as a top 12 QB in Dynasty and at least an average QB in the NFL. I would bet on Murray starting somewhere in Week 1 of the 2026 season, even if it is not in Arizona.While Murray did fall to QB25 in the rankings below, I would still call him a hold. That is easier because he is on IR, and many leagues have a place you can stash those guys. If you don't have those spots, I am still holding in all Superflex leagues and all but the most shallow of one-QB leagues. There are not enough starting QBs in the NFL for 32 teams to pass on Murray if they get the chance. And as of November, there aren't enough good prospects in the 2026 class to fix the problem. If you wanted to try to buy in Superflex leagues, I would not offer more than a Round 2 pick. \nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine. There you'll find trade values for both Superflex and One-QB trades to help you dominate your Dynasty league.Here are my updated Dynasty Quarterback Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Running Back Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Wide Receiver Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Tight End Rankings:\n            ",

Additionally, Northern Illinois is a disciplined crew as they commit the 16th fewest penalties per game.Discipline happens to be something that Toledo is lacking as just seven teams in FBS commit more penalties per game.

Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2.

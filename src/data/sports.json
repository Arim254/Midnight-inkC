Booker connected helmet-to-helmet on the sack, dropping Love hard to the turf. Love remained on the turf for minutes, grabbing at his helmet before being checked by the athletic staff and escorted into the blue medical tent for evaluation. Booker was flagged for roughing the passer for the contact to Love's head.\nThe Packers confirmed that Love was undergoing evaluation for a concussion and listed his possible return to the pivotal NFC North game as questionable. As the second half began, the Packers confirmed that Love had been ruled out for the remainder of the game with a concussion.\nBackup quarterback Malik Willis entered the game following Love's injury. Willis helped drive the Packers down the field after Love exited the game, leading to a field goal to take a 6-0 lead into the half.\nLove has completed 66% of his passes on the season, throwing for 3,304 yards, 23 touchdowns and just six interceptions as he has led the Packers to a 9-4-1 record, slightly trailing the 10-4 Bears in the division. Love was also injured in a game against the Bears late in the 2024 season, though he returned for the Packers' Wild Card loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        OXFORD, Miss. -- With \"Pete!\" chants ringing out loudly inside a still packed Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, a fired-up and soaking wet Pete Goldi",
    "body": "\n        OXFORD, Miss. -- With \"Pete!\" chants ringing out loudly inside a still packed Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, a fired-up and soaking wet Pete Golding embraced the moment walking off the field with his two sons, pumped his fist to the sky and emphatically tossed his visor into the crowd.It was a move his predecessor Lane Kiffin had made before, but this was different. After Kiffin jilted Ole Miss for LSU, the Rebels faithful needed someone to direct their adoration to and they did so overwhelmingly for a first-time head coach who just delivered the first playoff win in program history. Ole Miss fans loved Pete Golding, and he loved them back. \"Well, we just had a home playoff game in Oxford, decent signing day and we just won the game,\" Golding deadpanned about the chants of his name. \"I'm well aware how the other side goes when you don't win the game so I've been on both sides of that.\"\nAfter No. 6 Ole Miss' 43-10 blowout win over No. 11 Tulane to set up a Sugar Bowl rematch against No. 3 Georgia, it can be easy to ignore how much pressure Golding faced in his debut. In his first ever game as a head coach, Golding had to win a playoff game at home against a team the Kiffin-led Ole Miss team beat by 35 points in September. He had to do so after a chaotic stretch in which Kiffin's will-he-or-won't-he decision sucked all the oxygen out of the program and overshadowed the special season the Rebels were having. Losing Kiffin, who fought until the very end to coach this team through the playoff, could have imploded a lesser team. No head coach has ever left a playoff-bound team before it played in the College Football Playoff, and it may be awhile before we see another pull a Kiffin. There were a lot of emotions -- some good, some bad -- for a group of college-aged men to have to process in real-time over the last two weeks leading up to this game. Maybe getting Tulane as the first post-Kiffin game was the ideal scenario for Ole Miss to find its footing. It certainly looked easy from the jump as Ole Miss raced out to a 14-0 lead and didn't give up a touchdown until a garbage-time score with four minutes left in the game. \nBut you can imagine how disastrous it could have been for Golding, Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter and the rest of the coaching staff if Tulane somehow won. Carter made a bold decision to hold his ground in not allowing Kiffin to continue to coach this team, and then doubled down promoting Golding from defensive coordinator to full-time head coach. \n        \n            \n                Pete Golding, Ole Miss separate from Lane Kiffin ahead of College Football Playoff: 'I ain't going to yoga'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOle Miss badly needed Golding to prove it could win at the highest levels without Kiffin. It's only one game, but Golding passed the test with flying colors. The team did not miss a beat. It helped that offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. committed to calling the plays through the Rebels' playoff run before leaving for good to join Kiffin in Baton Rouge. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss led the way with 282 passing yards, one passing touchdown and two rushing touchdowns. \nGolding wasn't worried about how the offense would look under Weis Jr., just like he wasn't worried about his offensive coordinator reneging on a commitment to finish out the season. \"I had zero concern with Charlie Weis calling this thing for one reason: Charlie Weis cannot afford not to call a hell of a game,\" Golding said. \"All he's heard is all Lane Kiffin's offense, Lane Kiffin's offense, Lane Kiffin's offense. This is his one opportunity for people to realize Charlie Weis calls the offense -- just like he's done all year -- and did a great job tonight. I had no concern because the last thing Charlie wants to do is come out and lay an egg.\"There were both subtle and noticeable differences between this Ole Miss team under Golding than the one that finished the regular season 11-1. \nAfter Golding took over, he talked to every player on the roster and had two important questions: What is the No. 1 thing you love about Ole Miss football?What is the biggest thing you would change if you could?The answers to the second question and action items that stemmed from it were interesting. The gimmicky basketball hoop Ole Miss players would dunk on to celebrate touchdowns and turnovers was nowhere to be found Saturday (even as Ole Miss forced three turnovers). Another, more subtle change? Golding agreed to allow players to wear whatever color cleats they'd like as long as they were Nike. Kiffin had the players all wear the same color shoe. Ole Miss greenlit its players wearing different colored cleats.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It's the little things that distinguish Golding the head coach from Golding the defensive coordinator. He's still calling the defensive plays and he's still coming into his own as a head coach, but you can see the potential. There's an authenticity from Golding that is rare from the typical coachspeak and cliched answers you usually hear. \n\"He just has that head coach swag about himself,\" said Ole Miss co-defensive coordinator Bryan Brown. \"He controls the moment, he controls the narrative, anything he wants to control. The guys believe in him, just like they do defensively, and you could see it turn over to our whole team. He's a great human being, he's a great coach, a great motivator and he knows football inside and out.\" Said quarterbacks coach Joe Judge: \"Pete's Pete. I think what makes him so special is he's not going to change no matter what title or label you put on. He's always been the same guy.\" Golding is still rough around the edges. The 41-year old Louisiana native admitted he's trying to cuss less, but let's just say that's very much a work in progress. There were times Golding turned his postgame press conference into a mini-comedy hour with his deadpan answers, self-deprecating sense of humor and colorful language. \nConsider his answer about helping his team navigate what has been a chaotic last few weeks.\"I don't think it was very hard at all, because, I mean, it'd be one thing, no disrespect, if this was the Pop-Tarts Bowl or something like that, that shit would be really hard,\" Golding said. \"This is the playoffs. When people started talking about are they gonna play, are they not gonna play? What are you talking about?\"The next challenge figures to be a lot harder than what Golding faced Saturday. Ole Miss already played Georgia once this season, a 43-35 loss in Athens. Golding's defense gave up 34 first downs, 510 total yards and never forced the Bulldogs to punt in the game. A repeat of that performance won't be good enough down in New Orleans on New Year's Day in the Sugar Bowl. \nThat's a problem for Golding to worry about tomorrow. On Saturday night in front of a school-record crowd inside Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, Golding won his first game as a head coach and gave an Ole Miss fanbase a joy it had never experienced before. It was worth a celebratory visor toss and so much more. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After blowing a 16-point fourth quarter lead on Thursday night to the Seahawks, Rams coach Sean McVay decided to make an in-season change to his staff for the first time ever. McVay fired special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn, according to ESPN. Blackburn's special teams unit has been one of the few weaknesses for the Rams this season, and a punt return touchdown early in the fourth quarter served as the spark for Seattle's comeback win in overtime. \nThe Rams also missed a field goal later in the fourth, a continuation of a rough kicking season in L.A. where they rank 31st in the league with a 75% make percentage on field goal attempts. \nBlackburn was in his third season as the special teams coordinator in L.A. after spending time as an assistant with the Panthers and Titans to begin his coaching career. McVay has been fiercely loyal to his assistants in his nine years as the Rams' coach, but in a season where the Rams appear to have a team capable of winning a championship, he decided the special teams situation was untenable and needed an immediate change. \nThe Rams are 11-4, but the loss to Seattle dropped them a game behind the Seahawks for the division lead and the all-important No. 1 seed in the NFC that gets the lone bye from the Wild Card round. It's not clear who will take over the special teams unit for the remainder of the season and the playoffs, but the Rams will hope to clean up that operation to avoid losing ground to opponents in the third phase of the game. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The CBS Sports Classic was the belle of the ball in Saturday's college basketball schedule, and boy, did it deliver. Kentucky survived a scary-looking injury to Jaland Lowe and rallied in the second half to run away from No. 22 St. John's, 78-66. The outlook in Lexington has dramatically changed as the now-healthy 'Cats showcased some real teeth.   \n        \n            \n                After Jayden Quaintance's Kentucky debut in victory vs. St. John's, things are looking up for Wildcats\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the nightcap, it was all North Carolina for close to 37 minutes before a late Ohio State rally that was snuffed with a game-winning Henri Veesaar slam in the closing seconds to give the Tar Heels a 71-70 victory.   But compelling basketball was not hard to find in every nook and cranny.   Let's dive into the winners and losers from Saturday's topsy-turvy slate.    \tWinner: Kentucky's bookends emerge  Point guard and center are the two most important positions on the floor, and Kentucky coach Mark Pope's offseason vision finally came to fruition in Saturday's 78-66 win over No. 22 St. John's. Lowe somewhat miraculously shook off another shoulder stinger and cooked St. John's in the second half for 13 points and three assists. But the return of big man Jayden Quaintance was the biggest story. Quaintance totaled 10 points, eight rebounds and numerous rim-rocking slams to go along with blanketing defense on St. John's star Zuby Ejiofor.   \"You all need to learn a little bit of a lesson as writers,\" St. John's coach Rick Pitino said after the game. \"You're expecting Kentucky to be a great basketball team with all of these injuries. You all need to learn a lesson -- you can't be a great basketball team without two of your best players.\" -– Isaac Trotter  \n  \tWinner: The sweater game between Tom Izzo, Greg Kampe  Michigan State won the game 79-70 over Oakland in Detroit, but the real winner from this one was the fashion from its head coaches. Tom Izzo donned a Christmas sweater with the word \"NAUGHTY\" in all caps on it -- and friend and competitor, Greg Kampe, wore a matching sweater with the word \"NICE\" in all caps across the front. Izzo's sweater also had a visual of him yelling at an official while Kampe's shows him smiling and fist-bumping an official. A bang-up job all-around and a huge win for fashion in college hoops. -- Kyle Boone  \n  \tWinner: UNC's frontcourt stays flexin'  Has any position group transformed from a weakness to a strength like UNC's frontcourt? 2024-25 UNC featured a frontcourt that was undersized and limited on both ends. The glow-up is real with the Henri Veesaar-Caleb Wilson tandem taking center stage. No. 12 North Carolina improved to 11-1 with a last-second, 71-70 victory over Ohio State thanks to a game-winning, rim-rocking slam from Veesaar to cap a day that saw him who score 17 points, grab 10 boards and dish out five assists.   Wilson, a potential top-five pick in next summer's NBA Draft, continued his unbelievable freshman campaign with a 20-point, 15-rebound, two-assist, three-block showing even amidst a slow first half.  \nNorth Carolina certainly has one of the top frontcourts in the country. Oh, and getting a healthy Seth Trimble back certainly doesn't hurt. Trimble splashed some big treys, delivered the game-winning dime, helped slow down Ohio State star Bruce Thornton and finished with 17 points. All in a day's work for the UNC captain. -- Trotter    \tLoser: Memphis hits a freefall  A year ago, Memphis rode a 10-3 record against one of the nation's toughest nonconference schedules to a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. This time around, a similarly challenging slate is wreaking havoc on the Tigers, who fell to 4-7 with a 71-67 loss at Mississippi State on Saturday.   Now 1-6 against high-major opposition, the Tigers have no path to the NCAA Tournament outside of winning the AAC Tournament -- their chances at making the Big Day as an at-large are 0.0%, per CBS Sports Bracketology.   \nWhat's so frustrating is that Memphis has been close, as five of its losses have come in tight games. But with zero continuity from last year's team, the Tigers have lost their winning edge and are careening toward their worst season yet under eighth-year coach Penny Hardaway. -- Cobb  \n  \tWinner: Louisville passes final nonconference test shorthanded  Playing without star freshman point guard Mikel Brown Jr. for the first time earlier this week, No. 11 Louisville looked lost on the road in an 83-62 defeat to Tennessee. But it bounced back in a big way Saturday night as Brown continued to ride the pine in recovery with a 94-54 win over Montana. The outing -- Louisville's last of its non-league schedule before ACC begins Dec. 30 vs. Cal -- was a dominant interior performance as it scored 44 of its 94 points in the paint and scored 21 points off second-chance opportunities. -- Kyle Boone  \n  \tLoser: Dayton flubs shot to build momentum before A-10 play  Dayton fumbled away what seemed like a surefire win and punched its ticket to misery town with a 64-61 loss at home to Liberty. The Flyers closed as 10.5-point favorites in the game and had a 3-point lead with 2:09 remaining before the visiting Flames closed on a 6-0 run to steal the win. Dayton missed six of its final seven field goal attempts in its flailing finish and went the final 2:28 without scoring a point. Ouch. -- Boone  \n  \tLoser: St. John's has leaky pick-and-roll defense  Another game, another lead guard just getting whatever it wanted in pick-and-rolls against this St. John's defense. Add Jaland Lowe to the list of lead guards who eviscerated St. John's off the bounce. All the preseason concerns about the drop-off for this perimeter defense without Kadary Richmond and Deivon Smith have reared their ugly heads. Kentucky also scored 21 transition points. St. John's can't become the team it wants to be without this point-of-attack defense getting significantly stiffer quickly. -- Trotter    \tLoser: Colorado State takes it on the chin  Colorado State had pieced together wins against a trio of top-100 NET teams over the past month as it entered Saturday's Mountain West tilt with league frontrunner Utah State. But the Rams' momentum came to a screeching halt in a 100-58 loss. The Aggies improved to 10-1 behind double-figure scoring contributions from six players while shooting a whopping 64%, including 12 of 21 from 3-point range.   The lopsided outcome provided authoritative evidence that the Mountain West will run through Utah State in 2026. All is not lost for a Colorado State team that has shown the makings of being a strong offensive squad under first-year coach Ali Farokhmanesh, but this was a humbling defensive performance. -- David Cobb  \n  \tWinner: Longwood wins at the buzzer  Longwood edged NC Central 74-72 when Elijah Tucker tipped in a wild prayer of a shot from teammate Redd Thompson Jr. at the buzzer. It was a fitting ending for the Lancers, who dominated the offensive glass for a 15-6 advantage in second-chance points. It was Tucker's first bucket since the 9:37 mark, and it came just in time to send Longwood into Christmas with a 7-7 record. -- Cobb  \n  \tWinner: Miami (Ohio) remains undefeated after another road win  Miami (Ohio) remained among the shrinking group of unbeaten teams with an 86-77 road win over Ball State to improve to 12-0 on the season. The win kept the RedHawks and fourth-year coach Travis Steele perfect, capping a challenging four-game stretch of away games that included a 3-point OT win over UNC Asheville on Dec. 10 and a back-and-forth battle Saturday vs. Ball State in which the Redhawks eventually pulled away. They will be big favorites Monday vs. the NAIA's Milligan in their penultimate game of the 2025 calendar year before diving headfirst into MAC play again Dec. 30 at Bowling Green. -- Boone   \tWinner: Houston makes a statement vs. Arkansas Since losing to Tennessee last month, Houston has been on fire. The Cougars won their fifth straight game with a 94-85 win over No. 14 Arkansas, their second ranked win of the season. One of the most impressive first-year players in the sport has been Kingston Flemings. He finished with 21 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Once again, Houston is going to be a tough out in March. -- Cameron Salerno  \n  \tPurdue runs away from Auburn  Purdue got some good, old-fashioned revenge on Auburn after getting run off the floor a year ago by Johni Broome and the Tigers. This time, it was all Boilers from start to finish. Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 18 points and Braden Smith dealt 14 dimes in an 88-69 romp. Purdue shot 46% from downtown and got 11 treys combined from CJ Cox, Jack Better and Gicarri Harris. -- Trotter  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Washington Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota exited Saturday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles with a hand injury. On the first drive of the second half, Mariota pulled up after running toward the sideline and is now questionable to return.On a third-down play, Mariota escaped the pocket and threw the ball away after trying to buy some extra time. Eagles defensive lineman Jordan Davis was in pursuit when Mariota finished the play awkwardly. As Washington sent the punt unit out, Mariota was in clear discomfort on the sideline.During the Eagles' ensuing possession, backup quarterback Josh Johnson warmed up while Mariota jogged off the field and toward the locker room.\nThe Commanders reported that Mariota was evaluated for a concussion during a brief stint in the injury tent. While Mariota cleared the concussion protocol, he is still being evaluated for a right hand injury.Before exiting the game, Mariota completed seven of his 14 passing attempts for 95 yards. He only had one rushing attempt, which lost a yard.\nWith star quarterback Jayden Daniels sidelined for most of the season, Mariota has now started eight games. Entering Saturday, Mariota had completed 62.0% of his passes for 1,600 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions while adding 298 yards and a score on the ground.Johnson, 39, replaced the injured Mariota, and it marks his first real action of the 2025 season. Johnson, who has played for an NFL record 14 teams, registered appearances in two games, but he didn't attempt a pass in either one.Johnson hasn't taken meaningful snaps since the 2021 season when he started a game for the Baltimore Ravens. In 47 career games (and nine starts), Johnson has completed 58.1% of his throws for 2,297 yards, 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also brings some mobility with 426 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.\nThe Commanders entered Saturday with a 4-10 record. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEWARK, N.J. — How do you make it to within one shot of winning a national title, bring back three key pieces from that team, start 10-1 and still float along the outskirts of the national radar?Only one way: You're the perpetually under-discussed Houston Cougars. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying it's how it is. Far too often. \"Don't sleep on Houston,\" Kelvin Sampson famously said last April after the Cougars stunned much of the college hoops world by ending Cooper Flagg's college career with the Coogs' epic upset of No. 1 Duke in the Final Four.It's time to remind the world to wake up again. Maybe it's because Houston loves to win ugly. Maybe it's because its schedule hasn't been flashy so far. Maybe it's because the Cougars don't produce one-and-done talent (though, read on, because that's now no longer the case).But here we are again, amid another season, and Houston is one of the best teams in the country. It's time to start paying game-by-game attention to the Cougars once more, as they are the most reliably successful team in college basketball and proved that true again on Saturday with another physically authoritative, Houston-style win against overmatched Arkansas in the Never Forget Tribute Classic at the Prudential Center. \nThe Cougars defeated the Razorbacks 94-85 to improve to 11-1, getting there behind 22 points from senior guard Emanuel Sharp and 21 more from freshman guard Kingston Flemings Jr.\nHouston entered the game with a No. 8 ranking, Arkansas at No. 14. They didn't look all that close. Arkansas was within breathing distance for the entire second half, but Houston broke the game open when it ripped off a 15-0 run to get the score to 41-19. The game teetered there. The only reason it wasn't a blowout was thanks to the play of Arkansas freshman point Darius Acuff Jr., who kept the gap from becoming a chasm. Acuff, who may well be a lottery pick in next June's NBA Draft, finished with 27 points and seven assists, both game-highs. \nJohn Calipari and Kelvin Sampson have 70 Seasons and 1,600-plus wins between them, but this was just the second time they'd ever matched its; Calipari got the better of Sampson in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. For Arkansas, the game was a missed opportunity. The Hogs are 9-3, but a victory here would have surely bumped their reputation up a tier. Instead, they're one of six or seven teams with talent that are jumbled near the top of the SEC, which will start league play in two weeks. Houston's in a much rosier position. The Big 12 is stacked with the likes of Arizona, Iowa State, BYU and even Kansas. It hasn't dropped a bit from its perch in this sport. The answer as to why Houston wasn't getting more attention is their schedule. Saturday's win logs as just the second Quad 1 victory for UH through 12 games, joining the Nov. 16 73-72 defeat of Auburn in Birmingham, Alabama. Beating Arkansas also improved UH to 7-1 in the last eight games in top-15 matchups.\nThis is what Sampson's teams do. Win way more than they lose, and when they win, they hurt you and tend not to make it close. You might've forgotten it amid the crunch of incredible November games, but Houston's only loss came by three at Players Era in Vegas. I was there; Tennessee might not play a better overall game this season. And the Vols are obviously of good quality. That in mind, Houston having a lone single-possession loss against a team that might be a top-four seed shouldn't displace them from the conversation of who's elite in this terrific season. Houston's adaptability Saturday was also admirable. Arkansas came into the game averaging 89.9 points, and it got close to that, but Houston had no problem making it a track meet. The game had 73 possessions, the most Houston's played in regulation since the start of the 2024-25 season. I know Kelvin Sampson abhors seeing another team hit 80-plus on his guys, but having this kind of win will serve Houston well in the next three months.\nThe Cougars stymied the run-happy Hogs, who came into the game ranked No. 2 in fast break points at 22.7 per night. On this night, a mere seven — which is a half-point more than Houston gives up per game.Houston knew it would have its moments on the offensive glass — Arkansas allows 16 per game in second-chance opportunities — and voila: Cougars got 16 on the board after securing 12 offensive rebounds.No matter the cut-off you want to use, Houston leads all teams in college basketball in win total in the past five, six, seven, eight years. It's no surprise the Cougars are great again. Not just great, but a national title contender, and while they don't rate top-five in efficiency just yet, their DNA puts them in a deep pool of teams that includes undefeateds such as Arizona, Michigan, Duke and Iowa State. Then the one-loss bullies are Houston, UConn, Gonzaga, Purdue, Michigan State and North Carolina. (Undefeated Vanderbilt may well be in that class as well, but it's yet to beat a top-30 team.)\nGetting Sharp, Uzan and Tugler back, with that Final Four experience, is huge. But the addition of Flemings is what changes the dynamics in play. He's a rangy lead guard who was ranked 20th in his high school class and has already outplayed that projection. He's putting up better than 15 points, five assists and shooting almost 60%. Houston's always been good/great under Sampson. Always been tough. Always been opportunistic. Always had a swagger. Kingston makes them dangerous. Uzan and Sharp are capable of taking and making the big shot, but Flemings is the guy who is the key to keeping Houston just as good this season as it was last season, and the one before that, and the one before that. \nBut even more? He's talented enough to make Houston believe that getting back to a national championship game should be the expectation, not the hope. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It has been seven weeks since the World Series ended and so far only three of our top 10 free agents have signed and two of our top 25 trade candidates have been moved. A slow offseason, this has been, though we did get a three-team trade Friday. Perhaps that's a sign the hot stove is about to heat up. Here now are Saturday's rumors. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pirates hope to add another batEven after picking up Brandon Lowe, the Pirates hope to add what GM Ben Cherington called a \"proven bat,\" according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Third base and DH could use an upgrade, possibly left field as well. Really, everything should be on the table after the Pirates scored the fewest runs and hit the fewest home runs in baseball in 2025.FanGraphs estimates the club's 2026 payroll at $82 million, including arbitration projections. It was $87 million in 2025. If they hold steady at the same payroll level next year, there's not much room to spend. The Pirates have signaled a willingness to spend big this offseason (their Kyle Schwarber pursuit, etc.), so perhaps Cherington & Co. still have plenty of financial wiggle room.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPhillies pursuing catcher trades As talks with free agent J.T. Realmuto have failed to progress, the Phillies have begun to explore the trade market for a catcher, reports The Athletic. Philadelphia is said to have an offer on the table for Realmuto. Ultimately, a reunion makes sense for both sides, but a deal hasn't come together yet, so the Phillies are exploring their options. \nThe best free agent catcher behind Realmuto is Victor Caratini, who plays first base and DH as much as he catches these days. As for the trade market, Twins backstop Ryan Jeffers is an obvious candidate to be moved. He's a year away from free agency and the Twins sold hard at this summer's trade deadline. We ranked Realmuto as the 13th best free agent available this offseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Orioles interested in Romero \nThe Orioles are among the teams with interest in Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Romero is a year away from free agency and thus an obvious trade candidate with the Cardinals not prioritizing contention in 2026. The O's have already added righties Ryan Helsley and Andrew Kittredge to their bullpen this offseason. \nRomero, 29, is a sinker specialist with a knack for limiting homers. Baltimore has two lefties, Keegan Akin and Dietrich Enns, in their bullpen, though neither is a late-inning matchup specialist. A quality lefty reliever is a necessity in the AL East, which houses quality lefty bats Roman Anthony, Jonathan Aranda, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Jarren Duran, Ben Rice, Daulton Varsho, and others. \n            ",

Watt will miss his second consecutive game after undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered while getting treatment at the team facility. However, Mike Tomlin hasn't shut the door on a Week 17 return for Watt.While Watt wasn't practicing this week, he was back at the team's facility and doing some \"cardio,\" Tomlin told CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson. With Watt back in the facility, the Steelers are \"hopeful\" their star pass rusher will be back on the field next week when they take on the Cleveland Browns.Watt went to Pittsburgh area hospital last Wednesday after he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needling treatment session. He is expected to return to the field this season, per NFL Network. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. A seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. He surpassed brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list this season. \nIn 13 games this season, Watt has seven sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception. With Watt and Nick Herbig (hamstring) out, the Steelers' pass rush will likely lean heavily on veteran Alex Highsmith and rookie Jack Sawyer during Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers are 8-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. Highsmith is tied for second on the team with 6.5 sacks. Sawyer has one sack, an interception, 26 tackles and three pass breakups in 14 games. \n\"He's had some opportunities this year and has made some plays,\" Tomlin recently said of Sawyer. \"Has had a sack. Has had an interception. So, I wouldn't be surprised if he displays that readiness if he gets an expanded role opportunity this week.\"\n            \n    ",

The bracket has been set and teams see the road ahead -- all that's left to do now is settle it all on the field as 12 teams vie for the national title. It comes as no surprise that Indiana secured the top overall seed after knocking off Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. It's the highest ranking in program history as the Hoosiers enter the postseason as legitimate national contenders, fresh off their first outright conference title in 80 years.Ohio State didn't fall far. The Buckeyes, looking to defend their 2024 national championship, landed at No. 2, followed by SEC champion Georgia at No. 3 and Big 12 champion Texas Tech at No. 4. Those four teams earn opening-round byes.No. 9 Alabama kicked off the CFP with a first-round comeback victory over No. 8 Oklahoma. Oregon (No. 5), Ole Miss (No. 6) and Texas A&M (No. 7) will each host first-round games. The top eight was mostly locked entering Sunday's selection show. Beyond that is where the intrigue surfaced. Alabama wasn't punished for its lopsided loss in the SEC title game, holding firm at No. 9. That sets up a first-round rematch with Oklahoma, which beat the Crimson Tide earlier this season.The real controversy came at No. 10, where Miami edged Notre Dame for the final at-large bid despite trailing the Irish in every previous set of rankings.For the first time ever, two Group of Five teams reached the playoff. No. 11 Tulane earned its bid by winning the American Conference, while No. 12 James Madison benefited from ACC chaos to slide in as Sun Belt champion.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternFirst roundSaturday, Dec. 20(12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner -- : 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner -- : 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The final spot in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals will be decided Saturday night, when No. 5 Oregon hosts No. 12 James Madison in a David vs. Goliath matchup to close the College Football Playoff's first round.Oregon is back in the CFP for a second straight year, continuing its rise under fourth-year coach Dan Manning with an 11-1 regular season. Backed by Nike founder Phil Knight, the Ducks bring a deep, well-funded roster that weathered a wave of offensive injuries to secure a coveted home game.Traveling three time zones west is a James Madison program in just its fourth season at the FBS level. The Dukes (12-1) operate with only a fraction of Oregon's payroll, but they earned their place in the field by finishing as the fifth-highest-ranked conference champion following a 31-14 win over Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game.Competing on the road against one of college football's premier brands is a daunting task. Still, James Madison will not lack confidence. The Dukes famously scored 70 points in a road win at North Carolina last season and held a second-half lead at Louisville in Week 2 before fading late.\nGiven the stakes, a James Madison victory would rank among the most significant upsets in college football history. Pulling it off, however, will require knocking off a supremely talented Oregon team. The winner advances to face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day.Where to watch Oregon vs. James Madison liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, OregonTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oregon vs. James Madison: Need to know  Oregon's hobbled receiver room: There is hope for Oregon's hobbled receiver room. Premier targets Gary Bryant Jr. and Dakorien Moore both participated, at least to some extent, in practice this week. So did receiver Evan Stewart, who hasn't played all season because of a knee injury. Bryant hasn't played since Nov. 8, and Moore hasn't played since Oct. 25. As a result, the Ducks have been reaching deep into their depth chart, and quarterback Dante Moore has been leaning heavily on tight end Kenyon Sadiq. But reinforcements appear to be coming.\nJames Madison's mobile threat: James Madison quarterback Alonza Barnett III has rushed for 14 touchdowns this season and totaled 544 yards on the ground while establishing himself as one of the nation's top dual-threat quarterbacks. Among quarterbacks in the CFP, only Tulane's Jake Retzlaff has run for more touchdowns (16). But Barnett is plenty skilled as a passer, too. His dynamic skillset will pose a challenge to Oregon's defense. However, the Ducks were successful in defending similarly talented Washington quarterback Demond Williams in a season-ending rivalry victory.Coaching exodus: Many of the key coaches in this game have already been introduced as head coaches at new schools for the 2026 season and are pulling double-duty during the playoff. James Madison head coach Bob Chesney will soon be off to UCLA, Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein is taking over at Kentucky and Ducks defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi is headed to Cal. Though they've been pulled in different directions during the buildup to the CFP, all three will be dialed in to their 2025 teams on Saturday.\"I would feel like a complete fraud if I left these guys throughout this playoff run and this opportunity in front of us to coach in Autzen another time,\" Stein said. \"Honestly, it'd be crazy. Tosh is the same way. We've poured so much of our lives, so much of our time, our families' time into this team and into this program. Coach Lanning gave me an opportunity … so the last thing I'd ever do would be to leave these players.\"\n  Oregon vs. James Madison prediction, pick\nAfter earning the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye in last year's CFP and taking a 41-21 loss to Ohio State in the quarterfinals, Oregon will be motivated for redemption. With weeks to prepare for James Madison and to rehabilitate key injured playmakers, the Ducks have no excuse not to dominate. Oregon is more athletic and skilled at every position and has home-field advantage in its corner. Barring catastrophic turnover issues or other self-inflicted mistakes, the Ducks should cruise past a good JMU that faces a significant talent disparity. Pick: Oregon -20.5Who will win and cover in each college football bowl and playoff game?

Either way, the expectation is that Jayden Quaintance will make his debut for UK after missing the first 11 games while recovering from an ACL tear suffered last season while playing at Arizona State.He could be a real difference-maker.Quaintance, a 6-foot-9 forward, is slotted 11th in Kyle Boone's latest 2026 NBA Mock Draft thanks in part to a 7-foot-5 wingspan that allows him to block and alter shots at a high rate. His block-percentage last season was 9.8, which ranked 11th nationally, according to KenPom.com. Quaintance's presence alone should change how St. John's tries to attack UK's defense.\n        \n            \n                College basketball picks, schedule: Predictions for Duke vs. Texas Tech, more top 25 games\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSt. John's is No. 21 in Saturday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 11th straight day.

    "description": "\n        In Year 2 under Mike Elko, Texas A&M put together a football season for the ages and broke generational curses in the process. The Aggies won",
    "body": "\n        In Year 2 under Mike Elko, Texas A&M put together a football season for the ages and broke generational curses in the process. The Aggies won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 1994 when they were members of the Southwest Conference. They pulled off the biggest comeback in school history against South Carolina and went on the road to land a historic win against Notre Dame with a magical fourth-and-13 touchdown pass. Finally, in Year 12 of the College Football Playoff, the Aggies reached the postseason. And even more gratifying was the fact that rival Texas was left on the outside looking in. But, after an ugly 10-3 loss to No. 10 Miami in the first round, it's a season that left meat on the bone. After finishing the 2024 season on a losing streak, the Aggies looked to build around starting quarterback Marcel Reed. They made two fantastic investments in wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver, both of whom earned All-American status. Tight end Nate Boerkircher and defensive lineman Tyler Onyedim also emerged as key additions. \nThe roster building culminated with a 41-40 upset at the buzzer against No. 8 Notre Dame, which introduced the Aggies to the national stage. Texas A&M won 11 straight games to begin the year, the first such start since 1994. Reed was one of the breakout players in the sport, and after crushing LSU 48-25, serious national contention seemed within reach. However, after going on the road to shellac Missouri 38-17, something shifted. The Aggies went down 30-3 against lowly South Carolina. They ultimately went on to score 28 straight to pull off the comeback, but the lackluster effort carried into their 27-17 loss against rival Texas. In his final two games, Reed threw zero touchdowns to four interceptions. Now, instead of reaching a first-round bye as it looked for most of the year, the Aggies are out in the first round. Several key players are set to leave for the NFL, including at least three starters on the offensive line. Both coordinators are set to leave as well. \nThe 2025 season was proof of concept for Elko's Aggies, but there's work to be done to improve on this campaign. The offense is just getting startedEarlier this week, Texas A&M wide receiver Mario Craver announced that he was returning to the program in 2026 on a new deal. Craver's production tapered off in the second half of the year, but his efforts were massive for the Aggies during a breakout season. He finished the regular season with 52 catches for 825 yards. With Craver returning, the Texas A&M passing attack should only continue to grow in 2026 behind Reed. The sophomore was a breakout player in college football, finishing with just under 3,000 yards passing, 500 yards rushing and 31 total touchdowns in the regular season. Even with receiver KC Concepcion expected to leave for the NFL, the offense will be dangerous. \nThe offensive line remains a significant question mark, however, after losing multiple All-Americans. Additionally, Holman Wiggins takes over as offensive coordinator from Collin Klein; Wiggins has never called plays during his legendary wide receiver coach career. But if Texas A&M's 2024 offseason was any indication, the Aggies will again do an exceptional job of identifying top skill talent and bringing them to College Station. The run defense remains inconsistentTexas A&M made a meaningful defensive jump in 2025, leaping from No. 12 to 5 in the SEC in total defense. But in the biggest moments of the season, the unit still let them down against the run. \nThe Aggies rank No. 13 in yards per carry defense, giving up more than 4 yards per carry. In their losses against Texas and Miami, running backs put together their best efforts of the season. Hurricanes rusher Mark Fletcher rushed for 172 yards on only 17 carries, exceeding his production from the three previous games. Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner also added 155 yards on the ground, his only 100-yard rushing performance of the season. Texas A&M has rushed the passer well, but the Aggies remain inconsistent against the run. Linebackers Taurean York and Daymion Sanford are expected back, but both defensive tackles are out of eligibility. Junior D.J. Hicks will be the primary defensive lineman expected to take another step. The Aggies will also turn to Lyle Hemphill as defensive coordinator after Jay Bateman left for a job at Kentucky. Hemphill is a longtime confidant of Elko. \nThe final prognosisAfter winning 11 games and reaching the College Football Playoff, the Elko era is already off to a blazing start. The program was able to quickly identify and fill holes on the roster through the transfer portal, and the core of the program is set. Next year, the Aggies bring in another top 10 recruiting class filled with potential instant-impact contributors. They'll again be a buyer in the portal, especially as transfers see the success of the previous class. The schedule will likely not line up as easily for the Aggies heading forward, but Texas A&M has established itself as a serious factor in the SEC under Elko. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal will enter Christmas atop the Premier League following a 1-0 victory over Everton on Saturday. Yet again, the Gunners were able to go away from home to pick up points thanks to an early penalty put away by striker Viktor Gyokeres. It's only the second goal in the last 11 appearances for the Swedish striker, as injuries have gotten in the way of him integrating into the side, but even with that, Arsenal's defense, set play dominance, and timely scoring have been enough to ensure that they'll maintain a two-point advantage over Manchester City.But, this is also an advantage that was as large as six points just over a month ago. But in a tight Premier League race, one loss and two defeats in their last seven matches will be enough for the chasing pack to make this a race going into the holidays. Defensive injuries have helped open the door, but when Arsenal have finished as runners-up in the Premier League in three consecutive seasons, hearing the footsteps behind them is when the pressure will be on in the race for their first Premier League title since 2003-04.Even as leading the league at Christmas will make it feel like a great position to be in, Mikel Arteta will know that there is much work left to do. In three of the last five seasons, Arsenal have entered Christmas leading the league, ultimately losing their advantage. Experience from coming up short is something that will sit with a squad that feels that their time is now, but almost reaching the halfway point of the Premier League season, it's a good chance to look at the credentials of Arsenal and the small chasing pack.ArsenalThey control their own destiny at this stage of the season, and while there's usually more pressure on the team leading the league at this stage, Arsenal should be used to that pressure. Only allowing 10 goals in Premier League play, the Gunners have been able to create more room for error due to stopping their opponents from testing David Raya's net. Their 31 goals scored are the second most in the Premier League, but this hardly feels like a dynamic attack due to spending significant time without Martin Odegaard, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, and Gyokeres this season. But as the festive period takes shape, all of those players except Havertz are back in the squad, and they've done a great job in pushing the attack forward. Arterta has options to change a game, and while the Gunners have had their issues away from home, they've controlled matches enough that even situations that seem like oncoming losses are ones that they'll get the best of their foes in. All eyes will be on their fixture with Manchester City on April 18, but there's plenty that needs to happen between now and then.\nManchester CityBack in November, City were seven points behind the Gunners and struggling to find their form with three losses in 10 matches played. Fast forward to now, and they've taken a joint-best 18 points from their seven matches played while scoring five goals more than anyone else in the league with 21 in that span while only conceding eight. As teams around the league have leaned on set pieces, City have taken on a throwback style of soccer because the big man Erling Haaland is up there somewhere. In 17 matches played, Haaland has scored 19 of City's 41 goals, and after Phil Foden's seven, no player has even five league goals for City despite their prolific attack. It's essentially a one-man show, but that's okay when the Norwegian is on a different level than any other striker in the league.Rayan Cherki has found his own form since joining from Lyon, racking up six assists, and Jeremy Doku's dribbling ability has made the attack hard to stop. Winners of five consecutive Premier League matches, City were my pick to win the league ahead of the season, and it's hard to see anyone slowing them down from adding a fifth Premier League title in the past six seasons. They may struggle, but time and time again, Pep Guardiola has proven that the Premier League title is his, and occasionally other teams get to borrow it.Aston VillaEvery title race needs an unlikely suspect, and this season, you have to look no further than Unai Emery's Aston Villa side. It took four matches for Villa to get their first win of the season, triumphing over Fulham on Sept. 28, and they've only lost once since. Taking out City and Arsenal during that span, Villa have shown that they can hang with the top teams in the league, but entering Sunday six points back of Arsenal and with a game in hand, much of their title credentials will be on if they can defeat Manchester United. United will be without Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbuemo due to them being at the Africa Cup of Nations, which only adds to the reasons that Villa should keep things going, but Emery's men have also heavily overperformed so far this season.They've scored 25 goals from an xG of 17.08 and allowed 17 goals from an xG against of 22.07. If either of those evens out during the season, and a major gap could open atop the table. On the bright side, Villa lead fourth-place Chelsea by four points, and that could already be enough to secure Champions League soccer next season. While they wouldn't complain with a league title, that would already accomplish the goal for a team who are happy to be here at this stage in what is truly a two team race for the league title.\nCurrent Premier League top half As of Dec. 20PosTeamGPWDLGFGAGDPTS1Arsenal1712323110+21392Manchester City1712144116+25373Aston Villa1610332517+8334Chelsea178542917+12295Liverpool179262825+3296Sunderland177641917+2277Manchester United167543026+4268Crystal Palace177552119+2269Brighton & Hove Albion176652523+22410Everton177371820-224\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are here as six matchups are set to unfold over the course of Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists the Rams at -10.5 vs. the Panthers and the Bears at -1 vs. the Packers on Saturday. On Sunday, the latest NFL lines have the Bills at -1.5 vs. the Jaguars, the Eagles at -3.5 vs. the 49ers and the Patriots at -3.5 vs. the Chargers. A playoff edition of 'Monday Night Football' concludes the slate with the Texans favored by 3.5 points on the road against the Steelers.  SportsLine's Eric Cohen has revealed his exact score prediction for each game to help you formulate spread, over/under, money-line and even NFL best bets as Wild Card Weekend approaches.A SportsLine expert and CBS on-air talent, Cohen has evaluated the entire NFL playoff slate and delivers score predictions and logic for each matchup. Cohen went 180-91-1 (66%) on his NFL straight-up picks this season, and was a sizzling 10-3 (77%) on his straight-up NFL playoff picks last season. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now he's turned his attention to the 2026 NFL Wild Card Weekend, studied each matchup in depth, and has revealed his exact NFL score predictions for each game. All Week 18 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina Panthers\n\"Carolina won this matchup on November 30, 31-28, in one of the more impactful upsets for both teams in the NFL this season,\" Cohen said. \"That's not happening again. While Sean McVay's team hasn't looked great lately, they'll exact serious revenge as a double-digit road favorite on Saturday. The Panthers have absolutely no business being in the playoffs and it's going to be a wake up call to the other teams in the conference. I would be mildly surprised if this wasn't a blowout.\"Pick: Rams 34, Panthers 12Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1)\n\"This will be the NFC North rivals' third matchup since December 7,\" Cohen said. \"Green Bay held on by a touchdown in the first one, before blowing a 10 point lead in the final two minutes and falling in overtime. I believe that Packers coach Matt LaFleur's job is on the line. While his team makes the playoffs just about every season, they have lost four of their last five in the postseason and finished the 2025 regular season on a four game losing streak. I'm just not sure the Bears are ready for this kind of pressure, especially against a rested Green Bay team. In another thriller on Saturday night, the Packers exact a matter of revenge for the Week 16 collapse.\"Pick: Packers 23, Bears 21Buffalo Bills (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\"Winners of nine of their last 10 games, I have a hard time picking against Jacksonville at home,\" Cohen said. \"Buffalo's passing game is devoid of weapons and the Jaguars boast the NFL's top rush defense to slow Josh Allen and James Cook. While Allen and the Bills are 5-0 in the Wild Card Round since 2020, all five of those games have been at home. Trevor Lawrence has played at an MVP level since November and it will continue this weekend. The Jaguars win on a walk-off Cam Little field goal from 50-plus yards. If this result plays out as I anticipate, Sean McDermott won't be back to coach Buffalo next season.\"Pick: Jaguars 27, Bills 24San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5)\n\"With Philadelphia only giving 3.5 points on the early line, this is my favorite spread play of the Wild Card games,\" Cohen said. \"This is a matchup between the two NFC teams who have played in the last three Super Bowls, but I don't trust San Francisco's defense to hold up against the Eagles' potent receivers and Saquon Barkley on the ground. San Francisco had potentially three straight home games in front of them with a win against Seattle in Week 18. Now, after an offensive dud against the Seahawks, their season ends in disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.\"Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 21Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (-3.5)\n\"My top play in this game is the Under 45.5 (though I may buy it up a few points in my weekend parlays),\" Cohen said. \"Both of these teams give up less than 21 points per game so don't expect fireworks. Of the Patriots' 14 wins, only three came against playoff teams (Panthers, Bills, Ravens) so they might have benefitted from a ridiculously weak schedule. Then again, the Chargers only beat two playoff teams (Broncos, Eagles), so I can't use that to their advantage. In their second playoffs under Jim Harbaugh (in two years), I think L.A. leads most of the game, with Drake Maye leading a late New England rally. \"Pick: Patriots 23, Chargers 21 Houston Texans (-3.5) at Pittsburgh Steelers \n\"I can't believe Aaron Rodgers found a way in the playoffs yet again,\" Cohen said. \"I have to think this is it for him either way. The Texans' defense should overwhelm the future Hall of Famer and hold Pittsburgh fairly in check. Entering the playoffs on a nine game winning streak and facing a team who I believe is a class below them, I think Houston's offense does enough to win. One betting note: Houston kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn had multiple field goal attempts in all 15 games he played in this season and hit his Over 1.5 made FGs in 14/15. Whatever the juice is, lay it in this game.\"Pick: Texans 23, Steelers 10How to get more NFL Wild Card Weekend picksSportsLine's model has simulated every Wild Card Weekend Game 10,000 times and revealed its picks.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood will return for his sophomore season, he announced, giving first-year Wolverines coach Kyle Whittingham a cornerstone around which to build his debut roster.Retaining Underwood was priority No. 1 for Whittingham upon his arrival at Michigan. The firing of Sherrone Moore and staff turnover that occurred in the wake of the stunning ouster cast uncertainty over the prized former five-star recruit's future. That Whittingham was able to keep Underwood in Ann Arbor is a major early victory for the veteran coach and could help him hit the ground running with a competitive first year in the Big Ten.Teams in search of quarterback help would have knocked down the doors to land Underwood had he entered the transfer portal, but his contract with Michigan may have factored in his decision to stay. Underwood signed a multi-year deal out of high school that, per CBS Sports' Chris Hummer, pays him more than $2 million per season. His deal also comes with a significant buyout that would have made a transfer more challenging.While Underwood's freshman season came with a number of hiccups, including his three-interception day in the Citrus Bowl loss to Texas last week, the Michigan quarterback also dazzled at times and displayed immense upside as a potential star in the making. He led the Wolverines to a 9-3 regular-season record, passed for 2,428 yards and ran for six touchdowns with a display of dual-threat talent.\nWhittingham constructed an identity at Utah that revolved mostly around defense, but the staff he brings with him to Michigan has the potential to turn Underwood into a stellar playmaker. Offensive coordinator Jason Beck is a bright mind who produced statistical anomalies from his past quarterbacks and most recently developed Devon Dampier into a dual-threat standout. His track record suggests he can turn Underwood into a refined passer while utilizing his legs to construct a dynamic, yardage-eating attack.If Underwood takes his expected step forward as a sophomore, the Michigan offense in total should benefit and improve upon its mediocre 2025 production. The Wolverines were just the 69th-highest-scoring team in the country and ranked No. 107 in passing offense during his debut season.\nDespite all of the upheaval inside the Michigan program, retaining Underwood gives Michigan a bright outlook for 2026 and beyond. With three years of eligibility remaining, the former No. 1 overall recruit has ample time to reach his ceiling. If he taps into that potential this season, the Wolverines could contend for a College Football Playoff berth in Year 1 of the Whittingham era. After all, they were effectively one win shy of earning a spot in the bracket in 2025.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- A first round draft pick by the Dallas Cowboys in 2022, Tyler Smith earned three consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2023-2025)",
    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- A first round draft pick by the Dallas Cowboys in 2022, Tyler Smith earned three consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2023-2025) and a 2022 second team All-Pro selection for his play at left guard.However, the Cowboys decided to line Smith up at left tackle for the final three games of the season with 2024 first-round pick left tackle Tyer Guyton on injured reserve with an ankle injury. Now, Smith will meet with head coach Brian Schottenheimer on Monday to figure out what his head coach and offensive play caller feels is his long-term position. \"I do have some thoughts in my mind that I'm going to share with him,\" Smith said Monday at Dallas' locker room cleanout. .. \"Of course I made that move for the team, but we're kind of going to find out what the grand scheme of things is going to be. It might be a conversation that carries on for longer than just today, but at least today will give us clarity.\"    The Cowboys did re-sign Smith during the 2025 season to be the NFL's highest-paid interior offensive lineman with a four-year, $96 million contract extension that gave him an average per year salary of $24 million. The reason for the uncertainty is twofold: Guyton missing nine games with injuries in his first two seasons and the decline of right tackle Terence Steele in pass protection. Steele, at the age of 28 in 2025, allowed 47 quarterback pressures, the most in the NFL according to TruMedia. Since returning from a torn ACL in 2023, Smith's 141 quarterback pressures over the last three seasons are also the most any lineman has allowed in this span, per TruMedia. Releasing him this offseason would save $8.75 million in cap space while giving Dallas $9.375 million in dead money. \nOne route the Cowboys could take is cutting Steele, moving Smith to left tackle and moving Guyton back to right tackle, where he predominantly played at the University of Oklahoma. Another avenue is keeping Guyton at left tackle and Smith at left guard while then releasing Steele and finding a more affordable right tackle in the draft or free agency. If it was up to Smith, he would choose to remain at left guard.  \"The way you build comfort is through reps,\" Smith said. \"Right now, I obviously made a lot of money playing offensive guard. That's what it is. I had the most reps in the NFL I've had at offensive guard. Obviously I'm more comfortable there.\"  The 24-year-old Smith is walking the tightrope between being a team player and looking out for his best interests. He's a better guard than tackle -- the difference between Smith the left guard and Smith the left tackle is the difference between an All-Pro and an average to above-average player at this stage. Now is the time for Schottenheimer and Smith to agree on a long-term, positional home for their three-time Pro Bowler. \n\"We'll talk about it. You have to show them what your mindset is. At the same time, it's about my success and my career as well as this team's success. That's the biggest thing for me,\" Smith said. \"It's like what's best for the team, but also what's smart for me in my career. ... It's a matter of conversation. I just need to know.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Monday afternoon, six NFL teams have fired their coaches. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon.In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. FalconsThere are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release). \nThe Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap. All that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid. The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.\nThe Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach. \n        \n            \n                Falcons coaching candidates: Why Kevin Stefanski tops list, plus two Rams coordinators should be in play\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. GiantsThe Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle. \nThen there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball. A potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.\n        \n            \n                Ranking reported Giants coaching candidates by category: Head coaches, coordinators and more\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. TitansTennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.\nCam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft. They're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. \nThere is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.One drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n        \n            \n                Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. \nWhat the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.The Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. \nArizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. They do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The juiced-up DraftKings promo code now gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and although there's no football to wager on today, the model still finds value in some of the NBA's top matchups for online sports betting. Arguably, the game of the day in the NBA is the Detroit Pistons hosting the New York Knicks in a matchup of the two teams with the best records in the Eastern Conference. Despite the Pistons being home and having a better record, the SportsLine advanced computer model is backing the Knicks as 2.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Knicks vs. Pistons is 232.5, down three from the opening line. The model is also backing the Clippers to defeat the Warriors. One of SportsLine's top experts also has an NHL pick on the New York Rangers vs. Utah Mammoth on Monday. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 12 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 33-15 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

Josh Hart (ankle) and Landry Shamet (shoulder) remain out for the Knicks, but no Karl-Anthony Towns or Mitchell Robinson on the injury report is promising. The Knicks have the No. 4 scoring offense (120.6 points per game this season). New York defeated the Pistons in six games in the playoffs last year, including going 3-0 and clinching the series in Detroit, so the road environment shouldn't be an issue on Monday.

The Russian has helped New York on a 6-1-1 run, and after winning the Winter Classic in Miami, he has one or fewer goals in eight games this season, tied for fourth-most in the league.\" Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-102) vs. WarriorsThe Clippers are coming off a bad 146-115 loss to the Celtics on Saturday, but they had a six-game winning streak before that contest, including victories over the Pistons, Lakers and Rockets. The Clippers have rebounded from their awful start to give themselves a chance at competing for an NBA Play-In tournament spot if they keep playing as they have over the last few weeks. The Clippers are just 12-22 this season, but they are home on Monday, and they've gone 5-1 over their last six home games. James Harden and Kawhi Leonard still make a top duo in the league for Los Angeles, and Leonard is averaging 38.8 ppg over his last four contests. The Warriors are 2-3 over their last five road games, and 8-12 away on the season.

    "body": "\n        Maxxine Dupri is under the microscope. Every milestone match of hers has played out for a global audience. With the WWE women's intercontinental championship resting on her shoulder, that won't change anytime soon.  The most successful wrestling characters are often amplified projections of the people portraying them, and Dupri embraces that philosophy. She's as novice as she is bubbly, and no one is pretending otherwise. While some may take issue with her winning a singles title so early, many fans connect with Dupri as an authentic underdog.  \"The most beautiful part about Maxxine's character is that it's really  me. I'm learning on the road,\" Dupri told CBS Sports while promoting WrestleMania 42, which returns to Las Vegas on April 18 and 19. \"You get to see my first match on Monday  Night Raw, and those feelings. You get a behind-the-scenes look at who I  am and what I'm going through. I think it's special that fans get to  take that ride with me.\"\nDupri is approaching five years with WWE, but very little of that time was spent inside the ring. She primarily worked as a valet for Maximum Male Models and Alpha Academy, and didn't wrestle her first match until August 2023. That debut wasn't tucked away on a pre-taped episode of Main Event or NXT; it happened under the bright lights of WWE Raw. Two years later, she pinned future WWE Hall of Famer Becky Lynch to win singles gold.  That kind of rapid ascent can rub people the wrong way. Many WWE superstars spend decades plying their craft without ever touching singles gold. Backstage, however, Dupri is reportedly well-liked, and her humility appears to go a long way.\"They're all very aware that my 50th match, including live events, was  when I beat Becky Lynch for the title,\" Dupri said. \"That's the journey I'm on. I'm  very honest about where I'm at. I'm not going to pretend to know about  things that I don't.\" \nDupri's bubbly personality is beginning to give way to a more serious edge. WWE recently aired a dramatic vignette showing her training with Natalya inside The Dungeon, the wrestling school run by Natalya and her husband, WWE producer TJ Wilson. The Dungeon is a spiritual successor to Stu Hart's legendary Hart Dungeon, which shaped the careers of Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and countless others. True to form, the character shift mirrors Dupri's growing confidence as a wrestler.  \"I think it's time we show them exactly why Maxxine is improving...\" Dupri said of the intention behind the cinematic video. \"It's  because of the Dungeon. It's because of Nattie and TJ. It's because of  those moments. I thought it was special to peel that curtain back and  show the fans.\"\nWith WrestleMania 42 on the horizon, Dupri isn't shying away from the spotlight; it's the only world she knows. And if she has it her way, Becky Lynch will be waiting for her in Las Vegas.  \n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders are once again in the market for a new head coach after firing Pete Carroll on Monday following just one season in 2025",
    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders are once again in the market for a new head coach after firing Pete Carroll on Monday following just one season in 2025.Las Vegas still owes significant money to Josh McDaniels (2022–23), Antonio Pierce (2024), Carroll (2025) and former offensive coordinator Chip Kelly (2025), but that hasn't been an issue for owner Mark Davis after how the team performed in 2025. The Raiders ranked dead last in the NFL in nearly every key offensive category, including scoring (14.2 points per game), total offense (245.2 yards per game), rushing (77.5 yards per game) and sacks allowed (3.8 per game).After a 3–14 campaign, the Raiders own the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, marking just the second time in the common draft era (since 1967) they will select first overall. The last time was in 2007, when they chose LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell.Oregon quarterback Dante Moore and Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza -- the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner -- are widely viewed as the top two quarterback prospects in the class, and they'll face each other Friday in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl.\nSo who should minority owner Tom Brady and general manager John Spytek consider as they prepare to enter Week 1 of the 2026 season with the team's fourth different head coach in four years? Here are five options to consider -- some with Patriots ties and some fresh faces.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Brian Flores -- Vikings defensive coordinatorThe Vikings thrived under Brian Flores' complex scheme, which blitzed at the highest rate in the NFL (49.5%) this season and helped Minnesota rack up 49 sacks, tied for the fourth most in the league. His coaching job was even more impressive given how rough quarterback J.J. McCarthy was in his first season as the team's starter in 2025. McCarthy ranked dead last in the NFL in completion percentage (57.6%), touchdown-to-interception ratio (0.9; 11 touchdowns, 12 interceptions) and passer rating (72.6).Providing Flores with a five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher in Maxx Crosby and his choice of quarterback at the top of the draft could yield strong results for the Raiders. Plus, Flores and Tom Brady share a deep familiarity. Flores worked in New England in various roles - from scout to defensive position coach - from 2004 to 2018, spanning nearly the entire Brady-Bill Belichick dynasty.\nKlint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinatorThe 14-3 Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed and the betting favorite to win Super Bowl LX at +350 odds, according to DraftKings Sportsbook. That's due in large part to the job offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak has done with quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks' offense.Darnold ranked second in the NFL in yards per pass attempt (8.5) and 12th in expected points added per dropback (0.09) despite still showing some familiar tendencies. His 20 turnovers -- 14 interceptions and six lost fumbles -- led the league. Wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba led the NFL with 1,793 receiving yards, the eighth most in a single season in league history. He also paced the league with 79 receiving first downs.Las Vegas will want to maximize the talent of 2025 sixth overall pick Ashton Jeanty, along with whichever quarterback it selects first overall in 2026 and 2024 second-round pick Jack Bech. Kubiak stands out as the top up-and-coming offensive mind available in this coaching cycle.\nKevin Stefanski -- Ex-Browns head coach Former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski accomplished more than most during his time in Cleveland. Stefanski and Pro Football Hall of Famer Paul Brown are the only two head coaches in franchise history to post multiple 11-win seasons. He also led the Browns to their first playoff victory since 1994 during the 2020 season.However, Browns management effectively torpedoed his quarterback room by trading away Baker Mayfield, then sending three first-round picks to acquire Deshaun Watson and handing him a fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million contract. Stefanski could thrive with Jeanty and a fresh quarterback to mold using the No. 1 overall pick. \n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski after five-win season; two-time Coach of the Year may land another job this cycle\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrian Daboll -- Ex-Giants head coachBrian Daboll, who was named the NFL's Coach of the Year for the 2022 season, is just the second head coach in the past 15 years to be fired within three seasons of winning the award. The other is Mike Vrabel, who won the honor with the Titans in 2021 and was fired after the 2023 season. Vrabel has since rebounded as head coach of the Patriots, leading them to an AFC East title and the No. 2 seed in the AFC in his first season.\nDaboll did help Jaxson Dart begin to get comfortable in the NFL before being fired during the season, even as the Giants never quite stabilized their offensive line or receiving corps. He also won a road playoff game with Daniel Jones as his quarterback in 2022 and completed two stints with Brady's Patriots -- from 2000-06 and 2013-16 -- as an offensive position coach.Robert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinatorDespite losing All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa and All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner, 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh helped guide San Francisco to a 12-5 record and the No. 6 seed in a loaded NFC. The 49ers finishing with the NFL's 13th-ranked scoring defense (21.8 points per game allowed) despite posting a league-low 20 sacks, borders on miraculous.Saleh earning a second opportunity as an NFL head coach after a tumultuous stint with the Jets is well deserved, and he could thrive the second time around with stronger offensive talent -- particularly at quarterback. In New York, he endured inconsistent play from Zach Wilson and Aaron Rodgers tearing his Achilles. Pairing Moore or Mendoza with Jeanty could set the stage for a strong second act for Saleh as an NFL head coach.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in two weeks after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2",
    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in two weeks after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, but the top European leagues aren't going on break in the meantime. Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to fight for another Premier League title while Bayern Munich are once again dominating the Bundesliga standings. Elsewhere, Juventus are getting back to the top of the Serie A standings while Real Madrid seem to have solved their problems. Let's take a look at our weekly power rankings:   1. Arsenal (--)Week after week, I'm more convinced this is going to be the year when they will finally lift a trophy. Mikel Arteta's side have a six-point advantage on Manchester City in the Premier League standings and lead the league phase table in the Champions League. If they don't win at least one of those in the next five months, it will be a failure.  2. Bayern Munich (--) The German Bundesliga will be back this week after the winter break and we can expect Bayern Munich to continue to score, having recorded 55 goals scored in 15 games played so far in the league. Averaging 3.6 goals per game, they have to be considered one of the best teams of the season.  3. Manchester City (--)Despite the home draw against Chelsea over the weekend that slowed down their pursuit of Arsenal, the feeling is that they will continue to show their strong form, while the future of the Spanish manager Pep Guardiola will be a big topic in the coming weeks. This might be the last six months of him at City despite a contract running until 2027, and they have to make the most out of it. \n 4. Barcelona (--)The team coached by Hansi Flick won 2-0 in each of the last four games played in all competitions, showing a big improvement in defense, something that they have always struggled to achieve in the past months. Next up: the Spanish Super Cup.  5. PSG (--) Once the 2025 AFCON is over, PSG will also welcome back Achraf Hakimi, who finally recovered from his injury and will be a big boost for the team coached by Luis Enrique in the coming weeks, when both Ligue 1 and Champions League will enter their key phases. 6. Inter (+1)Inter are performing incredibly well in the past weeks, showing some great football and also winning a lot of games, as it happened over the past weekend against Bologna. It will be another key week as the Nerazzurri will also meet Napoli on Sunday at San Siro for what is likely to be a crucial test for the title race. \n7. Real Madrid (+2)Xabi Alonso's job was in danger a month ago, but the Spanish coach was able to turn things around and adjust it all. Over the weekend, the Blancos won 5-1 against Real Betis and Gonzalo Garcia scored his first hat trick with the team. This is getting interesting. 8. Atletico Madrid (-2)The biggest issue about Diego Simeone's side this season has been the inconsistency of results. Too many times Atletico Madrid had some ups and downs that prevented them from being at the top of the standings and trying to put pressure on both Real Madrid and Barcelona for the title race. I was expecting a bit more from them after last summer. 9. Atalanta (+1)Raffaele Palladino did what he was asked to. He took over Atalanta and quickly changed the situation after a disappointing start under Ivan Juric. The 1-0 win over AS Roma this weekend marked the beginning of a new era as Palladino won against the side coached by Gian Piero Gasperini, the former Atalanta coach who left in the summer of 2025 after a decade at the club. \n10. Liverpool (+1)It's not so much a reflection of their improvement, but after what has happened in recent days with Enzo Maresca's departure, they simply cannot be ranked below Chelsea.11. Chelsea (-3)Ah, here we go again. In my previous rankings, I asked the Chelsea board to stick with Enzo Maresca at least until the end of the season. I guess they didn't read it. \n        \n            \n                Who is Liam Rosenior? Chelsea set to hire Strasbourg coach after Enzo Maresca exit, per report\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n 12. Olympique Marseille (--)If there is one team that can beat PSG, that's the side coached by Roberto De Zerbi. I won't be surprised if he's on the radar of many clubs this summer or even Manchester United right now.\n13. Newcastle (--)Eddie Howe's side are slowly coming back but this season is not going as we were expecting last summer. Too many ups and downs don't pay off when it comes to the Premier League and this is why they are now in ninth place.  14. Borussia Dortmund (--)The Bundesliga will be back this week and Dortmund will try to close the gap with Bayern Munich, but that's just not going to happen. However, they should focus more on the Champions League's last two games of the league phase as they still have chances to end up in a good spot.  15. Galatasaray (--)After what they have done in the summer, there are high expectations, especially in the Champions League but they might not be over as they are currently looking to sign Italian midfielder Davide Frattesi from Inter in the winter transfer session. If that happens, it will be another signal of their desire to impress. \n 16. Napoli (+1)Their position in this ranking is strictly related to their disappointing Champions League campaign as Antonio Conte's team are performing incredibly well in the Serie A standings despite some big injuries that continue to affect the roster. 17. Juventus (-1)After some good results, the Bianconeri drew 1-1 against Lecce over the weekend, but the cycle under Luciano Spalletti started off well. They should extend his deal beyond the summer and start working with him to rebuild the team. He's the right manager for this club.  18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)I'm not sure what we can expect from them in the second part of the season and the winter break. I'm sure they made the right decision to sack Erik ten Hag and to appoint Kasper Hjulmand, but they need more stability in 2026, after so many changes in the roster and in the coaching staff. \n19. Sporting CP (--)They have been performing well this season, but Porto look unstoppable, with Francesco Farioli's side winning 16 matches, drawing once, and remaining unbeaten in the Portuguese league so far. 20. PSV (+1)They are doing great. In the league: 15 wins, one draw, only one defeat and a 15-point gap on Feyenoord.21. Tottenham (-1)I thought Thomas Frank was the right man to turn things around, but I'm not sure at this point if he can achieve what he hoped for at the club. Both Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim were sacked this year, and I'm not surprised if he's next.\n 22. AS Monaco (--)Another challenging season for AS Monaco. The good old days seem really far away but maybe with the right manager this team can still be back at the top. 23. Benfica (--)They found the right manager but I'm not sure he will stay forever. What if Manchester United call Jose Mourinho back this summer?  24. Club Brugge (--)Can they avoid selling their best player to AC Milan this year? I guess not, as their striker Nicolò Tresoldi was at San Siro to watch the Rossoneri facing Hellas Verona. \n 25. Copenaghen (--) I didn't think they could make it for the playoffs of the league phase but their away win against Villarreal will give them a shot. 26. Qarabag (--)They surprised everyone in the opening matches of the league phase but that was it. Not enough to hope to see them again in the playoffs. 27. Eintracht Frankfurt (--)They have conceded 30 goals in 15 Bundesliga matches. With such a record, they can't hope for much more than that. \n 28. Union Saint-Gilloise (--) Their focus now will be on the league as they have no chances to qualify for the play-offs.  29. Athletic Club (--) I was sure they were going to become the surprising side of the league phase. That's right, I was.  30. Villarreal (--)I still can't understand how they can be the most surprising team in LaLiga, currently sitting third behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid, yet at the same time are one of the most disappointing sides in the Champions League.31. Pafos (--)It was amazing to see them playing in the Champions League and really hope to see them again here in the future.  32. Slavia Prague (--) With all due respect, they are not at the level of the other teams, and this is where we were expecting to see them.  33. Olympiacos (--)There were expectations to be good when maybe there shouldn't have been.34. Bodo/Glimt (--) I thought they could do better in Europe this season, especially considering the temperatures at their home games.  35. Ajax (--)By far the biggest disappointment of the season, and there are still a lot of months to go before the end. 36. Kairat (--)I write this every week, but I'm not tired yet: I hope to see them back on the Champions League stage next season. They offer something unique. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Change is underway for the Cleveland Browns, who fired two-time Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski at the end of a five-win 2025 season. Whether the coaching change leads to roster upheaval remains to be seen, and the uncertainty surrounding the Browns' direction casts a shadow over the starting quarterback job. Shedeur Sanders started the final seven games of the campaign, but general manager Andrew Berry did not commit to him as the leader of the offense for 2026.The Browns' revolving door at the quarterback position may continue just one year after they selected two signal-callers in the 2025 NFL Draft. Neither Sanders nor Dillon Gabriel strung together much success in their rookie seasons.\"We're going to do our work on the quarterback market,\" Berry said after the Stefanski ouster. \"It's too important of a position, and it's something that has to be solidified. I can't sit here and tell you whether the solution for the starter in 2026 is internal or external. It's something that we're going to work through over the next several weeks, and quite honestly, the new head coach will also have a lot of input on that, as well.\"Cleveland has a number of options even with Deshaun Watson sitting on the books as an expensive, untradeable asset. It could look to deal Gabriel or Sanders in a trade for a quarterback or draft capital, it may seek immediate help from a veteran free agent or it could use another draft pick -- potentially one of its two first-rounders -- on a promising rookie.\nIf the market is dry or the Browns' next coach sees enough potential in Sanders to give him another look in 2026, it is also possible that the former Colorado star will reprise his role atop the depth chart.\"I think I did what I was able to do,\" Sanders said. \"I definitely grew from a lot of things, and I got experience now. I'm always the same confidence-wise. I'm there. But that's not in my hands. That's not my decision. I can't speak on what other people feel.\"Sanders' flashes of excellence were bright during his rookie campaign. A 364-yard, three-touchdown effort against the Tennessee Titans in his third start displayed the kind of upside he could bring to an offense that has lacked direction for years. But he also threw more interceptions (10) than touchdowns (seven) on the year, took too many sacks and had the second-lowest QBR of any quarterback in the league with a minimum of six starts.\n\"I think we saw a lot of progress with Shedeur this year,\" Berry said. \"I think that's both mentally and physically, playing the position. He's still very much a work in progress like many rookie quarterbacks are. But I think we saw some really good things in terms of his playmaking, his accuracy, his ability to extend with his feet. I think I'd also give him credit -- as well as our offensive staff -- for bringing him along in terms of his pocket management, his situation awareness and things of that nature.\"\n            ",

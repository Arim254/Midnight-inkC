    "body": "\n        Two young quarterbacks looking to establish themselves as NFL starters face off on Sunday when the New York Jets host the Carolina Panthers. Bryce Young finished last year on a high note but has been hit and miss in 2025. As for the Jets, Justin Fields started the year with a big performance against the Steelers but has struggled since as New York is the lone winless team left in the NFL this year. Kickoff from MetLife Stadium Field is set for 1 p.m. ET. The Panthers are 1.5-point favorites on the road, per SportsLine consensus odds, and the total sits at 41.5. Carolina is a -119 favorite (wager $119 to win $100) while the Jets are -101 underdogs.

Chuba Hubbard will be active this week, so it'll be interesting to see how the Panthers split touches in the backfield. Additionally, rookie receiver Tetairoa McMillan caught his first two NFL touchdowns last week against the Cowboys. As for the Jets, they need a better performance from Fields this week, especially as top receiver Garrett Wilson is doubtful to play.

    "body": "\n        The defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are on a two-game skid after dropping games to the Denver Broncos and New York Giants the last two weeks, and they'll look to get back in the win column on Sunday when they visit the Minnesota Vikings. Philly is 4-2 on the year while the Vikings are 3-2 and are coming off a bye week after a trip to London. This is a \"revenge game\" of sorts as former Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz will make yet another start for the Vikings with J.J. McCarthy dealing with an ankle injury.Kickoff from US Bank Stadium Field is set for 1 p.m. ET. The Eagles are 1.5-point favorites, per SportsLine consensus odds, and the total sits at 43.5.

Philly needs a win to snap a two-game skid, while a loss would put Minnesota back to .500. The Eagles' offense has looked lost this year with a lack of a run game with Saquon Barkley while Jalen Hurts has failed to connect with his top receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith in the passing game. As for the Vikings, the biggest story has been that McCarthy, the team's first-round pick last year, has been out with an ankle injury since Week 2. Wentz has done well filling in as the starter, and he gets a crack at his former team in this one. He also has a great receiving group to throw to, headlined by superstar Justin Jefferson.Click here to bet Eagles vs. Vikings at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Eagles vs. Vikings prediction, picksThe Eagles are 4-2 overall and 3-3 against the spread, while Minnesota is 3-2 both straight up and against the spread.

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots are in a position they haven't been in for a while -- first place in the AFC East. They look to keep that divisional lead this week when they face the Tennessee Titans, who just happen to be the former team of current Patriots current coach Mike Vrabel.But the biggest news out of Tennessee this week wasn't the Vrabel homecoming, it was the firing of head coach Brian Callahan. The Titans interim head coach is Mike McCoy, the team's senior offensive assistant. Bet Patriots vs. Titans at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:The Patriots currently sit at 4-2, coming off a win over the New Orleans Saints. The Titans are 1-5, coming off a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Patriots are undefeated on the road this season (3-0).Here's how to watch the game live, along with odds for the matchup.\nWhere to watch Titans vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Nissan Stadium -- Nashville, Tennessee TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports App Odds: Patriots -7; O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)    Titans vs. Patriots: Need to knowThe Titans coaching carousel. The Titans hired Vrabel in 2018 and not long after he won Coach of the Year in 2021, the team fired him and hired Callahan, who lasted just 23 games in Tennessee. Now, right after they fired their coach, the Titans are hosting their former coach who is in the process of turning a team around, something Tennessee fans may find difficult to watch.Drake Maye makes history. Drake Maye joined elite company last week when he joined Patrick Mahomes and Dan Marino are the only quarterbacks under 24 to record at least 200 passing yards and a passer rating of over 100 in five straight games. Maye looks like the real deal and he's only strengthening his bond with his receivers. Heading into Week 7, Maye has 1,522 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions. Cam Ward may have a challenging day. Ward joined a long list of other first overall selections who had their coach fired midseason. Ward is only a few games into his NFL career, but that doesn't mean people don't expect him to be a star already. Immediate success has become something demanded in the league, but Ward will likely need more time. The 2025 No. 1 overall pick has yet to prove whether he can be \"the guy\" for Tennessee as his stat line -- 55.5 completion percentage, 1,101 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions -- would indicate. This defense will not be an easy one for Ward to face and with Calvin Ridley's health in question, it could be a long day for the offense.\nTitans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots have the benefit of facing a team in their first week with an interim coach. While this firing should light a fire in the Titans' locker room, the Patriots have the clear upper hand. I expect Maye to continue his impressive campaign and put up solid numbers this year. Pick: Patriots -7, Over 42.5\n            ",

Star tight end George Kittle has been activated off of injured reserved ahead of the team's Week 7 game against the Atlanta Falcons.Speaking with reporters at his Saturday press conference, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said Kittle's role will not be limited in his first game back.\"No pitch count,\" Shanahan said. \"George has rehabbed really well. Came back 100% and had a good week of practice. We'll space it out throughout the game, but no pitch count.\"\nKittle tweaked his hamstring on the team's first possession of its season-opening win over the Seattle Seahawks, and he's missed the last five games. Kittle was eligible to return from IR last week, but San Francisco chose to exercise caution with its veteran tight end.Getting Kittle back will be huge for a 49ers offense that has been decimated by injuries all season. Kittle has been the go-to pass-catcher in San Francisco for a while now with 542 receptions for 7,405 yards and 46 touchdowns in his nine-year career. He should immediately go back to being the featured target in the passing game, especially given the other injury questions.\nEven with Kittle back in the lineup, the 49ers will still be shorthanded against the Falcons. Quarterback Brock Purdy and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall have been ruled out, and receiver Jauan Jennings will once again play through a few nagging injuries.\n            \n    ",

Lamb finished the season with 101 receptions for 1,194 yards and six touchdowns across 15 games, earning him Pro Bowl honors. In 2025, through his first three games, Lamb has caught 16 passes for 222 yards in part-time action, with an average of 13.9 yards per catch. He's shown glimpses of his prior dominance -- especially in Week 1 (seven catches, 110 yards) and Week 2 (nine catches, 112 yards) -- before being sidelined by a high ankle sprain. Despite the injury setback, Lamb's touches and yardage totals reflect the same workhorse role he's embraced throughout his career. Lamb is no longer listed on the Cowboys' Injury Report and will be a full participant in Week 7. See who else to roster here.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice. The former second round pick out of SMU is set to return from his six-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy in Week 7. Rice is expected to reclaim a key role in Kansas City's offense alongside Patrick Mahomes.Rice had a solid campaign as a rookie in 2023, catching 79 passes for 938 yards and seven touchdowns. He looked primed for a breakout year in 2024 before injuries derailed his season. Rice still managed to haul in 24 passes for 288 yards and two scores in four games.

    "body": "\n        Two teams that are having vastly opposite seasons are squaring off Sunday in the Windy City. After an 0-2 start, the Chicago Bears have won three straight games and are right in the thick of things in the NFC North. Conversely, the opponent on Sunday, the New Orleans Saints, are hoping to play the role of spoiler as it enters Chicago with a record of just 1-5. Bet Bears vs. Saints at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Both teams are being led by first-year coaches. Kellen Moore picked up his first win with the Saints in Week 5, when New Orleans forced five turnovers in a 26-14 upset win over the Giants. Ben Johnson is trying to lead the Bears to their first winning season since 2018, when then-first year head coach Matt Nagy led Chicago to a 12-4 record. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Saints vs. Bears liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Soldier Field -- Chicago, Illinois TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -5.5; O/U 46.5 (via FanDuel)Saints vs. Bears: Need to know Defense, anyone? Neither team can say that defense has been their strength so far this season. The Saints and Bears are currently 25th and 27th in the NFL in most points allowed, respectively. Ironically, they are both 24th in the NFL in red zone efficiency after allowing 12 touchdowns in 18 opponents' trips into the 20-yard-line. One big difference between the units has been on third down. The Bears' defense is third in the NFL in that area, whereas the Saints are just 24th in the NFL in that area. Offensive edge. The Bears have a clear advantage on offense. They are currently 10th in the NFL in scoring, whereas the Saints are the fifth-worst team in the NFL with an average of 18.5 points per outing. Quarterback play has a major reason why the Bears' offense has had more success this season. Second-year quarterback Caleb Williams has largely played well and has done a good job taking care of the football. And while Saints QB Spencer Rattler has also done a good job in terms of not throwing interceptions, he's averaging just one touchdown pass per game. \nWhen in Rome. Chicago has enjoyed a breakout sophomore season from wideout Rome Odunze, who has already caught more touchdown passes this season (5) than he did during his entire rookie campaign (3). One Saints advantage. One of the Saints' advantages entering this game is their pass rush. Led by Carl Granderson's 4.5 sacks, New Orleans' defense has sacked opposing quarterbacks five more time this season than the Bears, who have just seven sacks though five games. Saints vs. Bears prediction, pick \nLed by Alvin Kamara and wideouts Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed, the Saints have enough offensive weapons to keep things close on Sunday. That being said, I'm going with the Bears in this one, largely due to their advantage on offense.  Pick: Bears -5.5; Under 46.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A chaotic season in the ACC is setting up for a thrilling conference championship race, but for now the team in pole position is Georgia Tech after the Yellow Jackets improved to 7-0 overall and 4-0 in conference play with a 27-18 win at Duke on Saturday afternoon. Brent Key's team is guaranteed to be the only team at 4-0 in league play after Week 8 and lead a handful of contenders to reach the ACC Championship Game by being one of the top two teams in the final conference standings. Georgia Tech being in the mix for an ACC title game appearance is not a huge break from preseason expectations, but the rest of the competition certainly does not fall in line with how experts viewed the conference coming into the year. An outlook of Clemson, Miami and Florida State has been displaced by the likes of Georgia Tech, Virginia and Louisville. The Cardinals made a move into the ACC title picture with an upset of Miami on Friday night that has left Week 8 being among the most significant turning points in the conference championship race. Louisville now has a head-to-head advantage over Miami, and given the imbalanced schedules across a 17-team league any win like that is crucial for all tiebreaker scenarios. Miami is, of course, not out of the mix at all. The Hurricanes may have suffered a disappointing home loss as a two-touchdown favorite but winning out in ACC play and getting some help from a team on Louisville's schedule could very quickly flip what might be an uphill battle to get to Charlotte. And thankfully for Miami, at least when it comes to the College Football Playoff, the team has some quality nonconference wins against Notre Dame, South Florida and Florida that could be necessary to land an at-large bid if the team finds itself shut out of winning the conference. The picture can be expanded even more as SMU and Pittsburgh each have viable paths to making the top two by season's end. Making matters even more complicated is that Georgia Tech, Virginia and Miami have zero crossover games between them to help decide tiebreakers.  \nSo who among the seven teams in the hunt have the best chance to make the ACC Championship Game and play for a spot in the College Football Playoff? We have ranked our top five most likely title game matchups below.\n        \n            \n                After a dominant start to the season, past problems returned to haunt Carson Beck, Miami in loss to Louisville\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n5. Louisville vs. Georgia Tech The primary path for the Cardinals seems to be for Virginia to lose two ACC games before the end of the season and for Louisville to win out in conference play. That would include a strong finish with games against Clemson at home and at SMU in back-to-back weeks to close the ACC schedule. But if Louisville finishes 7-1 in conference play and Virginia slips up a couple of times, that head-to-head win against Miami could put the Cardinals back in the ACC Championship Game for the second time in three years. Here we have Georgia Tech making it through, as the Yellow Jackets have the least amount of work left to finish with an 8-0 or 7-1 league record. 4. Georgia Tech vs. SMU Don't look now but SMU is still very much in the mix for the ACC title after dropping both of its nonconference games against the Big 12 (Baylor, SMU). The Mustangs were the runner-up in the conference last year after going 8-0 in the regular season and again have a path where Rhett Lashlee's group gets to determine its own outcome. That's because SMU gets both Miami and Louisville on its home turf in the second half of the season, and if the Mustangs win them both we will see another surge to the top of the standings. \n3. Miami vs. Virginia This is the scenario where Georgia Tech fumbles the bag, and drops at least one of its final four conference games while Miami wins out and Virginia and secures the right wins to also finish with an 8-0 or 7-1 conference record. For the Yellow Jackets to fall out of the picture they'd need to take at least one loss and likely two from a stretch that includes Syracuse (home), NC State (road), Boston College (road) and Pitt (home). It's a team that's been winning at the margins, especially on the road, so maybe there is some regression there with results and that's what Miami is hoping for so that maybe the NC State game can become a common opponent tiebreaker win for the Canes.   2. Georgia Tech vs. Virginia This is where Miami's loss to Louisville could be doubly painful, because any tiebreakers with Virginia that come down to common opponents would break the Wahoos way because of their win against the Cardinals back in Week 6. Virginia has some tricky cross-country travel to navigate in coming weeks with a Chapel Hill-to-Berkley-to-Charlottesville run starting in Week 9, but if they get through that run, and a mid-November date at Duke, with only one loss then odds are very good the Wahoos can secure the tiebreakers needed to make the conference title game.   1. Miami vs. Georgia Tech Another edition of of Mario Cristobal against Brent Key would make for a highly entertaining ACC Championship Game, and possibly the matchup that would give the ACC the highest probability to get both participants into the College Football Playoff. Of course Miami would need some help to jump ahead of Virginia in the standings, in addition to winning out its final six games of the ACC schedule. Miami will be favored in every game left on the schedule, but now the margin for error has lessened because another conference loss could bounce them from even winning tiebreakers at 6-2.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At almost every Power Four program in the country, Ohio State star Carnell Tate would be the clear-cut No. 1 wide receiver on his team. The only places he might have competition for that title are at Arizona State (Jordyn Tyson), USC (Makai Lemon) and Ohio State (Jeremiah Smith).Smith has been labeled as a can't-miss prospect from the moment he played his first game at Ohio State last year -- and rightfully so. Smith is clearly on track to be the WR1 in the 2027 NFL Draft and has a strong case as the best player in the sport regardless of position.But don't forget about Tate, who is establishing himself as the most underappreciated star in college football. Tate finished with six catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns in the No. 1 Buckeyes' 34-0 win over Wisconsin on Saturday, which marked his third game this season with at least 100 receiving yards.\nTate, a former five-star recruit from the 2023 class, was competing for targets as a freshman with a wide receiver corps that included Marvin Harrison Jr., Emeka Egbuka and Julian Fleming. Still, he finished the 2023 campaign with 18 catches for 264 yards and a touchdown.\nDuring Ohio State's run to a national title last season, Tate took a giant leap and established himself as a go-to target for quarterback Will Howard. He ended the 2024 campaign with 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns -- which included catching seven passes for 87 yards against Texas in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl.This season has been a different story for Tate. Through Ohio State's first seven games, he has caught 34 passes for 587 yards and six touchdowns -- which is already a new season-high with plenty of games still to play. Despite an overall resume that may not include eye-popping numbers like some of his peers elsewhere, Tate is making the case to be one of the top wide receivers selected this spring.In CBS Sports' latest mock draft by Ryan Wilson, Tate is projected No. 19 overall to the Cleveland Browns. CBS Sports' Mike Renner had Tate in Tier 1 with Tyson on the wide receiver prospect pecking order for the 2026 NFL Draft, and said he has the \"makings of a high-volume X-receiver\" in the NFL.\nCarnell Tate might go down as one of the least-heralded top-10 picks at receiver in recent memory. Such is life when your former teammate is rookie sensation Emeka Egbuka and your current teammate is generational talent Jeremiah Smith. But Tate has all the makings of a high-volume X-receiver at the next level. His body type and smooth athleticism are more reminiscent of an NBA slasher than a traditional wideout -- and that's what makes him special.And with the history of what Ohio State wide receivers have done at the next level, how could you not bet on the pedigree? Egbuka, who finished as Ohio State's all-time leader in receptions (205), took somewhat of a backseat role to Smith last year. Still, he finished with 81 catches for 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns and would've been in the same position Tate is in today: The WR2 at his school, and the No. 1 almost everywhere else.That's why when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Egbuka to join a loaded wide receiver corps that included veteran Chris Godwin Jr. and Mike Evans, it was nothing new for him. Immediately, Egbuka has established himself as one of the best wide receivers in the league as a rookie. He has 27 catches for 469 yards and five touchdowns in six games and has the second-best odds behind New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart, per FanDuel, to win Offensive Rookie of the Year.What Egbuka has done so far could be Tate's reality one day. It doesn't matter that he's technically Ohio State's \"WR2\" because he is capable of being the No. 1 option on any given Saturday -- and the top option on a team on Sundays one day. Any program would be lucky to have Smith or Tate on their roster. It just so happens that Ohio State has both. It's part of the reason why the Buckeyes are currently the clear favorite (+280) to win the national title. Tate, unlike Smith, had to wait his turn to be the guy at Ohio State. So did Egbuka, Harrison, Jaxson Smith-Njigba, Garrett Wilson and other former Buckeyes who are now among the best players at the position in the NFL. The future for Tate is bright, and he is someone worthy of the title as one of the best and most underappreciated players in the sport.\n            ",

Starting running back Jam Miller is listed as probable for the Tide. Tennessee linebacker Edwin Spillman is out for the first half after being called for targeting in the second half last week. Kickoff from Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala., is at 7:30 p.m. ET. Tennessee has won two of the last three meetings, but is looking for its first win in Tuscaloosa since 2003.

    "body": "\n        Diego Pavia struck the Heisman pose after one of his three touchdowns in No. 17 Vanderbilt's 31-24 win over No. 10 LSU. It's a celebratory move reserved only for the most elite, or the most self-confident, players in college football. Pavia is both of those things. And he had his Heisman moment on Saturday.It would be difficult to identify a player more important to his team's success than Pavia is to Vanderbilt. The Commodores had not been to a bowl game in six years when he transferred in from New Mexico State, and they promptly posted a winning season in his debut campaign and suddenly have momentum in the College Football Playoff race. The program's rise coincides entirely with Pavia's emergence as a star.Saturday's victory was a step forward in both of those realms. It was a program-defining win for Vanderbilt, which until this week had not been favored against a ranked opponent in 176 games. It was a statement performance from Pavia, too, as he flashed his dynamism in a do-it-all effort on a massive stage.Not only did Pavia pass for 160 yards and a score, but he also led all players in carries (17), rushing yards (86) and touchdowns (2). He did all that against one of college football's top defenses, no less -- one that had not allowed more than 24 points all year until the Commodores broke the 30-point threshold.\nIt was after Vanderbilt's final touchdown, a 21-yard sprint, that Pavia hit the Heisman pose.\"I didn't see the pose, but yeah, I think he's the best player in college football,\" Vanderbilt coach Clark Lea said postgame. \"That's what I think. You can't watch him play and not realize what a game-changer he is. There are a lot of good players; there's only a handful, to me, that can take a game over, and he's one of those.\"\nMovement in the betting market reflected Pavia's surge in the Heisman race. His odds to win college football's most prestigious award, per FanDuel, skyrocketed to +1900 after the victory. Only six players nationally have shorter odds. Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (+230) and Alabama's Ty Simpson (+270) are the perceived frontrunners.\n\"He deserves all the attention, all the credit,\" said Lea. \"He's a confident guy, but he's humble in his process. His greatest trait is his curiosity. He's a dawg. That's what he is. And he shows up every time. I love him, and I'm glad he's with us. I hope for everything for him, including the Heisman.\"This is really nothing new for Pavia, who passed or ran for a touchdown in 24 consecutive games entering the week, going all the way back to his final year at New Mexico State. The sixth-year senior is a more refined player this season, though, and is clearly a much better passer than previously in his career. Last week, he passed for 300 yards for just the second time in his career and set a personal best with five touchdowns through the air. His 70.5% completion rate on the year is more than 10 points higher than his previous season-long best.Pavia has the numbers, the swagger and now the team resume it takes to clinch a spot at the front of the Heisman race. If he keeps things rolling when the Commodores host No. 16 Missouri and travel to No. 21 Texas in the next two weeks, he might just earn himself a seat at the award ceremony in New York City.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a thrilling clash that lived up to its potential playoff-hype billing, the Washington Spirit and Orlando Pride delivered an instant NWSL classic on Saturday on CBS. The third-place Pride secured a dramatic 3-2 comeback victory over the second-place Spirit on the road at Audi Field. In a match that was a wild roller coaster that featured lead changes, two own goals, and a decisive penalty that ultimately snapped the Spirit's 12-game unbeaten streak, it was a crucial three points for Orlando, who are rallying into a better form ahead of the NWSL postseason. \"Great game, great result. You know, we were disappointed with the goals that we conceded, but we showed a lot of resilience to come back and win the game. Credit to all the players, the staff, it's been a journey to get here. We now hold our own destiny, trying to reach that top four spot,\" Pride head coach Seb Hines told the media after the game.The Spirit took control of the game in the first half and carried a narrow lead into halftime. The initial go-ahead goal was crafted by Italy international Sofia Cantore with a backheel.\nThe highlight-worthy goal was the last time the Spirit would lead the game. Orlando's second-half comeback was sparked by Brazilian international Marta off the bench. The 39-year-old attacker's impact was instant, getting on the ball from the whistle, putting on the moves in the box, and taking a cheeky shot that deflected off Spirit midfielder Narumi Miura and into the goal.\nThe veteran player later converted a game-winning penalty kick with composure that sent goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury the opposite direction. Pride forward Ally Watt earned the penalty after a foul inside the box was committed by Spirit defender Kysha Sylla. Marta's penalty goal makes her the oldest player to score from the spot in NWSL history.\n\"To bring on a player with her quality, she's an attacking player. She wants to get forward, she wants to score goals, you know, make an immediate impact off the bench. We have to manage her and her loads because she played high minutes on Wednesday night against Pachuca. We felt we needed a bit of a spark, and she certainly brought that,\" Hines said. \n\"And then showing that sort of composure in front of goal with the penalty. You know, she's been in those moments many of times. She's obviously faced Aubrey [Kingsbury] many of times in that position as well. And she calmly slots it away. So yeah, really pleased with her, really happy that we've got her back firing in such a pivotal moment in the season.\"The Pride, who struggled after returning from the mid-season break and lost their leading goal scorer, Barbra Banda, to a season-ending injury, are now on a four-game unbeaten streak with the playoffs just a few weeks away. They have three wins in their last five matches, and will have a final regular-season game on Nov. 2. If the league standings remain the same, there could be a future semifinal meeting between the Spirit and Orlando.It would be the third high-stakes match that the two sides play against each other in a year. The two last met in November during the 2024 NWSL Championship, with Orlando the victors, and again in March during the 2025 NWSL Challenge Cup, with the Spirit achieving a bit of revenge following the championship final. It's the thing that sparks rivalry naturally, and something a young league like NWSL craves. \nThe chaotic back-and-forth of Saturday's match just adds more lore to the recent meetings between the two sides. The Spirit recently lost dynamic winger Trinity Rodman just days before the match to an injury. She sustained a grade 1 MCL sprain during a Concacaf W Champions Cup on Wednesday, and the club confirmed she'll be evaluated. The Spirit roster is not unfamiliar with navigating stretches of the season without Rodman. The franchise player was away from the team for several months as she managed a lingering back injury. She had just returned to playing regularly in August and was recently named to the USWNT roster, though she will now miss out on the international window. Fans eager to see the two sides battle again will have to hold out hope for a potential semifinal meeting, as the Spirit are hopeful to have Rodman for the playoffs. The recent games are just an example of the high-level competition between them. \n\"Anytime we play Washington, it's always an emotional game. It's very competitive. Both teams are going after it. So, yeah, it's for the neutrals. It was a good game,\" Hines joked. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A reset is what the Philadelphia Eagles needed following a mini-bye, a few days off to get the season back on track following two straight losses. The Eagles were beaten soundly by the New York Giants before they headed into their mini-bye, falling back into the field in regards to the NFC East standings -- even though Philadelphia does still lead the division. The Eagles took time to self-reflect, an opportunity to (perhaps) get things right. Bet Eagles vs. Vikings at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\"It's always a good time to kinda reevaluate yourself,\" said Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean. \"Evaluate yourself as a team, as an individual, as a unit.\"\nThe Eagles will have a challenge on their hands on Sunday, as they face the Minnesota Vikings, a team that is coming off a bye after a win over the Cleveland Browns in London. This opponent will provide a true test for Philadelphia given Brian Flores' aggressive defense. The Eagles have the highest pressure rate allowed this season (40%), while Minnesota has the second-highest defensive pressure rate (44%) and blitz rate (38%) this season. \"It's like one of those fun bags where you go to a party and you put your hand in and you don't know what you're gonna get,\" said Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata. \"A lolly, or candy, a toy? You just never know what you're gonna get first, second down. The tape says what it says, but at the same time we know with a Brian Flores defense, expect the unexpected.\"\nWill the Eagles rebound against the Vikings? Will Carson Wentz keep the Vikings' ship afloat another week? Here's more on where to watch the game, along with a prediction and pick. Where to watch Vikings vs. Eagles live Date: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -1.5; O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)When the Eagles have the ballThere has been plenty of conversation surrounding how the Eagles have so much offensive talent, yet are struggling to move the ball consistently. Heading into Week 7, the Eagles offense averaged 274.6 yards per game (30th in NFL), 21.5 offensive points per game (18th), 4.7 yards per play (28th), 3.5 yards per carry (28th), and have a 34.7% third-down conversion rate (27th). Those numbers are way below where Philadelphia was through Week 6 last season. So why is the offense struggling?\n\"Self-inflicted wounds,\" said Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown. \"Sometimes lack of execution at the wrong time. If it's first down and you have a lack of execution, it might not be the end of the world. But when you get to third down, it puts you behind the sticks. That's hard to recover from in this league. So I think just being on the same page, communication and lack of execution.\"\nThe Eagles had opportunities to self-reflect, but they are aware of the challenges that Brian Flores' defense will present. The Vikings' has allowed 19.4 points per game this season (5th in NFL, 289.8 yards per game (8th), and a third-down conversion rate of just 30% (2nd). This may not be the week the offense gets right, but the Eagles will have to keep the Vikings defense on the field. They have a 44.4% three-and-out rate, which is second-highest in the NFL. \nWhen the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings won't have J.J. McCarthy back this week (ankle), even though he was limited in practice all week and has a questionable injury designation for the game. (McCarthy will be the third quarterback.) Carson Wentz will get the start against the team that drafted him, even though it's been five years since Wentz played for the Eagles. Wentz has been on five different teams since while the Eagles have been to two Super Bowls, winning one. Their paths couldn't have been more different since Wentz's departure. \"I enjoyed my time with Carson,\" said Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. \"I learned a lot from him, He was always a pure student and taking everything in through my experience with him so I think right now just trying to set the best example I can [for the young guys], knowing some of the things that I was able to experience.\"\nWentz has played well filling in for McCarthy, completing 69% of his passes for 759 yards with five touchdowns to two interceptions in three games -- a passer rating of 99.5. He has been sacked 12 times while playing behind a makeshift offensive line, but the Vikings are expected to have at least four of the five starters playing this week as right tackle Brian O'Neill is questionable. As for Wentz's time in Philadelphia. That's well in the past. \"Maybe earlier in my career maybe I had a different feeling,\" Wentz said to reporters earlier this week. \"But at the same time, you look over there, and I'm not even sure there's anyone on the defensive side that I've played with. It just looks different. So it's another opponent. \"A lot of respect for those guys. There's still guys in that organization, there's a lot of good people that I still have a lot of care for and respect for. But, at the same time, that feels like multiple lifetimes ago at this point.\"\nVikings vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe mini-bye may just be the formula to get the Eagles back on track, as they look to get the run game going and reset their offense after an inconsistent six weeks. Jalen Hurts is getting the ball to A.J. Brown, but throwing the ball has not set up the run game like the Eagles would have liked. Landon Dickerson is questionable, but it looks like he'll play on Sunday, which is a huge boost for Philadelphia's offensive line. The Eagles have to get into third-and-shorts and move the chains, so running the ball and gaining positive yards on first and second down will be paramount. The Vikings pass rush will play a major role in this one. On the defensive side of the ball, having Jalen Carter and Quinyon Mitchell back is massive. (Carter is listed as questionable but he said he's playing.) Whoever is the CB2 will have their hands full against Jordan Addison. If the Eagles pass rush can get to Wentz, they have a shot to win this game. However, a third of the way through the season there's been no evidence they can do that -- and Za'Darius Smith suddenly retired. The Vikings should win this game bases on how the Eagles have played, but Philadelphia has more talent and needs to play up to that. \nLet's bank on the culture in this one. Pick: Eagles 27, Vikings 24\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Thomas Frank has taken Tottenham by storm with the team in a European spot in the league while also getting the job done in Champions League play. But they've been far from pretty while doing it, relying on set pieces and the defense digging in to find success. It's a marked departure from the team under Ange Postecoglou, while a similar departure has been happening in the front office, where Daniel Levy no longer serves as chairman after stepping down last month.How to watch Tottenham vs. Aston Villa, oddsDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 9 a.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonTV: USA | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Tottenham +105; Draw +250; Aston Villa +260But while this year of change has started off well for Tottenham, it feels like everything is balanced on a razor's edge. Despite their standing in the Premier League, Tottenham's expected goal difference is -1.39, which is good for 12th in the league. While they've been putting the ball in the back of the net fine, Frank's team has overperformed on the defensive end, allowing five goals from an expected eight.Over the course of the season, things like that can catch up to a team, especially when playing multiple times per week due to Champions League commitments. Improvements in net by starting keeper Guglielmo Vicario can only go so far, but weeks like this one are what can show what Tottenham are made of. \nComing off the international break, they'll have a tough matchup hosting Aston Villa before then travelling away to face Monaco in Champions League play. Needing all three points in both matches, Frank needs to look for more avenues to pull creativity out of his squad. Mohammed Kudus and Pedro Porro are leading the way with 1.85 and 1.30 expected assists to begin the season, respectively, in all competitions, but Xavi Simons has yet to get going.With James Maddison injured, Tottenham's hopes hinge on the Dutchman bringing his form from RB Leipzig to North London, and if it doesn't happen, a long slide down the table could be coming. Goals from Mickey Van De Ven and Richarlison have been able to prop up the team so far, but it's not sustainable. If Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha can't get the ball to the attackers for consistent build-up, Frank may need to fiddle around with things. \nTottenham are riding a fine line, but they've yet to prove that things have improved from last season to a degree that will see them make the Champions League again. This team won't finish 17th in the league again, but if they want to make the top four, an evolution needs to take place in midfield over the next few weeks, or they'll come crashing back to earth.\n            ",

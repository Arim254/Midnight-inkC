The Patriots advanced through the AFC playoffs thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. They won a snowy, mistake-filled AFC title game in Denver two weeks ago, claiming the conference championship over a Broncos team that was starting its backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham but that nonetheless stayed in the game throughout.Seattle is back on this stage for the first time since making the Super Bowl in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye in the playoffs thanks to claiming the No. 1 seed in the NFC and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks to claim the conference championship. The title game itself was a rollicking, back-and-forth affair wherein Sam Darnold slayed some demons and took down the Rams with a three-touchdown performance.This game itself is a rematch of the Super Bowl over a decade ago where the Pats defeated the Seahawks thanks to Malcolm Butler's miraculous goal-line interception that stopped the Seahawks from claiming back-to-back Super Bowls. Which of these two teams will emerge victorious this time around? We'll find out soon enough. But in the meantime, here's a look at how you can actually watch the game.\nWhere to watch Super Bowl LX liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC, stream live on PeacockFollow: CBS Sports App\nKey storylines and matchupsDrake Maye's shoulder. Maye injured his shoulder during the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos. He said during Super Bowl Opening Night that he felt the injury turned a corner over the weekend and he felt good. He has been a full participant in practices and will play in the game, but it's still worth watching on Sunday.Sam Darnold's oblique. Darnold was limited in Wednesday's practice due to his recent oblique injury. He was also limited throughout the week leading up to the NFC title game, though, and then he went out and had one of the best games of his entire career. There is no question that he'll play on Sunday.Nick Emmanwori's ankle. Emmanwori injured his ankle in Wednesday's practice, according to head coach Mike Macdonald. If it affects him at all or even keeps him out of the game, it is an absolutely massive story. He is one of the keys to making Macdonald's defense work because of his size and ability to play both the run and the pass from the slot and as a hybrid safety-linebacker type. Macdonald said he expects Emmanwori to play, thankfully, but we'll have to watch his status leading up to Sunday's game.Milton Williams' effect on the Patriots defense. Williams has been a monster since signing his mega free-agent deal last offseason. And New England's defense is a different animal when he is on the field than when he is off it. According to ESPN, the Pats rank sixth in pass-rush win rate with Williams on the field and 26th with him off. According to Tru Media, they allow an additional half-yard per carry before contact with Williams on the sideline than when he is in the game. Since he returned from his injury, the Patriots have been defending at an extremely high level, and they'll need that to continue here.The challenge of Jaxon Smith-Njigba. JSN had one of the best wide receiver seasons in recent memory, catching 119 passes for 1,793 yards and 10 touchdowns. He averaged 3.68 yards per route run, per Tru Media, the third-best mark of any player in the last 10 years. The Patriots have a top cover corner in Christian Gonzalez, but it'll be interesting to see if he shadows JSN all over the field or if they try to bracket him with two defenders and use Gonzalez to take away Rashid Shaheed and/or Cooper Kupp instead. New England's weaponry. The Patriots have cobbled together a pass-catching corps throughout this season, not using any specific reason or tight end on a significant majority of snaps. Stefon Diggs has emerged as the top target for Maye in the passing game but guys like Kayshon Boutte, Demario Douglas, Hunter Henry and more have played their roles. How and whether they are able to find their way against the Seattle secondary will play a big role here. The same guys for how Rhamondre Stevenson and/or TreVeyon Henderson can find any rushing lanes against the ferocious Seattle run defense. Kenneth Walker, feature back. Zach Charbonnet remains out after tearing his knee during the Divisional Round win over the San Francisco 49ers. Walker has played 62% and 63% of the snaps in the two games with Charbonnet out after playing 47% of the snaps during the regular season. George Holani will still work into the mix but it should be expected that Walker gets the significant majority of the touches here.Zone defense battle. Seattle played zone at the league's third-highest rate, forcing opponents into -0.10 EPA per dropback on those snaps, per Tru Media. Meanwhile, Maye was arguably the best quarterback in the league against zone this season, checking in first in EPA per dropback on those snaps. Which team wins the battle in that area will go a long way toward determining who wins the game itself.Prediction\nSeattle's defense is just too good. New England has already struggled offensively through its first three playoff games, failing to produce representative performances against the Chargers, Texans or Broncos. Now, the Patriots face what may be their toughest test yet in this Seahawks group. They can generate pressure and are sticky on the back end. They typically don't allow the type of big plays the Patriots' passing offense relied on during the regular season before it backslid in the playoffs.The Pats will have to run the ball well and probably dink and dunk their way down the field, and I'm not sure they can do it well enough to put up a ton of points. Strangely, I might trust Seattle's offense more than New England's at the moment, given the way Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and even Kenneth Walker III are playing. If the Seahawks can stay in a neutral or positive game script and avoid a pure dropback game for an extended stretch, I like them to come away with the win.Prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props like Kenneth Walker anytime touchdown (-195) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -231, Patriots +191), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay.

He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit.

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns have a decision to make at quarterback this offseason. Will they give the starting job back to Deshaun Watson with him healthy again? Will they move forward with Shedeur Sanders as QB1? Or could Cleveland hop on the quarterback carousel and search for someone else via free agency or the draft?When Todd Monken was introduced as the Browns' new coach this week, he was asked about Sanders -- who was named to the Pro Bowl as an alternate following his rookie season. Monken said he was excited about Sanders, but the starting quarterback was \"still to be determined.\" Some believe Sanders did enough in limited action as a rookie to be named the starter moving forward, such as Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith, who went on a four-minute rant about the Browns and Sanders during a recent appearance on \"Up & Adams.\" \"What does Cleveland have? Absolutely nothing,\" Smith said. \"So what's the debate? Are you going to give it to Dillon [Gabriel] again?\"Smith said that in the eight games Sanders played in 2025, it became clear he was the best option Cleveland had. \"I haven't seen anyone else earn the right to be that, but him\" Smith said. \"And he hasn't played enough, and they haven't given him enough chances to be on the football field, and when he's on the football field, they feel better. They look better.\" \nGiven the fact that Smith played with Deion Sanders during their Dallas Cowboys days, he said that he's known Shedeur since he was a child. Growing up under one of the best athletes of all time, Sanders was basically raised to be great, and his confidence is contagious. \"The team believes different. His energy is different. His swag is different. His level of confidence is different. Notice I said confidence, I didn't say nothing about arrogance. His level of confidence is different,\" Smith said. \"So he believes that he has the ability to do it. He's not walking out there thinking, 'Can I do it?' Or 'Do I have the possibility to do it? No, I'm going to make it happen.'\"Check out Smith's full rant, here:\nSanders went 3-4 as the starter, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions this past season. While he began the year as the emergency third quarterback behind Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, Sanders got his first career start in Week 12 against the Las Vegas Raiders and became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995. In a 24-10 victory, he completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. However, things didn't improve after his first career start, as Sanders registered the second-worst completion percentage and threw an NFL-high 10 interceptions over the final eight weeks of the season.\nSanders was statistically one of the worst starting quarterbacks in 2025, but he was still better than where he was selected at in the 2025 NFL Draft. The former Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year does have potential, but more reps are needed for development.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- Retirement will have to wait a little while longer for Matthew Stafford. After being named NFL MVP for the first time in his 17-year NFL career, the Los Angeles Rams quarterback announced on the NFL Honors stage that he will be back for the 2026 season. Before this announcement on Thursday night, Stafford's playing future had been up in the air ever since the Rams' season ended in the NFC Championship. \"I'll see you guys next year,\" Stafford said with the MVP award in hand and four daughters alongside him. \n\"It's something that I've been thinking about,\" Stafford told reporters after receiving the award. \"Talking with my family about even before the season ended, whether or not they wanted me to continue to play and whether or not it felt like I wanted to keep playing. I ended the season on a healthy note and was a part of a great team. I had a bunch of teammates in the crowd, coaches in the crowd, and it just felt like the right thing to do at the right moment. \"It's a family decision. I have my girls with me, so it just felt right. Happy to be coming back.\"Stafford, 37, just completed a prolific 2025 season that found him voted as a first-team All-Pro along with this MVP honor. His 46 passing touchdowns were a franchise record and a career high for the former No. 1 overall pick in 2009. He was also just the fourth quarterback all time with at least 45 passing touchdowns and under 10 interceptions on the year.\n\"This game takes a lot out of you,\" Stafford said when asked why he considered retirement after a season where he played at such an elite level. \"You saw the people, the four little girls that were standing on stage with me, and I want to be as big a part of their life as I possibly can be. That's really important to me, and if they weren't supportive of me playing, I wouldn't do it. \"I'm lucky to have little girls that want their dad to do what he loves to do. They love cheering me on and all my teammates. It's a special thing to have that, but it's not something I'm willing to lose over a game that I love to play there's no question about it but if they weren't behind me in that decision, I don't care how good I played that year or the year before or whatever it is, you know, we'd have some real talks.\"Stafford is also just the 15th quarterback ever to win MVP and have a Super Bowl on his résumé. Ten of those other 14 players are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while three of the ones currently on the outside looking in are simply not eligible, but will get in (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes). \nWith that in mind, Stafford has positioned himself quite nicely to one day be enshrined in Canton, Ohio, but the clock for his eligibility won't start ticking quite yet. \n            ",

The award is given out to the player who has had a significant and positive impact on his community, emphasizing excellence on and off the field. At Thursday's NFL Honors, Washington Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner was named the 2026 Walter Payton Man of the Year. \nWagner created the FAST54 Phenia Mae Fund, named in honor of his late mother, who passed away in 2012 due to stroke complications. Working with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, Cedar Sinai, National Children's Hospital, and Kaiser Permanente, the fund helps stroke patients and promotes stroke education. On top of this endeavor, Wagner is an advocate for social justice reform and mental health, participating in the NFL's Inspire Change.Wagner, 35, just wrapped up his 14th season in the NFL and second with the Commanders. He initially entered the league as a second-round draft choice of the Seattle Seahawks in 2012 and has been one of the best linebackers of his era. Wagner helped Seattle to a Super Bowl XLVIII win and has been named to 11 All-Pro teams (six first-team). He's also been named to 10 Pro Bowls. \nWagner will receive up to a $250,000 donation to the charity of his choice. Meanwhile, the 31 other players who were nominated by their teams will receive up to a $40,000 donation to the charity of their choosing. This award was first established in 1970 and was renamed in 1999 to honor the late Hall of Fame running back, Walter Payton. \n            \n    ",

This distinction is handed out to the top offensive lineman of the year, and the inaugural winner for 2026 is Chicago Bears guard Joe Thuney. This award caps off a stellar first season in Chicago for Thuney, who was acquired by the Bears in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs this offense and subsequently inked to a two-year, $35 million extension. \nThuney spearheaded a revamped offensive line in Chicago that proved to be a key reason for their turnaround under first year head coach Ben Johnson. After being sacked a league-leading 68 times over his rookie season, Caleb Williams was sacked just 24 times in 2025 with Thuney and others installed upfront. In 17 games this season, Thuney did not allow a single sack, just one quarterback hit, and 14 pressures, according to TruMedia. Thuney entered the NFL as a third-round draft choice of the New England Patriots in 2016. After helping the organization to two Super Bowl titles as a key cog along the offensive line, he signed with Kansas City in 2021, where he won two more titles. \nThuney was chosen by a panel of six former All-Pro linemen: LeCharles Bentley, Jason Kelce, Shaun O'Hara, Orlando Pace, Will Shields, and Andrew Whitworth. He beat out fellow finalists Garrett Bolles, Aaron Brewer, Creed Humphrey, Quinn Meinerz, and Penei Sewell. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The gambling scandal that has ensnared two Cleveland Guardians players has grown in scale. According to court documents filed on Thursday, Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase is accused by prosecutors of throwing pitches to benefit bettors in a total of 48 games in recent years, ESPN reports. Last year, Clase and a Cleveland teammate, right-handed starter Luis L. Ortiz, were indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. According to the Department of Justice, both pitchers \"agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types of pitches and speeds of pitches.\"The Department of Justice went on to allege that the pair made at least $450,000 by rigging outings and throwing specific pitches to the benefit of bettors placing wagers on the outcome of those pitches. Both Clase and Ortiz pleaded not guilty to those charges in November of last year. In that unsealed indictment, prosecutors listed nine occasions on which Clase was alleged to have thrown a suspicious  pitch. The Thursday filing, however, increases that total by more than five fold. Clase is alleged to have begun his illegal activity in May of 2023, and Ortiz is alleged to have joined the scheme in June of 2025 for a pair of games. Clase and Ortiz have been on administrative leave since late June of 2025 while Major League Baseball investigates. Clase, 27, has been one of the most dominant closers in baseball the last few years. He's a three-time All-Star, and in 2024 he finished third in the American League Cy Young vote. Ortiz, also 27, has made 50 starts and 25 relief appearances across parts of four MLB seasons. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on the charges of wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. \n\"Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,\" the closer's attorney told CBS Sports in a November statement when the charges were first announced. \"Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"\"Luis is and always has been a fierce competitor. He has always given his best effort in every inning of every game. Those who have played with him know this. And the government's investigation, including discussions with Luis' teammates, supports this as well,\" Ortiz's lawyer told CBS Sports in a statement around that same time. \"...There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court. The government's case is weak and circumstantial. He will defend himself, and he will prevail.\"Ortiz's lawyer also said that all payments and money transfers were \"for lawful activities.\"\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on May 4. \n            ",

This comes after the Cleveland Browns pass rusher orchestrated a record-setting year, breaking the single-season sack record with 23. This is the second DPOY award Garrett has won in his career, with the first coming in 2023. Garrett's 23 sacks surpassed both Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021), who co-held the record at 22.5. On top of the sacks, Garrett had 33 tackles for loss, which were the second-most in the NFL over the last 25 years. His 39 quarterback hits also ranked second in the league in 2025. The former No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was heads and shoulders above the rest of his peers this season when it came to sacking the quarterback. Garrett had 6.5 more sacks than the next closest player this season (Brian Burns with 16.5). \nPlayer2025 NFL Sack LeadersMyles Garrett23.0Brian Burns16.5Danielle Hunter15.0Aidan Hutchsinson14.5Nik Bonitto14.0\nOne critique of Garrett breaking the sack record has been that the Browns pass rusher did have the luxury of an extra game with the NFL moving to an 18-week regular season (17 games) in 2021. However, as CBS Sports Research notes, Garrett actually had fewer chances to collect sacks this season than both Strahan and Watt. In 2025, the Browns faced 562 dropbacks, which was the third-fewest in the NFL. When Strahan broke the record in 2001, his Giants faced 576 dropbacks. As for Watt, his Steelers faced 649 dropbacks in 2021 when he tied himself with Strahan. That further highlights just how impressive and dominant Garrett was this season. \nGarrett beat out a group of finalists consisting of Will Anderson Jr. (Texans), Nik Bonitto (Broncos), Aidan Hutchinson (Lions), and Micah Parsons (Packers) for the award. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In his third start of the season, Chris Gotterup has his eyes fixed on his second victory of the year. The free-swinging right-hander was flawless Thursday morning at the 2026 WM Phoenix Open as he navigated TPC Scottsdale in bogey-free fashion, signing for an 8-under 63.Gotterup's effort was good enough to give him a two-shot lead over Matt Fitzpatrick, who similarly reached 8 under before dropping a pair of strokes late in his round. A trio of young, budding stars in Michael Thorbjornsen, Nicolai Hojgaard and Pierceson Coody, along with Sam Stevens, sit one further back at 5 under.\"I think, to start the year, I really felt like I worked hard in the offseason to get ready for the season,\" Gotterup said. \"TGL in the offseason also, just getting used to the adrenaline rush you get inside there and being able to hit shots under pressure has helped me and my game. It's nice to start the year off on a good note.\"Gotterup played alongside world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who struggled to a 73, his first round over par since June 2025, and Jordan Spieth, who signed for a 70. Gotterup got things rolling in the middle of the back nine, starting his round on the par-4 10th. He rolled in an eagle putt from off the green on the par-5 13th and followed it with three straight birdie connections from the 6-10 foot range.\nThough he failed to get up-and-down short of the par-4 17th for a fifth straight par-breaker, Gotterup made up for it quickly by dialling in a 25-foot birdie bid on No. 18 to turn in 6 under. Moving to the more difficult front nine, Gotterup managed his game well. He took advantage of the lone par 5 (missing a 7-foot eagle putt) and once again summoned a birdie from distance on the par-3 7th for his final birdie of the day.\"I feel like I'm doing things well and thinking through things well, and I think that's the most important thing,\" Gotterup said. \"I wouldn't say today I drove it my best or did anything -- I putted great today, but I just was in the right spot when I needed to be. I drove it unbelievably and did good stuff there. It's nice to play well and also have other parts complement that. It's been nice to manage my game properly.\"Gotterup was chasing Fitzpatrick for most of the morning as the Englishman looked shot out of a cannon in the early going. Fitzpatrick played his first eight holes in 7 under and turned in 29 as the course record (60) crept into conversation. Like Gotterup, he added a birdie on No. 3, but unlike the leader, he was unable to run through the finish line and scored bogeys on Nos. 8-9.\n\"It's disappointing. I guess the way you got to look at it is if I started bogey, bogey, and you finish 6-under, you come off feeling like the greatest player in the world,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"You got to try and reframe it there. If someone would've said, 'Here is 6-under to start day,' and I can stay in bed, I would've snatched your hand off. I'm in a good position to start with and hopefully kick on.\"Gotterup and Fitzpatrick benefited from calmer conditions on Thursday as winds picked up and posed problems for players as the round progressed. Notable scores from the afternoon wave include Hideki Matsuyama's 68, Viktor Hovland's 69, Xander Schauffele's 71 and Brooks Koepka's 75.Leader1. Chris Gotterup (-8): Gotterup has now played nine rounds in 2026, and the scores read as follows: 63, 69, 68, 64, 68, 70, 70, 69, 63. All nine of these efforts have come in under par (even at the difficult Torrey Pines South Course) as the third-year PGA Tour member has come into the new year as a new-look player.\nThe 26-year-old is driving the ball great, but the iron play and course management have leapt forward. He's picking his spots wisely, playing to his strong points and never really gets out in front of himself. This can make up for deficiencies while also emphasising one's strengths.\"We went through some stats from last year, and obviously, I had a great year last year,\" Gotterup said. \"There were like two or three things that were kind of glaring in terms of losing shots in spots where if I didn't look at stats I probably would've said I did decent at. We worked on that, and that was really the only things … other than just normal practice. Those were things that I worked on to get ready for this year.\"\nContenders2. Matt Fitzpatrick (-6)T3. Michael Thorbjornsen, Nicolai Hojgaard, Pierceson Coody, Sam Stevens (-5)T7. Kevin Roy, Max McGreevy, Daniel Berger, Jake Knapp, Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen (-4)After splitting time between the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA Tour during his rookie season, Coody has started his sophomore campaign in stride. The righty has rattled off three straight top 20s with a runner-up result materialising last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.\nWith his start to the year, Coody commands the top spot in the Aon Swing 5, which would put him in the next two signature events -- the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Genesis Invitational -- but he is eyeing more, as a win would secure a whole lot more for the 26-year-old.\"It's certainly a different spot than I was in my rookie year,\" Coody said. \"I think I missed the first six cuts my rookie year. Last year, obviously, wasn't playing on the West Coast and didn't play in Florida, either, so I knew I was only going to start in the middle of the year essentially. \"Yeah, to be one up on the way I've started the last couple years feels really nice. I know I've set myself up to, yeah, keep moving the bar and playing well and play a little different schedule than I had the last few years.\"\n2026 WM Phoenix Open updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookChris Gotterup: 3-1Matt Fitzpatrick: 8-1Pierceson Coody: 14-1Michael Thorbjornsen: 14-1Nicolai Hojgaard: 17-1Sam Stevens: 17-1Hideki Matsuyama: 18-1Jake Knapp: 18-1Scottie Scheffler: 21-1The afternoon wave played more than 0.50 strokes more difficult, and yet, Matsuyama managed a clean round of 3 under. The two-time tournament winner kept plodding his way along, taking advantage of the par 5s and picking off what few scoring chances there were. His iron play has been great over the first month of the season, and he has shown a propensity to pop on these greens in the past.\n            ",

He joins Cam Newton (2011) as the only Offensive Rookie of the Year winners in Panthers history.The No. 8 overall pick out of Arizona, McMillan showed immediate promise as a lead wide receiver for Bryce Young and the Panthers, reaching 100 yards in his second NFL game. He found the end zone twice -- his first two NFL scores -- in a Week 6 win over the Dallas Cowboys. Overall, McMillan finished his rookie campaign with 70 receptions for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns.

Bringing a regular-season game to Rio strengthens our connection to a vibrant and passionate football community and underscores our long-term commitment to the market.\" \nThe NFL has played two games in Brazil over the last two years, but those matchups took place in São Paulo.

    "body": "\n        Just three days ago, it didn't seem like the Los Angeles Clippers were going to do much of anything at the trade deadline. They'd won 17 of their previous 21 games, the NBA's best record during that stretch, to totally turn around their season after a 6-21 start. If they were going to make any moves, they profiled as buyers as they climbed to ninth in the West with Kawhi Leonard playing at an MVP level. \"In our situation, I don't see much movement,\" coach Tyronn Lue had recently told reporters.That quote is now hilarious. Before Thursday's deadline, the Clippers traded their second- and third-best players. The front office completely reoriented the franchise, prioritizing the future over the remainder of this season. They were the kind of moves you'd expect from the most disappointing team in the league, not the hottest one. They were also two of the best trades that any team made at the deadline.I find every part of this strange, as I liked seeing Los Angeles turn into the type of team I thought it would be coming into the season. From that vantage point, it's a bit of a bummer to watch the organization pivot away from what was working. There is no way, though, that I can argue with what the Clippers did from a team-building perspective. They didn't just turn James Harden into an All-Star-caliber guard 10 years his junior; they convinced the Cleveland Cavaliers to send them a second-round pick for their trouble. And they didn't just turn Ivica Zubac into multiple picks in a deal with the Indiana Pacers; they turned him into a pair of good firsts, one of which is particularly interesting.\n        \n            \n                James Harden's early-exit legacy is likely cemented, but that doesn't make it any less complicated\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's start with the Harden trade. Unless Garland has the most persistent case of turf toe in history, the Clippers will look brilliant for buying low on him. Just last season, Garland had the best year of his career, averaging 20.6 points on 60% true shooting as an integral part of the league's top offense. After two-plus years of Harden running the show, it will be jarring to see this team with a lead guard who is active and dangerous off the ball. \nGiven concerns about durability -- he's played in only 26 games this season and has been out since mid-January, but told reporters in LA that he's \"ready to hoop\" -- and the defensive viability of a Garland-Donovan Mitchell backcourt, it's understandable that the Cavaliers, firmly in win-now mode (and convince-Mitchell-to-sign-an-extension mode) wanted to swap him for Harden. For a Clippers team that was ancient and light on draft capital, though, this was a no-brainer. They sidestepped extension discussions with a star who turns 37 in August and replaced him with a 26-year-old who will be a core player going forward.I am curious to see if the Clippers, who rank 30th in offensive pace, speed things up with Garland. The biggest question coming out of the deadline, though, is what will happen with the protected pick they received in the Zubac deal. The particulars are fascinating. In a throwback to the 2012 trade that sent Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets to the Toronto Raptors, the Pacers agreed to send Los Angeles their pick in this year's loaded draft with double protection, so it stays in Indiana if it falls between No. 1 and No. 4 or if it's No. 10 onward.This is a hell of a risk for the Pacers. If the lottery lands them between No. 5 and No. 9, they'll have to send the draft pick that was supposed to be their reward for a \"gap year\" to Los Angeles. And if doesn't, then the outcome isn't necessarily bad for Los Angeles: It will immediately turn into to an unprotected 2031 first-round pick. (There are, obviously, a wide range of outcomes. If Indiana wins the lottery and pairs Kansas star Darryn Peterson with Tyrese Haliburton, I'd bet against them sending the Clippers an awesome pick in 2031.) At the moment, the Pacers have the NBA's third-worst record; if that holds, Los Angeles will have a 47.9% chance of getting the pick, per Tankathon.\n\n        \n            \n                Ivica Zubac trade grades: Winner of Pacers, Clippers deal will be decided on lottery night\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nZubac, 28, is an excellent player and an incredible development story. The Clippers stole him from the Los Angeles Lakers at the 2019 deadline, and since then he's improved as a rim protector, a post-up threat, a passer and a finisher. He earned a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team last year, and he'll feast as a roll man next to Halliburton next season. That said, one could make the case that the aforementioned pick alone would be worth giving him up. In addition, the Clippers got Indiana's unprotected (!) 2029 pick, plus wing Bennedict Mathurin and big man Isaiah Jackson. (They also sent wing Kobe Brown to the Pacers.)Mathurin was a popular Most Improved Player candidate coming into the season, but, in the last year of his rookie contract, he failed to convince the Pacers that they needed to keep him around. He has upped his 3-point rate, though, and is averaging 17.5 points on 58.6% true shooting, both career highs. The former No. 6 pick is still just 23 years old and a talented bucket-getter, and the Clippers will get to spend some time with him before deciding how they want to approach his restricted free agency. They did Indiana a favor by taking on Jackson's contract, which doesn't expire until 2028, but he at least gives them another big body with Zubac walking out the door.Like all trades involving picks, young players and injury concerns, there are a lot of variables here, and the protected Pacers pick is an unusually wild one. We don't need the benefit of hindsight, though, to know that, value-wise, the Clippers crushed this deadline. Until now, they were at the end of an era that began with the arrival of Leonard and Paul George in 2019, trying to make the best of the situation without sacrificing flexibility. Now they've started to build something new.\n            ",

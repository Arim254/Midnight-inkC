    "body": "\n        A Monday Night Football doubleheader in Week 6 means twice as many NFL player props and more chances to find NFL longshot picks with enhanced payouts. A full night of NFL betting begins at 7:15 p.m. ET with Falcons vs. Bills, followed by Commanders vs. Bears at 8:15 p.m. ET. It's a quarterback-focused league, and it will be a quarterback-focused night with the reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen playing along with three first-round picks from a year ago (Michael Penix Jr., Jayden Daniels and Caleb Williams).However, we're spotlighting Bills running back James Cook in one of our top NFL longshot props tonight. Cook to rush for 80 yards or more is priced as high as +132 in the latest Week 6 NFL odds, and he's already piled up three 100-yard rushing games this season. The model also has two other Monday Night Football longshots that you can target for bigger payouts.SportsLine's Projection Model can help you find value to add to your Week 6 NFL picks at top online sportsbooks. It can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code, where new users receive 20 100% profit boost tokens with the code CBS20X:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Anybody following its NFL predictions at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Best Week 6 NFL longshot picks:James Cook, Bills, alt line 80+ rushing yards (+132)D'Andre Swift, Bears, alt line 60+ rushing yards (+171)Luke McCaffrey, Commanders, anytime touchdown scorer (+400)Parlay these picks for +3120 odds at DraftKings (odds subject to change)James Cook, Bills, alt line 80+ rushing yards (+132)  He's averaging 90 rushing yards per game this season and has already cracked the century mark in three of Buffalo's first five games. Dating back to October of last season, he's cracked this total in 11 of his last 20 games including the postseason, so getting plus-money here regardless of the opponent is a bargain. However, things get even better when you consider that the Falcons rank 16th in run defense and 23rd in yards allowed per carry. The model predicts 85 yards on average for Cook. New customers can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wins. Claim this FanDuel Sportsbook bonus here.D'Andre Swift, Bears, alt line 60+ rushing yards (+171)The Bears have struggled to get their running game going this season, but Swift has still hit this number once already this season, and Ben Johnson has had the bye week to try to cure what ails his rushing attack. The Commanders might also be a remedy, as they rank 17th in run defense this season and most recently gave up 155 rushing yards to the Chargers in a win. The model predicts that Swift finishes with 62 yards on average, making this a great value play. Get this price at DraftKings, where you can also get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.Luke McCaffrey, Commanders, anytime touchdown scorer (+400)A third-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and the younger brother of 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Luke McCaffrey hasn't earned a high-volume role in the Washington offense yet, but he's slowly winning over the staff. He has a touchdown reception in two of the last three weeks and also broke a 50-yarder in Jayden Daniels' return to action last week. These odds imply a 20% chance of scoring, but the model predicts that he scores 0.31 touchdowns on average.Want more Week 6 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL longshot picks for Week 6.

Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels, the top two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft, go head-to-head for the second time in their NFL careers, and the Commanders defeated the Bears, 18-15, in last year's meeting. The first game of the Monday Night Football doubleheader features the Buffalo Bills (4-1) back in primetime after a 23-20 loss to the Patriots on Sunday Night Football last week. The Bills are favored by 3.5 points, according to the latest NFL odds, and the Commanders are 5.5-point favorites. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Bills vs. Falcons and Bears vs. Commanders.

Allen, off his first NFL MVP last season, has Buffalo averaging 30.6 points per game, which was third in the NFL entering Week 6 on the third-most yards (395.8 per game). James Cook has been a key reason for the success as well, with Buffalo ranking No. 1 in the NFL in run-play percentage (50%) while ranking second in rushing yards per game (154.4). Cook is rushing for 90 yards per game, with Allen adding 42.2 rushing yards per contest. Meanwhile, the Falcons are allowing 4.6 yards per rush, which ranks 23rd in the league. The model projects the Bills to cover in 69% of simulations.Over 49.5 pointsThe Bills and Falcons average the two most rushes per game in the NFL, and neither team is particularly strong at stopping the run. While Atlanta ranks 23rd at 4.6 yards per rush allowed, Buffalo ranks 30th at 5.6 yards per attempt. With an elite rusher like Bijan Robinson, who is averaging 96.7 rushing yards per game over his last three contests and 4.9 yards per rush on the season, the 23-year-old could have a few breakout runs to create big plays and fast scores. The Falcons had two weeks to prepare for Buffalo off a bye week after scoring 34 points against the Commanders in Week 4. With Buffalo having the No. 3 scoring offense in the league on the other side, the model projects the Over to hit in 57% of simulations.Bears vs. Commanders bettingCommanders -5.5The Commanders defeated the Chargers, 27-10, in Daniels' return after missing the last two games. It was a slow start for Daniels and Washington with no points in the first quarter of his return, but Washington scored on five of its final six possessions, including a 13-play, 99-yard drive, and the model projects that offensive success to carry into Monday Night Football. The Commanders have the No. 8 scoring offense (26.8 ppg), while the Bears have the No. 28 scoring defense (29.3 ppg allowed). The model projects the Commanders to cover the spread in 59% of simulations.Over 49.5 pointsIt was a rough start for the Ben Johnson era in Chicago with back-to-back losses to open the season, but their slow start wasn't due to offensive struggles. The Bears have scored more than 20 points in all four games, and are 11th in the NFL in scoring offense (25.3 ppg). The Chicago defense, however, has been one of the worst in the NFL, allowing 29.3 ppg. Three of four Bears games have gone Over their over/under this season, and two of the last three Washington games have also gone Over. Williams vs. Daniels as the top two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft is the storyline that will dominate the contest, and both quarterbacks and offenses will want to showcase the talent of their top pick from that draft. The model projects the Over to hit in 52% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

The Bills lost to the Patriots, 23-20, on Sunday Night Football last week for their first loss of the season. Still, Buffalo has the No. 3 scoring offense, averaging 30.6 ppg, on the most yards (395.8 per game) this season. The Bills have the No. 2 rushing offense (154.4 rushing yards per game) with running back James Cook averaging 90 rushing yards per game. Meanwhile, the Falcons are 24th in the NFL in yards per rush (4.6). The model projects the Bills to win in 78% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 68.55%, making this a valuable favorite to include with a pair of underdog picks in the model's Monday DraftKings parlay.Bears (+205) to defeat the CommandersChicago had an additional week to prepare for Washington while coming off a bye, and the model projects that to play to the Bears' advantage on Monday. After a slow start with two losses, largely due to defensive struggles with Chicago allowing 39.5 ppg over its first two contests, the Bears entered the bye week off back-to-back victories as the underdog in both contests. The Bears defeated the Cowboys, 31-14, in Week 3, followed by a 25-24 win over the Raiders. Chicago has the No. 10 scoring offense (25.3 ppg) this season. The model projects the Bears to win in 37% of simulations, however, with the implied odds of +205 signaling a 32.8% chance of victory, the model sees solid value in taking the shot of Chicago upsetting Washington.Brewers (+128) to defeat the DodgersThe Brewers are using the element of surprise to their advantage, not naming a Game 1 starter as of Monday morning, coming off their five-game series victory over the Cubs on Saturday. Milwaukee, which had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, knocked off the Cubs, 3-1, on Saturday to improve to 3-0 at home this postseason. The Brewers went 52-29 at home this season, and they will host the Dodgers on Monday. Regardless of who starts for the Brewers, they have the luxury of one of the top bullpens in baseball, ranking sixth in bullpen ERA (3.63) this season. The Brewers also had the No. 4 scoring offense (4.96 runs per game) this season. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday.Want more NFL picks for Monday Night Football and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

First, Tagovailoa detailed some of the Dolphins' locker room dysfunction after Miami dropped to 1-5 on the season following Los Angeles' game-winning field goal in the final minute.\"I think it starts with the leadership and helping articulate that for the guys, and then what we're expecting out of the guys,\" Tagovailoa said. \"We're expecting 'this.' Are we getting that? Are we not getting that? We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late, guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There's a lot that goes into that. \"Do we have to make this mandatory? Do we not have to make this mandatory? It's a lot of things of that nature that we've gotta get cleaned up, and it starts with the little things like that.\"Shortly after Tagovailoa's poignant remarks made the rounds, Hamilton — a practice squad player for the Dolphins during the 2022 season — took Miami's quarterback to task.\"This dude…the starting QB…was late to the first team meeting during my 3 seconds on the Dolphins  and everything was all cool in there,\" Hamilton wrote Sunday night.\nThe Dolphins reportedly held a players-only meeting after their Week 1 blowout loss to the Indianapolis Colts, with whatever was discussed falling on deaf ears. Miami started the season 0-3 before its lone win came at home on Monday Night Football against the winless New York Jets.\nTagovailoa calling out the team's leadership is a bit ironic when he's the franchise player. He tossed three interceptions in Sunday's loss, sending his QBR (50.1) to 21st in the NFL.This comes a week after the Dolphins squandered a 17-point lead on the road during a loss to the Carolina Panthers.\n\"There's just so many things that go into it,\" Tagovailoa said after that loss. \"And we've got to figure this out. And we've got to figure this out now. This feeling sucks.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Quarterback Caleb Williams was seen by many as a \"generational\" talent coming out of USC as the 2022 NFL Heisman Trophy winner, which was why the Chicago Bears selected him first overall in the 2024 NFL Draft.On Monday, Williams and the Bears (2-2) will face 2024 second overall pick quarterback Jayden Daniels, the 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year who helped lead his team to the NFC championship game, and the Washington Commanders (3-2) for the second time in their respective careers. That's why now is as good a time as ever to reflect on if the Bears chose the right quarterback with the first overall pick a year ago. Williams' Bears lost the first head-to-head meeting, 18-15, in Week 8 last season after Daniels hit wide receiver Noah Brown on a 52-yard Hail Mary pass as the clock hit zero. That play represented the longest game-winning, Hail Mary touchdown with time expiring in regulation since the 2015 season when Aaron Rodgers hit Green Bay Packers tight end Richard Rodgers for a 62-yard touchdown at the Detroit Lions for the \"Miracle in Motown.\" That Week 8 loss kickstarted two very different endings to the 2024 season: a 10-game losing streak for Chicago while Washington ended up as the NFC runner up. Fast forward to Week 6 of this season, let's take a look at how Williams, Daniels and 2024 third overall pick quarterback Drake Maye of the New England Patriots stack up thus far in their NFL careers. It's worth noting Williams' first offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired in the middle of a tumultuous 2024 season as was his first head coach Matt Eberflus. Jerod Mayo, Maye's first head coach in New England, was fired after a 4-13 campaign in 2024. \nCaleb Williams vs. Jayden Daniels vs. Drake Maye, CareersWilliams (CHI)Daniels (WAS)Maye (NE)W-L7-1414-67-11Comp Pct62.4%67.3%68.9%Pass Yards4,4684,2323,798Pass Yards/Attempt  6.57.37.3Pass TD-INT28-829-925-12Passer Rating89.798.996.5Rush Yards5991,015559Rush Yards/Carry5.75.86.2Rush TD163Total Turnovers (INT + Fumbles Lost) 13919This season, Maye ranks top 10 in the league in completion percentage (73.2%, second in the NFL entering \"Monday Night Football\"), passing yards (1,522, fifth in the NFL entering \"Monday Night Football\"  ), passing yards per attempt (8.5, fourth in the NFL entering \"Monday Night Football\") and passer rating (112.5, fourth in the NFL entering \"Monday Night Football\"). He also helped power his Patriots to one of the signature victories of the 2025 season, upsetting the then-undefeated, 4-0 Bills and 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen in Buffalo on \"Sunday Night Football\" 23-20 in Week 5. Maye has certainly benefitted from the additions of four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2025. Drake Maye This Season, NFL RanksNFL Ranks*Completion Percentage73.2%2ndPass Yards1,5225thPass Yards/Attempt8.54thPass TD10T-8thPasser Rating112.54thExpected Points Added (EPA)/Play0.1010th* Entering the two \"Monday Night Football\" games that will conclude Week 6, including Bears at CommandersEven though Daniels missed a couple games with a hamstring injury this season, he became the fastest player ever to throw for over 4,000 yards and rush for over 1,000 yards in a career, doing so in 20 games after crossing both thresholds in a Week 5 win at the Los Angeles Chargers. \nWilliams could very well make another leap or two the longer he works with new Bears head coach Ben Johnson, but early on, he's had the least notable career of the first three picks in the 2024 NFL Draft. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        UAB fired coach Trent Dilfer on Sunday, halfway through his third season. It took all of half an hour for a program legend to publicly throw his hat in the ring. Four-time NFL Pro Bowler Roddy White, who starred for the Blazers from 2001-04, said on social media that he wants the coaching position at his alma mater.White has no coaching experience, but he would not be the only former star player to jump into the industry out of the blue. This year alone, Michael Vick became a first-time head coach when he landed the Norfolk State job and DeShaun Jackson did the same at Delaware State. White could be the next in line to follow a path that Deion Sanders paved when he effectively broke the mold in 2020 at Jackson State.\"I want the job,\" White said in response to Dilfer's firing.Despite the gaps on his résumé, White could be a natural fit at UAB. He was a third-team All-American with the Blazers in 2004 and is a member of the university's Hall of Fame. White closed his college career with a massively successful 2004 season in which he racked up 71 catches for 1,452 yards and 14 touchdowns. His yardage led the nation, and the 14 scores were a Conference USA-best.\nWhite went on to enjoy a tremendous professional career. The former first-round pick led the NFL in receptions during the 2010 season and was later inducted into the Atlanta Falcons Ring of Honor after he spent the entirety of his 11-year career with the franchise. During his prime, he logged six consecutive seasons with at least 1,153 receiving yards.The UAB job is a historically tough one. The Blazers finished below .500 more often than not throughout their 28 years as an FBS program, and they have yet to crack the AP Top 25 rankings. Dilfer struggled in overseeing UAB's transition to the American Conference and went 9-21 overall and 5-14 in league play throughout his two and a half years at the helm.UAB does, however, have proven upside. Following a two-year period in which the Blazers did not field a football team, former coach Bill Clark led them to their best seasons in program history. Across a five year stretch from 2017-21, Clark won eight or more games all but once and guided UAB to an 11-3 record in 2018.\nThe next coach will be tasked with rekindling the momentum Clark built during the best span in UAB history. Prior to Dilfer's arrival, the Blazers strung together seven straight winning seasons -- an unprecedented run and one that indicated UAB has a potential program on the rise.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State made the biggest move thus far on the 2025 college football coaching carousel when it fired James Franklin on Sunday amid a stunning three-game losing streak. The Nittany Lions' change in leadership sent shockwaves through the sport, and a number of former Nittany Lions spoke up with a range of reactions, including Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons, program legend LaVar Arrington, and former quarterback Trace McSorley.  Franklin's shortcomings against elite competition and Penn State's consecutive losses this season to Big Ten bottom-dwellers created what the university deemed an untenable situation. But Parsons indicated that he did not fully agree with the program's decision. \nParsons was a 2019 consensus All-American under Franklin's tutelage and shined with the Nittany Lions as an eventual first-round NFL Draft pick. He played two seasons at Penn State and excelled in his lone year as a starter in helping the program reach 11 wins. That was one of six seasons with double-digit victories for Franklin. The 12-year Nittany Lions coach places his program at the forefront of college football as a mainstay in the Big Ten championship race and top 25 rankings. Each of Franklin's last 10 teams cracked the top eight of the AP Top 25 poll, and last year's squad set a program record with 13 wins en route to the College Football Playoff semifinals. \nThose achievements left a lasting impression on program legends like Arrington, who did not play for Franklin but watched closely as the Nittany Lions returned to the perennial heights that were the norm throughout the Joe Paterno era. \"Coach Franklin took on a daunting task when he became PSU's head guy,\" Arrington said on Instagram. \"He did a job that most wouldn't try or could do! I will be forever grateful for your service to our team and our program. I know your heart and I know you wanted the best for our team and our community. I wish you and your family well Coach. \"Life happens and sometimes we have hard things to endure,\" Arrington continued. \"Not everyone makes a difference along the way. You did and I'm grateful that We had you to guide us when times weren't so good. From getting through one of the biggest scandals in college sports history to 1 play away from being in the national championship a year ago.  You did well coach. Will always be here for you and always respect and love my guy!!! We Are!!!! We Are Better because of you!!\" \nIn the end, three consecutive losses, including two to UCLA and Northwestern, cost Franklin his job. Penn State carried national championship aspirations into this season after returning most of the top contributors from last year's College Football Playoff semifinal roster, and its sudden fall from the top of the title race to the bottom of the Big Ten standings was the last straw in a tenure that lacked signature wins. Franklin went just 4-21 against AP top-10 teams and closed his Penn State career with 15 consecutive losses to teams in the top six. Repeatedly falling short under the brightest of lights did not sit well with program greats like O.J. McDuffie, another icon of the Paterno era who earned consensus All-American honors and later led the NFL in receptions in 1998.\"There were so many things that you wondered what the hell was going on with this program,\" McDuffie said on SiriusXM College Sports Radio. \"It starts at the top. It really starts at the top. There's a lot of people invested in Penn State, and our AD, Dr. Pat Kraft, he had enough. He loves James Franklin. You know how tough it had to be on him to do that. But he had enough. And I think as alumni, we've had enough, as well. We talked about it a lot. I've got a lot of group texts with some buddies of mine that played at Penn State, and we're all very, very frustrated.\"\nDespite the unfortunate ending to his tenure, Franklin figures to land on his feet. His 104-45 record at Penn State, prior achievements at Vanderbilt and ability to stack playoff-contending seasons on top of each other should earn him a look at another prominent program before long.\"Coach, I really don't have words to express my gratitude,\" said former Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley, whom Franklin hired this year as an assistant quarterbacks coach. Together, McSorley and Franklin hit the 11-win mark twice and in 2016 won the Big Ten. \"You believed in me when others didn't,\" McSorley said. You pushed me to be the best player and man I could be. You were there for me at my highest and lowest points on and off the field. You showed me what hard work, dedication, loyalty, and leadership looks like. I wouldn't have wanted to play for anybody else in the world. It always starts with I love you and ends with I love you. Love you Coach!\" \nPenn State's coaching search may be the most prominent on the 2025 carousel. It is not every season that a job of this caliber comes open, and with the rich tradition and immense resources that come with the Nittany Lions position, the program could have its pick of some of the nation's most promising candidates. Nebraska's Matt Rhule and Indiana's Curt Cignetti are two of the numerous massive names to watch as the search begins. \n            ",

Our voters were already a little bit higher on the Hoosiers, positioning them a few spots above their AP Top 25 poll ranking, but the weekend's results also solidified the battle for No. 1 as being mostly between Ohio State (average ballot ranking of 1.7) and Miami (average ballot ranking of 1.9).Of course Oregon takes a fall from No. 3 to No. 8 after taking its first loss of the season, and Oklahoma fell after its upset loss at the hands of Texas as well. The Sooners were No. 7 going into the weekend in the CBS Sports 136 and now find themselves well outside the top 10 checking in at No. 15. \n\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Alabama becomes SEC frontrunner in College Football Playoff race, Indiana spikes\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course with plenty of movement up and down the rankings there will be changes that exceed the shuffling inside the top 15.

But it's also a team that deserves some re-evaluation now that the Wildcats are boasting a 4-2 record through the first half of the season. The rest of the schedule is daunting, but a bowl game is far more likely to be a possibility after taking down the Nittany Lions and sparking a coaching change in Happy Valley. No. 16 USC (+11): Prior to defeating Michigan 31-13 on Saturday night in the Coliseum, the best USC win from a rankings perspective was a choice between Michigan State or Purdue, two teams that have each gotten off to 0-3 starts in Big Ten play. The close loss at Illinois provides a good look at USC's worthiness for top 25 consideration, but without that high-end win it was tough for voters to move USC up compared to other one-loss teams. Now the real interesting piece moving forward is what happens next week, and in the next two games, as the Trojans take on the No. 17 (Notre Dame) and No. 25 (Nebraska) teams in the CBS Sports 136. No. 21 Texas (+11): No asterisk needed for this edition of the Red River Rivalry as the Longhorns took on a full strength Oklahoma team and wore them down over the course of 60 minutes. Prior to Saturday Texas was being knocked as a two-loss team without a power conference win, but now that this talented group has a high-quality win the Longhorns have a better hold in debates against other two-loss teams. No. 36 UNLV (+10): Dan Mullen's Rebels have been lurking in the CBS Sports 136 as they continue to pile up wins and now seems like the time we could see a big move up. UNLV improved to 6-0 over the weekend with a wild 51-48 win against Air Force, and up next is a road trip to Boise State that will test the team's top 40 bona fides. No. 32 Arizona State (-10): Every voter has their own right to make adjustments as they choose, but I'd like to think that our highly-educated experts are putting in some kind of rankings buffer for Arizona State not having star quarterback Sam Leavitt on Saturday night in Salt Lake City. The Sun Devils fell to 4-2 on the year with a 42-10 loss to Utah, and while falling out of the top 25 feels appropriate given the other options to move up the margin of defeat seems more tied to the injury issues than the team's quality. No. 39 TCU (-10): Among the more stunning results of Week 7 was TCU, a team that at one time figured to be among the top teams in the Big 12, getting rolled by a Kansas State team with a losing record. The 41-28 defeat to the Wildcats has dropped the Horned Frogs to just 1-2 in conference play and brought real doubt as to where this team stands among the top 40 teams in the country. No. 49 Penn State (-16): If you strip all of the context away and only look at the resume, Penn State might not even have a top-50 rankings profile. The team is 3-3 with its only two FBS wins coming against No. 114 FIU and No. 130 Nevada. Now Penn State has been just a few plays away from winning all three games, including the double-overtime defeat to top-10 Oregon, but the inability to close those games out (and the subsequent ones against UCLA and Northwestern) demands action when filling out a ballot. No. 44 Florida State (-17): Another situation of going from bad-to-worse, Florida State continues its tumble as the Seminoles lost their third straight game of the season, this time at home to Pitt. While Florida State peaked with a win against Alabama, an 0-3 start in ACC play has stripped away most of the shine from that memorable Saturday afternoon in Tallahassee.Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        DALLAS -- Casey Thompson has the unique perspective of playing for both Texas and Oklahoma in the Red River Rivalry during his six-year career. He tied the all-time record with five passing touchdowns in the game, though the Longhorns fell short after a miraculous comeback from Caleb Williams in 2021. It was on a touchdown pass during the rivalry game that Thompson's thumb hit an opposing helmet, causing significant ligament damage. He played through it for six weeks, and it continuously got worse. When he transferred to Nebraska, his brother -- former OU receiver Kendal Thompson -- recommended he get a second opinion. \"It was actually one of the greatest decisions of my life to see Dr. Shin,\" Thompson told CBS Sports. \"When I first saw the news that John (Mateer) was going to have surgery from him, I was really excited because I knew that was the best guy he could go to.\" Dr. Steven Shin has never played a down of football. According to a Wall Street Journal profile in 2020, he barely even pays attention to sports, unless one of his former patients is playing. With a patient list that includes Drew Brees, Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant, that's a wide group. Oklahoma City Thunder star Jalen Williams was also a patient, and sang Shin's praises. \nHowever, Shin became an overnight sports celebrity in the state of Oklahoma when it was revealed that he would be performing hand surgery on Sooners quarterback John Mateer. The initial timeline put out by Oklahoma indicated that recovery could take a month. But with Dr. Shin's magical touch? There was belief he could return for the Texas game, only 17 days after surgery, a radical timeline after surgery on a throwing hand. Fans made memes and edits featuring Shin holding a championship trophy, leading the Sooners out onto the field and wearing the golden hat handed out to the winner of the Red River Rivalry. The Oklahoma attorney general -- an actual elected official in the state -- gave a formal statement of commendation to Shin. Even Mateer and his coaches got in on the fun, throwing little nods to him on social media. \nDoctors formally gave Mateer the all clear on Thursday. He miraculously took the field for Oklahoma's first snap on Saturday. \n\"Everybody's body heals and responds differently,\" Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said. \"There's a pain piece to it, ability to grip the bill, all the things you've got to do [as a quarterback]. It was no surprise whatsoever. You all know who John is.\" But should Mateer have played? That question is a little more complicated. Playing SupermanThe Sooners invested heavily in Mateer over the offseason when he transferred from Washington State, making him one of the most highly-paid players in the country, according to 247Sports. Early on, the Little Elm, Texas, native has lived up to the hype. Heading into Week 7, Mateer ranked No. 2 nationally in total offense per game.With Mateer taking the place of 2024 struggling starters Michael Hawkins Jr. and Jackson Arnold, the Sooners mustered enough offense to capture wins over No. 15 Michigan and No. 22 Auburn. The Sooners jumped all the way to No. 5 in the AP Top 25, their best mark since 2023. The rest of the offense still has many of the same problems as 2024, but Mateer papers over them. \nAt its core, the fandom that built around a Los Angeles-based surgeon is driven by that understanding: Oklahoma without a healthy Mateer is not a serious contender. Physically, the legendary surgeon delivered. From the moment he came out for warmups, Mateer looked exceptional. He zipped the ball with ease, sporting only a small wrap on his thumb. On the first drive, Mateer hit Isaiah Sategna for a 23-yard pass and Deion Burks for an 18-yarder to set up a field goal. There was never a moment where Mateer appeared to be lagging, or where the ball wobbled out of his hand. He never fumbled or lost the ball via loose grip. There was one play where a snap appeared to hit his hand a little awkwardly and popped up, but he quickly clutched it without issue. Mateer later said that he felt zero pain during the game, and that he was satisfied with his practice time in the lead up. \nBut after the first few drives, Mateer started making costly mistakes against one of the best defenses in college football. There was an interception to Malik Muhammad where Mateer simply failed to recognize zone coverage. He forced a throw to the end zone at the end of the half, resulting in a second interception to Muhammad instead of a field goal. \"I was ready to go physically, but mentally, I just didn't perform,\" Mateer said. \"My eyes weren't as good as they needed to be. As a quarterback, if you don't play good football, then it's hard to win in this league.\" To his credit, Texas also started causing major issues with its pass rush. All-American edge rusher Colin Simmons led an effort that sacked Mateer five times. Prior, the Sooners had allowed only eight sacks all season. \nWith Mateer just half a step behind his usual brilliance, Oklahoma revealed just how lost the rest of the offense remains. Mateer's number was called on 52 of the Sooners' 69 plays. On the 17 others, Oklahoma sputtered to only 41 yards. The program averaged 1.6 yards per carry and created few opportunities after the catch. While the injury did not slow Mateer down, fatigue did seem to set in after not consistently throwing a football for two weeks. He finished the game hitting only seven of his final 18 pass attempts. The Sooners were never a serious threat to get into the end zone. There was no Plan B on offense. It was Mateer or nothing. \"I'm glad the quarterback played,\" Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. \"John Mateer is a heck of a player, but I didn't want to come up here and have to answer, well what if he would have played?\" \n\n        \n            \n                Arch Manning's Red River debut: No fireworks, but plenty of clutch first downs in win over No. 6 Oklahoma\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy OU had no choiceMateer's decision to get his hand surgically repaired comes with short-term consequences, but the long-term benefits could be significant. The injury is fixed. He will improve over the course of the season instead of continuing to aggravate it. The ex-QB Thompson, who suffered more complex ligament damage, was initially advised to rehab the injury. However, surgery was framed as a more complete solution. \"It felt better right after the surgery and then every week following,\" Thompson said. \"I knew that it was the right decision.\" \nShin did impeccable work, as always. But though Thompson's hand was structurally ready to go quickly, there are still plenty of complications that come with hand surgery. There were periods of numbness, which are normal. Thompson did not get his stitches out for 14 days. Oklahoma QB John Mateer had to wear a wrap on his right hand after surgery only 17 days earlier.   \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Mateer declined to get into the details of the sensations in his hand during the game, only confirming that he was pain free. But with such a short timeline, there's an understanding that there will be a few adjustments, even in simply returning to repeated activity. The hand is a wildly complex system. There's a case that Mateer should have just sat out and waited a little longer to get fully back to normal. The Sooners could simply write off a loss to Texas as being with the backup quarterback. The College Football Playoff committee would take that under consideration. As long as the Sooners split the Texas and South Carolina games, there would be plenty left to play for in the final weeks. \nThat said, Oklahoma travels to face the Gamecocks on Saturday. Afterwards, the Sooners have five straight games against AP top 16 opponents to close the year. Both of Oklahoma's ranked victories came against teams no longer in the top 25.To stay alive in the national and SEC title conversations, there was no quality loss that would satiate matters. Oklahoma had to beat Texas. And with the high-pressure money involved in this era, Oklahoma cannot afford to have its biggest investment -- in the literal monetary sense -- sitting on the bench.The Sooners came into the Red River Rivalry ranked No. 6 in the nation. After the 23-6 loss, they dropped all the way to No. 14. According to FanDuel, Oklahoma is now only 19-to-1 to win the SEC, compared to 7.5-to-1 for Texas. The Sooners had a chance to put a final nail in the Longhorns; instead, they gave them new life. \n\"How you respond is the mark of a true competitor,\" Venables said. \"I think you really find out about people when things aren't going well. And I've got incredible faith and belief and confidence in every one of those guys. We know who these guys are and we know they'll respond the right way.\" In just 17 days, Dr. Shin and Mateer delivered a miracle of modern medicine. With all the flaws dragging down the rest of the roster, even that may not be enough. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the 2025 NFL trade deadline set for Tuesday, Nov. 4, every new deal from here on out will shape the playoff chase or accelerate a rebuild. Already we've seen the Cincinnati Bengals turn to Joe Flacco in an effort to stabilize their quarterback room, and that's just the start of what figures to be a busy few weeks. Expect fringe contenders like the Steelers and Buccaneers to explore upgrades, while teams stuck near the bottom, such as the Jets and Saints, weigh offers for veterans who could bring back draft capital.To help you track all the NFL trade deals ahead of the deadline, we'll be logging every move in one place with concise analysis highlighting who got better, who got future assets, and what it means for the season ahead. Whether it's a blockbuster involving a former Pro Bowler or a depth move that fills a key injury gap, this page will be your running guide through deadline season.Jaguars, Browns swap cornerbacks (10/9)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jags get: Greg Newsome, sixth-round pickLanky corner in final year of rookie dealThis is a win-now move. Jacksonville gets a solid cornerback in Newsome, who has graded out well this year, allowing just a 52% completion rate as the primary defender, on track to be the best of his career. Through five Weeks, he's Pro Football Focus' 33rd-ranked cornerback out of 85 who have played at least 150 defensive snaps; Campbell is 57th.Newsome is in the fifth and final year of his rookie deal, so he's set to be a free agent at the end of this season. There's a significant scheme adjustment here, too, as the Browns play the highest rate of man coverage in the league by far, while Jacksonville is 23rd, but clearly the Jaguars see plenty to like in Newsome. Jacksonville does take on a $19.5-million dead cap hit in 2026, but that's a problem for a few months from now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Tyson Campbell, seventh-round pickSolid starter getting a fresh startThis is a depth improvement for Cleveland. Campbell had a strong 2024 season after signing a four-year, $76.5 million extension, but the new Jaguars regime clearly wanted to move on from him after a slow start to this season. A significant chunk of that deal has already been paid, meaning the Browns will get to look at Campbell for nearly an entire season and evaluate how he fits both now and in the future. Campbell has had some injury issues, but when he's healthy, he's a starting-caliber cornerback, and one who's under team control well into the future.Harbaughs do defensive business (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chargers get: Odafe Oweh, seventh-round pickAthletic but inconsistent edge rusherThis is a win-now move for Los Angeles. Oweh broke out last season with 10 sacks in 2024  -- double his previous career high – but the 2021 first-round pick is yet to record a sack this season. His pressure rate this season – 10.3% – is slightly lower than his 11.7% last year, but neither are particularly impressive numbers; he was at 17.2% in 2023.\nPerhaps time had simply run its course for Oweh in Baltimore. He was playing on the fifth-year option  of his rookie deal and will be a free agent this offseason. In Los Angeles, he'll play under innovative defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and hope to provide pressure both before and after Khalil Mack returns from an elbow injury. Through five weeks, Los Angeles ranks 19th in pressure rate.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ravens get: Alohi Gilman, fifth-round pickReliable safety, plus a better draft pickI see this as a dart throw. Things have already gone majorly off the rails for Baltimore (1-4), and trading away a former first-round pick certainly wasn't on the Bingo card one month ago. But Baltimore has better depth and youth on the edge than it does at safety, where ArDarius Washington tore his Achilles during the offseason and Kyle Hamilton has been dealing with a groin injury. That left undrafted rookie Reuben Lowery to play every defensive snap of a 44-10 Week 5 loss to the Texans.Flacco gets new job, stays in Ohio (10/7)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bengals get: Joe Flacco, sixth-round pickAging pocket passer hoping to raise the floorSometimes, the NFL is about optics, and the Bengals trailing 28-3 at halftime and Jake Browning getting booed off the field after his third interception in an eventual 37-24 loss to the Lions in Week 4 was bad, bad optics. Enter Flacco, whom Cleveland benched after Week 4. Through five weeks, Browning was dead last in expected points added per dropback. Flacco was third-worst.\nThe Bengals are hoping Flacco can provide a similar boost to the one he provided Cleveland in 2023, when it ended up making the playoffs thanks to a late-season surge. The Bengals don't have near the defense the Browns do, and the offensive line is a mess, but for a cheap price, it's a move that makes sense. If Flacco recaptures the magic, great. If he doesn't, this season was probably lost the moment Joe Burrow got hurt anyway. It's a total dart throw. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Browns get: Fifth-round pickA modest gain in draft positionFlacco was no longer part of the plan in Cleveland, which moves up a round in the draft. That's solid business for a team that's had its eye on the future essentially since this season began.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State is embarking one of the most fascinating coaching searches of the past few years after paying coach James Franklin more than $50 million in buyout money for the right to fire him. However, there's some belief around college football that the Nittany Lions already have their target: Matt Rhule.  Rhule attended State College Area High School, then walked on to Penn State as linebacker under legendary coach Joe Paterno and has never been shy about his love for the program. His first coaching job was as a volunteer assistant with the Nittany Lions in 1998, and he often cites lessons that he learned while part of the program.  Of course, Rhule is at Nebraska now -- a similarly historic program. After leading the program to a 5-1 start and national AP Top 25 program, he could easily decide to keep building in Lincoln, where he makes over $8 million annually. Rhlue would owe Nebraska $5 million if he left any time before Dec. 31, according to his contract. As far as Penn State's decision-making is concerned, would Rhule be enough of an upgrade to make the exorbitant expenditure worth it if -- after already paying the second-biggest buyout in college football history? \nCBS Sports writers Shehan Jeyarajah and Cody Nagel work through the pros and cons of Penn State targeting Rhule for the new top opening on the market.   Pro: Rhule is a program builder Rhule has a career 64-57 record as a head coach, but don't let the top line distract you. He's taken over some of the toughest situations in college football. Rhule started his head coaching career at Temple, and led the program to only the second conference title in program history. Then, he entered the smoldering crater left at Baylor by the Art Briles scandal and took them from 1-11 to 11-3 in only three years.  Nebraska has been a unique build after taking over for Scott Frost. But after reaching a bowl game last season, the Cornhuskers are within striking distance of their first eight-win season since 2016. There are few shortcuts taken in a Rhule rebuild, but the program emerges structurally stronger and more competitive.  \nAn underrated part of the equation? Two former Rhule assistants have become head coaches -- Fran Brown (Syracuse) and Joey McGuire (Texas Tech). Both are upfront about how much they learned from Rhule. The success of his process has been stress-tested across the country. --Jeyarajah  Con: Penn State doesn't need a rebuild The Nittany Lions should be approaching this hiring process in search of a candidate who can win now -- someone who can take over a program that isn't broken but just needs the right push to get over the hump. Rhule doesn't necessarily fit that profile. Penn State doesn't need a savior; it needs a finisher. Let's not forget this program was minutes away from playing for a national championship last season. It isn't the kind of rebuild Rhule has walked into before. If he arrives and starts reshaping things to fit his long-term blueprint, as he's done everywhere else, what happens if it doesn't immediately click? Does Penn State really have the patience for a step backward just as the door to the College Football Playoff is finally open? \nRhule's process is proven to work over time, but time is the one thing Penn State doesn't have. Someone like Indiana's Curt Cignetti -- a 'win-now' type -- feels far more aligned with the program's moment. -- Nagel  Pro: Few understand Penn State better In the past several years, Rhule has moved all around the country for coaching jobs, from Texas to North Carolina to Nebraska. But in his heart, Rhule is a Northeasterner. He grew up in New York City and spent many of his most formative moments in State College, Philadelphia and the Meadowlands.  \n        \n            \n                Penn State coaching candidates: Matt Rhule, Curt Cignetti among options on hot board to replace James Franklin\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf he stepped into Penn State, he would quickly be able to win over the most important people and figures in the base. Athletic director Pat Kraft, amazingly, was the AD who hired him at Temple. Rhule also excels at rallying the troops, which will be an important job for the next coach after the Franklin era ended with a thud. It will also be critical for squeezing every dollar out of Central Pennsylvania to use towards winning at the highest level. \nAdditionally, Rhule's newfound national background could actually present a huge benefit. Penn State needs to nationalize its recruiting infrastructure to contend with the Ohio States of the world. Rhule is wildly popular in Texas, and has spent enough time recruiting out West and South that he can go almost anywhere. --Jeyarajah  Con: Penn State might not be the best fit for Rhule Sure, Nebraska has expectations -- a fanbase desperate to return to national relevance and decades of nostalgia for the Tom Osborne era -- but the pressure at Penn State is an entirely different animal. If Rhule thinks the noise on the farmlands of Nebraska can get loud, wait until he loses a few games in the echoing chambers of Happy Valley.  Rhule's proven he can rebuild struggling programs, but Penn State isn't looking for that -- it's looking for championships. The standard isn't 'get us back,' it's 'get us past Michigan, Ohio State and also Oregon.' That's a different kind of heat than Rhule has ever faced. At Nebraska, patience has long been the mantra; at Penn State, patience lasts about one bad Saturday. -- Nagel \n Pro: Elite resources could unlock another gear In 2024, Nebraska decided to laser in on five-star quarterback Dylan Raiola. The son of legendary 'Huskers offensive lineman Dominic Raiola, the staff refused to let Dylan get away without a fight. Rhule put the full-court press on the star quarterback and managed to flip him from Georgia, giving Nebraska its biggest recruiting win of the modern era.  Rhule is a relentless and organized recruiter who has correctly identified several NFL prospects out of the rough. Now imagine if he had the budget to land five-stars, too.  Nebraska has been fighting to up its figures over the past few years and the recruiting has increased as a result. Rhule has consistently signed classes bordering on the top 20. However, Penn State is well into the blue-chip ratio. It's always hard to be sure how well a coach will translate into a different context, but it would be fascinating to see Rhule compete with top 10 resources instead of top 25. --Jeyarajah \n Con: Rhule isn't known to punch up Let's be serious -- if Penn State's goal in moving on from James Franklin is to finally punch through against college football's elite, Rhule's résumé doesn't inspire much confidence. Franklin's critics are fair: he was 15-31 against AP Top 25 opponents, 4-21 versus the AP Top 10 and 4-17 against Michigan and Ohio State. But Rhule's numbers are even more concerning.  Across Temple, Baylor and Nebraska, he's just 2-23 against ranked opponents and 0-11 versus the Top 10. That's not a coach who's proven he can win when the lights are brightest. Penn State's problem has been getting over the hump, not rebuilding from scratch, and Rhule hasn't shown he can deliver those breakthrough wins that define national contenders. To be fair, Rhule's teams have almost always been underdogs in those situations -- he's been favored just twice in 18 games against AP Top 25 opponents at Baylor and Nebraska, but he's covered the spread in just eight of those games. -- Nagel \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    If you want all of the latest Penn State coaching search news and info, there's no better place than Lions247.  It's the most trusted source for intel on the Nittany Lions and has the largest and most dedicated community of Penn State fans.

    "body": "\n        The National League Championship Series gets underway Monday night with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers embarking on a seven-game set to see who will represent the Senior Circuit in this year's World Series. The Dodgers reached this point after knocking off the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies; the Brewers after downing the Chicago Cubs.One of the biggest challenges facing the Brewers is containing two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani. That's no small task considering Ohtani is weeks away from claiming yet another MVP award following a regular season that saw him bat .282/.392/.622 (179 OPS+) with a career-high 55 home runs, 102 runs batted in, and 20 stolen bases. His contributions as the Dodgers' DH and leadoff man alone were worth 6.6 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference.\nYet, for as brilliant as Ohtani was throughout the year, he was largely a nonfactor against the Phillies. Indeed, across those four games, he went 1 for 18 with nine strikeouts and zero extra-base hits. He walked only twice, with one of those being of the intentional variety. The Phillies did not win the war against the Dodgers, but they did win the battle by hampering Ohtani.Just how did the Phillies do it, and is there anything Brewers can copy for the NLCS? Let's find out.\n1. Were the results earned?If you've read my analysis with regularity over the years, you've seen me stress the difference between a descriptive and a predictive statistic. On its own, Ohtani's batting line during the NLDS is a descriptive statistic. It's what happened: he recorded one hit in 18 at-bats. In terms of predictive power, though, the above information is too limited to draw conclusions from. Watch baseball for any length of time, and you'll see hot streaks that are fueled by squibbers and bleeders, as well as slumps that persist despite the batter squaring up ball after ball. Were you selecting one of those two to employ for the next year, you would almost always take the second player. Why? Because, despite the short-term results, you know that making authoritative contact on a regular basis tends to yield good results over the long haul. (It should but will not go without noting that I am generalizing here. There are good hitters who are weak-contact merchants.)So, with that in mind: did Ohtani \"earn\" his bad results? Mostly yes.SplitWhiff rate%Exit velocity10-30 degree%xBAxwOBANLDS39.4%92.2 mph0%.100.150Regular season33.4%94.9 mph31.2%.257.392Ohtani, to his credit, still hit the ball hard when he connected. His average exit velocity during the NLDS was 92.2 mph, above the league average albeit below his seasonal norm (94.9 mph). Yet there were some clear reasons that he failed to generate offense during the NLDS. For starters, Ohtani's whiff rate swelled to 39.4%, which would've been the highest among qualifiers during the regular season … by more than four percentage points. Additionally, Ohtani may have made hard contact during the NLDS, but it wasn't particularly good contact. By that I mean he was too prone to either beating the ball into the ground or hitting it up in the air. To wit, more than 31% of Ohtani's batted balls during the regular season were launched between 10 and 30 degrees -- that being the ideal trajectory range for a batter. Do you want to guess how many of Ohtani's nine batted balls during the NLDS were hit in that window? The answer is none. Comparatively, three of Ohtani's batted balls had launch angles higher than 50 degrees, and another three had launch angles below minus-14 degrees.TruMedia tracks \"expected\" numbers based solely on each batted ball's exit velocity and launch angle. The measure is imperfect. It doesn't take into account spray angle (i.e. to which field it was hit), ballpark, or anything else. Just exit velocity and launch angle. Anyway, Ohtani's \"expected\" slash line from the NLDS was .100/.190/.181. This wasn't a case of bad luck. He just didn't play well.2. How did Phillies pitch Ohtani?Having established that Ohtani did indeed struggle during the NLDS, it's only fair to ask: is there anything that the Brewers can borrow from the Phillies' approach? I think the answer is \"maybe.\" I noticed a few trends when I reviewed how the Phillies pitched to Ohtani. Foremost, they worked down in the zone a lot more than he's accustomed to seeing. During the regular season, 59.5% of his pitches were located in the lower half of the strike zone. Against the Phillies? That percentage spiked to 74.6%. What's more is that the Phillies were also more aggressive working him on the inside corner, placing seven more pitches there per 100 offerings than what he faced during the regular season.One of the tricky aspects of analyzing how a team attacks a player is divining whether it's because of a perceived strategic edge or simply because of their personnel; is it design or necessity? There was probably a little of both at play here.The strategic element extended to who the Phillies used against Ohtani. Again, he received 20 plate appearances throughout the series. He faced a left-hander in 16 of those. In three of those four other trips to the dish, Ohtani faced closer Jhoan Duran, who may as well be a lefty given his career reverse splits. It's clear that the Phillies wanted to possess the platoon advantage almost every time he batted.As for the necessity part, consider who those lefties were: Cristopher Sánchez, Jesús Luzardo, Matt Strahm, and Tanner Banks. What do they usually throw when they're facing a lefty batter? Take a look:PitcherTop pitch vs. LHBSecondary pitch vs. LHBSánchezSinkerSliderLuzardoSweeperSinkerStrahmSliderSinkerBanksSweeperSinkerAs you can see, all four Phillies lefties throw a sinker and a slider variation as either their top or secondary pitch versus lefties. Where are most left-on-left sinkers located? Down and/or in, the exact areas where Ohtani was flooded during the series. Did the Phillies see something in the data or in Ohtani's video that caused them to pursue that spot, or did they simply have their pitchers do what they do when they're facing a left-handed batter? It almost doesn't matter. It worked regardless.The question, then, is can the Brewers replicate that approach -- that is, spamming Ohtani with left-handed sinkerballers?In my estimation, Milwaukee has the personnel to do it. The Brewers had three different left-handed pitchers who threw more than 50% sinkers to same-handed batters: Jared Koenig, Aaron Ashby, and Jose Quintana. (They also have Robert Gasser, who checked in around 30% sinkers.) During the NLDS, the Brewers started Freddy Peralta twice and Quinn Priester once, and filled in the gaps by deploying Ashby and another reliever as openers. It wouldn't be much of a departure, then, if manager Pat Murphy and the front office formulated a gameplan where Ohtani is either facing Peralta, a high-leverage reliever like Abner Uribe or Trevor Megill, or one of those aforementioned lefties.Of course, even if the Brewers could run the exact same playbook as the Phillies, there are no guarantees that it would work as well. Remember that bit earlier about descriptive and predictive statistics? You have to remember that the players can influence matters by making adjustments of their own. Ohtani himself played some role in his struggles. He was more aggressive than usual, and it's clear that his timing was off based on some of his aforementioned measures. You needn't take my word for it, either.\n\"I think a lot of it is driven by the left-handed pitching. Even with that, he wasn't as bad in the regular season as he was in the postseason against those guys. Certainly whatever opponent we're going to face, they're going to put as many lefties on Shohei, but we're hoping that he can do a little self-reflecting on that series and how aggressive he was outside of the strike zone and passive in the zone,\" manager Dave Roberts told reporters Saturday. \"The at-bat quality needs to get better. Hopefully with the hitting guys, learning from that past series and getting better. We're going to need him to be better.\"The team, Roberts said, is looking to Ohtani to \"recalibrate,\" much as he did before the 2024 NLCS.\n\"We're not going to win the World Series with that sort of performance,\" Roberts said.Will Ohtani return to his usual form in the NLCS, or will the Brewers be able to keep him locked down? That question will go a long way in determining which team proceeds to the World Series.\n            ",

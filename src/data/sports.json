    "body": "\nReal Madrid target three wins out of three in the UEFA Champions League, hosting Juventus on Wednesday as Matchday 3 action rolls on.Xabi Alonso's side are off to a near-perfect start to the season with just one defeat across all competitions and are expected to continue in that trajectory, hopes high that they will notch another routine win before Sunday's Clasico. Alonso has reimagined Los Blancos as a more restrained but efficient team in his first season in charge, though the showstopping moments have almost been reserved for one person entirely – Kylian Mbappe. He has been the focal point of Alonso's tactical rebuild with 16 goals in 14 games across all competitions, backed up by a rotating cast of attacking characters. He is expected to be the star of the show against Juventus but who will join him is a big question; Alonso has opted to rotate through his options, at times leaving Vinicius Junior to start games on the bench.Juventus, meanwhile, are in the midst of an up-and-down season and are winless in their last six. The task of looking for their first Champions League win of the season, then, might just be an uphill battle against an in-form Real Madrid.Here's what you need to know before tuning in.How to watch Real Madrid vs. Juventus, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Santiago Bernabeu Stadium -- Madrid, SpainLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Real Madrid -230; Draw +370; Juventus +600Projected lineupsReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Federico Valverde, Raul Asencio, Eder Militao, Alvaro Carreras, Arda Guler, Aurelien Tchouameni, Jude Bellingham, Franco Mastantuono, Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius JuniorJuventus: Michele Di Gregorio, Federico Gatti, Daniele Rugani, Lloyd Kelly, Pierre Kalulu, Weston McKennie, Teun Koopmeiners, Andrea Cambiaso, Kenan Yildiz, Jonathan David, Francisco ConceicaoPredictionThis match is Real Madrid's to lose and there is little reason to believe they will. Mbappe is firing on all cylinders, taking nicely to his new role as the go-to player up top, and Alonso has a wide range of attackers at his disposal to support the France international. No matter the combination of players on the field, expect Los Blancos to show their full might against an inconsistent Juventus and extend their perfect start to Champions League play this season.

    "body": "\n        Luka Dončić stuffed the stat sheet to the tune of 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block on Tuesday, and his Lakers still lost to the Warriors, 119-109, on opening night as Dončić finished as a minus-eight for the game.Putting up numbers like that and still losing is deliciously ripe for overreaction in Lakers land. So let's do it! And let's start with the fact that J.J. Redick had to play Dončić 40 minutes, which is not ideal in any regular-season game -- let alone on opening night -- in a league obsessed with load managing its stars' mileage. Such is life without LeBron James, who's out until at least mid-November as he deals with this sciatica situation and the Lakers simply don't have much else to turn to on a nightly basis. Yes, Austin Reaves went for 26, but that's also a lot to ask of him every night. And even if he does, against the good teams, two guys is not enough. Bottom line: You simply cannot rely on two dudes combining for 69 points, 18 assists and 17 rebounds while logging a combined 76 minutes, especially if you're still losing the game. Those are not sustainable numbers through any lens. \nBeyond that, there's no sense in regurgitating the box score from one game. No doubt the Lakers will get more from the likes of Rui Hachimura and hopefully Gabe Vincent and Deandre Ayton, the latter of whom Lakers fans have spent the summer convincing themselves can suddenly become a player he hasn't been in a half decade. Nevertheless, as one-game evals go, Dončić   having to go hero mode for 40 minutes just to stay within striking distance is kind of a poisonous recipe. Will Redick back off his minutes? Can he afford to until LeBron returns? \"Every game is different,\" Redick said of Dončić's workload against the Warriors. \"I'm not concerned about that.\"\nRedick is right. Every game is different. Which is why Luka can't be expected to produce at this level every night. And he won't have to as soon as LeBron gets back, right? That's interesting. At some point LeBron is not going to be, you know, LeBron. Honestly, can the Lakers even depend on James to pop right back into All-NBA mode at almost 41 years old and already ailing? Truth is, even when LeBron comes back, he simply can't be expected to play more than 50 games at this stage. Maybe he will. It's surely possible. But if you're planning realistically, you have to be prepared to be without him for a decent amount of time, and the initial returns on his absence weren't great. The upside, of course, is Luka was great. He only made two of his 10 3-pointers, but he was in do-everything mode and, as usual, getting to any spot he wanted on the floor as he registered the highest scoring output in a season opener for any Lakers player since Kobe Bryant put 45 on the Rockets to begin the 2007-08 campaign. \nIf Dončić is going to make a run at his first MVP, his case is going to have to start being built in these early non-LeBron games as he aims to keep the Lakers afloat. It's almost a guarantee he's going to put up massive stats, but can enough of the supporting staff step up their game to make it matter? Can Redick avoid the temptation to run Dončić into the ground? If it gets desperate enough, he might have to. Right now, obviously nothing is desperate. It's one game against a very good Warriors team, who were operating close to full strength (Moses Moody and De'Anthony Melton were out). But it was a glimpse into life without LeBron, and despite how well Dončić played, it wasn't such a pretty picture for the Lakers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- It's not hyperbole that the Golden State Warriors' offseason quite literally revolved around Jonathan Kuminga. So much so, the organization didn't even have enough players on their active roster to run a five-on-five scrimmage until they figured out which direction they wanted to take with Kuminga.Sure, the Warriors had commitments from veterans such as Al Horford, Gary Payton II and De'Anthony Melton lined up, but that didn't matter. Golden State couldn't move forward without figuring out what to do with its 23-year-old restricted free agent forward. After all the dust settled, Golden State ended up being the last team in the association to add a newcomer either via free agency or on the trade market.Waiting to decide on Kuminga's future until just weeks before their season-opener on Tuesday against the Los Angeles Lakers was no doubt a risk. However, the Warriors' thinking -- and almost no-brainer decision to bring Kuminga back and kick the can down the road -- appears to be the right one. Kuminga finished with 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 33 minutes during the Warriors' 119-109 win over the Lakers and showed why the best version of Golden State revolves around him being at his best.\"He has really matured,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"We have had some really good conversations. He has a better understanding. ... I think he just has a better sense of what is needed now compared to past years. I think Jimmy (Butler) has really helped him, too.\"\nPart of why Kuminga is still the biggest unknown on this roster is that there are flashes -- like Tuesday -- that prove he should be a crucial cog in the long-term plan. But, at the same time, the reason there have been question marks -- and why he signed a two-year, $48 million deal to return -- is that there have been perplexing stretches during his career that could lead to an inevitable divorce down the line.Kuminga wants to be featured. It's why the pitch from the Sacramento Kings -- who were reportedly interested in him this summer -- might have been enticing to his camp. Had Kuminga been traded this summer, he could have been a full-time starter in a low-stakes environment. That obviously didn't happen, but the Warriors could still hypothetically trade him starting on Jan. 15.For now, Kuminga is a Warrior. And they both need this partnership to work -- for however long it may end up lasting -- to chase a fifth title for this core. Kuminga might be the biggest X-Factor on the team outside of the obvious \"Big Three\" of Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, simply because of his unique blend of size and athleticism.\nKuminga didn't shoot well in the first half of the opener, but he added value by creating second-chance opportunities and being disruptive on the defensive end. He also had the toughest assignment on the floor by getting matched up with Lakers star Luka Dončić in extended stretches.\"For him, it hasn't been easy to find minutes on our team,\" Kerr said. \"I'm really proud of him for staying with it and really maturing. It's a great start for him and a great start for us.\"Kuminga has shown what he can do in a high-stakes environment such as last season's playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played 27.4 minutes and averaged 20.8 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists during the five-game series. But before that, he was getting DNPs during the home stretch of the regular season. The hamstring injury to Curry in the playoffs against Minnesota forced Kuminga into a more prominent role -- which he capitalized on -- that left more questions than answers.\nWhy can't Kuminga be like that on a more consistent basis? It's quite literally a multi-million dollar question.The reality of how the Warriors built their roster is that there will be games when Curry, Butler, Green and Horford need to rest. Kerr already said this month that Horford won't be playing in back-to-backs this season and because Golden State has 15 back-to-backs, there could be plenty of opportunities for Kuminga to thrive in a featured role.Kuminga remains the biggest mystery on the Warriors roster. In fact, a performance like Tuesday's begs the question of how he ended up out of Golden State's rotation in the first place. \nAt the same time, he needs to be at his best to justify the chaos Golden State went through this offseason. If this was a preview of what this season could be, the Warriors will be vindicated in playing the long game because Kuminga appears to be bought into the vision of what the franchise hopes to accomplish.\"When you ask for opportunity, you must deliver,\" Green said after Tuesday's win. \"I think he has been very vocal about his opportunity and he delivered. When you see a guy who's willing to put his neck on the line and be vocal, and they deliver, you must reward them.\"\n            ",

McAtamney missed three extra points in a two-week period, with the third and final miss helping seal the Giants' doom after blowing a 25-8 lead in the final minutes of Sunday's loss in Denver.McAtamney, a second-year pro from Northern Ireland who was an undrafted free agent out of Rutgers, joined the Giants via the NFL's International Pathway program and was thrust into kicking duties in Week 4 after veteran Graham Gano injured his groin pre-game against the Kansas City Chiefs. McAtamney made two short field goals in his first action against the Chargers and made two extra points a week later. He missed an extra point in Week 6 against the Philadelphia Eagles before completely falling apart against the Broncos.\n        \n            \n                Broncos set two NFL records in stunning comeback win over Giants: How Denver rewrote the record book\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter missing an extra point early in the game, McAtamney missed again after quarterback Jaxson Dart scored a go-ahead touchdown with 37 seconds left, leaving the score 32-30 and giving the Broncos the opportunity to kick a game-winning field goal instead of having to settle for tying the game. McAtamney's kicks also influenced the loss in other ways, as his lack of range prompted the Giants to pass up on field goal attempts, and his extra point miss prompted the Giants to try a failed two-point conversion when going up 19-0 late in the third quarter.\nMcAtamney's release comes as Gano is now eligible to come off Injured Reserve, with the New York Post reporting that Gano will kick on Tuesday to determine if he is ready to return to playing. The Giants also have Younghoe Koo, who was cut by the Atlanta Falcons after missing kicks early in the season, on their practice squad.Gano, a former Pro Bowl kicker who was among the best in the league in his first several years with the Giants, has struggled with injuries since the 2023 season and has missed 20 of a possible 41 games in that stretch.\nThe Giants fell to 2-5 with the loss to the Broncos and will look to rebound on the road against the Eagles on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're now more than a third of the way through the NFL's 2025 season, which means we have a ton of information about what these teams are and where they might be going. We're obviously going to get a lot more the rest of the way, and things could change pretty drastically in just a few weeks, but there is plenty to glean from.That allows us to make some educated guesses about which teams are good and bad, contenders versus pretenders and preparing for the draft or thinking about the Super Bowl. As such, we're putting all 32 NFL teams into tiers based on where they stand after seven weeks.We're putting the league into four buckets: the inner and outer circles of contenders, fringe playoff teams and draft preparations. Those tiers are below with the teams in them listed alphabetically.Tier 4: Draft preparationsBrowns, Cardinals, Dolphins, Giants, Jets, Raiders, Saints, TitansSome of these teams are better than others, but they all have records of 2-5 or worse -- especially in the NFC with 12 of 16 having records of .500 or better. If you're 2-5, your season is probably not going anywhere.\nThis applies to the Cardinals and Giants, who seem like they might be a tier above the rest of this group but have records that put them in the same category. They'd need to rip seven or nine wins the rest of the way just to make a run at the playoffs, and that's probably not happening.Others like the Dolphins, Saints and Titans only have one win seven weeks into the season while the Jets are winless. They're all, pretty clearly, done for and playing out the string.Tier 3: The fringeBears, Bengals, Broncos, Chargers, Commanders, Cowboys, Falcons, Jaguars, Panthers, Ravens, Steelers, Texans, VikingsThis 13-team bucket is the largest tier by far, comprising almost half the league. It's full of OK teams with some major flaws that likely prevent them from being true contenders. They're not quite getting ready for the draft just yet but also shouldn't be selling playoff tickets and definitely shouldn't be making hotel reservations in the Bay Area for Super Bowl LX.\nThe Bears have won four in a row and their run game suddenly looks quite dangerous, but Chicago's defense has been suspect for much of the season. The Bengals are quarterbacked by Joe Flacco and their defense is highly flammable.The Broncos have a great defense, but it just got torn apart by the Giants, and the Bo Nix-led offense has been extremely inconsistent. The Chargers' injury issues are threatening to tank yet another season.The Commanders are 3-4 while Jayden Daniels deals with an injury for the second time this year and their upcoming schedule is daunting. Dallas might have the league's best offense and worst defense.\nThe Falcons can run the ball and have a defense that is playing great, but the passing attack comes and goes, which just doesn't work in the modern NFL. The Jags look like they were entirely too dependent on those early season turnovers that they kept forcing.The Panthers have beaten up on a soft defensive schedule with a trio of one-score wins that don't look indicative of the rest of their season. The Ravens are 1-5 and only here because of all their injuries and the fact that the AFC North is just not good.If the Steelers hadn't lost to the Bengals this past week, they might be in the tier above this. But they get the Packers, Colts and Chargers in their next three games and -- one way or another -- things could look much different for them soon.\nThe Texans lost three one-score games to start the year and then blew out two bad teams before losing against the Seahawks on Monday night. Who knows what to do with them. The Vikings have one of the league's most creative defenses, but it's hard to trust their offense given the quarterback situation.Tier 2: The outer circle49ers, Buccaneers, Colts, Eagles, Packers, Patriots, SeahawksThese teams are probably top contenders, but there is maybe just one thing that holds us back from placing them among the elite.For the 49ers, it's the injuries. How long can they keep doing what they're doing without their top guys? They'll get healthier on offense but Nick Bosa and Fred Warner aren't coming back. Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has made it work so far, but can that continue?\nThe Bucs are everybody's favorite team to watch early in the season, but we saw on Monday night how things can look different when they don't stage their weekly miracle comeback. Four of their five wins have come by a combined 10 points, and four all of them saw the game-winning points scored in the final minute. That's highly unsustainable.The Colts look like world-beaters. Their offense is a machine. And I still cannot bring myself to trust a Daniel Jones-led offense just yet. Am I waiting too long? Maybe. But I feel comfortable waiting more than seven games.Everything has looked difficult for the Eagles this year, especially on offense, where the run game has just not looked the same as it did last season. They also can't really rush the passer. They're in this tier because they have the talent and record, but they haven't looked the part for much of the season.\nThe Packers appear to have the highest ceiling of any team in this tier and perhaps the entire league, but they haven't hit it since Week 2. When are we going to see that team again?Drake Maye is a breakout superstar, and the Patriots are rolling. Only one of their five wins is against a team worth writing home about (more on that in a second), though, and I'd really like to see what their defense looks like against another offense worth its salt before moving them into the inner circle.The Seahawks can reach an extremely high level on both sides of the ball -- especially when they're healthy in the secondary. All of their wins are against pretenders, though, and they've lost the two times when they've played teams in this tier. I want to see what it looks like for them if and when they get down in a game and need to stage a comeback, too.\nTier 1: The inner circleBills, Chiefs, Lions, RamsHave the Bills looked like world-beaters this year? Not exactly. But armed with Josh Allen and always in the mix for the AFC title, they have to think that the only way their season could be considered a major success is if they finally break through and make -- and even win -- the title game.The Chiefs are rounding into form, winning four of their past five games and looking as explosive offensively as we've seen them in years. Their defense has also stepped it up lately in a way that it hadn't early in the season. That unit is coming off its best performance of the season. We also know that the Chiefs are annually in the conference title game and have gone to three consecutive Super Bowls.The Lions still have one of the best rosters in the NFL. They should get healthier over the course of the season and that should help their defense get back into fighting shape. Their offense is explosive as any in the league, and it can be ruthlessly efficient when set up in the right game script. They didn't get their chance last year thanks to injuries, but they have to be thinking big again.\nThe Rams could easily be 6-1 right now were it not for a blocked kick against the Eagles. Even without Puka Nacua, their offense just put up five touchdowns over in London. Their defense still has some question marks (namely at outside corner) but is a strong enough unit to make a run with Matthew Stafford nearing the end of his career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NBA season is officially at hand, and it's missing a key character. For the first time since the 2018-19 season, LeBron James is absent from the festivities. This is the first season opener he's ever missed, and his Lakers have been a fixture on opening night ever since their 2019 acquisition of Anthony Davis. He's not the only significant name we won't see on Tuesday. Obviously, the Houston Rockets will be without Fred VanVleet as he'll likely miss the season recovering from a torn ACL, and the Oklahoma City Thunder are missing key forward Jalen Williams. The season hasn't even begun and we're already missing several important players. Alas, we soldier on without them, as their teams now must. The Rockets, Thunder, Lakers and Warriors will tip off the 2025-26 season on Tuesday, even if they have to do so at least at full strength.   Where to watch NBA opening night Game times: Thunder vs. Rockets, 7:30 p.m. ET | Lakers vs. Warriors, 10 p.m. ETTV channel: NBC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free), PeacockOdds (via DraftKings): OKC -258, HOU +210, O/U: 227.5 | GSW -142, LAL +120, O/U: 226.5So, with the season set to tip off, let's pick some best bets for Tuesday's slate with odds provided by DraftKings Sportsbook.  Houston Rockets at Oklahoma City Thunder We're kicking off the season with last year's No. 1 and No. 5 ranked defenses, so there's going to be a temptation to lean under here. That's especially true with Houston starting a jumbo lineup with Kevin Durant at shooting guard, and the inevitable emotions of ring night pouring over into the game. Keep in mind, though, these teams played five games last season. The lowest-scoring of them came in at 207. The other four came in at 233, 235, 236 and 265. For whatever reason, these defenses can stop everyone but one another. The absence of Williams will be felt fairly acutely for the Thunder defensively, as he was the obvious Durant matchup. They have a ton of other viable perimeter defenders, but their one weakness is height. That's a problem against one of the tallest wing scorers in league history, and both teams will generate easy points off turnovers, which tend to be plentiful early in seasons when offenses are sloppier. The Pick: Over 227.5. \nI'll admit I'm tempted to pick Houston to cover the seven-point spread. The Rockets beat the Thunder twice last season and it's opening night -- we want drama. But I just can't get over the danger of starting Amen Thompson as a point guard in his first game without Fred VanVleet around as a security blanket against this, specific Thunder team. I have all the faith in the world in Thompson eventually being a point guard-level handler and creator. It should even happen this season. But right away, against the best turnover-generating defense ever on the road with a raucous Oklahoma City crowd? I just think that's the difference here. Thompson will get there. I don't think he's quite ready for the role he'll have to play right away. The Pick: Thunder -7 Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now: It wouldn't be a Rockets game without a rebounding prop. I'm operating under the assumption that Alperen Sengun, for offense's sake, with Houston playing this jumbo lineup, just isn't going to be able to leave the floor much. Steven Adams and Clint Capela will come and go, but the Rockets are playing big, which probably means their shooting is going to be suboptimal. This is the best offensive rebounding team in the NBA, and I'm expecting them to reaffirm that on opening night. The Pick: Alperen Sengun Over 8.5 Rebounds \n \tGolden State Warriors at Los Angeles Lakers An opening night home underdog that has the best player in the game? Yes please. Luka Dončić has had a reasonably successful regular-season record against the Warriors at 14-8. Their defense, imposing as it is against the right opponents, struggles most with heliocentric offensive stars because they lack a single, elite perimeter defender. If you're a Deandre Ayton optimist, you'd figure that this would be a game for him. He has meaningful size and athletic advantages over Golden State's older, smaller front court of Al Horford and Draymond Green. Ironically, missing LeBron may not be the worst thing for the Lakers in this one. He's 1-6 in season openers as a Laker. The Pick: Lakers +2 Well, if you expect a big Dončić game, you almost have to pick the over. Even if a big Dončić game is a relatively slow one, the Lakers have a long way to go defensively, and the Warriors are exactly the sort of team you don't want to play on opening night in that regard because of how crisp their passing and movement are. Stopping them means having good habits and communication, which the Lakers likely don't yet have with all of their new faces. The Pick: Over 225.5 \nI'm not overthinking the props here. This is skinny Luka against a defense without a perimeter stopper. He's going to have the ball basically all night with James out. I can't promise the most efficient game out of Dončić, but I have to imagine he brute forces his way to 31 points. The Pick: Dončić Over 30.5 Points \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Jakobi Meyers requested a trade in the offseason, and while the team did not move him before the season started, nothing has changed with regard to his desire to play elsewhere. Meyers said ahead of Week 8 that he \"for sure\" still wants to be traded, even though the Raiders reportedly had no interest in shipping him off at the start of the year.The NFL trade deadline is just over two weeks away, and there is still seemingly no momentum in a potential Meyers deal. A number of teams could benefit from adding the veteran receiver if he becomes available ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline, though. Wideout-needy teams like the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers could be buyers, and the New England Patriots are familiar with Meyers and could potentially use another weapon for breakout quarterback Drake Maye.\"I'm a professional at the end of the day,\" Meyers said Tuesday. \"I'm just trying to play good football. If I'm here, like I said, I'll play good football. If I'm not here, I'll go out there and play wherever I'm supposed to be.\"\n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers landing spots: Where could veteran WR wind up if Raiders trade him before deadline?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeyers' August trade request came after his search for a new contract came up short. He is in the final season of a three-year deal he signed with the Raiders in 2023, and his stock could not have been higher in the offseason as he was fresh off a career year in which he racked up 87 catches for 1,027 yards and four touchdowns.\nThe sides did not reach an agreement on an extension before the season began, halting the discussions.\"That window kind of closed when the offseason ended,\" Meyers said. \"I'm just focused on being where my feet are. If it gets done, I don't care, for real. I just want to be in a good spot for me, for my family, and like I said, really just play good football.\"The Raiders, who are 2-5 and in last place in the AFC West, will have to determine how expendable Meyers is before making a decision on whether to trade him at the deadline, to re-sign him before or during free agency or to let him walk at the end of the year. With the offense struggling under first-year coach Pete Carroll, Meyers has not been quite the leader of the wideouts that he was last year when he finished second only to tight end Brock Bowers in receiving, but he still ranks in a tie for first place on the team with 29 catches.\nFellow receiver Tre Tucker emerged as the Raiders' most productive pass-catcher from both a yardage and touchdown standpoint with Bowers missing time this season due to injury.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the clock wound down Friday night at Huntington Bank Stadium with Minnesota leading Nebraska 24-6, the reaction to the result was predictable. Nebraska, coming into the game ranked for the first time since Week 3 of last season, blew it. Matt Rhule, who had been mentioned with the suddenly vacant Penn State job all week, blew it as well.I get it. That's how it works when the teams with the numbers next to their names lose to those without them. However, I had a different takeaway in the immediate aftermath. I thought, \"Boy, P.J. Fleck does not get nearly enough credit for what he's done at Minnesota.\"The win improved the Gophers to 5-2 on the season and 3-1 in the Big Ten. They are a win away from their fifth straight bowl appearance, which would tie the school's record for consecutive postseason berths. It also improved Fleck's record to 37-37 in Big Ten games. If you take out his first season, the Gophers are 35-30 in Big Ten play, and if you ignore 2020 (and, honestly, we should all ignore the results of the COVID season, because they've mostly proven meaningless) he's 32-26. Those numbers won't wow you, but in the context of where Minnesota has historically found itself in the Big Ten over the last 75 years, it's impressive.Minnesota has won seven national titles in its history, but none since 1960. If we consider only the modern era of college football (since the BCS began in 1998), Minnesota has finished with a winning conference record eight times in 27 seasons. Fleck is responsible for four of them, and is two wins away from his fifth.\nWhat Fleck has done at Minnesota reminds me a lot of what Hayden Fry and then Kirk Ferentz have done at Iowa. He's taken a Big Ten program that isn't considered one of the league's best and consistently found ways to exceed expectations every season. Coincidentally, that's who Fleck's Gophers will face this week in one of the Big Ten's traditional rivalry games.There's a bronze pig on the line, folks!Now, before Iowa fans throw heavy objects at me, Fleck has not taken Minnesota to the same kind of heights Fry and Ferentz have reached at Iowa. Hayden Fry took the Hawkeyes to the Rose Bowl three times. Kirk Ferentz has two Big Ten titles, a Rose Bowl appearance, and an Orange Bowl appearance on top of it. Fleck has never won the Big Ten and his biggest bowl was a Cotton Bowl appearance with Western Michigan that led to him landing the Minnesota job.My comparison is more about what Minnesota has become under Fleck. Some may have seen Nebraska going on the road to Minnesota and losing as some kind of big upset. Perhaps it was on the point spread, but it wasn't a shock to anybody who pays close attention. Much like Big Ten teams have found going into Kinnick Stadium and facing the Hawkeyes to be difficult, the same thing is happening with road trips to Minneapolis.\nOn Friday night it was No. 25 Nebraska who lost. Last season No. 11 USC came into Huntington Bank Stadium and fell 24-17. A month and a half later it was No. 4 Penn State that narrowly avoided disaster in a 26-25 win. In a year where it feels like so many Big Ten programs are wondering who they are and what their place in the league is, Minnesota has an identity under Fleck. The Gophers might surprise you, but they don't surprise themselves.Let's rank rivalry trophiesAll right, since the Floyd of Rosedale is on the line Saturday in Iowa City, and I love that damn pig, it feels like a good time to rank the top five Big Ten rivalry trophies. These rankings are final, and if you disagree, it's because you are wrong and need to reevaluate everything you've ever felt or thought to this point in your life. Perhaps then you'll figure out why your rankings are wrong.\nAnyway, here we go.1. Floyd of Rosedale2. Paul Bunyan's Axe3. Illibuck4. Paul Bunyan Trophy5. Little Brown JugWisconsin is badTo the surprise of nobody, Wisconsin was dominated by Ohio State in a 34-0 loss. This performance came on the heels of a 37-0 loss to Iowa the week before. That's right, the Badgers have not scored a point in a football game since kicking a 39-yard field goal to cut Michigan's lead to 24-10 with 2:43 left to play. It has been 122 minutes and 43 seconds of game time since the Badgers put a point on the board.They have been outscored 122-20 in four Big Ten games. No other Big Ten team has scored fewer than 64 points in conference play this year. Things are pretty bad, but I don't know if these numbers truly explain it, so let's take it a step further.\nThere have been 36 Big Ten conference games played so far this year, and Wisconsin's average of -0.42 EPA per snap was the second-worst performance of the season in any of those contests. The worst? Well, that was Wisconsin's 37-0 loss to Iowa last week. It averaged -0.58 against the Hawkeyes.What's that? You want it to hurt more? Well, I've got good news for you sickos, no other Big Ten team has had an average EPA per play worse than -0.34 this year, so not only does Wisconsin have the two worst performances, it has them by a mile!Oh, and Wisconsin's -0.20 performance against Maryland ranks as the 10th-worst this year. So the Badgers claim three of the 10 worst offensive showings of the Big Ten season. No other Big Ten team has more than one of the worst 10, and what's crazier is all three of Wisconsin's have come at home.\nOffenseOpponentEPA per Snap1. WisconsinIowa-0.582. WisconsinOhio State-0.423. Purdueat Northwestern-0.344. Illinoisat Indiana-0.345. RutgersOregon-0.326. Minnesotaat Ohio State-0.297. Washingtonat Michigan-0.258. Marylandat UCLA-0.219. OregonIndiana-0.2010. WisconsinMaryland-0.20Their best performance was -0.15 against Michigan, which checks in as the 15th-worst. Seriously, everyone, it's been very bad.Dylan Raiola cannot stop getting sackedDylan Raiola was sacked nine times in Nebraska's loss to Minnesota, which is obviously the most he's ever been sacked in a game. But this is not a new problem. Raiola has been sacked frequently this season. After being sacked 25 times last year, he's now been dropped 26 times in 2025, and we're barely past the halfway point of the regular season.The only quarterback who has been sacked more often than Raiola this year is Auburn's Jackson Arnold, who is at 27. I place a lot of the blame for this on Raiola's shoulders.He has a pressure-to-sack ratio of 2.81. For those who aren't clear, that just means how many times is the QB pressured for every sack he takes. Among the 116 qualified quarterbacks, Raiola's ratio ranks 116th. Jackson Arnold is 115th at 3.00.Some people will want to blame the offensive line, and I'm not going to absolve that unit of blame, but Raiola's only been pressured on 29.1% of his dropbacks. That ranks 54th of 116 qualified QBs. Also, while PFF grades are far from a holy grail, PFF gives Nebraska's offensive line a pass-blocking grade of 78.7 on the season. That ranks 13th among the 136 FBS teams.I've been critical of Raiola on the Cover 3 Podcast this year. I do not think he is a fundamentally sound player, and it annoys me because, from a talent perspective, there aren't many in the country with his arm talent. He has great arm strength and tremendous accuracy. He can make every throw in the book, and he can do so in different ways. But he gets sloppy in his footwork and it leads to misses that shouldn't happen far too often.Then there are the sacks he's taking. A lot of them are products of his desire to make plays happen off script. Sometimes he does something spectacular, like this.\nMore often, instead of stepping up in the pocket to escape pressure, he moves backwards or tries to roll to his right or left to buy more time to do something incredible, but only ends up running into the waiting arms of a defender.The sacks put Nebraska's offense in tough positions, which then causes Raiola to put more pressure on himself to do something great, which leads to more sacks. It's something he and the Cornhuskers have gotten away with in nonconference games, but it hurts them in Big Ten games.Until Raiola starts understanding that boring plays can be more effective than spectacular ones, Nebraska will have a tough time winning consistently in the Big Ten.Going with my gutEvery week I pick the Big Ten games against the spread based on nothing but my gut reaction to the number. No digging into numbers -- just vibes, baby. I even track my record to embarrass myself publicly. Any game not included is due to there not being a posted line at time of publishing.\nMinnesota at Iowa: OK, here's the deal. It's hard for me to trust Iowa to cover a spread this large when the Hawkeyes were barely able to beat Penn State at home last week. This was a Penn State team that was on a three-game losing streak that got its coach fired, and had lost its starting quarterback for the year to an injury. There was no excuse for Iowa to make that one so close. Now you've got Minnesota coming to town with the Floyd of Rosedale on the line. I have to take the points here.

He faces off against the Spanish giants, this time desperately needing to show he is anything like the sort of striker who can match the output of Kylian Mbappe in European competitions, like he did last season. So far, he isn't getting close. Just one shot on target so far this season and zero shots of any variety in back to back starts against AC Milan and Como. The bar could scarcely be lower. -- James BengeMan of the match: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid -- Juventus are currently going through a challenging moment and they need a positive result, but it won't be easy against Real Madrid. In particular, their disappointing defensive performances will be challenged by French striker Kylian Mbappe, who already scored 15 goals in 11 matches played so far in all competitions, including a hat trick against Kairat in the opening fixture of the season. -- Francesco Porzio Prediction: Real Madrid 3, Juventus 1 -- Xabi Alonso's version of Real Madrid is essentially an exercise in restrained efficiency so modest scorelines come more naturally to Los Blancos these days than lopsided victories, but they can make a rare exception and they just might do so on Wednesday. Juventus are a bit all over the place to start the season, which may make it open season for Kylian Mbappe and his colleagues as they look to extend their perfect start to Champions League play. Alonso has a wide range of attackers at his disposal, too, each of them probably eager to make their mark in Europe as the manager continues to rotate through his options while leaving Mbappe front and center. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: Both teams to score and Real Madrid to win (+187): They have too much on the attacking end for Juventus to overcome, especially if Italian side couldn't cope with Como away from home over the weekend. But Xabi Alonso's defense has also given up chances and with talented attackers like Kenan Yildiz, Juventus will find a way to get one goal. Unfortunately once they do, they have to deal with stopping Kylian Mbappe. -- Chuck Booth  Chelsea vs. Ajax, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Pedro Neto, Chelsea: Enzo Maresca could be without a host of key attackers on Wednesday, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Cole Palmer and potentially Enzo Fernandez. Someone is going to need to step up in their absence and Neto might just be the most senior forward in the Chelsea XI at kickoff. The Portugal winger has not come close to a consistent run of form that might justify the $70 million plus that was paid to Wolves for his services. However, a sprightly game against Nottingham Forest is at least something to build on. -- James BengeMan of the match: Estevao, Chelsea: The talented Brazilian striker is expected to start his first ever Champions League's match on Wednesday after playing 45 minutes between the game against Benfica and the one against Bayern Munich. Match after match, he's becoming an increasingly important part of Enzo Maresca's rotations, having also scored a last-minute winner against Liverpool. Now, he looks ready to take the next step and make his mark on the European stage. -- Francesco Porzio Prediction: Chelsea 3, Ajax 0 -- There is no greater treat for a team in inconsistent form than an opponent that will allow them to reverse course, even if the joy only lasts for 90 minutes. Chelsea may have some injuries to contend with and a habit for picking up red cards that hampers their ability to win games more often than it should, but Ajax have been incredibly unimpressive in their first Champions League season in three years, having conceded six goals in two games while scoring none, vulnerable on set pieces and mistake-prone at the back. The Blues just punished Nottingham Forest for having similar attributes over the weekend, so expect Enzo Maresca's side to collect their second win of the European season in the process. --  Pardeep Cattry \nBest bet: Chelsea to win to nil (+120): While the Blues have had their ups and downs this season, this iteration of Ajax looks nothing like the ones who used to challenge for the round of 16 every campaign in Champions League play. Chelsea's defense and former Ajax man Jorrel Hato will be able to take care of business winning at home at Stamford Bridge for a much needed three points in the league phase. -- Chuck Booth \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chelsea may still be picking up red cards with three in their last five matches, but they're beginning to find their form under Ezno Maresca. There were wobbles as Cole Palmer has missed time with a groin injury, and the Englishman still won't be available for their Champions League clash hosting Ajax, but their form is changing. With a victory, Maresca's squad will have won four matches in a row since losing to Brighton, while also being in a good position to advance from the league phase.How to watch Chelsea vs. Ajax, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- London, England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea -450; Draw +550; Ajax +1000While strikers have been rotated for the club, Pedro Neto and Reece James have stepped up. Neto delivered a goal and assist over the weekend, while James has a goal and two assists in his last four matches. Slotted in at right back or coming into midfield, James has been able to show why, when healthy, he's one of the best right backs in the Premier League. Following Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure from Liverpool to join Real Madrid, James has a strong case as the best right back in the league. With the club struggling without their talisman, it's important for their captain to step up to fill in the gaps, and James has done just that. The expectation will be for Chelsea to win with ease after Ajax fell to Marseille last time out, but with Joao Pedro suspended for the match, more changes will be needed up top. Marc Guiu was recalled from loan at Sunderland when Nicolas Jackson was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day, so the expectation would be that he starts this game, but Tyrique George could also be in contention if Maresca doesn't opt to play a false nine, putting Neto up top. That possible inexperience leading the line will be Ajax's best hope in getting any points at Stamford Bridge.\nIt has been quite a fall from the Ajax side, who used to be regulars in the Champions League round of 16. Currently at the bottom of the league phase table with six goals conceded in two matches played and none scored, they'll need quite a performance to get anything from Chelsea. Even in the Eredivisie, Ajax are fourth in the table under manager John Heitinga. A club in search of their former glory, getting a result off of the Blues may be unlikely, but Chelsea's depth issues could open the door.PredictionThis isn't the Ajax of dominance -- it's far from it, and despite the lack of attacking depth, Chelsea get it done.

    "description": "\n        As Frankfurt host Liverpool on Wednesday, it will be a reunion between the German side and former striker Hugo Ekitike, who joined Liverpool ",
    "body": "\n        As Frankfurt host Liverpool on Wednesday, it will be a reunion between the German side and former striker Hugo Ekitike, who joined Liverpool over the summer as the latest forward export from the system, but as the Reds descend upon Deutsche Bank Park in the middle of the forest, something special is happening. No team has gotten the true meaning of the term Champions League as Frankfurt, who face the reigning champions of Spain, England and Italy during their eight league phase games, but that also gives the teams a chance to see what's special about Frankfurt, as well as showing where soccer in Germany is going.Finishing third in the Bundesliga last season, Frankfurt are seeing their club membership climb as it now sits at 155,000 members, which is the fourth highest in German soccer. Due to the 50-plus-one rule in Germany, to play in the Bundesliga, supporters must be included in decisions, with members holding the majority of the voting rights in a club, guarding against commercial ownership of clubs, which has become increasingly common over the years. It's something that can be seen as holding German soccer back due to the lack of financial muscle compared to bigger teams around the world, but when looking at ticket prices, accessibility to the game, and the atmosphere at stadiums, the impact that the connection has on the fan experience is clear.With around two percent of the German population being members of clubs, it shows how important their connection is. Fans have a say on what goes on in the club and are able to vote on things such as who is on the board of directors, to have a hand in the direction that the club moves. How exactly it looks is different from club to club, but it's still quite different from how most of the world operates with supporters' opinions truly mattering, but it's up to the club to determine if anything will come of it or not.How to watch Frankfurt vs. Liverpool, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Deutsche Bank Park -- Frankfurt, GermanyLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Frankfurt +400; Draw +350; Liverpool -175The current Bundesliga motto, \"Football as it's meant to be,\" may seem cliché, but one step into a stadium shows just what that means. In the historic scene, the sports club came before soccer, and members may be taking part in things such as basketball, table tennis, track, hockey, darts, or so much more, all while sporting the iconic eagle badge. This is quite different from how American sports operate with their franchise model, and it also means that Bundesliga clubs have to balance both sporting success along with keeping the sports club doors open for the community.\n\"We have about 10,000 kids and minors doing sports with our club, and to understand that, the system in Germany is completely different than in the United States,\" Frankfurt vice president of sport Armin Kraaz said. \"Here in the U.S., all the school, high school and college, do the sport. In Germany, it's all the clubs. The school doesn't do sport, any sport, an hour a week, that's it. So the responsibility for us is to keep the kids away from the streets, bring them on the field, or into the gyms, and doing sports with us. And on the other hand, of course, we are a football club as well. So, we have two different organizations under one roof.\"It's something that presents unique challenges but also it makes the connection to the community unique, as these teams have such a direct impact on their communities. With ownership being much more of an investment venture in other leagues, they've moved more in the direction of business operations than holistically representing the community that they exist in. That's not to say that community clubs don't exist elsewhere, because they do, but it's almost a requirement to exist as a club in Germany. That balance is something that Frankfurt strikes well, as from the top down, they know that it's important to function as a business while also winning soccer games, which is even harder to do when leagues like the Premier League are buying up talent in the Bundesliga at a faster rate than ever.Bundesliga international CEO Peer Naubert put it bluntly during a media roundtable, saying, \"So we're not trying to, you know, get it to the same level as the Premier League because they're, they are doing a different game.\"\nThat doesn't mean that the Bundesliga isn't trying to advance, but it's critical to know where they are currently and how they can do something unique to produce talent to compete at the highest level.While that can be an issue for keeping talent, it's something that can be a selling point about the league. There's a way to have success while developing talent, and while Frankfurt CEO Axel Hellmann admits that it isn't the plan to sell a striker for $100 million every six months or so with Randal Kolo Muani, Omar Marmoush, and Ekitike all being Frankfurt products, that doesn't mean that this isn't their project working, having won the Europa League in 2021-22. When bids of that nature come in, it's in the best interest of everyone to say yes, and this is also what Frankfurt prepares these players for. \"It's not only buying or integrating players, you have to develop a plan. What is the player made for? For example, if we look particularly at the U.S. for players we have, for them it's not that easy to go directly from the club or the college leagues directly to the Premier League. directly to the top level,\" Hellmann said. \"What we can offer is that they make a step, going first in the Bundesliga because they play and they develop and they grow. It's important that in commercial interests and alignment on the pitch that you have an alignment of interest where the players' interest is to make the next step and at the club end, we develop that player for the benefit of both and that's an economic question .\"\nThey may already have their next $100 million talent at the club in 19-year-old Can Uzan. Joining during the summer of 2024 from FC Nuremberg in the 2. Bundesliga, Uzan was eased into things at the club last season, making 31 appearances totaling just over 1,000 minutes and scoring five goals and assisting three more. Now, looking at playing Liverpool, he'll be one of the key figures that Frankfurt will be relying on. He's catching eyes around the world with six goals and four assists already in 10 matches this season, including a UCL goal against Galatasaray. But things haven't been all smiles for Frankfurt in Europe's premier competition. After winning 5-1 in their opening match facing Galatasaray, they then lost 5-1 to Atletico Madrid at their home stadium. Facing Liverpool will be a chance to show that the real Frankfurt lies somewhere in between those two performances, while being able to provide those passionate fans with something to celebrate at their home stadium.There hasn't been a German champion of Europe since Bayern Munich won it in the 2019-20 season, and a German team has only won one of the last 10 finals. Frankfurt, Bayern Munich, and Bayer Leverkusen are all looking to be the team to end that drought, but with so many high-priced exports to teams elsewhere this summer, they'll need to lean on those fans, which make them special, to make their home stadiums fortresses in pursuit of European glory. \n            ",

Despite Alabama being a three-loss team and going against undefeated Indiana, the SportsLine advanced computer model is backing the Crimson Tide as 7-point underdogs as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The model also has a Thursday best bet from the NBA, backing the Dallas Mavericks to upset the Philadelphia 76ers as +114 underdogs at DraftKings.

However, despite Alabama suffering three losses this year, the Crimson Tide still have one of the most talented rosters from top to bottom in the nation, and as reminded once again on Wednesday in Miami's upset over Ohio State, the CFP is an entirely new season from what happened over the past few months. Junior quarterback Ty Simpson has proven ready to take over as the Alabama starter, throwing for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns compared to five interceptions this season. The Crimson Tide play in their ninth CFP over the last 12 years, as the program is used to this environment, which can't hurt on Thursday. The model projects Alabama to cover in 63% of simulations. Back Alabama at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Mavericks (+114) to defeat the 76ersThe Mavericks enter on a three-game losing streak, however, those all results came on the road, and they return to Dallas on Thursday. The Mavericks defeated the Nuggets, 131-130, as 6.5-point underdogs on Dec. 23 in their most recent home game, and they have won five straight in Dallas. The Mavericks were underdogs in four of those home games as well, so they have thrived in similar situations to Thursday as of late. Mavericks center Anthony Davis has missed the last two games, but he's off the injury report for Thursday. The 10-time All-Star is averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds per game this season, with rookie Cooper Flagg adding 19.4 ppg. The 76ers are 1-3 over their last four games, with their one win coming in a 139-136 overtime contest against the Grizzlies. The model projects the Mavericks to win in 62% of simulations, despite being plus-money underdogs. Back the Mavericks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Georgia (-6) vs. Ole Miss (-110)\"Georgia had eight full possessions in the first meeting and scored points on all eight of them,\" SportsLine expert Tom Fornelli said. \"Ole Miss' defense has been its biggest weakness all year, and will prove to be again here, only this time the offense won't be able to keep up as long.\" Back the Bulldogs at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more College Football Playoff picks and NBA picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

This 2026 Rose Bowl matchup is the second of the CFP quarterfinals, as the two programs will face off for the first time ever. Indiana (13-0) is the only undefeated team left standing, is coming off a 13-10 victory over Ohio State in the Big Ten title game and boasts the Heisman winner in Fernando Mendoza. Alabama (11-3) knocked off Oklahoma, 34-24, in the CFP First Round after dropping the SEC Championship Game to Georgia. The winner will advance to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. This will be IU's first game in program history as the AP No. 1 team. The Hoosiers are 7.5-point favorites in the latest Indiana vs. Alabama odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 47.5. IU is at -260 on the money line (risk $260 to win $100), while Bama is priced at +211 (risk $100 to win $211).

The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner. With two prolific offenses, 50 combined points are projected as the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Alabama vs. Indiana, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Indiana vs. Alabama spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe fourth and final game of the College Football Playoff quarterfinal round sees two SEC rivals square off for the second time this season with Ole Miss taking on Georgia in the Sugar Bowl Thursday night. The winner of this matchup faces Miami in the CFP semifinal with a trip to the championship game on the line. The last time Georgia and Ole Miss faced one another, it appeared the Rebels were on their way to a big win. However, a 17-0 fourth-quarter run by the Bulldogs gave Georgia the win and handed Ole Miss its only loss of the season to date. The Bulldogs would also lose just one game this year, and they wound up winning the SEC Championship. Both teams have a slightly different look right now, with Georgia really clicking on both sides of the ball over the last two months while Ole Miss has a new head coach. Lane Kiffin left the Rebels for rival LSU after the regular season ended, and he wasn't allowed to coach Ole Miss in the CFP. Instead, the Rebels are now led by Pete Golding, formerly the program's defensive coordinator. He kicked off his head coaching tenure with a blowout win over Tulane in the CFP's first round, while Georgia enjoyed a first-round bye. Kickoff from the Caesars Superdome is set for 8 p.m. ET on New Year's Day. The Bulldogs are 6.5-point favorites in the latest SportsLine consensus Ole Miss vs. Georgia odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 55.5. Georgia is a -240 money line favorite (bet $240 to win $100), while the Rebels are +197 underdogs (wager $100 to win $197). Before you make any Ole Miss vs. Georgia picks of your own, make sure you see the top college football picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times.\nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Georgia on ThursdayWhen: Thursday, Jan. 1Time: 8 p.m. ETTV: ESPNStream: Fubo  Follow along: CBS Sports AppOle Miss vs. Georgia betting previewOdds: Georgia -6.5, Over/Under 55.5\nA lot of focus entering the CFP was on the Big Ten given Indiana is the No. 1 seed in the field and Ohio State won it all last year, though the Buckeyes lost Wednesday night to Miami, meaning the winner of Ole Miss-Georgia faces the Hurricanes in the next round. There's a strong case that Georgia -- not any Big Ten team -- is the most dangerous team in the field. The team's offense has been dynamic and efficient behind first-year starting quarterback Gunner Stockton, who finished seventh in Heisman Trophy voting with a 70.7% completion rate and 23 touchdowns to five picks. Stockton is also coming off maybe his best overall performance of his career as he completed 20 of his 26 passing attempts with three touchdowns against Alabama in the SEC title game a few weeks ago. Georgia also finished the year ninth in scoring defense at 15.9 points per game after allowing 35 to Ole Miss and 41 to Tennessee earlier in 2025.The Rebels kicked off the Pete Golding era in resounding fashion, dominating Tulane 41-10 in the CFP's first round for Ole Miss' second win over the Green Wave this year. It was expected Ole Miss would win that game and win rather thoroughly, but this matchup with Georgia is Golding's first major test as the Rebels' head coach. Ole Miss' offense has been incredibly dynamic over the years when Kiffin was the head coach and calling plays, and that side of the ball scored 35 against Georgia's elite defense. But with Kiffin gone and many of the current Ole Miss offensive staff members soon to depart for LSU, how will that side of the ball look? Golding's defense found a groove in the second half of the year after some high-scoring affairs in September and October, so quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and Co. will have more pressure on them if the Rebels want to pull off the upset.Despite the 12-1 record, Georgia is just 6-7 against the spread this year. Ole Miss is also 12-1 and is better ATS at 8-5. Both teams have played more games that finished Under the total as opposed to Over, with eight of Georgia's 13 games finishing Under and seven of Ole Miss' 13 doing the same. An Under finish may be in play here as the total is very high at 55.5, per the latest SportsLine consensus odds.Model's Ole Miss vs. Georgia score prediction, picksThe Bulldogs win in the majority of the SportsLine Projection Model's 10,000 simulations, but the model instead would rather back the Rebels as they win in 44% of simulations at plus money while also covering the 6.5-point spread nearly 60% of the time. The model also has the Over on 55.5 hitting in 51% of simulations despite both teams leaning Under this season. Four of Ole Miss' last five games have finished Under, and each of Georgia's last four games have also gone Under the total.Ole Miss vs. Georgia score prediction: Georgia 30, Ole Miss 27Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Ole Miss vs. Georgia.

He has been one of NPB's top starters since 2021 and, in 2025, he threw 163⅔ innings with a 1.92 ERA and 178 strikeouts. Imai struck out 28% of the batters he faced in the league where the average is a 19% strikeout rate. The MLB average was 22% strikeouts in 2025, for reference.We ranked Imai as the 12th-best free agent available this offseason and the fifth-best starting pitcher. Here's what you need to know about the right-hander:\nRelative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB,  pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories  to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest  it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good  news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him  post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings.  He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers  from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with  his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to  walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in  his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3  starter as soon as next spring.As the scouting report suggests, Imai is not considered on par with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who was seen as an instant ace who could front a contender's rotation from Day 1. Imai needn't be Yamamoto to be a valuable member of a rotation, however. He's only 27 with plenty of peak years ahead of him, and mid-to-upper-90s gas always plays.Imai was made available to MLB teams through the posting process and the Astros owe the Seibu Lions a posting fee that is based on the size of his contract. Here is the posting fee structure:\nContract worth less than $25 million: 20% of contract valueContract worth $25 million to $50 million: $5 million plus 17.5% of amount over $25 millionContract worth more than $50 million: $9.275 million plus 15% of amount over $50 millionThe posting fee does not count against the competitive balance tax, though it is a lot of real money that has to be paid to the Lions in short order. The signing must be complete by the 5 p.m. ET on Friday. Physical passed, contract signed, the works. An agreement and a handshake is not enough.\n            \n    ",

Top-ranked and unbeaten Indiana's showdown with Alabama in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals appears set to be a wet one.Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the morning in Pasadena, California followed by fewer showers in the afternoon during the game, according to AccuWeather. Thursday's high in 64 degrees and Pasadena's Rose Parade was under a flood watch through noon local time.Rain is expected to stop around 1 p.m. local time for a brief period, but there is a 50% chance for more precipitation thereafter during the first half of the Rose Bowl through 6 p.m.Heavy rains Thursday morning forced organizers to tarp the field inside the Rose Bowl as working crews rushed to move standing water off the playing surface by pushing it toward the stands.\n\"You know, if it's a deluge, that's one thing. I don't expect that tomorrow, and I don't expect it to be a real critical factor in the game, and I don't see it changing our game plan very much,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said at his final press conference ahead of the contest.For Alabama, the game plan will not change unless there are heavier rains.\"I think you just gotta see what it is in the moment,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said. \"You know, it could be heavy at times. I don't know. It could be light. You just have to adjust. For us, we haven't played a lot in those elements this season. You try to prepare in practice with a wet ball and things like that, whether it's snapping the football, catching the football, throwing it, whatever it is. \n\"But in the end, you've just got to adapt, and we talked about those things on the staff, whether it's offense or defense, it kind of affects how you go about.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 18 could be considerably lucrative for players with incentive-based contracts, including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Aaron Rodgers of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers standout Keenan Allen.Darnold could hit a $1 million jackpot with three touchdown passes and 150 yards passing against the San Francisco 49ers in a battle for the NFC West. Darnold has 3,850 yards through the air and 25 touchdowns with notable escalators in his contract.Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle is active for the finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which means he cashes a $1 million bonus. He could tack on another $250,000 to that with a touchdown. For the Buccaneers, wideout Sterling Shepard needs one reception for $125,000 and just 29 receiving yards for an additional $125,000.Rodgers' one-year deal with the Steelers is laced with incentives to a total of $5.85 million if he hits them all. Only one of those — make the playoffs — can be accomplished this weekend with a win.\nRodgers makes $500,000 if the Steelers beat the Baltimore Ravens to win the AFC North. Among other incentives, Rodgers take homes $600,000 if the Steelers win a wild-card game and he plays at least 50% of the offensive snaps and another $1 million should Pittsburgh win the AFC Championship.NFL's Week 18 incentive notablesPotential total earningsNeedHow it happensKeenan Allen, Chargers$1.25 million6 catches; 9+ yards; 2 TDsImpressive statsRico Dowdle, Panthers$1.25 millionActive; TDPlay and scoreSam Darnold, Seahawks$1 million3 passing TD; 150 yardsUsual effortAaron Rodgers, Steelers$500,000WinBeat Baltimore Tony Pollard, Titans$500,00066 rushing yards; 2 TDsBest season avg.Dawson Knox, Bills$500,0007+ yards; TDFind red zone TDSaquon Barkley, Eagles$500,00087 scrimmage yardsHeavy touchesCaleb Williams, BearsFuture max270 yards for 4,000Explosive playsFor Allen, there's a $1.25 million bonus on the line against the Denver Broncos. Six catches would give him a $750,000 check, while nine or more yards receiving and two touchdowns would net him another $500,000. Allen has 74 receptions for 741 yards and four scores this fall.For 49ers wideout Jauan Jennings, a seven-reception game would give him a $666,666 bonus. Washington Commanders playmaker Deebo Samuel could get to $1.5 million with at least 10 catches, 93 yards receiving and two touchdowns to hit everything.Commanders pass rusher Von Miller needs one sack of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to hit a $1 million bonus.New England Patriots tight end Hunter Henry could pocket a $250,000 incentive with five catches against the Miami Dolphins. And Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the MVP frontrunner, is expected to play.While there's no contract language in the form of a bonus for Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams, the former No. 1 overall pick looks to become the franchise's first 4,000-yard passer. That would push the second-year pro closer to a max deal when the times comes. Williams needs 109 yards against the Detroit Lions to break Erik Kramer's team record of 3,838 set in 1995 and 270 yards to eclipse 4,000.\"For me, it would be cool just in the sense there's never been one here,\" Williams said. \"I was brought here for those types of things and those types of moments, the things that haven't been done here, to try and be able to accomplish. But the self-goals and all of that always get swept under when you go for team goals and that's winning ballgames. That's first and foremost on my mind. That's first and foremost for this team because the most important thing is winning ballgames and heading into the playoffs with some momentum and some good energy.\"And in another milestone department, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is 110 receiving yards away from hitting the 1,000-yard mark in both rushing and receiving this season, which would mark the second time that's happened in his NFL career.Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett needs one sack to set NFL record and he gets his opportunity against one of the NFL's weakest offensive fronts.\n            ",

Backup Crimson Tide quarterback Austin Mack entered the College Football Playoff quarterfinal in Simpson's place with Alabama trailing 24-0 in the third quarter. Simpson took a big hit in the first half while trying to extend for a first down and has been grimacing while throwing the ball. He tried to come back and play in the second half. The hit was on Simpson's lower back and led to a fumble, which the Hoosiers converted into points. However, Simpson has struggled to create explosive plays during a heavyweight battle with the Hoosiers. The junior completed 12-of-16 passes for 67 yards and added 17 yards on the ground, but was held without a score in his snaps. \nMack came off the bench and played good snaps in relief of Simpson, including leading the Crimson Tide's lone field goal drive. The California native completed 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards, but was also sacked multiple times in the loss. Mack's three drives averaged nearly eight plays per drive compared to only five for Simpson's drives. Alabama scored only three points in their loss to the Hoosiers, failing to reach multiple scores for the second time in three games. The Crimson Tide finished the year losing three of their final six games, including losing three of four against ranked opponents. \nAfter the win, No. 1 Indiana heads to face No. 5 Oregon at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are the final remaining undefeated team in college football, and hope to become the first 16-0 team in major college history. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It's rare that a Premier League job opens to start the new year where a team is not only still alive in the Champions League but also firmly in the race for a top-four position, but business has been anything but normal at Chelsea over the past few seasons. After winning the Europa Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup last season, manager Enzo Maresca has departed the club by mutual consent, opening quite a role at Stamford Bridge. The Blues will now look for their seventh manager since 2020 (including interim managers), but the top target could already be in scope. Let's take a look at who the Blues may be taking a look at to replace Maresca:Liam Rosenior, StrasbourgAlready in the BlueCo ecosystem that has sent players to Chelsea, it's hard not to consider the French side when looking at the potential next steps for the Blues, which is also why he's the leading candidate for the job, according to The Athletic. While Andrey Santos is the only current member of the Chelsea squad to have spent time at the French club, there is a strong development aspect of sending Chelsea prospects abroad to spend time under Liam Rosenior. With the two clubs under BlueCo, the connection is already there. The English manager has had a lengthy playing career while also spending time managing Hull City after hanging up his boots, before taking over the French club in 2024. While Strasbourg are currently in the Europa Conference League, there are valid concerns about whether a jump into the pressure cooker that is Chelsea may be a step too far for him as a manager at this stage. His side are eighth in the Ligue 1 table but have struggled in recent matches, only winning four of their last 10 matches in all competitions before the winter break. Knowing the system would still come as a plus due to Rosenior having a quicker settling-in period, but if it meant looking over more experienced options, that could keep Chelsea out of Europe next season.Filipe Luis, FlamengoThriving in his first managerial job at Flamengo in Brazil, Filipe Luis has a rising managerial star. His side had a strong run at the Club World Cup, but he was also able to win the league and the Copa Libertadores in 2025. While Filipe Luis would have similar concerns of not having managed a top European club, his time at Atletico Madrid as a player and coaching players such as Jorginho currently will add to his ability to command a locker room at Chelsea. His expansive playing style is also something that could suit the Blues while keeping the possession-based approach that they developed under Maresca.\nCesc Fabregas, ComoPushing for Champions League soccer with Como, it feels like only a matter of time until Cesc Fabregas ends up at a massive job. Already linked to Inter when they hired Cristian Chivu, the former Chelsea midfielder would be one of the top names that they could get for the role -- if he were open to leaving the club midseason, that is. With where Chelsea are, they can't afford an interim manager or waiting for their guy, so Fabregas' loyalty to Como could come at the expense of a club like Chelsea, who need a manager right now. Fabregas' success with youth players like Nico Paz is something that could fit right in at Stamford Bridge, but the timing of a match here feels just slightly off.Frank Lampard, CoventryIs the third time the charm? You can't mention Chelsea managers without mentioning Lampard, who has had two spells in charge of the club since 2019. He is on track for a return to the Premier League with Coventry City, but if he could take over a club like Chelsea, that's still preferable to hoping that he could avoid relegation next season if the Sky Blues get to the Premier League. While it's unlikely that Chelsea would go after Lampard yet again, it's happened enough that it has to be in the realm of comprehension.\nOliver Glasner, Crystal PalaceRising up the managerial rankings by the day with Crystal Palace, Glasner is someone else who should be in consideration for Chelsea. He has already won a European title with Eintracht Frankfurt, and between his time there and at Wolfsburg, Glasner has shown that he can manage at top levels by also winning the FA Cup last season. A pragmatic manager who is comfortable changing his style depending on who is available and the opposition, Glasner would be among the top names that the Blues could net, but availability, looking to do this in January again, comes as an issue.\n            ",

Lake, a team captain, signed a three-year extension Thursday, the Rams announced.The deal is worth $42 million, with $25.7 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. At $14 million annually, it is the 12th-largest per-year contract among all safeties. Lake, a sixth-round pick out of UCLA in 2022, is in the final year of his rookie deal and was set to hit free agency in the offseason. Instead, he'll stay put as another impressive draft-and-develop find for the Rams. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 18 NFL picks: Steelers send Ravens to Cancun while 49ers claim No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLake saw spot duty as a rookie and slightly more playing time in his second year, but he broke out in 2024, recording 111 tackles and a pair of sacks while showing off versatility playing all over the secondary. Lake, 26, was on his way to another strong season -- he had his first career interception and also a career-high 10 passes defensed -- before injuring his elbow in Week 11 against the Seattle Seahawks. Rams coach Sean McVay said this week that the Rams will open Lake's 21-day practice window and that the team expects to have him back for the first round of the playoffs. Though he's listed as a safety, Lake has played two-thirds of his snaps this season as a slot cornerback. He is Pro Football Focus' 12th-highest graded safety this season, and the Rams have allowed 5.0 yards per play with him on the field compared to 5.4 yards per play with him off the field.\nThe Rams dropped to 11-5 with a loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night and will close out the season at home against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The Rams currently occupy the NFC's No. 6 seed, but would jump to the No. 5 spot with a win over the Cardinals and if the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Once dubbed by legendary broadcaster Keith Jackson as \"The Granddaddy of them All,\" the Rose Bowl has changed dramatically in recent years -- a reflection of college football as a whole. While it no longer features the best of the Big Ten and the Pac-12, it's still one of the most anticipated events on the college football calendar every year as an annual site for the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.What hasn't changed is the time the game is played, or the beautiful setting. Also, as luck would have it, the Big Ten champion will play in the game this year, with the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers squaring off against No. 9 Alabama.This is Indiana's second straight season reaching the College Football Playoff, and the Hoosiers are hoping it goes better than last year when they lost a first-round game at Notre Dame. Alabama did not make the 12-team field last season, but is a playoff regular, and came back from a 17-0 deficit to beat No. 8 Oklahoma in the first round.It's the first matchup between these two schools with very different backgrounds, and the winner will move on to face the winner of the Orange Bowl in the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9. With inclement weather conditions expected at the 2026 Rose Bowl, a rarity for this legendary game, anything is on the table. \nWhere to watch Alabama vs. Indiana liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: The Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, CaliforniaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along with live updates and analysis as Indiana faces Alabama in the 2026 Rose Bowl Game. Alabama vs. Indiana: Need to know for Rose BowlThis is the first time Indiana will play a game as the No. 1 team in the country: When the Hoosiers beat Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship it didn't just result in their first Big Ten championship since 1967, it moved them to No. 1 in the CFP poll as well as the AP Top 25. It's the first time in history the Hoosiers have been No. 1 in the AP poll, which means that when they take the field in Pasadena, it'll be the first time they've played a game as the No. 1 team in the country. How ironic that it comes against the program that's been considered the most dominant of the BCS and playoff era?  \nAlabama has been to more Rose Bowls than Indiana: The SEC has never had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl, but this will be Alabama's ninth appearance in the game. The Tide were last here for a College Football Playoff semifinal against Michigan on New Year's Day of 2024, losing to the Wolverines. They also won a Rose Bowl during the 2020 College Football Playoff. Their last trip to the game that wasn't a playoff appearance was in 1945, which was one of their six appearances from 1926 to 1946.  Fernando Mendoza is the first Heisman winner in Indiana program history: Given Indiana's lack of overall success in football, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy this year after leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated season and a Big Ten title. It's his first year with Indiana, as he began his college football career at California before transferring to the Big Ten. It seems the move was a wise decision on Mendoza's part.Alabama vs. Indiana prediction, picks  \nThe total for this one feels a little low. I'm not expecting a shootout, but I do believe both offenses are capable of moving the ball against these opposing defenses. Oklahoma probably should've scored more than it did against Alabama in the first round, and while Indiana's defense has been exceptional, it has been prone to allowing explosive passes this season, which is an area Alabama thrives. Won't be a shootout, but it won't be a rock fight, either. Pick: Over 48.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Georgia will seek redemption in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, when it takes on No. 6 Ole Miss inside the Superdome in New Orleans. The Bulldogs were in an identical situation a year ago in the College Football Playoff semifinal when they were eliminated by a surging Notre Dame team that finished as the national runner up.Back then, UGA was relying on unproven quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was making his first career start in a high-stakes showdown against one of the nation's best defenses. This time around, Stockton is a seasoned veteran who emerged as one of the nation's top QBs while guiding the Bulldogs to an SEC championship.On the other side, Ole Miss will also be seeking some redemption after the Rebels lost 43-35 at Georgia on Oct. 18. Head coach Lane Kiffin has since departed for LSU, leaving Ole Miss in the care of new coach Pete Golding for the program's first-ever CFP appearance.Despite the strangely timed coaching transition, the Rebels looked strong in a 41-10 first-round beatdown of Tulane. With star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss spearheading a dynamic offense, Ole Miss remains a force to be reckoned with.\nGeorgia is entering off a bye, but the Bulldogs were dominant in a 28-7 SEC title game win over Alabama. The UGA defense has gone four straight games without allowing more than 10 points.Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Sugar BowlKewan Lacy's status: The top injury-related storyline entering the Sugar Bowl appears to be the health of Ole Miss star running back Kewan Lacy. The Missouri transfer exited the Rebels' first-round win over Tulane in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. Though he returned, he appeared to be less than 100%, which has cast his status for the quarterfinals into doubt. Lacy is second nationally among all players with 21 rushing touchdowns. Though he tallied just 31 yards rushing on 12 carries in the Rebels' October loss at Georgia, he did score two touchdowns against the Bulldogs.The last meeting: Georgia scored on every offensive possession against Ole Miss in its 43-35 win over the Rebels on Oct. 18 until it was time to take a knee. It was an unbelievable performance from the UGA offense and quarterback Gunner Stockton. But that doesn't mean the victory came easy for the Bulldogs. Ole Miss proved unstoppable for three quarters and took a 35-26 lead into the fourth inside Sanford Stadium. Finally, when the game was on the line, Georgia's defense stepped up and came up with critical stops to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season.\nNew coaching rivalry: Add another chapter to college football's long-running saga of former Nick Saban assistants coaching against each other. Georgia coach Kirby Smart and new Ole Miss coach Pete Golding each share the distinction of being former Alabama defensive coordinators who are now running their own SEC programs. Smart is the most-accomplished branch of the Saban tree, whereas Golding is just one game into his head coaching career and has a lot to prove. While they didn't overlap at Alabama, they learned under the same teacher, and both helped the Crimson Tide win national titles.

The Bulldogs' last four opponents have averaged a paltry 7.25 points per game as coordinator Glenn Schumann's unit has developed the teeth needed to make UGA a legitimate national championship contender. It's hard to imagine Ole Miss playing as perfectly offensively as it did through the first three quarters of the first meeting. Look for Georgia's defense to come up with enough key stops to help Georgia pull away and reach the semifinals. Pick: Georgia -6.5\n\n                    \n    \n

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who both left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings in December. The Astros, meanwhile, made a splash on New Year's Day. Houston agreed to a contract with Japanese rigty Tatsuya Imai, who is coming to MLB after a stellar career in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.\n        \n            \n                Tatsuya Imai signs with Astros: NPB ace agrees to uncommon contract with Houston\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Valdez and Suárez would slot in toward the front of any rotation.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

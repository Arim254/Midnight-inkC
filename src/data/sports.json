Tate, a projected first-round pick, caught 51 passes for 875 yards and nine touchdowns in 11 games this season for the Buckeyes, who were eliminated from the College Football Playoff in the quarterfinals last week by Miami.Tate, who ranks No. 5 overall in CBS Sports' NFL Draft prospect rankings, missed three games this season due to injury and closes out his collegiate career with 121 catches for 1,872 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nDuring the Buckeyes' national championship run in 2024, he recorded 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns. The junior crossed 100 yards receiving in four games this season, including a nine-catch, 183-yard explosion against Minnesota in October.Listed at 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, Tate is CBS Sports' No. 2 wide receiver behind Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson. In Mike Renner's most recent mock draft, Tate is the first wide receiver off the board, going to the Washington Commanders at No. 7 overall. \nLast year, Ohio State became the first school to ever have a wide receiver drafted in the first round in four straight years with Emeka Egbuka, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba plus Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave in 2022. The Buckeyes will likely make it five straight years come April before Jeremiah Smith joins that group in 2027. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon has chased this moment for decades, cycling through eras defined by innovation, near-misses and a bit of recalibration. Now, as the Ducks prepare for the College Football Playoff semifinal against No. 1 Indiana at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, the path to the program's first national championship no longer feels theoretical. It feels earned.Since Dan Lanning arrived in Eugene before the 2022 season, Oregon has built a consistent identity and trajectory that few programs in the country can claim: three straight seasons with at least 12 wins. Last year, the Ducks flirted with a breakthrough on the national stage, climbing to No. 1 in the rankings for much of the season, securing a Big Ten Championship and entering the CFP with an unbeaten record. But their run ended in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal against eventual national champion Ohio State.That loss stung not because it derailed the season, but because it revealed precisely where the Ducks still needed to improve: physicality against elite opponents and consistent execution in high-pressure moments.Fast forward to 2025, and Oregon has returned to the national conversation, this time with those lessons fully integrated into the roster, coaching approach and overall game plan.\nThe progress is no accident.Oregon is the only one of the four remaining CFP semifinalists with top-15 national recruiting classes in each of the past four cycles: fifth in 2025, third in 2024, ninth in 2023 and 13th in 2022. That doesn't even account for strategic transfer portal additions that have filled gaps and provided immediate impact. The Ducks entered the season ranked fifth in 247Sports Team Talent Composite. The other semifinalists? Miami (15th), Ole Miss (21st) and Indiana (72nd).After coming up short in previous title runs, including the near-misses of 2010 and 2014, the Ducks won't let this opportunity slip away again. Here are three reasons why Oregon is positioned to seize that long-awaited national championship.More CFP predictions: Why Ole Miss can win it all | Why Indiana can win it all | Why Miami can win it all\nBalanced excellence on both sidesChampionship teams aren't one-dimensional. Among the four remaining CFP semifinalists, only Indiana and Oregon rank inside the top 20 nationally in both offensive EPA per play and defensive EPA per play against FBS opponents this season. The Ducks are also the only semifinalist in the top 20 for both explosive play rate and limiting opponent explosive plays against FBS opponents. This balance gives Oregon multiple ways to win: they can sustain drives and grind in a possession game or flip a matchup with big plays when needed. Efficiency and Explosiveness (vs. FBS only)TeamEPA/PlayDef EPA/PlayExplosive RateOpp. Explosive RateIndiana0.25 (5th)0.20 (2nd)13.8% (18th)10.3% (t-31st)Oregon0.16 (t-15th)0.14 (t-6th)14.9% (t-9th)7.5% (2nd)Ole Miss0.19 (t-8th)-0.01 (t-54th)13.4% (t-23rd)10.7% (t-39th)Miami0.13 (t-23rd)0.14 (t-6th)12.2% (t-48th)8.3% (t-7th)In a national semifinal environment where every possession matters and mistakes are magnified, that versatility is invaluable -- Oregon is equipped to succeed regardless of how the game unfolds.Peach Bowl could determine the CFP championAccording to FanDuel's hypothetical national championship odds, Oregon (and Indiana) would be favored over both Ole Miss and Miami in the CFP title game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens -- a de facto home game for the Hurricanes. The Hoosiers are the toughest opponent standing between the Ducks and their first national title.Oregon already faced Indiana earlier this season in Eugene, falling 30‑20 in a game where Indiana physically dominated. If there's any doubt that Lanning will use that experience as motivation, consider the circumstances: Indiana coach Curt Cignetti has openly acknowledged how difficult it is to beat the same team twice in a year, admitting the previous result actually gives Oregon the edge.The Big Ten has set the standard in recent years of the CFP, winning the last two national championships: Michigan (2023) and Ohio State (2024). Both programs reached that breakthrough only after coming up painfully short the year prior. The Big Ten is guaranteed to have a finalist for the third year in a row and there's no reason Oregon can't be the next program to carry that banner.Best pass defense remaining in CFPFor all the attention Oregon gets for winning the lines of scrimmage, its secondary is what can truly disrupt opposing offenses and force them into one-dimensional play. The Ducks boast a 64.8% success rate on pass plays against FBS opponents, tied for third in the country and 6.1% higher than the next best CFP semifinalist, Ole Miss (58.7%).And yes, their first-round opener against James Madison was an outlier: while they allowed 323 yards and two touchdowns, it came on 49 pass attempts and quarterback Alonza Barnett III completed just 49% of his throws. Against high-powered Texas Tech, Oregon's secondary dominated, allowing only 137 yards on 32 attempts (4.3 yards per pass) and forcing two interceptions from Brandon Finney Jr. in the shutout.That same ability to generate turnovers and disrupt timing will be critical against Indiana's Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who Oregon got to at times in the first meeting, including a pick-6 that easily could have led to a win for the Ducks.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The women's college basketball season is ramping up, and while many ranked teams have already suffered upsets early in 2026,  the top four teams -- UConn, Texas, South Carolina and UCLA -- are holding strong and proving to be true championship contenders. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement, as even undefeated UConn and Texas have been close to their first losses. Geno Auriemma said the No. 1 Huskies \"can get a lot better,\" and that is a sentiment Vic Schaefer, Dawn Staley and Cori Close have echoed.Conference play won't be forgiving, particularly in the SEC and Big Ten, so the next two months will tell us a lot about who could take over in March. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, here are the main questions for each of the top contenders.Can UConn stay undefeated?We have been asking this question since the preseason, but it is certainly a topic worth revisiting because it is not an easy feat to accomplish. In the history of Division I women's basketball, only 10 national champions have lifted the trophy without a single loss -- and UConn has six of those perfect seasons.\nThe Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd duo is one of the best in the nation, but the team has depth, too. Freshman Blanca Quiñonez has emerged as another double-figure scorer for the Huskies. Jana El Alfy has found momentum after the holiday break, and Wisconsin transfer Serah Williams has been good enough to be in the starting lineup while still waiting for her true breakout game as a Husky.KK Arnold has done a great job taking over as the starting point guard, but when she missed the game against Providence on New Year's Eve with a nose injury, the team still won by 37 points. While the Friars are not a ranked opponent, and UConn's uncharacteristic 21 turnovers certainly proved Arnold was missed, it was still impressive to get such a dominant victory without their quarterback. Of course, the Huskies are not actually untouchable -- they almost got upset by then-No. 6 Michigan in November. But there is not currently a team in the Big East that looks like a real threat for UConn and the only ranked opponent they have remaining in the regular season will be Tennessee on Feb. 1.\nCan the Texas offense stay strong against SEC opponents?Nobody is questioning Texas's defensive prowess, and it's also undeniable that their offense is significantly stronger than last season. In fact, the Longhorns have one of the top scoring offenses in the nation, averaging 93.2 points per game on 52.1% shooting. They have also reached 100+ points in six games and currently have has six active players averaging at least nine points per contest -- led by POY candidate Madison Booker's 19.1 points per game. Schaefer considers Rori Harmon \"the best point guard in the nation,\" and Texas has been benefiting from Jordan Lee's breakout season.All that being said, Schaefer describes the SEC as \"pure hell,\" so he is well aware that his team can't get too comfortable in the coming months. Texas already defeated South Carolina once this season, but that 66-64 win at the Players Era Championship was a tough battle the Longhorns survived thanks to a last-second shot by Rori Harmon. It was a quality win for sure, but that was Texas's lowest-scoring game this season. Their second-lowest scoring game was a 67-64 win over No. 15 Ole Miss, another SEC foe, on Jan. 4. \"Toughness comes in all forms. It's physical, it's mental,\" Schaefer said. \".... It's a win in the SEC. It's a ranked team again, but I think there's a lot of learning we can get from it.\"\nIn the coming weeks, Texas will need to prove that their offensive improvements were not just an early-season mirage.\nCan South Carolina clean up the little things?South Carolina is a tough team for anyone to face, but being consistent and taking care of the little things can make the difference between a win and a loss in March. The Gamecocks are shooting under 70% from the free-throw line, and those extra points could come in handy in close games such as the ones against Texas or Louisville.Although they recently got a 74-63 win over Florida, it was hardly a smooth ride for Staley's team. The Gators were able to speed them up, which led to the Gamecocks shooting just 34.3% from the field and registering a season-high 21 turnovers. However, they did show fight in what Staley described as an \"ugly\" win and got a season-best 59 rebounds. It's also important to note they were playing without Ta'Niya Latson, who is day-to-day with an ankle injury.\n\"Sometimes you gotta grind it out and win a game no matter how it looks,\" Staley said.Starters have to be specially locked in because although the South Carolina bench averaged 40.3 points per game last season, that production has dipped significantly to 17.4 bench points per contest.\nCan UCLA stay consistent and aggressive?The Bruins opened the season with a 77-53 win against San Diego State, but Close called out her team for a performance that was \"flat all the way around.\" The Bruins played with more urgency after that one, but they still have some alarming lapses. UCLA's only loss this season was against Texas in a game in which the Bruins had seven turnovers and just 10 points in the first quarter. They had a players-only meeting shortly after, which helped them bounce back with a 30-point win against Duke. \nThe Bruins are fresh off an 80-46 victory against crosstown rival USC, but even that game had a shaky start with six turnovers in the first 10 minutes. After the game, Close referenced their December win over Ohio State and pointed out the Bruins gave up 21 points in that one due to mistakes, lack of effort or lack of focus. She has been challenging her team to play with more urgency and awareness.\"There is a difference between hard work and competing. There's an awareness. There is a dog in you,\" Close said. \"There is a sense of urgency that has to happen. I want them to transfer hard work into competitive awareness and competitive fight. I think we are going in the right direction but I think that's still a journey that we need to go on. I think we gotta fight for a few more possessions.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Washington star quarterback Demond Williams Jr. announced that he was entering the transfer portal on Tuesday night. Williams will have a do-not-contact tag when he officially enters. In a post shared to social media, Williams thanked Washington coaches, teammates and fans before announcing his departure.\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" Williams wrote. After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"News of Williams' intention to enter the portal comes just days after the star QB signed a new deal to return to Washington for the 2026 season. The Huskies are prepping to pursue any and all legal avenues to enforce the terms of that contract, according to ESPN. Sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zentiz and Chris Hummer that LSU will be one of the teams to watch as Williams explores other options in the portal. The Tigers do have a need at quarterback, especially after Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss chose to remain with the Rebels instead of following Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge should he be granted a waiver for an extra year of eligibility that's still pending.\nOne of the best available playmakers hits open marketAs a sophomore in 2025, Williams ranked sixth in the Big Ten with 3,065 passing yards, and his 25 touchdown passes ranked fourth. He also showed off his mobility with 611 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. Williams did all that while leading Washington to a 9-4 record, which included a win over Boise State in the LA Bowl.Coming out of high school in Arizona, Williams was a four-star recruit and the No. 19 quarterback in the 2024 signing class, according to 247Sports. Although Williams didn't start for most of his true freshman season, he did play in every game before starting starting in the final two. His skill was evident, and he built upon that with a big 2025 season.In 26 games with the Huskies, Williams completed 71.5% of his throws for 4,009 yards, 33 touchdowns and nine interceptions while adding 893 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.\nBehind Williams, the Huskies don't have a ton of experience at quarterback. The only other quarterback to attempt a pass for the Huskies this past season was Tulane transfer Kai Horton, who completed four of seven passes for 13 yards.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens made a significant move on Tuesday, firing coach John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Harbaugh, the winningest coach in Ravens history, immediately vaults atop the list of available coaching candidates. How attractive is Harbaugh on this coaching carousel? His agent, Bryan Harlan, said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in Harbaugh 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There are just seven jobs open currently, and the Ravens didn't call about their former coach. That means there's an NFL team out there right now considering firing their own coach for a shot at Harbaugh.Who could that team be? The Miami Dolphins have not fired Mike McDaniel following a disappointing 7-10 campaign. He is 35-33 during his four seasons in South Beach, but 0-2 in the playoffs. Todd Bowles thinks he has done enough to keep his job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after three straight NFC South titles, but how does the organization feel about him moving forward? \nMaybe Jerry Jones makes an aggressive move for the Dallas Cowboys, or could the Cincinnati Bengals move on from Zac Taylor and seduce Harbaugh with star quarterback Joe Burrow and the idea of coaching against his former team twice a year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nApart from the Ravens, there are six franchises searching for new head coaches: the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Atlanta Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns and Arizona Cardinals. And there apparently is already a team to watch, as ESPN reports that Harbaugh is expected to emerge as the favorite for the Giants.\nYou can understand why teams are excited about the prospect of hiring Harbaugh. He is the winningest coach in Ravens history, going 180-113 during his time in Baltimore, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, and was named NFL Coach of the Year in 2019. Harbaugh has won eight road playoff games over his career, which are the most by a coach in NFL history. However, the Ravens have struggled in the playoffs over the last 12 seasons, winning just four games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Red River Rivalry will carry an extra ounce of intrigue in 2026 after former Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone announced his commitment to Oklahoma through the transfer portal on Tuesday. Livingstone, a roommate of Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning, should be a key piece of the Sooners' aerial attack next season.Livingstone -- a four-star prospect and the No. 16 wide receiver in the transfer portal, per 247Sports -- insinuated when he entered the portal on Jan. 3 that it was not solely his decision to leave Texas. Just three days later, he found a landing spot within the SEC.\"Never in a million years did I think I would be going into the portal looking for a new home,\" Livingstone said. \"Some things are out of my control. Such is the reality of the ever-changing landscape of college football. Emptied my tank every day for this great university, my teammates & all of the good folks of Texas. Grateful.\"Manning and Livingstone connected 29 times for 516 yards and six touchdowns during the 2025 campaign as both climbed into the starting lineup for the first time. Livingstone, who did not record a catch in his true freshman season, redshirted in 2024 and brings three years of eligibility to Oklahoma. Barring a shakeup in the Sooners' quarterback group, he will catch his passes next year from incumbent starter John Mateer.\nLivingstone was the fourth-leading receiver at Texas during his lone year in the lineup, and he would have ranked fourth in catches and yardage for the Sooners if his 2025 production came at Oklahoma. He could immediately be the top target for the Sooners if Isaiah Sategna III declares for the NFL Draft. Deion Burks exhausted his eligibility, opening the door for Livingstone to at least replace one of the team's two standout receivers.Oklahoma saw Livingstone up close and personal in October when it lost, 23-6, to Texas. The receiver hauled in two catches for 29 yards.Jumping to the other side of the rivalry means Livingstone will shift allegiances in a series with which he was highly familiar as a longtime Texan. The Lucas (Texas) Lovejoy product said earlier this year that he attended a Red River Rivalry game before his commitment to the Longhorns.\n\"You come here, you come to the game, you hear about the game, you're from Dallas,\" Livingstone said in October. \"It's everywhere for a month before the game even happens. I really think it helps out tremendously in recruiting. It's a great reason. My senior year, I came here for the game, and it was an unbelievable atmosphere. I was like, 'I want to play in the burnt orange. I want to be on the right side.'\"\n            ",

The Red Raiders recently celebrated the addition of top transfer quarterback Brendan Sorsby with advertisements posted in Times Square. Texas Tech posted a welcome message on Times Square's famous digital billboards. \nSorsby is the gem of Texas Tech's 2026 transfer haul thus far. The former Cincinnati star ranks as the No. 2 player nationally and the No. 2 quarterback in 247Sports' Transfer Portal Rankings. He reportedly commanded a price tag of $5 million in name, image and likeness revenue, making him the highest-paid quarterback in college football. Sorsby enters his final year of collegiate eligibility after a breakout season with the Bearcats. The former Indiana starter initially transferred to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 season and led the Bearcats to a 7-6 record in 2025 while throwing for 2,800 yards and a career-high 27 touchdowns to just five interceptions. He also rushed for 580 yards, a new personal best, and nine touchdowns while averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Texas Tech hopes that Sorsby can maintain its modern resurgence under coach Joey McGuire after the Red Raiders, who went all-in on the 2025 portal, won a Big 12 Championship Game and earned a top-four seed in the College Football Playoff. \nTexas Tech is also betting on Sorsby elevating its offensive ceiling. The Red Raiders were held scoreless while managing just 215 total yards of offense in their CFP debut against Oregon. Quarterback Behren Morton completed 18 of his 32 pass attempts for 137 yards with two interceptions. \n            \n    ",

The Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year committed to Nebraska on his visit Tuesday.Colandrea's arrival marks a pivot for Nebraska, which over the weekend appeared to have its quarterback situation for 2026 sorted out. Former Notre Dame signal-caller Kenny Minchey committed to the Cornhuskers on Sunday but flipped his pledge to Kentucky a day later, leaving Matt Rhule in search of another starting option.Rhule has his man in Colandrea, who is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, helped elevate the Cornhuskers out of an extended bowl drought, but Nebraska still remains in search of a true breakout season after going 7-6 in each of the last two seasons. Raiola entered the transfer portal at the end of his second campaign in Lincoln.Colandrea brings three years of starting experience to Nebraska and has the potential to be one of the Big Ten's most dynamic quarterbacks. He was a prolific runner at both UNLV and Virginia and made strides as a passer during his lone season with the Rebels. His 3,459 passing yards led the Mountain West, and his 23 touchdowns were a career high. He also cut down on his turnovers in 2025, throwing nine interceptions across 14 games. That was a major step forward for a gunslinging quarterback who racked up 20 picks over the previous two years.\nNebraska offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen will have a dual-threat weapon on his hands for the first time in Lincoln. Raiola, while adept at avoiding pass rushers, was a pocket passer in every sense of the term. While Colandrea is not as refined of a thrower as his predecessor, his skill set could unlock something in a relatively stale Cornhuskers offense.Targeting a mobile quarterback seems to have been a priority for Rhule and Holgorsen, as Minchey was also set to bring notable rushing ability to the program before he flipped his pledge to Kentucky.\nColandrea is a three-star prospect in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, per 247Sports, and ranks as the No. 21 quarterback and No. 175 player overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions have fired offensive coordinator John Morton after just one season, the team announced. Morton, previously the passing game coordinator of the Denver Broncos, was hired to replace Ben Johnson, who left last offseason to become the Chicago Bears' coach. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Lions led the NFL with 33.2 points per game in 2024 en route to a 15-win season. This year, the Lions finished tied for fourth in scoring (28.3), third in passing yards and eighth in red zone efficiency but failed to reach the postseason for the first time since 2022, going just 9-8 on the heels of consecutive NFC North titles. The Lions went 12-5 in 2023, losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, and then went 15-2 in 2024, only to get upset in the divisional round by the Washington Commanders. The team had Super Bowl aspirations entering 2025, but fell well short of expectations. \n        \n            \n                One reason for each NFL non-playoff team to be optimistic: Premium draft picks, young quarterbacks and more\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLions coach Dan Campbell took over as the team's offensive play-caller prior to their Week 10 win over the Commanders. At the time, Campbell downplayed the change while saying that the team's play-calling was a collaborative effort. \n\"It was just, let's try something a little different,\" Campbell said at the time. \"Look, I know what I want to do, I know how I want to do it. Now, that being said, this is a collaborative effort. I was taking input from John Morton that whole time, and the other coaches.\" While that may have been true, it's clear now that Campbell wasn't happy with the direction of the Lions' offense. Meanwhile, Johnson enjoyed highly-successful season with the Bears that included an NFC North division title. Chicago will host the Green Bay Packers this weekend in the NFC wild card round. The Lions were just 20th in the NFL on third down and 14th in rushing despite having one of the league's best running back duos in Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. While Gibbs enjoyed a big season, Montgomery was carried the ball a career-low 158 times. \nMorton, 56, was a senior offensive assistant on Campbell's staff in Detroit in 2022 before two years in Denver. He had a previous stint as an offensive coordinator with the New York Jets in 2017 and also worked as an offensive assistant with three other teams -- the Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Scoot over Kevin Stefanski and Klint Kubiak, there's a new most sought-after coach in the 2026 NFL coaching carousel: John Harbaugh. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 seasons (2008-2025) on Tuesday two days after losing the de facto AFC North championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a missed field goal as time expired.Harbaugh's Ravens went 180-113 in his 18 seasons, good for the fourth-best in the NFL in that span behind only the New England Patriots (193-100), the Pittsburgh Steelers (183-108-2) and the Green Bay Packers (182-108-3). His 13 playoff wins are tied for the seventh-most in NFL history along with Mike Holmgren. Harbaugh's eight road playoff wins are the most in NFL postseason history. He helped lead Baltimore to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history with a victory in Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers to conclude the 2012 season. Harbaugh earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 2019 when the Ravens produced a 14-2 record in quarterback Lamar Jackson's first of two NFL MVP campaigns. Blowing a 10-0 lead against the Steelers on Sunday night ended up being the final straw for Harbaugh, whose 26 blown leads of 10-plus points are the most by any coach since 2008 when he took over the Ravens' job. Twelve of them occurred over the last five seasons, which is five more than any other team in the NFL. After his 180 wins with the Ravens, the eighth-most by any coach with one team in NFL history, Harbaugh will now be arguably the most coveted coach of this NFL hiring cycle. Here's a look at his top five landing spots now that he is available.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns If Harbaugh desired to go the petty route, he could remain in the AFC North with the Cleveland Browns after they fired Kevin Stefanski. Cleveland needs a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom trading for and extending quarterback Deshaun Watson brought their franchise. Harbaugh oversaw the drafting and development of quarterback Joe Flacco, who won Super Bowl XLVII honors, and Jackson, who won NFL MVP honors in 2019 and 2023. Coaching soon-to-be two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher Myles Garrett after he just broke the league's single-season record with 23.0 in 2025 could be very appealing. He'll just need to help Cleveland navigate a successful search for a franchise quarterback after hitting on two with the Ravens in Flacco and Jackson. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are perhaps the most win-now option of the current NFL coaching vacancies given their young talent and being in the NFC South, a division the Carolina Panthers won with a losing record (8-9) in 2025.\nRunning back Bijan Robinson, at 23 years old, led the NFL in scrimmage yards (2,298). Wide receiver Drake London, 24, has flashed No. 1 wide receiver potential at times. Tight end Kyle Pitts, 25, is showing progress after producing a career-high 88 catches, the second-most in the NFL among tight ends in 2025. Defensively, the Falcons had the 2025 rookie leader in sacks and quarterback pressures (edge rusher James Pearce Jr. with 10.5 sacks and 45 quarterback pressures), the No. 2 2025 rookie leader in sacks (edge rusher Jalon Walker) and the 2025 rookie leader in interceptions (safety Xavier Watts with five). That's a strong foundation for a team whose division is up for grabs every season. If Harbaugh can help the Falcons get the quarterback position right, Atlanta could be a contender for years to come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants The New York Giants have their hopeful quarterback of the future in place with 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart. He ended his rookie year on a high note with 230 yards passing and two passing touchdowns while completing 22 of his 32 throws for a career-high 110.2 passer rating in a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers will be back for Year 3 fully recovered from a torn ACL. \nPro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL in sacks with 16.5, and the Giants also have Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with 2025 third overall pick edge rusher Abdul Carter developing on the other side of the defensive line as well. If Harbaugh wants to coach what is arguably the most talented defensive line in football with some offensive playmakers already in place, the Giants make plenty of sense. It will be interesting to see if he would want to work with general manager Joe Schoen or if he would prefer entering a new team with a general manager he already possesses an established rapport with. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders are a blank slate Harbaugh can mold in his own image since they have the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick. He can handpick his preferred quarterback between Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. \nHe would be pairing one of those passers with 2024 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty is the first rookie in NFL history with 900-plus rushing yards (975), five-plus rushing touchdowns (4) and five-plus receiving touchdowns (5). Plus, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, who will be in just his third season in 2026. Five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby is also a fantastic defensive foundation block. However, the AFC West is a gauntlet with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos, the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers and Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsThe Miami Dolphins still employ coach Mike McDaniel, but there's a chance that could change with Harbaugh's availability flipping the whole NFL coaching carousel upside down. Team owner Stephen Ross is a huge fan of the Harbaugh family as a prominent University of Michigan alum: the university's business school is named after the Dolphins owner. That could lead to Ross moving heaven and earth to land Harbaugh. Miami already has a general manager vacancy, so the Dolphins could offer Harbaugh the chance to pick his own GM.\nMiami will be headed toward a rebuild in 2026 and 2027 with the failed nature of the Tua Tagovailoa era that netted zero playoff wins, which could put the Dolphins in prime position to draft University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning in 2027. That setup, plus the opportunity to live in South Florida as Harbaugh enters his mid-60s, could be quite appealing. \n            ",

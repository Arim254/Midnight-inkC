There is no timetable for his return.According to The Athletic, Dahlin will return to his home country to support his fiancée, Carolina Matovac, who is in recovery from a heart transplant.\"He said everything is OK,\" Ruff said. \"He's got full support by our team.\"Dahlin and Matovac announced in September that the latter experienced major heart failure on vacation in France this summer. She received life-saving CPR for hours at a time and was transferred to a hospital, where she remained on life support for weeks while she awaited a heart transplant. Matovac had the transplant later in the summer and eventually returned to Sweden to continue the rehabilitation process.\n\"I think it's been incredibly hard,\" Ruff said. \"Not easy. I fully understand what this young man is going through. I don't think you can describe it, and I don't think you can feel what he's feeling. I'm pretty passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has undoubtedly got the support of everybody on this. This is larger than hockey.\"Dahlin embarked on the NHL season with the Sabres during Matovac's recovery but will step away temporarily after 14 games. Despite the heavy emotional toll of his fiancée's health, Dahlin was highly productive as the anchor of the Sabres' defense and accumulated nine points while averaging more than 24 minutes per contest.\"Family and person come before hockey,\" Ruff said. \"Hockey's our job. Hockey's our lifeline. But family and personal trump anything that comes before.\"\nThe Sabres selected Dahlin with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft. They will have to press on for the foreseeable future without their most reliable defenseman -- a three-time NHL All-Star who is in his second year as the team's captain.\n            \n    ",

This year, the team added former BYU standout QB, Jake Retzlaff, who is among the best dual threats in the sport. He is one of six FBS quarterbacks with 1,500 passing yards and 500 rushing yards, and he has seven total touchdowns over his last three games.The Green Wave also have an improving run defense which could make Memphis one dimensional on offense. Tulane has kept each of its last four opponents to under 3.9 yards per rush, thanks to a pair of disruptive defensive linemen. Santana Hopper and Harvey Dyson III have combined for 10.5 tackles for loss over this four-game stretch as the pair of transfers are making huge impacts in their first years in New Orleans. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Memphis can coverNo team in all of college football has more spread victories than the Tigers this year, who are 8-1 versus the line. That includes a 4-0 ATS mark at home as the team is 10-1-1 against the line dating back to last season. The Tigers also get to face a Tulane team which hasn't measured up when stepping up in class to face AP-ranked opponents. The Green Wave are 2-9 ATS on the road versus ranked teams over the last decade, and that includes three straight spread losses and straight-up defeats in these types of games.On the field, Memphis' 30 rushing touchdowns are tied for the most in FBS as four different Tigers have at least six rushing scores. If Lewis can go, he'll give Memphis a big boost. He leads the American with a 69.1% completion rate, and he's also averaging over 60 rushing yards per contest. Ryan Silverfield's crew also dominates when it comes to the all-important turnover stat as Memphis is riding a 13-game streak in which it has not lost the turnover battle. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Memphis vs. Tulane picksSportsLine's model has simulated Tulane vs. Memphis 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 62 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The NBA's interest in expanding its global reach has been well documented, and it goes beyond just playing preseason and regular season games in various countries. Commissioner Adam Silver has talked about the possibility of starting an NBA Europe league on numerous occasions, but there hasn't been much information beyond the league's interest in getting something off the ground. However, some of the league's plans went public Friday when NBA Europe managing director George Aivazoglou spoke at a conference in Milan, Italy.Silver has mentioned that there's been significant ownership interest from \"a lot of well known wealthy European families, American families and institutions,\" and with the backing of the NBA, it's certainly something that could happen in the near future. Silver previously pointed to 2027 or 2028 as a potential start date, but Aivazoglou said Friday that October 2027 is being targeted as the potential launch date for the league, according to The Associated Press. The current plan for the league consists of 16 teams, 12 of which would be permanent members, Aivazoglou said. Here's a list of the target countries and cities that could get teams, via the AP. Nothing has been formalized by the NBA. Great Britain: London and ManchesterFrance: Paris and LyonSpain: Madrid and BarcelonaItaly: Rome and MilanGermany: Munich and BerlinGreece: AthensTürkiye: IstanbulThe remaining four teams would qualify to join the league by winning either FIBA's Champions League, or based on their performance in their domestic leagues, Aivazoglou said. There have been no deals made with any cities or existing clubs, however, it's been mentioned that several EuroLeague teams would be considered as permanent members, like Spanish powerhouse club Real Madrid.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA commissioner Adam Silver isn't worried about losing talent to European league, but maybe he should be\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAivazoglou said that the first season may not feature all 16 teams as the league gets off the ground, but that is the long-term hope.\"We're well underway in our approach and engagement with the market,\" Aivagolozu said. \"We're having serious discussions with respect to investors.\"Another feature that is being considered with the creation of this league is having NBA teams face some of the European squads.\n\"One of the things that we'll do very soon after we launch this league is probably create a new tournament,\" Aivogolozu said.That tournament could be similar to the FIFA World Cup, but it would differ because players wouldn't necessarily be playing for their home countries.If this league were to get off the ground, it would certainly create some competition for the NBA. Silver's said in the past that he isn't concerned about losing talent to this league, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. It won't be an immediate concern, but perhaps down the line some top international players may consider staying in Europe instead of playing in the NBA in the United States.\nOn paper, this sounds like an exciting new venture for the league, and would be a great representation of how global the sport of basketball really is. There's a record 135 international players on NBA rosters this season, which represents roughly 30% of the total players in the league. This new league would show just how much global interest there is in basketball, and allows the NBA to expand on a level that can only be compared to soccer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin is kicking the can down the road.Wisconsin AD Chris McIntosh ended all speculation Thursday, going on-record that football coach Luke Fickell would return for 2026. That was always the expectation, even if some fans hoped that a new loss every week would lead McIntosh to change his mind and become the latest athletic director to swallow a large buyout so he could go spend even more money on a new coaching staff.Fickell's buyout was around $25 million, and anybody with an understanding of life in Madison these days understood how unlikely Wisconsin was to spend it. McIntosh indirectly told you again while discussing the future plans for Wisconsin under Fickell.\"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Any time somebody tells you they're going to significantly elevate the investment in the program, that means there's a lot of elevating that needs to be done. Simply put, Wisconsin hasn't been playing on the same financial field as the rest of its Big Ten brethren -- it participates in the rev-sharing that gives about $13 million to its football program, but it is clear its NIL offerings are lacking. It's a huge reason why Fickell has been so unsuccessful to this point, while other Big Ten programs, which were much further behind Wisconsin with on-the-field results when Fickell was hired, have been able to take such giant leaps forward.\n\n        \n            \n                Armed with Mark Cuban donations and Curt Cignetti's brash approach, Indiana sets up for sustained success\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIndiana and Illinois have seen the investment in their football programs significantly elevated already. That investment is a big reason why (hiring the right coach is the other big one) the Hoosiers are No. 2 in the country and on the verge of a second-straight playoff appearance, while Illinois is in position to win at least nine games in consecutive seasons for the first time in program history.As they've risen, Wisconsin has fallen. All of which seemed highly unlikely when the Fickell hire was announced. It was a move that was heralded by nearly everyone, including me, but Fickell is 14-19 at Wisconsin and 8-15 in Big Ten play. Fickell has been foiled by a lack of resources comparatively, as well as bad luck (injuries) and bad decisions (RIP Dairy Raid experiment).\nThe problem with the decision to bring Fickell back in 2026 is not about Fickell himself, though. He's still the same coach who led Cincinnati to the College Football Playoff as a Group of Five school. Wisconsin's schedule, which has been one of the most difficult in the country this year, will be far easier next season (though that should not be taken as it'll be easy, because they still have to play Notre Dame to start the season). No, the problem is money can't fix everything. At least, not the way Wisconsin needs it to. It's one thing to say you'll have an investment; it's another to actually have it. How much money will Chris McIntosh be able to raise for a program when everybody he's asking knows the situation both he and Fickell find themselves in? The simple truth is, unless Wisconsin suddenly churns out a bunch of wins next season, there's a high likelihood neither Fickell nor McIntosh sees the end of the 2026 season, let alone 2027.It's a lot easier to ask for money when there's hope to sell.Just look at the way one of Wisconsin's most prominent former players spoke about the program this week. On Wednesday's episode of The Pat McAfee Show, J.J. Watt didn't sound like a man who's very interested in throwing good money after bad.\nFor the sake of argument, though, let's say McIntosh is able to raise a significant amount of funds this offseason. Now, Wisconsin has a bunch of money it wants to fire at the transfer portal to overhaul the roster.Well, it's going to have to pay a premium on that talent, because like J.J. Watt, you and I know Fickell will be in one of the hottest seats in the country going into next season. So if there's a quarterback available in the portal, how much will Wisconsin have to pay to convince that player to come to Madison in that situation?\n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRemember, Wisconsin won't be the only Big Ten team looking for a QB in the portal this winter. Odds are, Indiana and Illinois will be sniffing around, too. Maybe Penn State's new coach brings a QB with him, or maybe the Nittany Lions are also fishing in the same waters.\nWhich option looks more attractive to you? An Indiana team coming off two playoff appearances, or a Wisconsin team where the coach you're signing up to play for could be fired by mid-October?The simple truth is, if Wisconsin had the kind of money available to pull off a Texas Tech and overhaul the program in one offseason, it would've paid the $25 million buyout to start over. But it doesn't, so it didn't.Wisconsin may be serious about putting more money into its football program, but it's far more likely to be another coach who reaps the benefits of that money than Luke Fickell.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The lead in the Big 12 will be on the line when the No. 7 BYU Cougars and No. 8 Texas Tech Red Raiders collide in a crucial matchup on Saturday at Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock. The Cougars (8-0, 5-0 in Big 12) sit atop the conference and are seeking back-to-back 9-0 starts for the first time in school history. Meanwhile, the Red Raiders (8-1, 5-1) are tied for second in the Big 12, with Cincinnati and are looking to end a 16-game losing streak against teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Top 25.The winner of Saturday's game will have an inside track to reaching the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 6 in Arlington, Texas, and move one step closer to a berth in the College Football Playoff. Bet college football Week 11, including Texas Tech vs. BYU, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:Saturday's game may come down to Texas Tech's ability to generate turnovers. The Red Raiders lead the conference and are tied for second in the country in takeaways (20), but the Cougars have committed the fewest turnovers in the Big 12 (six) and lead the conference in turnover margin (+10).Top sportsbooks have made Texas Tech a 10.5-point favorite over BYU. The line has risen slightly after opening at -10.Is that line movement an overreaction or market correction? Here's a look at the BYU-Texas Tech point spread, as well as the line movement on the other two matchups featuring two top 25 teams in the CFP rankings and two other games with big line changes. All times Eastern.No. 7 BYU at No. 8 Texas Tech (noon)Open: Texas Tech -10 Current: Texas Tech -10.5The point spread for the game of the week has remained pretty steady from the start. Even the reports on Wednesday that Cougars running back LJ Martin is expected to play didn't drop this line into single digits. This is significant since A, the Red Raiders haven't been a double-digit favorite against a ranked team in the last 30 years, and B, BYU is just the fourth FBS team in the last 10 years to enter a conference game 8-0 or better as a double-digit underdog. Both teams have been bettors' best friends this season; Texas Tech is 7-2 against-the-spread, and BYU is 6-2 ATS.Bet Week 11 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Click here:Bowling Green at Eastern Michigan (1 p.m.)Open: Bowling Green -2 Current: Eastern Michigan -2.5This game features the biggest line move of the week, with Bowling Green (3-6, 1-4 in MAC) going from a small favorite to a small underdog. This seems like a market correction. The Falcons rank 124th in the country in total offense (304.9 yards per game) and 123rd in scoring offense (18.2 points per game), which prompted the firing of offensive coordinator Travis Partridge earlier this week. Bowling Green also played last week, while the Eagles are coming off a bye.FIU at Middle Tennessee (3 p.m.)Open: FIU -2.5 Current: Middle Tennessee -1.5Bettors prefer how the Blue Raiders (1-7, 0-4 in Conference USA) have played recently more than the Panthers (3-5, 2-3) have, making Middle Tennessee a small favorite after opening as a 2.5-point underdog. Though the Blue Raiders have lost five in a row, each of the last three games have been decided by three points or fewer. That includes a three-point defeat last week against Jacksonville State, which is currently tied atop the conference. On the other hand, the Panthers have lost four of their last five games, with the average point differential being 14.0 points a game. In addition Middle Tennessee has won nine of the last 10 meetings between the teams played in Tennessee.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 22 Missouri (3:30 p.m.)Open: Texas A&M -7 Current: Texas A&M -7Here's another point spread that has been pretty much spot-on from the start. This line has toggled between -7 and -6.5 all week and doesn't figure to move much if at all before kickoff since none of the players who are questionable are potential line-movers. This game will come down to whether the Tigers (6-2, 2-2 in SEC) can reignite their potent ground game after averaging just 3.1 yards per rush over the last two weeks. Missouri doesn't want to rely on true freshman quarterback Matt Zollers, who will be making his first college start, to drop back too many times against the defense that leads the country in sacks per game (4.00).No. 9 Oregon at No. 20 Iowa (3:30 p.m.)Open: Oregon -6 Current: Oregon -6.5This line opened at some places with the Ducks favored by 5.5 and has inched up to 6.5, but a couple sportsbooks have juiced this to -115 on Oregon, which tells me that they don't want to move this number to -7. That's interesting because the Hawkeyes have struggled in these type of games recently. They are 1-8-2 ATS in their last 11 games against ranked teams and 0-6 ATS in their last six games against top 10 teams. Meanwhile, the Ducks are 11-3 ATS as road favorites under coach Dan Lanning.\n            ",

Stroud, James Cook and Alvin Kamara will play into Week 10 Fantasy football decisions this week. As will the bye for the Chiefs and Cowboys, taking players like Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Travis Kelce out of the mix. There are some players coming back, however, either from injury or from last week's bye. Among those returning to action off a bye are Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Breece Hall -- who remained with the Jets despite trade rumors -- and Emeka Egbuka.

Despite that, he may not warrant a spot in Week 10 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in WR rankings. Diggs has salvaged his Fantasy value over the last two weeks with a touchdown in each game, but he had only 52 total yards and three catches in each. Over his last four games, the veteran is averaging just 37.3 receiving yards, and for the season, Diggs has only two games with at least 70 yards.The Patriots are seeing their younger receivers, namely Pop Douglas and Kayshon Boutte, emerge as each player has more touchdown catches than Diggs' pair on the season. Additionally, Diggs doesn't have the best Week 10 matchup versus Tampa, which has done a good job at keeping receivers out of the endzone. Over the last 14 touchdowns scored against the Bucs, just three of them have come via wideouts, as Diggs is a player to fade this week.Another curveball: The model is high on Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart, who is being started in fewer than half of Fantasy leagues. The rookie has rushing touchdowns in each of his last four games and also has a 7:1 TD:INT over that stretch. Dart's legs are one of his biggest Fantasy assets as only Jayden Daniels is averaging more rushing yards per start, amongst quarterbacks, and only Josh Allen has more rushing touchdowns at the position.On Sunday, he gets to face one of the most Fantasy-friendly defenses to running quarterbacks as just six teams allow more rushing yards per game to QBs than the Bears. Chicago was also shredded thru the air by Joe Flacco on Sunday, to the tune of 470 passing yards and four touchdowns. With Chicago having the No. 29 scoring defense and ranking 25th versus the pass, Dart finds himself in the top 10 of positional rankings.

    "body": "\n        Who's scoring this week? That's what every NFL gambler wants to know. Anytime touchdown wagers have become one of the most popular bets these days, whether you're constructing a parlay or looking for a long shot.Last week, I cashed on THREE of my top five picks. Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle found the end zone at +220, Denver Broncos rookie running back RJ Harvey did as well at +350, and then Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen cashed at +105. Let's see what I have cooking for this week. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 10. These will not be predictable choices like Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor, but they won't be wild long shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with the NFL game in Berlin on Sunday morning. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet.\nOdds: -135Jonathan Taylor and Bijan Robinson will meet in Germany as two of three players in the NFL with 1,000 scrimmage yards entering Week 10. Taylor is an absurd -320 to find the end zone, so let's go with the other star running back in Robinson. I like this bet for two reasons. One, Robinson is a dynamic threat who can score on the ground or through the air, and two, he hasn't scored a touchdown in two games after scoring in three straight contests. The point is -- he's due. There are people out there who believe the Indianapolis Colts will easily cover against the Falcons in this international game. I'm not so sure.\n\nOdds: +160The weather at Soldier Field on Sunday is going to be nasty. Weather.com predicts the high will be 37 degrees with 20 to 30 mile-per-hour winds. That means Chicago is going to rely on its No. 2-ranked rushing attack with D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai.Swift (-105 anytime TD) has scored touchdowns in the past four games he's played in (he missed last week due to injury), so let's bet on Monangai. He's coming off a career-high 176 rushing yards vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, and he found the end zone in the Bears' last home game against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nOdds: +115I think the play of J.J. McCarthy vs. the Detroit Lions last week was very surprising. I did not see him upsetting Dan Campbell's squad coming off a bye at home. In that game, Jefferson caught his second touchdown of the season, and I think he can take advantage of a bottom-five pass defense. Maybe bet the over on his longest reception as well. \n\nOdds: +145Despite the loss last week, LaPorta tied a season high with six receptions for 97 yards and a touchdown vs. the Vikings. I feel like the Lions are about to unleash hell on the spiraling Washington Commanders -- who have struggled to cover tight ends this year (along with everyone else). I went back and looked, and sure enough, Washington has allowed touchdowns to tight ends in THREE straight games -- including two from Jake Ferguson in Week 7. \n\nOdds: +110Saquon at plus money? Yes, it's true. So get on this before it changes. Barkley finally got back on track vs. the New York Giants last week, rushing 14 times for 150 yards and a touchdown. He also caught four passes for 24 yards and another score. The Green Bay Packers are favored over the Eagles, which confuses me since Philly is healthy and coming off a bye. Nick Sirianni has never lost coming off a bye, by the way. Barkley scored touchdowns in half of his games played last year, so this is a good bet. \n            ",

Smith Center on Friday in Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels and Jayhawks both opened the season with a win earlier this week, and this game will mark the first major test of the season for both programs.Kansas is led by star freshman Darryn Peterson, who could very well be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Peterson scored 21 points in his collegiate debut Monday in the Jayhawks' 94-51 win over Green Bay. The Jayhawks have won the last five meetings against the Tar Heels.North Carolina also has a star freshman of its own in Caleb Wilson. The former blue-chip recruit scored 22 points during UNC's 94-54 win over Central Arkansas. Wilson is a projected lottery pick this summer. The Jayhawks are one of three ranked teams the Tar Heels will face before ACC play begins.\n        \n            \n                Tracking college basketball freshman debuts: Cameron Boozer, AJ Dybantsa impress, Koa Peat explodes\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere is everything you need to know ahead of North Carolina's matchup with Kansas on Friday.\nWhere to watch Kansas vs. North Carolina live Date: Friday, Nov. 7 | Time: 7 p.m. ET  Location: Dean E.

Because of the blowout, Peterson didn't play as much as he could've. That won't be the case against the Tar Heels. This is a chance for both programs to pick up a statement win and an opportunity to watch two projected lottery picks square off against each other. My prediction is that Peterson has a big game in front of a hostile environment and Kansas pulls off the upset win on the road. Pick: Kansas +1.5Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            UNC -1.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nNorth Carolina -2.5 vs. KansasNorth Carolina's roster is headlined by star freshman Caleb Wilson, who scored 22 points in 24 minutes against Central Arkansas on Monday. The Tar Heels cruised to a 94-54 win in that game, shooting 50.8% from the floor while holding the Bears to 31.3% shooting. Wilson was one of five double-digit scorers. Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar added 14 points and 10 rebounds in his first game with the school, and North Carolina has one of the best home atmospheres in the country.

Anyone following its college football betting picks or NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Friday best bets at FanDuel SportsbookCeltics vs. Magic: Under 226.5 total points (-110)Northwestern (+13.5) vs. USC (+100)North Carolina (-1.5) vs. Kansas (-118)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at FanDuel would result in a payout of +584 (risk $100 to win $584). Bet it at FanDuel here:\nCeltics vs. Magic: Under 226.5 total points (-110)The Celtics have the No. 1 scoring defense in the NBA, allowing just 109.3 ppg, as without Jayson Tatum (Achilles) in the lineup, Boston needs to put an even heavier emphasis on defense than in recent seasons. These were the top two defensive teams in the NBA last season, though, with the Magic as the No. 1 scoring defense, allowing 105.5 ppg. The Magic are 15th in the league at 117.6 ppg this season, but that defensive focus remains in Orlando. The Magic are 20th in scoring offense with Boston 24th, as this has all the ingredients of an Under total. The model projects the Under to hit in 68% of simulations. Back the Under at FanDuel Sportsbook:Northwestern (+13.5) vs. USC (+100)\"The Trojans can thank their lucky stars that Nebraska QB Dylan Raiola got injured in the second half last week at Lincoln with the Huskers up 14-6 and driving inside of USC territory,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Nebraska's offense would then effectively stop as frosh QB TJ Lateef couldn't throw the ball downfield, netting just 7 pass yards the rest of the night, while USC rallied to a 21-17 win. Northwestern hasn't played USC at the Coliseum since 1969, but it's a better Northwestern team, and better than last year too, more resembling David Braun's 2023 overachievers, only this time with a real QB in the fold (SMU transfer Preston Stone) while a gnarly defense has helped NU to five straight covers.\" Back Northwestern at FanDuel Sportsbook:North Carolina (-1.5) vs. Kansas (-118)North Carolina vs. Kansas is one of those dream matchups for college basketball fans, and after the Jayhawks defeated the Tar Heels in Kansas last year in their first regular-season matchup since 2002, now they need to come to Chapel Hill. And the model projects North Carolina to protect its home court, as it has the vast majority of times in recent years. The Tar Heels went 26-4 at home over their previous two seasons, and opened the year with a 40-point victory over Central Arkansas in Chapel Hill. Caleb Wilson, the No. 8 recruit in the Class of 2025 by 247Sports, scored 22 points in his debut as the prized recruit of the No. 5 freshman class in the nation. North Carolina also returns its third-leading scorer in Seth Trimble, who averaged 11.6 ppg last season. Kansas lost its top six leading scorers from last season, leading the model to project North Carolina to cover in 51% of simulations. Back North Carolina at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more Friday picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Friday.

What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                    To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                  What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                  To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                  If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.              Ready to get off on the right foot?

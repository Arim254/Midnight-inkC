    "description": "<div>\n<p>Every Thursday during the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season, I'll release my favo",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Every Thursday during the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season, I'll release my favorite spots to bet for the upcoming week. </p><p>A great example of a \"spot\" play is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt's</a> upset over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> last season. The Commodores were returning home after two straight road losses, while Alabama was coming off an emotional win over No. 2 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>. Vanderbilt won the game outright as a 23-point underdog. We will see more opportunities like this once the season gets going based on travel, results, and injuries.</p><p>Just for clarification, I'll always mention if I bet the game personally. Sometimes, I will like the spot for a certain team but my numbers may not see enough value to make it an official play. </p><p>Here are three strong betting spots for Week 7</p><h3>Oregon State +3 vs. Wake Forest</h3>\n<p>Oregon State is 0-6, but I think the Beavers could win their first game on Saturday. This is an awful spot for Wake Forest coming off two emotional ACC games and now traveling across the country to Corvallis. </p><p>Wake Forest starting quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3176873/robby-ashford/\">Robby Ashford</a> is also a little banged up and while he is expected to play, he could be limited as a runner. Ashford is completing just 59% of his passes with two touchdowns and four interceptions, so it will be advantage Beavers if he can't run as much on Saturday. </p><p>Oregon State has played better at home than on the road. They should have beaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a> before losing by three in overtime and fell to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FRESNO/fresno-state-bulldogs/\">Fresno State</a> because they couldn't execute a long snap. I'm selling high on the Demon Deacons after beating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a> and losing by one to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a> in overtime. </p><p>The furthest Wake Forest has traveled this season is Blacksburg, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a>. The Demon Deacons are a young team, so we will see how they respond to traveling through three time zones to face a winless opponent this week. I made this line closer to pick and gave out the Beavers at +3.</p><h3>No. 14 Missouri +3 vs. No. 8 Alabama</h3>\n<p>I love this spot for Missouri. The Tigers get Alabama at home coming off the Georgia win and a big revenge game against Vanderbilt. </p><p>Missouri hasn't played the toughest schedule, but something that can keep the Tigers in this game is on paper, they lead college football in rush offense and rush defense. Alabama obviously represents a step up in competition from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> - Missouri's toughest opponents to date. However, if the Tigers can compete in the trenches against one of college football's top offensive and defensive lines, they have a good chance to pull off the upset. </p><p>While I do like the spot for Missouri, the reason I haven't bet it is because we lost value on the line. Last week, Alabama was -6.5 but the line re-opened at 3.5 and got bet down to -3. I make the number Alabama -5, so right now it's just not high enough for me to bite. </p><p>I do expect this to be a very tight game throughout. I recommend taking Missouri at anything over +4 if the odds move closer to kickoff. Other options are to put the Tigers in a teaser or wait to see if we get a better number live.</p><h3>Arkansas +12.5 vs. No. 12 Tennessee</h3>\n<p>Arkansas fired Sam Pittman during its bye week and named Bobby Petrino the interim head coach. Petrino then fired the defensive coordinator. The Hogs sure seem like a mess right now, so why is this a good spot for Arkansas?</p><p>The good news for the Razorbacks is they are catching Tennessee at a perfect time. The Vols are coming off a bye and face Alabama next week. It's not easy for college kids to spend an off week totally focused on a team that just canned its head coach without looking ahead to the Crimson Tide a little bit. </p><p>Arkansas players seem to be responding well to the coaching change with no one opting out. It could just be lip service but a lot of the kids are saying they are re-focused on the rest of the season under Petrino. Let's be honest, they weren't focused the last time out against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a>. The Fighting Irish are a good team but that was an embarrassing effort by the Hogs, leading to Pittman's firing. </p><p>I also still have major concerns about Tennessee's defense. This is a unit that allowed an average of 34 points in its last three games against Georgia, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UAB/uab-blazers/\">UAB</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>. Say what you want about Arkansas but the Hogs can score. Take away the dud against Notre Dame and Petrino's offense has topped 30 points in every game this season. </p><p>This line was 13.5 most of the week before moving to 12.5. I would consider the Razorbacks at that number. I also like Over 27.5 on Arkansas' team total . I think <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26697553/taylen-green/\">Taylen Green</a> and Co. will have enough success offensively to stay within the number.</p>\n            </div>",

The Argentinian coach, who won the 2007 edition of the Copa Libertadores with Boca Juniors, was diagnosed with prostate cancer back in 2017 but in June 2025 accepted his third stint with the team in his career. </p><p>Over the years, he coached multiple clubs in and outside the country, including Al-Nassr from 2021 to 2022. After, days of home treatments as his health conditions got worse, on Wednesday Boca Juniors announced: \"Miguel Angel Russo leaves much more at Boca than just the pleasant memories of his triumphs as head coach. What remains are his style and methods—if one may use a rhetorical device he perfected during his third and briefest stint at the club—for taking on challenges, pushing limits, and earning respect from both allies and rivals. He was passionate about his work, a tenacious fighter in every situation, and a reference point first as a player and later as a coach.\"</p>\n<p>Numerous clubs showed their support after his passing, <a href=\"https://www.realmadrid.com/es-ES/noticias/club/comunicados/comunicado-oficial-fallecimiento-de-miguel-angel-russo-09-10-2025\" target=\"_blank\">including Real Madrid</a>.</p>\n<p>Russo led Boca Juniors at the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this summer but decided to step back in the last weeks due to his health conditions. His last official match was on Sept. 21 against Central Cordoba at the Bombonera Stadium in Buenos Aires, and since then his assistants Claudio Ubeda and Juvenal Rodríguez took charge of the first team. Russo is considered one of the biggest figures of Argentinian soccer, as he also coached San Lorenzo, Racing Club and was previously at Estudiantes, where he played his whole career as a midfielder, winning two league titles in 1982 and 1983. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

A season undone by errors. By careless mistakes. By mental lapses. What happened here felt fitting: a final collapse that mirrored everything they'd been all year. </p><p>\"I've been thinking about that since it happened,\" said Chisholm, who couldn't come up with Andrés Giménez's sharp grounder, following <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-nlds-game-3-alds-game-4-live-updates-scores-results/live/#post-e12fcccb\" target=\"_blank\">the Yankees' 5-2 loss</a>. \"Still thinking about it. Still can't get out of my head, but at the end of the day, we got to move on eventually.\" </p>\n<p>The Chisholm error erased what should have been an easy inning-ending double play, with the Yankees still trailing 2-1. Instead, it turned what had been another quality start from rookie Cam Schlittler into a distant memory. His night was done after 6 ⅓ innings. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066820/devin-williams/\">Devin Williams</a> came in and two more runs crossed the plate.</p><p>New York couldn't escape this flaw.

Guerrero hit .529/.550/1.059 (a 1.609 OPS) in 20 ALDS plate appearances. Not against a team that, collectively, hit .338/.373/.601. No, that's not a typo. </p><p>Their swings are built for this moment, built for postseason baseball.

The Blue Jays compiled an 80.6 contact percentage this season, the highest in the majors, and their 9.4 percent whiff rate ranked second lowest in baseball. In this series alone, they went 15 for 37 with runners in scoring position. So it was almost expected when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2227773/nathan-lukes/\">Nathan Lukes</a> peppered a ball over the head of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117930/anthony-volpe/\">Anthony Volpe</a> to score two runs in the seventh.</p><p>Schlittler, whose stuff was a tick down, struck out just two batters after fanning 12 in Game 3 of the Wild Card Series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a>.</p><p>\"We make a lot of contact,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"That's been evident throughout the year. I think the epitome of it is Nathan Lucas facing Devin Williams, knowing he's probably going to get a fastball because Vlad's sitting on deck and not being afraid to commit to it, knowing the changeup is his best pitch. Guys have a plan when they go up there, and we try to utilize everyone's skill set to the best that we can.\" </p>\n<p>Schneider sat at the press conference table, champagne dripping from his hair, the smell still hanging on his black T-shirt. Down the hall, the Blue Jays were loud -- soaked in the same stuff, their clubhouse echoing with Sinatra's \"New York, New York.\" It always tastes a little sweeter in the Bronx.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Yankees sat in silence, trying to soak in what just happened. How could the team Boone and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> both called their best fall short again? Two rounds short of last year's disappointing World Series defeat.</p><p>\"It comes down to the little things,\" Judge said, standing in the middle of the clubhouse, pinstripes still on, eyes fixed toward the distance. \"You can't give teams extra outs.\"</p>\n<p>The Blue Jays have their flaws, no doubt, a thin rotation among them. The bullpen has underwhelmed, too. But what they do well, the Yankees, to some degree, don't. Toronto ranked fourth in the majors this year with 51 defensive runs saved. New York ranked 13th with 30, improving late in the season. The Blue Jays also ranked ninth in the big leagues with 16 outs above average, per Baseball Savant. The Yankees were 18th at minus-4.</p><p>\"I mean, that's part of what I've been talking about the last couple of months,\" Boone said.\"I think we're at this point, a really good defensive team. It became that we had to go through some tough moments in the middle of the season, you know. You know what came out of it became a really good and well-rounded club. That's why this hurts.\" </p><p>Boone's press conference, in part, felt like his own therapy session. He talked about this loss hurting. That he's been \"chasing a World Series all my life.\" </p>\n<p>\"It was just a hard year,\" said Boone. </p><p>As such, the flaws reared their head. They always do when it matters most. The offense, known for its slug, couldn't find it Wednesday. It's hard to live on home runs in October. The pitching is better then. </p><p>\"Very disappointed,\" added Chisholm. \"I feel like we all, everybody in here believe that we had such a great team.\" </p><p>The Blue Jays' celebration spilled onto the infield dirt. Families gathered around shortstop, the mound and second base, the same spot where Chisholm's error silenced any thought that the Yankees still had a chance. </p>\n<p>They'll have to regroup. Retool around a superstar whose prime is slipping away, one wasted October at a time.</p><p>Chisholm, meanwhile, will carry the error with him. It's still raw. It'll sit with him for a while -- the double play that wasn't, the flip to Anthony Volpe that never came. </p><p>Chisholm will look back again. </p><p>\"I'm still going to be thinking about this even probably when the season starts next year,\" he said.</p>\n            </div>",

We'll find out soon enough.

Acosta did an excellent job earlier this week of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-offense-showing-major-flaws-can-they-fix-them/\" target=\"_blank\">breaking down some of the Eagles' issues</a></span> on offense:</p><blockquote><p>In an era of teams playing more two-high shells, the foundation of the Eagles' offense is simple: they force teams out of two-high shells via the most punishing run game on early downs and against light boxes (six or fewer players in the tackle box). They have the best offensive line in the NFL and a built-in run threat in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a>, who forces teams into moving a safety into the tackle box, and that's when they take their shots throwing to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith on the outside.</p><p>The Eagles forced teams to play the World's Hardest Game, and just like when I actually played that game online as a kid, many teams failed. But in 2025, there seems to be more answers to stopping the Eagles' offense, and it has to do with their personnel. Left guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253017/landon-dickerson/\">Landon Dickerson</a> has been dealing with knee and back injuries since the preseason and left the Broncos game with an injury. Saquon Barkley is also nursing a knee injury, although he should be ready to go for Thursday's tilt against the Giants. It was already going to be difficult to replace the impact of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a> in the run game, but with Dickerson less than 100%, it has made the formula for the Eagles' offense turn sour. </p><p>Philadelphia still wants to run the ball on early downs; through five games this season, its early-down pass rate of 52.6% is almost in lockstep with their early-down pass rate of 51.2% in 2024. However, it had an EPA per carry of 0.057 on early downs last season, absolutely mowing teams down in the run game even without Hurts using his legs. </p><p>This season? The Eagles have dropped to -0.051, a drastic difference in how explosive they are on the ground on first and second down. Per Sports Information Solutions, their Positive Play Rate on these early-down runs has dropped from 43.2% to 38.6%, a precipitous fall in one offseason. This is also compounded by their inability to punish light boxes like they did last season. If you tried to defend the Eagles with six or fewer in the tackle box in 2024, you were asking to get run over; their 5.9 yards per carry and 0.16 EPA per carry against light boxes through the first five games of 2024 were the engine of a dominant offense. In 2025, that's gone down to 3.9 yards per carry (tied with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> for second-worst in the NFL) and -0.02 EPA per carry. They've simply been a poor rushing team this season, and when your identity is compromised, it makes everything else fall apart.</p><p>What was on display Sunday against the Broncos was a team trying to figure out who they are against one of the best defenses in the NFL. As their run game floundered, the RPOs that were working in the first half got cut short by a Broncos defense that sent more zone coverage at the Eagles than they expected. Hurts on those zone coverage plays: 14 of 23 for 138 yards, with six sacks taken. </p><p>This is also another issue for the Eagles' offense: they simply are not good when teams play zone against them in passing situations. In 2025, Hurts is 33rd among all QBs with 50 attempts against zone in success rate, compared to ninth against man coverage. This isn't just a 2025 thing, however: Hurts was 22nd in success rate vs. zone compared to second vs. man in 2024. It's not just throwing zone at the Eagles that clutters their pass game plan, however. Simulated pressures have been an issue for Hurts and the Eagles this season, bringing guys from depth while still getting four into the pass rush. These plays for the Eagles' passing offense have been all over their tape this season: a lack of answers against zone and a quarterback who isn't working quickly enough to help mitigate those.</p></blockquote><p>For the most part, the Philadelphia offense has operated too far at the extreme ends of the spectrum. </p><p>The Eagles have either gone absurdly run heavy and conservative with their passing game, like they did for 3.5 of the first four games of the year, or they have fully unleashed the passing attack and barely showed interest in the run, like they did in the second half of their game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> and then again in their game against the Broncos. You can't consistently operate at those extremes and be as effective as the Eagles were for most of last season. </p><p>It hasn't helped that, as Acosta noted, the run game hasn't been as effective this year. Part of that is the offensive line. Part of it is Barkley not being as explosive this year. Part of it is that Hurts <a href=\"https://x.com/denizselman33/status/1975945047662006307\" target=\"_blank\">hasn't been used in the designed run game</a> nearly as often as in years past. The passing game also hasn't been as effective, specifically because of the struggles against zone, and part of that may be affected by the fact that Brown has <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/scottspratt.bsky.social/post/3m2pca4nu5s27\" target=\"_blank\">not been open</a> quite as often as in years past. Part of it may also be affected by the line. And part of it is that Hurts isn't playing fast enough or pushing the ball downfield often enough.</p><p>How this all works against the Giants' defense will be interesting to watch. New York has an incredibly talented defensive line, and it dominated the game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> two weeks ago. But that line has also looked ordinary at times this season. </p><p>The matchup between that group and Philly's offensive line likely decides how the matchup goes on this side of the ball, because opportunities should be there for the Eagles to take if they can block things up along the front. The Giants are 31st in the NFL in rushing success rate allowed, per Tru Media, and they've already given up 14 explosive runs. Barkley will have chances to rip off long runs if the Eagles can get him to the second level.</p><p>The Giants are 12th in EPA allowed per dropback and have specifically done a good job of limiting explosives. But they play more man coverage than almost any team in the league, on 38.1% of opponent dropbacks. It'll be interesting to see if they abandon that strategy to play more zone and lean into what has been an Eagles weakness to date.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-offense-showing-major-flaws-can-they-fix-them/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>An identity crisis in Philadelphia: Eagles' offense showing major flaws, can Philly fix them?</p>\n                <p>\n                    JP Acosta                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"An identity crisis in Philadelphia: Eagles' offense showing major flaws, can Philly fix them?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/81de63b3-0623-4b5f-b007-58e8ed9b201b/thumbnail/270x152/e4fa0565c1ba80d916e30d359b87f94f/hurts.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>When the Giants have the ball</h2><p>We wrote a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-offense-looked-different-with-jaxson-dart-replacing-russell-wilson-how-rookie-qb-handled-first-start/\" target=\"_blank\">big story last week</a></span> about the ways the Giants' offense looked different with Jaxson Dart under center than it did with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> at the controls. Much of that stayed the same in Dart's second start against New Orleans, though there were some things that changed.</p>\n<ul><li>Quarterback run game: Dart has 17 carries in his two starts. He's both getting more designed runs than Wilson and especially scrambling away from pressure much more often than his predecessor did. </li><li>Short and quick passing game: In Dart's first start, 62.5% of his passes were thrown within 2.5 seconds of the snap, and he has an average depth of throw of just 6.3 yards, per Tru Media. In his second start, those numbers shifted pretty significantly to 40.0% and 8.2 air yards per attempt. Those figures were much more in line with where Wilson was during his time as the starter, and it's probably not a coincidence that Dart didn't look quite as comfortable as he did in his first action -- even while playing against an inferior defense to the one he faced in that debut start.</li><li>Limited true dropbacks: In his first start, 62% of Dart's passing plays were considered \"true\" dropbacks by Tru Media. That means passing plays that contained no play action and were not either screens or run-pass options. In Week 5, that number was down even further, to 51% of dropbacks. This isn't a bad thing. It's an attempt to give a rookie quarterback easy answers and limit the possibility of mistakes. His two picks against the Saints both came on \"true\" dropbacks. Two of his three touchdown passes so far have come on either play-action or shovel passes. </li><li>Sacks and hits: Dart got battered and bruised in his first action against the Chargers, but he and the Giants did a better job limiting the volume of hits he took against the Saints. </li></ul><p>Now Dart runs into one of the best defenses in the NFL. The Eagles are tied for ninth in opponents' EPA per play -- coincidentally tied with the Chargers -- per Tru Media.</p><p>The ways you want to attack the Eagles, though, are probably the ways the Giants want to attack offensively. Because Philly plays so much zone coverage (73.8% of opponent dropbacks) and so many light boxes, the best way to attack the defense is to run the ball and throw the ball into the underneath areas of the field. That's what the Giants want to do to begin with, with Dart under center.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/\">Cam Skattebo</a> has a chance to get on track if the Giants' offensive line can hold up. Philadelphia has yielded an average of 2.01 yards before contact per rush, according to Tru Media, which ranks 29th in the NFL. The thing the Eagles do better than most defenses is limit yards after contact, but Skattebo is great at creating those yards -- that's probably his biggest strength as a player. It'll be fascinating to see if he can do it against a defense designed to limit that aspect of opposing run games.</p>\n<p>It could prove more difficult to move the ball through the air. Without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\">Malik Nabers</a>, the Giants' perimeter weapons were already limited. Now they'll be without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183982/darius-slayton/\">Darius Slayton</a> due to a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-6-injury-report-updates-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">hamstring injury</a></span>. It's really hard to move the ball down the field with underneath passes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124107/wandale-robinson/\">Wan'Dale Robinson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162129/theo-johnson/\">Theo Johnson</a>, especially against a team that rallies to underneath passes and limits yards after the catch. It's especially difficult if the line can't keep him well-protected and if he keeps taking hits like he did in that first game against Los Angeles.</p><h2>Eagles vs. Giants prediction</h2>\n<p>The Eagles have been cutting things close throughout the entire season, but they are still among the most talented teams in the NFL. Even going on the road against a division rival, that talent should shine through. The Giants might be able to keep it relatively close, but we like the Eagles to bounce back from their first loss.</p><p><strong>Pick: Eagles 23, Giants 14 | <em>Eagles -7, under 40.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

The legendary coach has not only seen the Tar Heels take a step back on the football field, playing like one of the worst power-conference teams in the country, but has also failed to lay any sort of foundation of a strong locker room culture for which his Patriots teams were famous. </p><p>Instead, there are mounting reports of program dysfunction that have led to greater interest in exactly what is going on under Belichick. Among those seeking answers is UNC's student body president, Adolfo Alvarez, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6701293/2025/10/08/bill-belichick-unc-buyout-coach-first-season/\" target=\"_blank\">called for transparency</a> from the school in the form of an \"independent review\" while speaking with The Athletic: </p><blockquote><p>\"I do think that the university should launch an independent review of the culture that's happening within the team, in the locker room, because I think that there should be zero tolerance for non-compliance,\" Alvarez said.</p><p>Alvarez stressed his main concern was the well-being of the players.</p><p>\"Even though sometimes student-athletes can be seen as young professional players, at the end of the day, they are students, they're young, and they are part of our community,\" Alvarez said. \"They're under a lot of pressure and they're very often under the national media circus. Especially right now with coach Belichick. That shouldn't come at the cost of their well-being, and their families also deserve to feel included, and they deserve to feel like they're getting the same consistency that UNC was known for under our last coach.\"</p></blockquote><p>Belichick and athletic director Bubba Cunningham <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/north-carolina-backs-bill-belichick-pledges-full-support-as-rumors-swirl-about-coachs-job-status/\" target=\"_blank\">handed out short, lukewarm statements</a></span> about their commitment to each other late on Wednesday night, but that did nothing to calm the onslaught of questions and frustration from the UNC faithful. </p>\n<p>Firing Belichick without cause would be difficult because his <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/bill-belichick-buyout-what-would-it-cost-north-carolina-to-move-on-from-coach-as-tar-heels-struggle-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">buyout is more than $20 million right now</a></span>. If Belichick leaves on his own or is fired with cause, North Carolina could cut bait before things get worse without the prohibitive cost; however, recent examples of coaches being fired for cause due to violations have led to legal battles, with the schools still paying much of the buyout anyway. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/a-hollow-vote-of-confidence-caps-bill-belichicks-most-absurd-week-yet-at-unc-and-its-only-wednesday/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>A hollow vote of confidence caps Bill Belichick's most absurd week yet at UNC (and it's only Thursday)</p>\n                <p>\n                    Richard Johnson                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"A hollow vote of confidence caps Bill Belichick's most absurd week yet at UNC (and it's only Thursday)\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/09/7a4ef890-7c26-46e8-bbb7-0609319f6e7d/thumbnail/270x152/c4cb7584288f0e5912f395e90b88c805/billbelichick.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>It's not clear whether there's been anything truly untoward going on in the football program, or if it is simply a dysfunctional, disorganized mess.

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> world is rubbernecking at a seemingly never-ending car crash in Chapel Hill, and the embarrassment is so great that the student body president now wants a full accounting of what's happening. </p>\n            </div>",

Las Vegas held a 17-point lead in the final frame, but Phoenix mounted a furious charge to tie the game before Wilson's final bucket. Now, the Aces are one win away from their third WNBA title in the last four years.</li><li><strong>Three MLB teams extend their seasons in do-or-die</strong> <strong>games.</strong> The Tigers, Cubs and Phillies all played like desperate teams yesterday and fought to see another day. Detroit's offense came alive just in the nick of time. Chicago exploded for four runs in the first inning and held on from there. Kyle Schwarber set the tone for Philadelphia in a rout of the Dodgers. Stay tuned right here for all the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-nlds-game-3-alds-game-4-live-updates-scores-results/live/#post-b10e7059\" target=\"_blank\">results and schedules</a> as the division series continue.</li><li><strong>Joe Flacco</strong> <strong>has officially been named the Bengals' starting QB</strong>. Just one day after Flacco arrived in Cincinnati, coach Zac Taylor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-flacco-to-start-against-packers-bengals-zac-taylor-explains-why-veteran-qb-is-best-fit-for-cincinnati/\">named him the starter</a>. Flacco replaces Jake Browning, and the good news is it can't get much worse for the Bengals offense. On the other end of the trade, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-flacco-trade-reactions-packers-browns-bengals/\">was caught off guard by the deal</a>.</li><li><strong>Eagles LB Nakobe Dean is on track to make his season debut on Thursday night</strong>. As Week 6 of the NFL season begins, the Eagles defense will get a big boost with Dean <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nakobe-dean-injury-eagles-linebacker-expected-to-make-season-debut-against-giants/\" target=\"_blank\">coming back into the fold</a></span>. More good injury news for Philly -- and bad news for the Giants -- Saquon Barkley <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/saquon-barkley-injury-eagles-rb-knee-says-he-has-general-soreness-is-excited-to-play-giants-on-tnf/\">downplayed the foot injury</a> he's been dealing with this week.</li><li><strong>College athletes are one step closer to being allowed to gamble on pro sports.</strong> At the moment, sports betting of all kinds is forbidden for NCAA athletes. That could change <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ncaa-di-administrative-committee-votes-to-remove-ban-on-college-athletes-betting-on-professional-sports/\" target=\"_blank\">following a vote</a></span> by the NCAA DI Administrative Committee.

Then the <strong>Mercury</strong> started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when <strong>A'ja Wilson</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-mercury-live-updates-wnba-finals-game-3-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win</a>. </p><p>As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-mercury-live-updates-wnba-finals-game-3-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Not anymore</a>. Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. </p><ul><li><strong>Maloney:</strong> <em>\"A'ja Wilson is the only four-time MVP in WNBA history, a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and a seven-time All-Star. She's won two titles and a Finals MVP, and at 29 years old already has a case as the G.O.A.T. But until late on Wednesday night, she was lacking a true signature moment. That changed with a spin and a fade and a shot that rattled around the rim before it nestled in the net to give the Aces a 3-0 lead in the Finals and move them within a win of their third title in the last four years.\"</em></li></ul><p>After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé.  </p>\n<p>On the other side, the Mercury have <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/no-moral-victories-mercury-rue-slow-start-in-game-3-of-wnba-finals-vow-to-keep-fighting-despite-3-0-hole/\" target=\"_blank\">made it clear they won't go down without a fight</a></span>, but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. <strong>Satou Sabally</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2025-wnba-finals-mercury-forward-satou-sabally-leaves-game-3-with-head-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">left Game 3 with a head injury</a></span>, and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. </p><h2>Blue Jays send Yankees packing in ALDS </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-10-08t233822-497.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/09/a376954f-2676-44d1-8fe3-7d6a81b33829/resize/670x377/710287330616e1e45d0b87ec9e79c7c9/untitled-design-2025-10-08t233822-497.png\" /></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>For the first time in almost 10 years, the <strong>Blue Jays</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-2025-nlds-game-3-alds-game-4-live-updates-scores-results/live/#post-e12fcccb\" target=\"_blank\">are in the ALCS</a> after defeating the <strong>Yankees</strong> 5-2 in Game 4.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The mediocrity continues here in The Six Pack. We put another 3-3 week under our belts last week and are now 19-17 on the season. The Lock of the Week has dropped to 1-5, which I don't think I could do if I tried. I know this because, well, my Lock of the Week is 1-5.</p><p>The craziest part of it all to me is that there are four games guaranteed to be picked in this column every week. There are the two Games of the Week, the Lock of the Week and the Upset of the Week. Those four games have gone a combined 8-16 on the season.</p><p>That means I've gone 11-1 in the 12 \"free\" games. Maybe I should ditch the weekly staples? Or maybe I should just keep doing what I've been doing and stick to my long-held mantra, one that's working so very well for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNC/north-carolina-tar-heels/\">North Carolina</a> general manager Mike Lombardi these days.</p><p>That's right. We'll continue to #TrustTheProcess and wait for this thing to figure itself out.</p>\n<h2>Games of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong>No. 7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a> at No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a></strong>: This should be an absolute banger of a game, and I fear my pick won't accurately reflect how I feel about the situation. I've already <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-vibe-check-week-4-indiana-sure-looks-like-the-next-indiana/\" target=\"_blank\">written this year about my feelings for Indiana</a></span>. In my eyes, it's a legitimate playoff team, and it's a better team than the Indiana we saw last year. The squad has upgraded its offensive line, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> has been an upgrade on Kurtis Rourke. Keep in mind, I say that as a man who has been riding with Rourke since he was slinging it with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIO/ohio-bobcats/\">Ohio Bobcats</a>. We covered a lot of spread together, Kurtis and I!</p><p>Anyway, while Indiana has upgraded its overall talent level, I don't love this matchup for the Hoosiers. I wrote last week about the problems teams see when crossing the Rocky Mountains for road trips, and you saw what happened to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a>. You also saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> fall behind 20-0 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a> before storming back. That travel will impact Indiana here, too.</p><p>But that's only part of the equation. My bigger concern is Indiana's ability to cover Oregon's receivers. Indiana's secondary has been excellent this year, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29145935/dangelo-ponds/\">D'Angelo Ponds</a> missed last week's game against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a>. All signs point to his return this week, but even if he's at 100%, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906733/dakorien-moore/\">Dakorien Moore</a> is a better receiver than he or the Hoosiers have seen this year. And he's just one of Oregon's options. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121426/malik-benson/\">Malik Benson</a> and Gary <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BRY/bryant-bulldogs/\">Bryant</a> round out the receiver corps, and then there's tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125433/kenyon-sadiq/\">Kenyon Sadiq</a>. The Ducks roll deep, and unless Indiana gets a tremendous amount of pressure on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a>, I don't know that it can cover all of them.</p>\n<p>I do believe the Hoosiers' offensive line can slow down Oregon's pass rush a bit and that the Hoosiers will be able to find success of their own on offense. I just don't know that they'll find enough to stay within this number. I think Indiana is very good. I just think Oregon's that much better. <strong><em>The Pick: Oregon -7.5 (-105) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>No. 8 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> at No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a></strong>: You were probably a little surprised to see the spread in this game was only 3.5 points, but that's how good Missouri has been this year. I'm telling you right now, if the Tigers win this game, I will not be all that surprised by it. That said, I'm staying away from the spread because I believe there's a much better play available.</p><p>Alabama held <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> to 14 points last week, but Vanderbilt was a big reason why. The Commodores turned the ball over twice in the red zone. They still averaged 7.1 yards per carry on the ground, and Alabama's defense remains 63rd nationally in success rate against the run and 80th in EPA per rush. Enter Missouri, which is fourth nationally in rushing success rate on offense, third in EPA per rush and sixth in rushing explosive rate. The Tigers run the ball quite well! <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a> has rushed for at least 100 yards in every game they've played, and there's depth behind him in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29163501/jamal-roberts/\">Jamal Roberts</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906349/marquise-davis/\">Marquise Davis</a>. QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874546/beau-pribula/\">Beau Pribula</a> will contribute a bit with his legs, too. So I expect Mizzou will move the ball and score points.</p>\n<p>Alabama will, too. Missouri's overall defensive numbers are solid, but the Tigers allowed 31 points to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KANSAS/kansas-jayhawks/\">Kansas</a> and 29 to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a>. Both of those teams moved the ball very effectively through the air despite not having what anybody would consider a great passing offense (though South Carolina's has improved as the season has progressed). Missouri has a solid front seven, but if they can't get home and put Simpson on his backside, I don't think the Mizzou secondary will hold up. <strong><em>The Pick: Over 51.5 (-110) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">Draftkings</a></em></strong></p><h2>Lock of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a></strong>: Timing is everything. Last week, UCLA hosted a Penn State team still licking its wounds after a double-overtime loss to Oregon that seemed to suck the life out of that locker room. UCLA was also in the process of installing a new offense under a new offensive coordinator. While Penn State was feeling sorry for itself, it also had no idea what to expect from the UCLA offense. Next thing it knew, the Bruins put up 27 points on it before halftime. Penn State's defense adjusted at halftime and held the Bruins to 15 in the second half.</p><p>Well, Michigan State knows what UCLA's offense looks like because they have an entire game's worth of tape. Michigan State also had plenty of time to study it since it didn't play last week. Now, UCLA has to travel across the country to play three time zones over against a rested team that's not in a great mood after losing its first two Big Ten games. Sparty played both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> on the road, but while it lost both games, it scored 58 points. Now it's at home facing a UCLA defense that still ranks near or at the bottom of far too many defensive statistics I care about. I don't expect UCLA to look nearly as good as it did last week, and this line should be double digits. <strong><em>The Pick: Michigan State -7.5 (-112) at Draftkings</em></strong></p>\n<h2>Team Total of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a> at No. 12 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a></strong>: If you prefer taking the full game over here, I won't try to stop you. The average Tennessee game has seen 80 points scored. I prefer sticking to Tennessee's side of the equation since this will be Arkansas' first game under interim (I think?) coach Bobby Petrino, and I don't know exactly what they'll look like. Given Petrino's background, I'd expect they'll try to score plenty of points, though.</p><p>But unless Petrino overhauled his defensive depth chart and filled it with new players, I know the Hogs will give up points. In three games against quality competition, Arkansas has allowed 129 points (43 per game). Tennessee is scoring 51 points per game and hasn't scored fewer than 41 in any of them. If the Vols can put up 41 on freaking <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> in Knoxville, I'm confident they can put up 41 on Arkansas, too. <strong><em>The Pick: Tennessee Over 40.5 (-120) at Draftkings</em></strong></p><h2>Technical School Game of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a> at No. 13 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a></strong>: I can try to tell you about how much better Virginia Tech has looked since the coaching change, and it wouldn't be a lie. It was 0-3 when it fired Brent Pry, and it's 2-1 since. That includes a road win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NCST/nc-state-wolfpack/\">NC State</a> and a seven-point loss at home last week to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WAKE/wake-forest-demon-deacons/\">Wake Forest</a>. Georgia Tech is better than both of those teams, but I don't know if it's 14.5 points better than Virginia Tech.</p>\n<p>And, even if it is, it might not matter. Georgia Tech has certain tendencies. The Bees typically play to their opponent. If you're ranked, Georgia Tech's a juggernaut. If you're not, the Jackets aren't. Seriously, since last season, Georgia Tech is 1-4-1 ATS when playing an unranked ACC opponent. If you expand that to unranked teams from a Power Four conference, they're 2-5-1 ATS. That includes a mark of 0-2-1 when favored by more than 5 points in those games. The Bees aren't a team I trust as a two-touchdown favorite in these spots. <strong><em>The Pick: Virginia Tech +14.5 (-110) at FanDuel</em></strong></p><h2>Upset of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong>No. 15 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> at USC</strong>: The last we saw USC it was losing on the road at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> in a close game, but it suffered some injuries while in Champaign. The Trojans were already without starting left tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123232/elijah-paige/\">Elijah Paige</a>, and starting center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916576/kilian-oconnor/\">Kilian O'Connor</a> went down during the game. While Paige might return for this one, O'Connor is out, which is a blow to a unit that hadn't been performing all that spectacularly to begin with.</p><p>The truth is, even at full strength, I like Michigan along the lines of scrimmage more than I like USC, so if the Trojans are banged up, that tilts the scales even further into Michigan's direction.</p>\n<p>None of which is to say I think Michigan dominates the game. USC's offense remains lethal and is easily the best offense the Wolverines defense has seen this year. But if that line can't protect Maiava, he's prone to make bad decisions when pressured. I also don't know that USC's defense will be able to slow the Michigan run game, and Michigan QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906638/bryce-underwood/\">Bryce Underwood</a> looks like he's getting better and more comfortable in the offense every week. I'm not convinced the right team is favored here, and there's a strong chance Michigan goes into the Coliseum and gets a huge win in the Big Ten race. <strong><em>The Pick: Michigan (+114) at FanDuel</em></strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th>Bets</th><th>Last Week</th><th>Season</th><th>Units</th></tr><tr><td><p>Games of the Week</p></td><td><p>1-1</p></td><td><p>6-6</p></td><td><p>-1.60</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lock of the Week</p></td><td><p>0-1</p></td><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>-4.49</p></td></tr><tr><td>Upset of the Week</td><td>0-1</td><td>1-5<br /></td><td>-3.07</td></tr><tr><td><p>Overall</p></td><td><p>3-3</p></td><td><p>19-17</p></td><td><p>-0.33</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> game 10,000 times. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/college-football-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions-betting-advice-for-week-7-2025-from-proven-model/#ttag=10072025_lk_cbssports_picks_football_ncaa_model_CFBWeek7\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks</a>, all from the model that is 38-25 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks. </em></p>\n            </div>",

Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>Media outlets often publish a list of the best coaches in college basketball that's shaped largely by publicly available information like wins and championships. Those are always subjective but also pretty easy to do with more or less the same names slotted near the top each time.</p><p>But who are the good guys?</p><p>Not just good <em>coaches </em>but also good <em>men</em>, you know, the type of people you wouldn't mind your son playing for someday, and spending four years with someday, if he developed into a legitimate basketball prospect. A random person probably has no grasp for how to answer that question without real relationships throughout the sport. But do you know who has real relationships throughout the sport?</p><p> Coaches!</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind, Matt Norlander and I asked more than 100 college coaches the following question:</p><h2>If your son were a player, which college coach would you want him to spend four years with?</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Matt Painter (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>)</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Tom Izzo (Michigan State)</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Kelvin Sampson (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>)</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Rick Barnes (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>)</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Few (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/GONZAG/gonzaga-bulldogs/\">Gonzaga</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dusty May (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Pope (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Lloyd (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Shaka Smart (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MARQET/marquette-golden-eagles/\">Marquette</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Scott Drew (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Todd Golden (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>(</em><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>A list of more than a dozen coaches accounted for the other 21% of the vote.)</em></p><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><h3>On Matt Painter:</h3><ul><li>\"He's like a brother to me. [He's] one of the most genuine, well-spoken, compassionate, empathetic [people]. Elite thinker [and] elite coach who has produced with less and ... his player-development, and how he gets these kids to stay, is amazing to me. He's a really, really good human being.\"</li><li>\"Excellent coach. Better person. Man of integrity. Tells his players what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Genuinely cares about his program and the game of college basketball. Players have a great understanding of their job.\"</li><li>\"His program is at the highest level and has shown that they are doing the right things to retain players. So they are having a great experience, will develop and get better, and will always hear the truth.\"\t</li></ul><h3>On Tom Izzo:</h3><ul><li>\"Izzo embraces old school and new school. He teaches the game the right way -- and I think he has the ultimate respect of his players. You get coach Izzo for life if you play for him.\"</li><li>\"If he wants to coach four more years, and God only knows why he would want to, the answer for me is Izzo. While I genuinely think the \"leader of men\" thing is bullcrap when it comes to coaches raising players, Izzo is close to it, and his players tend to love him and always return to the program.</li><li>\"Tom Izzo is 'old school' in a good way, a way most college kids need/want. His players develop on the court, they win and, more importantly, they become a member of a family for life. At least from my perspective, that seems real. And if it were my son, I would want that for him.</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>Now that the 2025 Candid Coaches series has concluded it's fair to suggest that nobody had a better few weeks in it than Matt Painter and Purdue. While polling coaches, we learned that they believe the Boilermakers will be the best team this season and that Purdue point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a> will be <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">the best player</a></span>. Coaches also described Painter as the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">best Xs and Os coach</a></span> in the sport and among the favorites to next become a first-time national champion. And now they've told us that, if they had a son heading off to play college basketball, the person they'd most trust to provide a great and valuable experience is Painter.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/dca6c3fa-b537-44e9-924c-e610b7e128cb/thumbnail/270x152/f825ae894924dfd9112258855c191310/cc-sept26-v1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>None of this is surprising.</p>\n<p>The truth is that there are a lot of excellent coaches running great programs who double as good dudes -- but it was not surprising to see Painter lead all vote-getters when this question was asked. For lack of a better way to put it, people just really like and enjoy him. I don't mean to paint him as a saint, if only because I don't personally know any saints (and that seems like a weird place to set the bar). But what I can tell you is that in 20-plus years of covering college basketball, I don't think I've ever heard another coach say anything derogatory about Painter. He's both broadly respected as a coach and generally liked as a man. Not everybody in this sport checks those boxes while also being on track to someday become a Naismith Memorial Hall of Famer. But Painter clearly does, and the results of this final Candid Coaches question of 2025 illustrates as much.</p><h2>Previous 2025 Candid Coaches questions</h2><ul><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</a></span></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-what-percentage-of-your-schools-revenue-sharing-should-go-to-mens-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">What percentage of your school's revenue sharing should go to men's basketball?</a></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best college basketball player this season?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Who is the best X's and O's coach in college basketball?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-college-basketball-coaching-hire-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-do-you-trust-that-your-competitors-will-follow-new-recruiting-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Do you trust that your competitors will follow the new recruiting rules?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-college-basketball-coach-will-be-next-to-win-their-first-ncaa-tournament-title/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the next coach to win his first national championship?</a></span></li></ul>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1231866/kevin-durant/\">Kevin Durant</a> made his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/HOU/houston-rockets/\">Rockets</a> debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/UTA/utah-jazz/\">Jazz</a>, 140-127.</p><p>Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times.</p>\n<p>There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. </p><p>But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26646084/alperen-sengun/\">Alperen Sengun</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005049/amen-thompson/\">Amen Thompson</a>. </p>\n<p>Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1779901/kyrie-irving/\">Kyrie Irving</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685255/james-harden/\">James Harden</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152529/devin-booker/\">Devin Booker</a>, where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. </p><p>Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202822/ben-simmons/\">Ben Simmons</a>, is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-amen-thompson-is-in-prime-position-to-turn-into-the-player-ben-simmons-could-have-become/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Amen Thompson is in prime position to turn into the player Ben Simmons could have become</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Botkin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Amen Thompson is in prime position to turn into the player Ben Simmons could have become\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/04/fe2eaa84-6033-41ed-8198-466d9cddbdfa/thumbnail/270x152/a700b18e33649ef0d94220cd690ce00f/100325-amenthompson.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. </p>\n<p>More Durant and Sengun:</p>\n<p>And one more:</p>\n<p>Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. </p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. </p>\n<p>So, get ready Rockets fans. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2252663/fred-vanvleet/\">Fred VanVleet</a> injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Phoenix Mercury are on the brink of losing the WNBA Finals after falling 90-88 to the Las Vegas Aces in Wednesday's Game 3. They showed a lot of heart in the fourth quarter, particularly after <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2025-wnba-finals-mercury-forward-satou-sabally-leaves-game-3-with-head-injury/\" target=\"_blank\">Satou Sabally went down with a head injury,</a></span> and almost completed a 17-point comeback behind some strong performances from Kahleah Copper and DeWanna Bonner.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-mercury-live-updates-wnba-finals-game-3-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">a last-second shot from A'ja Wilson led to a Las Vegas victory</a>, and Phoenix is now on the verge of being swept.</p><p>\"We are not into moral victories. This is a game that we wanted to get, needed to get. But for us to compete the way that we did, I think just shows the character of our team. It's the way we fought all year,\" Mercury coach Nate TIbbetts said postgame. </p><p>\"We just kept fighting and put ourselves in a position to win against a really good team. I'm proud of our group for not giving in. That's what we expect on Friday, too. We are going to keep fighting. That's what this group is about.\"</p>\n<p>The Mercury almost snuck a road win in Game 1 while <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-finals-mercury-remain-confident-after-crunch-time-struggles-spoil-historic-3-point-shooting-in-game-1/\" target=\"_blank\">making playoff history with 14 3-pointers</a></span>, but Las Vegas won that one with a strong defensive performance in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Game 2 was a lot more one-sided, with the Aces winning 91-78  behind a 32-point performance by Jackie Young and 28 points and 14 rebounds for Wilson.</p><p>Tibbetts was under no impression that the Aces were going to be an easy opponent. They are chasing their third title in four years and entered the playoffs with a 16-game winning streak. The Mercury have not won a title since 2014 and have been overlooked numerous times this season. However, Tibbetts likes a lot of what his team has shown so far.</p>\n<p>\"I think you look inside yourself and continue to compete. We've played them in two close games with 25 seconds, 40 seconds to go, it's been a one-point game in two of the games. Obviously those are games you are positioned to win. Besides Game 2, I think we played them pretty solid. </p><p>\"We had to come back tonight. But we are facing a team that has been through this together. It's not a team that is just figuring it out, they are a well-oiled machine. ... But I was, again, super proud of how we just kept fighting.\"</p><p>This is the first season the WNBA has held a best-of-seven Finals, so there is no precedent for this kind of situation within this league. The closest comparison is the NBA, where no team has ever won a seven-game series after falling behind 3-0. If the Mercury want a chance at pulling it off, Tibbetts said they have to truly focus on one game at a time.</p>\n<p>But if they want to extend the series, they have to lock in at tip-off, and not wait until late in the game to rally. </p><p>\"We're facing elimination. We've had plenty of opportunities to go out there and get a win,\" Alyssa Thomas said. \"At some point we have to take it upon ourselves. Our first half was unacceptable, especially with the opportunity to play in your home court and go out there and get a win. So same thing goes for Game 4. We got to come out from from the start.\"</p><p>Thomas added that making it this far into the playoffs was a \"privilege\" and therefore the opportunity should not be wasted. Bonner agreed with her teammate and coach.</p>\n<p>\"You just got to keep fighting. We're not just going to give up,\" Bonner said. \"It's hard to get here, so we're going to continue to fight to the very end. And I feel like that's what we've been doing all playoffs, fighting our way back into it.\"</p><p>Game 4 will take place at PHX Arena on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.</p>\n            </div>",

Kennesaw State is coming off a 24-16 win over Middle Tennessee behind 101 rushing yards on 12 carries (8.4 yards per rush) from sixth-year senior Coleman Bennett last week. The 6-foot, 210-pound back is averaging 4.9 yards per carry this season. Kennesaw State's three-game winning streak has all come by protecting home field, and the Owls remain at home again on Thursday. The model projects the Owls to stay competitive with Louisiana Tech on their home field in this Conference USA matchup, with the Owls covering the spread in 62% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: East Carolina Pirates vs. Tulane Green Wave, 7:30 p.m. ET</strong><br /></li><li><strong>The Pick: Under 54.5 points</strong></li></ul><p>The Under has hit in three straight Pirates games, and in four of their five contests this season. Meanwhile, the Under has also hit in back-to-back Tulane contests and in three of five games this year. None of the last three East Carolina games have even reached 50 combined points, largely due to the Pirates' stout defense. East Carolina ranks 13th in the nation in scoring defense (16 points per game), and Tulane is 67th in the nation in scoring at 26.2 ppg. The model projects the Under to hit in 69% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Southern Miss Golden Eagles vs. Georgia Southern Eagles, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Georgia Southern (+3)</strong></li></ul><p>Georgia Southern hosts Southern Miss on Thursday, and the Eagles are 2-0 at home this season. They've scored more than 40 points in both contests and covered the spread in both games. The Eagles rushed for more than 200 yards in each home game, led by senior running back OJ Arnold's 213 yards and three touchdowns over those two games. Southern Miss is 3-2 this season, but the Golden Eagles will play just their second game on the road. They lost to Louisiana Tech, 30-20, in their only road game this season. The model projects Georgia Southern to cover the spread in 73% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Jacksonville State Gamecocks vs. Sam Houston Bearkats, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Jacksonville State (-7.5)</strong></li></ul><p>It would be an understatement to say Sam Houston has struggled to keep opposing teams off the scoreboard this season, ranking 131st of 136 teams in scoring defense. The Bearkats are allowing 41.6 ppg this season, while allowing at least 37 points in all five games during their 0-5 start. Jacksonville State is 2-3 this season, but the Gamecocks are 1-0 in Conference USA play heading into this conference matchup on CBS Sports Network. Junior Cam Cook has 614 rushing yards on 5.5 yards per carry to lead the Gamecocks, rushing for at least 75 yards in all five games and at least 120 yards in three contests. Jacksonville State has scored at least 34 points in three of its last four games, leading the model to project Jacksonville State to cover the spread in 58% of simulations. </p><p><strong>More college football best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Every college football game simulated 10,000 times</a></li></ul>\n            </div>",

With the defeat, the Cyclones had their six-game winning streak snapped and dropped from No. 14 to No. 22 in the AP rankings. Iowa State began the 2024 campaign with seven consecutive victories and is looking to record at least six over its first seven contests in back-to-back campaigns for the first time in program history.</p><p>The Buffaloes (2-4, 0-3) are hoping to avoid their first 0-4 start in conference play since going winless (0-9) in the Pac-12 in 2014. Colorado has lost eight straight meetings with AP-ranked opponents since defeating No. 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> in head coach Deion Sanders' debut with the squad in 2023. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26696465/kaidon-salter/\">Kaidon Salter</a> has been a dual threat quarterback for the Buffaloes as he has recorded both a passing and rushing touchdown in four of his five games this season, which ties him for most in FBS.</p><p>Colorado has dominated the all-time series against Iowa State, going 49-15-1, and has won five straight and 13 of the last 14 meetings in Boulder. However, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team's projection model sees that winning streak ending as the <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251011_IOWAST@COLO/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclones defeat the Buffaloes in 70% of its simulations</a>.</p><h3>Georgia vs. Auburn</h3>\n<p>The No. 10 Bulldogs (4-1, 2-1) enter this SEC showdown looking to extend their 44-game winning streak against unranked opponents, which is the longest active run in FBS. Georgia also has won eight consecutive meetings with Auburn - all by at least seven points - and hopes to match the longest winning streak by either team in the all-time series, which it put together from 1923-31. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876053/gunner-stockton/\">Gunner Stockton</a> has thrown six touchdown passes and rushed for five scores this year, becoming the first Georgia quarterback since 2000 to record at least five of each through the first five games of a season.</p><p>Auburn (3-2, 0-2) won its first three games of 2025 before dropping one-score decisions to then-No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> (24-17) and then-No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. The Tigers enter Saturday having lost 17 of their last 18 games against ranked opponents and seven straight against Georgia when the Bulldogs were ranked. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125321/jackson-arnold/\">Jackson Arnold</a>, who is the first power conference player who has registered at least five passing and five rushing TDs and not committed a turnover through five games since Oregon's Marcus Mariota in 2013, has made 288 consecutive pass attempts without an interception since throwing one against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> on Sept. 21, 2024 while with Oklahoma.</p><p>The Tigers haven't defeated the Bulldogs since 2017, when they posted a 40-17 triumph as the 10th-ranked team in the nation against a top-ranked Georgia squad. The ITL team's model doesn't believe Auburn's slide in the series will end as its simulations have the <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251011_UGA@AUBURN/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulldogs winning 68% of the time</a>.</p><h3>Utah State vs. Hawaii</h3>\n<p>Utah State (3-2, 1-0 Mountain West) enters this conference matchup looking to rebound from its second loss against a ranked opponent this season. The Aggies held a pair of seven-point leads against then-No. 18 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> on Sept. 27 before the Commodores moved ahead in the second quarter and pulled away in the second half for a 55-35 victory. Quarterbacks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3173117/bryson-barnes/\">Bryson Barnes</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26702285/jacob-conover/\">Jacob Conover</a> combined to throw five touchdown passes in the loss. Barnes leads Utah State with six rushing TDs and is two away from tying the school's single-season record by a signal-caller set in 2012 by Chuckie Keeton.</p><p>The Rainbow Warriors (4-2, 1-1) are looking to make back-to-back conference wins after outlasting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AF/air-force-falcons/\">Air Force</a> 44-35 last time out. QB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389540/micah-alejado/\">Micah Alejado</a> threw for a season-high 457 yards and three touchdowns - two of which were to wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29167382/jackson-harris/\">Jackson Harris</a>, who racked up 144 receiving yards. Hawaii is off to its best start through six games since 2019, when it posted 10 wins and made its only appearance in the Mountain West Championship Game.</p><p>Utah State is 13-6 in the all-time series and has won eight straight meetings with Hawaii, six of which were by 20 or more points. The Aggies also have won four in a row in Honolulu, and the ITL team's model sees the streak continuing, as Utah State <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251012_UTAHST@HAWAII/\" target=\"_blank\">wins in 62% of its simulations</a>. SportsLine expert Eric Cohen likes the Aggies to cover and improve to 6-0 against the spread this season.</p><h2>Money line underdog parlay for Week 7</h2>\n<h3>Alabama vs. Missouri</h3>\n<p>No. 8 Alabama (4-1, 2-0 SEC) has followed its season-opening loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> with four consecutive victories, the last two during SEC play. Those wins were over then-No. 5 Georgia and then-No. 16 Vanderbilt, putting the Crimson Tide in position to get off to a 3-0 start in conference play with all three wins coming against ranked opponents for the first time in program history. Alabama is first in the nation with a plus-9 turnover margin and ranks fifth in the SEC with an average of 16 points allowed.</p><p>The No. 14 Tigers (5-0, 1-0) are wrapping up their season-opening six-game home stand and seeking their first three-game home winning streak against ranked opponents since 1972-73. Missouri, which has won 15 straight at home overall, is third in the country in rushing with an average of 292 yards per game and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a> leads the nation with 730 yards on the ground while ranking second with nine touchdown runs. The sophomore has gained at least 100 yards in every game this season and set a career high with 250 on Sept. 13 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UL/louisiana-ragin-cajuns/\">Louisiana</a>.</p><p>Alabama fell to 0-2 in the all-time series with a loss in 1975 but has won all six meetings since then, including three on the road. The ITL team's model believes Missouri with end its slide, as the Tigers <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251011_BAMA@MIZZOU/\" target=\"_blank\">win in 54% of its simulations</a>. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman thinks Missouri will at least keep the game close, feeling Alabama has not performed all that well on the road under head coach Kalen DeBoer and will have difficulty defending multi-dimensional Tigers quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874546/beau-pribula/\">Beau Pribula</a>.</p><h3>TCU vs. Kansas State</h3>\n<p>Kansas State (2-4, 1-2) and TCU (4-1, 1-1) are seeking their second win in Big 12 play this season. The Wildcats are coming off a heartbreaking 35-34 loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a> in a contest in which they entered the fourth quarter with a 14-point lead. Five of Kansas State's six games this year have been decided by one score.</p><p>The Horned Frogs posted their first conference victory of 2025 last week, a 35-21 home triumph over Colorado. TCU boasts one of the top aerial attacks in the nation as it ranks 12th with an average of 311.6 yards per game. The Horned Frogs are one of only six teams in the country that has three players with at least 300 receiving yards, with wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26725442/eric-mcalister/\">Eric McAlister</a> topping the club with 385 on just 17 receptions.</p><p>Kansas State has won five of its last six meetings with TCU to improve to 10-8 in the all-time series. According to the ITL team's model, the Wildcats will make it six of seven as they <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251011_TCU@KSTATE/\" target=\"_blank\">win in 55% of its simulations</a>. Cohen agrees with the model as he hasn't been impressed by the Horned Frogs and notes that Kansas State's four losses this season have been by a total of 13 points.</p><h3>Michigan vs. USC</h3>\n<p>No. 15 Michigan (4-1, 2-0) looks to post its fourth consecutive victory and hand USC (4-1, 2-1) its second straight loss when these Big Ten teams collide. The Wolverines have rushed for 13 touchdowns during their three-game winning streak and have 17 rushing scores on the season, their most through the first five games of a season since recording 19 in 2022. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a> is fourth in the nation with 654 rushing yards and is just the second Wolverine in the last 30 years to run for at least 100 yards and a touchdown in each of the team's first five contests of a campaign.</p><p>The Trojans began 2025 with four straight victories before being edged 34-32 by then-No. 23 Illinois last time out. With the setback, USC fell to 4-17 in its last 21 games against ranked opponents. Wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123772/makai-lemon/\">Makai Lemon</a> hauled in 11 passes for 151 yards and a pair of TDs in the loss, becoming the first Trojan since 2012 to register at least 150 receiving yards and two scoring catches multiple times in a season. Lemon racked up 158 yards and two touchdowns on Sept. 6 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GAS/georgia-southern-eagles/\">Georgia Southern</a>.</p><p>USC dropped to 6-5 in the all-time series with a 27-24 loss at Michigan last year in just the third regular-season meeting between the schools and first with both being members of the Big Ten. The ITL team's projection model sees the Wolverines evening the series, as they <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251011_MICH@USC/\" target=\"_blank\">win in 58% of its simulations</a>.</p>\n            </div>",

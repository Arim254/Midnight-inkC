Tuesday's NBA schedule includes a potential Eastern Conference postseason preview when the new-look Cleveland Cavaliers host the New York Knicks at 7:30 p.m. ET. One of the SportsLine Projection Model's top picks comes from Knicks vs. Cavaliers, backing Over 230.5 total points for its Tuesday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The Over has hit in three of the last four Cavs games.The model is also backing the Milwaukee Bucks to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the Miami Heat. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on Duke vs. Notre Dame at 7 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model entered Week 19 on a sizzling 38-18 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookKnicks vs. Cavaliers: Over 230.5 points (-115)Bucks (+5.5) vs. Heat (-110)Duke (-17.5) vs. Notre Dame (-110)Combining the three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +581 (risk $100 to win $631, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nKnicks vs. Cavaliers: Over 230.5 points (-115)The Over has hit in three of the last four Cavaliers games as the duo of Cleveland guards Donovan Mitchell and James Harden learn how to complement one another on the court. Harden has never been one celebrated for his defensive prowess, so both his playmaking offensive ability and lackluster defensive skillset have this model siding with the Over. Cleveland has allowed at least 113 points in three of those four games, and the Knicks have the No. 8 scoring offense at 117.6 points per game this season. Cleveland is third at 119.7 ppg this season. Jalen Brunson is ninth in the NBA at 26.8 ppg this season, and Karl-Anthony Towns is coming off back-to-back imposing scoring performances, scoring 25 and 28 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 58.6% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Bucks (+5.5) vs. HeatGiannis Antetokounmpo (calf) remains out for the Bucks, but besides him, it's a rather clean injury report for a Milwaukee team that still has some talent. The Bucks had their three-game winning streak snapped in a 122-94 loss to the Raptors on Sunday, and although the Heat have won three straight games, none of them came against teams exactly playing the most motivated basketball at this point of the season (wins over the Pelicans, Hawks and Grizzlies). The Bucks have shown their depth with three different leading scorers over their last three games. Ryan Rollins has scored more than 20 points in six of seven games this month for the Bucks, who are 18-16 against the spread as the underdog this season. The model projects the Bucks to cover in 58% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings here:Duke (-17.5) vs. Notre Dame\"Duke enters the contest as one of the most mathematically dominant teams in the nation, ranking ninth overall in offensive efficiency and fourth in defensive efficiency,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"The Fighting Irish counter with a pedestrian offensive efficiency of 114.9 (ranked 88th nationally) and a highly vulnerable defensive efficiency of 106.0 (ranked 109th). The Blue Devils have a magnificent 57.5% effective field goal percentage on the offensive end, a metric largely driven by a physically dominant interior presence that secures a massive 36.9% offensive rebounding rate. Notre Dame will be forced to compete without freshman guard Jalen Haralson, their leading scorer and primary offensive initiator, who has been ruled out of this contest with an unspecified injury.\" Back Duke at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

Ertz, 35, will be a free agent. He is coming off a torn ACL he suffered in Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings but is expected to be cleared around Week 1, per Pelissero's report.A second-round pick in 2013, Ertz spent his first eight-plus seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles before getting traded to the Arizona Cardinals midway through the 2021 season. Ertz struggled with injuries in both 2022 and 2023 and, at 34, appeared to be nearing the end of his career.He landed with the Washington Commanders on a one-year deal in 2024 and showed he still had plenty left in the tank. Brought in mostly to be a reliable veteran presence for then-rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, Ertz played in all 17 games and registered 66 catches for 654 yards and seven touchdowns, his most scores since 2019. He added 18 catches for 155 yards and a touchdown in the playoffs as Washington made the NFC Championship Game for the first time in over three decades.Ertz returned to Washington in 2025 and was having another solid campaign -- 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns -- before a tough hit to his knee ended his season.\nIt won't end his career, though. His recovery from the ACL injury is key, of course, but Ertz when last healthy was still a reliable target in the short and intermediate passing games who ran precise routes. At 6-foo-5 and 250 pounds, he has the size to box out smaller defenders and win over the middle of the field and in the red zone. That -- plus his experience and historic track record -- should earn him some looks on the free-agent market, even if it's on a one-year deal.Zach Ertz careerAll-time rank among TEsReceptions8255thReceiving yards8,5928thReceiving touchdowns5710thZach Ertz landing spotsWith Dallas Goedert set to hit free agency, a reunion with the Eagles could make sense. Ertz would be a reliable, consistent addition for a passing attack that was far too inconsistent in 2025.A return to the Commanders could be in the cards, as Ertz and Daniels have developed a strong bond on and off the field. Still, Washington coach Dan Quinn and GM Adam Peters emphasized getting younger and faster this offseason, and Ertz doesn't fit either bill.Should Travis Kelce call it a career, Ertz could be a fit for the Kansas City Chiefs. Patrick Mahomes has always had a reliable pass catcher at tight end. Though Ertz is more of a quick-game target than Kelce -- and not dynamic with the ball in his hands -- there are some parallels. Plus, if Ertz wants to join a potential Super Bowl contender, Kansas City fits the bill.Any team with a young quarterback (or simply a young roster) could use a veteran presence such as Ertz. Among teams that come to mind quickly are the Tennessee Titans with Cam Ward and the New York Giants with Jaxson Dart.\n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.Any time an owner of one of Major League Baseball's 30 teams speaks publicly, I'm probably going to get some pretty easy Soapbox material. I might get a good pitch. I might get a meatball. Sometimes, though, they just bring out the tee and let me take a serious hack. Arte Moreno of the Angels, come on down! Via the O.C. Register: \"The number one thing fans want is affordability. They want affordability. They want safety and they want a good experience when they come to the ballpark. Believe it or not, winning is not in their top five.\"  He was so close, wasn't he? Fans definitely want everything Moreno said before the last seven words. But then he dropped the hammer with, basically, winning isn't really that important.This is just all kinds of dumb. First of all, think about the aspect of Moreno being one of the owners less than a year from the expiration of the CBA. Even hinting that you aren't trying to win is ammo for the player side and, sure enough, new MLBPA boss Bruce Meyer told The Athletic, \"Let's just say players took notice of it and we took notice of it too. The bottom line is players are competitors. They grew up competing every day. They go out and they try their hardest to win every game. And players want to see owners doing the same thing.\"Oops, Arte. Very oops. \nHow about the optics of a statement like this coming from an owner of the Los Angeles Angels? You know, the team with the longest playoff drought in the majors. They haven't been to the now-expanded playoffs since 2014. They don't appear close to snapping said drought, either. In fact, they're likely to be picked to finish in last place by the overwhelming majority of prognosticators for this coming season. For me, there's always concern when a billionaire tries to act like he knows how we normal folk feel. Maybe you don't think I, as a member of the media, count as a baseball fan. Fine, but I'm not rich and I'm a die-hard Bears, Pacers and Indiana University fan. I know what being a \"normal\" fan is like. I'm not sure Moreno does. Also, is he projecting? That is, does he think fans don't care that much about winning, maybe, because deep down winning is much less important to him than other stuff like making money? There's always that worry when it comes to a billionaire owner. We're going to suspect there's a disconnect there, even if it's subconscious. Perhaps this is a misunderstanding? It's possible Moreno means well and is just trying to point out that, when attending a single game, fans can deal with a loss -- especially just for one game -- as long as it's a great experience. I don't doubt that affordability, safety, convenience and stuff in that range are incredibly important for a non-rich family attending one game per year and, sure, in this specific instance, that stuff can all matter more than seeing a win in the grand scheme of things. \nHe just did a really poor job in his delivery. In the big picture, nothing to fans is more important than winning. No true sports fan needs evidence. We know it. Even if we get priced out. I generally go to one Bears game per season -- sometimes two, sometimes zero. If the Bears end up getting like dynasty-level awesome and I get priced out and can't attend a game in person for the next 10 years, I'd be happy for that outcome. Gimme all the winning on TV. I just want to cheer for a winner! I suspect the overwhelming majority of die-hard sports fans -- notably non-fair-weather fans (and remember, we don't let them bother us) -- would agree with me there. \nIf we need evidence on the \"winning trumps all\" front, though, we could look at the attendance numbers for a few teams to illustrate the point. Look at Arte's Angels. The franchise had never topped two million fans in attendance in a season until 1979, their first trip to the playoffs. That was the franchise record until 1982, or the next time they made the playoffs. They didn't top three million fans until 2003, which just happened to be the year after their first World Series championship. Are these all just the seasons that the Angels did the best job at affordability and safety? Nah, ticket prices were rising because demand was rising. It was the winning. \nWe could do this with other teams. The Brewers first drew over two million in 1983, the year after their lone pennant. They first hit three million in 2008, the next time they made the playoffs. The Cubs first hit three million in 2004, set new attendance records in both 2007 and 2008 and then broke that mark in 2016, which remains their high mark. On and on we could go. That's just how it works. Look, I understand the bottom line might not be as healthy as Moreno would like it to be. Their TV situation, as it is with so many teams right now, is wretched. The Angels have also been burned by a good number of bad contracts, like Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton, Anthony Rendon and a few others this past decade. I'm sure this has an impact on Moreno deep down in his brain when he's discussing spending and he thinks fans want a good ballpark experience instead of just throwing money at guys in a desperate attempt to turn the team around.Then again, if the Angels did a better job at fielding a competitive team -- and it's so much more than just spending on free agents -- winning on the field would put more butts in the seats and help mitigate any of those perceived shortfalls in revenue. \nAs always, the most important thing is winning. Saying otherwise is ignorance, delusion or a combination thereof.\n            ",

Although the NFL saw 12 field goals of 60 yards or longer in 2025, there were zero kicks from that distance in the UFL, so this rule wouldn't have been used last season, but with the kick now worth four points, more teams might think about attempting a field goal from long range. During the UFL's first season back in 2024, there were three field goals from 60 yards or longer, so it's certainly possible that the four-point play will happen this year (The longest kick in UFL history came from current Lions kicker Jake Bates, who drilled a 64-yarder while playing for the Michigan Panthers in 2024). Hopefully the NFL takes note of the four-point rule, because the league should give some serious thought about implementing it. \nThe four-point field goal was one of several bold new rules that the UFL announced on Tuesday. Let's take a look at some of the most notable changes: No punting inside the 50-yard line. The league also added another rule with a special teams twist. No punts will be allowed from inside the 50-yard line, so once a team crosses midfield, they're not allowed to punt. If a team crosses midfield and gets penalized or loses yardage that pushes them back into their own territory, they're still NOT allowed to punt. Teams WILL be allowed to punt inside the 50 after the after the two-minute warning of either half, but that will be the only situation where it's permitted. The Tush Push is being banned. The NFL hasn't banned the tush push, but the UFL has. Starting this year, it will be illegal to run \"a play in which after the quarterback takes the snap, he immediately drives forward as the offensive line surges and is assisted by additional players behind him who physically push him forward into the surging offensive line.\"Receivers only need one foot in-bounds. The UFL has decided to dump the NFL's two-foot rule for catches and go to the college rule, which only requires a receiver to have one foot in-bounds to make a catch. Three-point conversion is possible. After a team scores a touchdown, they'll have three options: They can kick an extra points (33-yard attempt), they can attempt a two-pointer from the two-yard line OR they can go for three. If a team wants to attempt a three-point conversion, the ball will be placed at the eight-yard line. The UFL will also be tweaking its kickoff. The league uses a kickoff that's similar to what the NFL uses and the most notable change this year is that most touchbacks (or a kick out of bounds) will bring the ball out to the 40-yard line. The only time a touchback won't go out to the 40 is if the ball hits in the landing zone and then rolls into the end zone. In that case, the touchback will go out to the 20-yard line. Like the NFL, the landing zone is the space between the goal line and the 20-yard line. The UFL came into existence back in 2024 after the USFL and the XFL merged. The league consists of eight teams, including three that are new this year in the Columbus Aviators, Louisville Kings, and Orlando Storm. Those three will join the Birmingham Stallions, Dallas Renegades, D.C. Defenders, St. Louis Battlehawks and Houston Gamblers. The eight teams all unveiled their uniforms for the season last week. \nYour first chance to see the new uniforms in action and to see how the new rules impact the game will come on March 27 when the UFL season kicks off with Birmingham facing Louisville. \n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Charles Bediako is once again attempting to return to play for Alabama. According to AL.com, the former Crimson Tide center filed an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court on Monday, two weeks after a Tuscaloosa County circuit court judge denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules.While Bediako's appeal is pending, he's seeking interim injunctive relief that would allow him to play immediately. Judge Daniel Pruet, who ruled on Bediako's initial injunction request, denied that temporary relief on Tuesday. The next step for Bediako and his representation is to make the same request to the Alabama Supreme Court in search of a different outcome.The appeal motion states that interim relief is critical as the appeal is unlikely to be resolved before the end of the college basketball season. Without interim relief paving the way for Bediako to play again this year, the appeal request will become moot.\"The request is to put an injunction in place while the Alabama Supreme Court considers the substance of our argument as to why we believe the Circuit Court's order was incorrect,\" David Holt, one of Bediako's attorneys, told ESPN.\nBediako has remained a student at Alabama and helped with the scout team, per coach Nate Oats. Alabama's next game is Wednesday vs. Mississippi State.\"We understand that Charles is pursuing an appeal in his case against the NCAA, and ultimately, he must do what he considers to be in his best interest,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"The University continues to support Charles as he works toward completing his degree.\"It's the latest twist in what's been quite the saga for Bediako, the NCAA and eligibility rules.\nBediako played for Alabama in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before forgoing the rest of his eligibility and entering the NBA Draft pool. Though he did not get drafted, he signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He never appeared in an NBA game but did play for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He also appeared in G League games for the Grand Rapids Gold and the Motor City Cruise on Exhibit 10 contracts.\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn late January 2026, Bediako filed suit against the NCAA, requesting \"immediate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Because Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he was -- and is still -- within his five-year eligibility clock. Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts granted Beidako a temporary restraining order against the NCAA, paving the way for him to return to the Crimson Tide. After it was later discovered Roberts is an Alabama donor; he recused himself from the case.Under the order, Bediako played in five games with Alabama from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7, averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks while shooting 77%.\nOn Feb. 9, Alabama circuit court judge Daniel Pruet denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The aim of the preliminary injunction had been to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"\nBediako's return to college basketball after signing multiple NBA contracts had caused significant consternation among NCAA higher-ups, with even SEC commissioner Greg Sankey signing an affidavit against Bediako's cause.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The race to see which conference will place the most teams in the 2026 NCAA Tournament is coming down to the wire as Selection Sunday looms less than three weeks away. While the SEC currently leads the pack 11 teams in the CBS Sports Bracketology field, the picture is evolving and prone to change over the last week of February.This week's bubble activity will be particularly interesting in the Big Ten. The league has just eight teams in the current field but has three knocking on the door from within the \"First Four Out,\" which means it's plausible the conference could catch the SEC in sheer number of bids.The ACC and Big 12 are also still in the mix with nine and eight tournament teams, respectively, in Tuesday's field of 68 from the CBS Sports Bracketology model. Lagging notably behind the pack from within the high-major ranks is the Big East, which has three teams in the field.When it comes to conference supremacy in the bracket, there is far more to the discussion than just bids, though. It's also about where your teams are seeded. That debate is all about the Big Ten and Big 12, each of which have five teams in the top 16 within our model.\nMore on the conference breakdown in a moment. First, let's check at how things stand at the top of the bracket.

What that means is that 11 bids is likely the most the league can hope for. While that would be a downtick from last year's tally of 14, it would still mark a strong haul for a conference that teetered some during November and December. Within the last few weeks, we've seen Georgia, Auburn, Texas, Texas A&M and Missouri all wobble and flirt with the cut line. No one from that group is fully \"safe\" just yet. But over the longhaul, our model projects each of them will make the field.\nACCCurrently in the CBS Sports Bracketology field (9): Duke (1), Virginia (4), Louisville (5), North Carolina (6), NC State (8), SMU (8), Miami (9), Clemson (10), Cal (11)Bubbly: Virginia Tech (Next Four Out)Selection Sunday will likely be a day of redemption for the ACC after the league placed just four teams in the 2025 NCAA Tournament. That was its lowest tally since the 2013 season, when the conference featured just 12 teams. As things stand entering Tuesday's action, the ACC is projected to put half of its 18 teams into the tournament. In a best-case scenario, Virginia Tech would close strong and rise from the \"Next Four Out\" to make the league's tally 10. On the flip side, Clemson and Cal are both at risk of missing the field if they don't finish well. If they did, the league's final number could be just seven. But that would still signify marked improvement over last seasonBig TenCurrently in the CBS Sports Bracketology field: Michigan (1), Purdue (2), Illinois (2), Nebraska (3), Michigan State (4), Wisconsin (6), Iowa (8), UCLA (10)Bubbly: Ohio State (First Four Out), USC (First Four Out), Indiana (First Four Out)\nOf the high-major leagues, the Big Ten features the most bubble intrigue heading down the stretch. In a best-case scenario, it could still wind up leading the nation in NCAA Tournament bids. That would likely require Ohio State, USC and Indiana all to finish strong and reach the right side of the cut line. As things stand now, they are teetering on the edge. At 4-10 across Quad 1 and Quad 2, Indiana has fewer Q1/2 victories than anyone in the top 50 of the NET aside from Miami (Ohio). Ohio State is still searching for its Quad 1 victory (next chance is Wednesday at Iowa). USC is reeling after a Quad 3 home loss to Oregon on Saturday.Big 12Currently in the CBS Sports Bracketology field: Arizona (1), Iowa State (2), Houston (2), Kansas (3), Texas Tech (4), BYU (6), UCF (9), TCU (Last Four In)Bubbly: Arizona State (Next Four Out)The Big 12 is loaded at the top but also features a significant chunk of teams on life support in the pursuit of an at-large bid. You won't seem them listed as \"bubbly\" here, because they have a lot of ground to make up. But if West Virginia, Cincinnati or Oklahoma State started stacking wins, they could still get bubbly. Those three teams are right on Arizona State's heels for \"Next Four Out.\" But with time running short, they need to get busy in a hurry. Same goes for the Sun Devils,\nBig EastCurrently in the CBS Sports Bracketology field (3): UConn (1), St. John's (6), Villanova (7)Bubbly: Seton Hall (Next Four Out)The Big East is not having a banner season. UConn and St. John's are carrying the flag for the league. Thankfully for the conference, Villanova has also been a pleasant surprise in Year 1 under coach Kevin Willard. After that, you've got to scroll for a while before stumbling upon another potential at-large team. Seton Hall could get there, but it would likely require winning on the road Saturday against UConn. The Pirates played the Huskies close in mid-January at home, so maybe there is hope.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Days before Arkansas was set to face Alabama in a marquee SEC showdown, star guard Darius Acuff Jr. was apparently in a walking boot. It was something that coach John Calipari revealed after the fact when the Razorbacks fell on the road 117-115 in double-overtime.That didn't stop Acuff from playing. In fact, during that performance, Acuff had arguably the best individual performance of any player in college basketball this season -- especially under the circumstances. Acuff played all 50 minutes (40 minutes regulation and 10 in the overtime periods) and left it all out on the floor.Acuff scored 49 points, which was the second time a player under Calipari scored at least 40 points. The other time?

He said, 'Are you nuts?' He doesn't care. Hurt, whatever it is. He was in a boot for two days ... There's not many. And I've coached some really good guards over the years, and I've had a few this way, but he's right there with them. I'm just telling you. He's unique and special, and I would imagine everybody saw it today. But it was a good game.\"\nLet's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season.Freshman of the Week: Darius Acuff Jr., ArkansasWelcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row, CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.Acuff, the former No. 5 overall player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, is putting his name in the conversation to be an All-American. The Arkansas star should be the favorite to win SEC Player of the Year, and last week might've closed the gap despite Alabama star Labaron Philon Jr. going for 35 points in that game.\nAcuff finished with 49 points, five rebounds and five assists in 50 minutes against Alabama. In the following game against Missouri, Acuff scored 20 points and added five assists and four rebounds.Previous Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleNov. 25: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 2: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 9: Hannes Steinbach, WashingtonDec. 16: AJ Dybantsa, BYUDec. 23: Shelton Henderson, MiamiDec. 30: Ebuka Okorie, StanfordJan. 6: Darius Acuff Jr., ArkansasJan. 13: Braylon Mullins, UConnJan. 20: Cameron Boozer, DukeJan. 27: Keaton Wagler, IllinoisFeb. 3: Bryson Tiller, KansasFeb. 10: Alijah Arenas, USCFeb. 17: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleFrosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 22.6 PPG | 10.0 RPG | 4.0 APG Boozer, the National Player of the Year frontrunner, is coming off a strong outing during his toughest challenge yet.

He scored 43 points against Utah. He recorded a triple-double earlier this season against Eastern Washington. Still, last weekend might've been his most impressive performance of them all. Dybantsa finished with 29 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists during a win over Iowa State. Dybantsa has stepped up even more on the offensive end lately since star guard Richie Saunders suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Last week: 2\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Darryn Peterson | G | KansasStats: 19.8 PPG | 3.9 RPG | 1.6 APGThe hottest topic in college basketball has been the availability (or lack thereof) of Peterson. On Monday against Houston, Peterson logged 30 minutes and scored 14 points on 5 of 14 shooting. Peterson also played 32 mins in Kansas' loss against Cincinnati last weekend. Last week: 2\n        \n            \n                Cincinnati shocks Kansas with historic win at Phog Allen despite full game from Jayhawks' Darryn Peterson\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Darius Acuff Jr. | G | ArkansasStats: 22.2 PPG | 3.0 RPG | 6.2 APGAcuff is raising his draft stock with how he's playing as of late. The Arkansas star should be the pick for SEC Player of the Year if the season ended today. The numbers he is putting up on a nightly basis are incredible. Acuff is coming off a 49-point outing against Alabama. He has scored at least 20 points in 11 of Arkansas' 14 games against SEC competition. Last week: 5\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Caleb Wilson | F | North CarolinaStats: 19.8 PPG | 9.4 RPG | 2.7 APG Wilson will be out for the foreseeable future after fracturing his hand. Wilson has been one of the best first-year players in the sport and has worked himself into the conversation to be a top-five pick this summer. Wilson's 19.8 points and 9.4 rebounds per game lead the Tar Heels. Losing Wilson is a massive deal for UNC, and others will have to step up. Last week: 4\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Keaton Wagler | G | IllinoisStats: 18.2 PPG | 5.0 RPG | 4.3 APG Wagler appeared to suffer a shoulder injury against UCLA last weekend. The good news for him and Illinois is that he was able to return to action. He finished with 19 points in 39 minutes in an overtime loss to UCLA. Wagler hit a go-ahead bucket in overtime, but Illinois was on the wrong side of a buzzer-beating win moments later. Last week: 6 \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Kingston Flemings | G | HoustonStats: 16.4 PPG | 3.6 RPG | 5.3 APGFlemings finished with 16 points in a loss against Kansas on Monday. Notably, Flemings passed Rob Williams (456 points) for the most points in a single season scored by a freshman in Houston basketball history. Last week: 5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Mikel Brown Jr. | G | LouisvilleStats: 18.6 PPG | 3.4 RPG | 4.9 APG Brown finished with 24 points in a loss to North Carolina on Monday. In that game against UNC, Brown knocked down six 3-pointers.

Brayden Burries | G | ArizonaStats: 15.2 PPG | 4.6 RPG | 2.6 APGBurries hasn't been scoring as much as he did during the start of the month, but he can still impact winning regardless. He finished with seven points, four rebounds and two assists during Arizona's gritty win on the road against Houston last weekend. Last week: 9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10.

    "body": "\n        As we head into late February and March, each game a team plays can have a major impact on its NCAA Tournament resume. Some schools are fighting for No. 1 seeds, while others are seeking hosting spots. But to win March Madness games, a team must first make the 68-team field itself.Several bubble teams went a long way towards reaching that goal on Sunday, particularly in the ACC. Entering the day, Duke and Louisville had gone a combined 29-1 in conference play, with the only loss being Louisville's one-point loss against Duke. That changed as Louisville lost at home against Virginia while Duke fell at Clemson.It was the biggest win of the season for both Virginia and Clemson, vaulting the Cavaliers up to a No. 10 seed and out of the Last Four In, while the Tigers enter the field with a third Quad-1 victory. Both Virginia and Clemson have a tricky week ahead, but one win should be enough to have them on the right side of the cut line as we enter the conference tournaments.Each of those teams was playing offense on Sunday, trying to establish itself in the field. Other programs were playing defense in trying to hold onto spots. Villanova held Marquette to 39 points and is now a win at Seton Hall from locking up a bid. \nNebraska was in freefall after losing six straight and trailed Washington by six points in the final five minutes on Sunday, but stole a 66-65 win after Britt Prince's three-pointer with seven seconds left and can breathe a major sigh of relief.The big loser of the day was Mississippi State, which lost by 50 points to Texas and lost its spot to Clemson. The Bulldogs are now the first team out of the projected field with games at Texas A&M and vs LSU left on the schedule.Bracketology -- Feb. 24SeedFort Worth 1Sacramento 2Fort Worth 3Sacramento 41\n

outBYUUtahKansasCaliforniaWhat to watch forWho can make the NCAA tournament as an at-large?This is the big question as the clock ticks down to Selection Sunday. Let's start by looking at which teams currently outside looking in can still make their way in without winning their conference tournament.\nMississippi State is in the best position if any team currently in the field slips up, and it also has the biggest possible win opportunity on the board for a bubble team against LSU. Stanford was a No. 7 seed in our first projections of the season, but has now lost eight of 10 games to fall out of the field. However, it remains alive and will host Clemson in a game that could end up deciding a spot in the field. A loss would likely require Stanford to win multiple games in the ACC Tournament.South Dakota State and Richmond need wins against North Dakota State and Rhode Island, respectively, to keep any at-large hopes alive. Wins for North Dakota State and Rhode Island (currently auto-bids) in those games would go a long way towards them getting an at-large bid, but neither team should feel comfortable if they fail to win their conference tournament.Each team currently in the Next Four Out is a long shot that would need a huge close to the season and other bubble teams to falter. The committee does value late-season performance, but these schools have a ways to go.\nConference tournament seeding on the lineSouth Carolina will be the No. 1 seed in the SEC Tournament, but which teams will also receive double-byes? For the first time since women's basketball became an NCAA sport, five teams from one conference are ranked in the top seven of the AP poll this late into a season, as Texas, Vanderbilt, LSU and Oklahoma lead the teams jockeying for position.But games in the ACC, Big 12 and Big Ten also have major seeding implications, particularly in the ACC, where nine teams remain alive for a top-four seed and matchups could mean everything for teams on the NCAA Tournament bubble.And in the Ivy League, Columbia needs to win its final two games to lock up the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament, while teams across the country will be rooting for the Tigers to falter and lose the automatic bid, making their Ivy League tournament path more difficult and potentially opening up another at-large spot.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 free agent running back class is impressive, highlighted by Kenneth Walker III, Breece Hall and Travis Etienne. We'll see if any of those running backs change teams this offseason, but none of them will be headed to Dallas.The Cowboys decided to sign Javonte Williams to a three-year contract extension for $24 million, including $16 million guaranteed. Williams, who turns 26 in April, can now build on his solid 2025 campaign when he was the No. 12 PPR running back at 15.2 points per game.In his first season in Dallas, Williams had 252 carries for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns and 35 catches for 137 yards and two touchdowns on 51 targets. He scored at least 17.9 PPR points in six of his first eight games and averaged 18.6 PPR points over that span.He struggled in the second half of the season when he averaged just 11.8 PPR points over his final eight games (he missed Week 18 with a shoulder injury). But he impressed the Cowboys enough to give him a long-term extension.\nFantasy managers should consider Williams a solid No. 2 running back in all leagues, and I have him at No. 20 in my early running back rankings. I would consider drafting Williams as early as Round 5.Williams should once again be looking at a hefty workload in 2026, and he was No. 10 in carries in 2025 and No. 13 in total touches. Barring a significant change, the Cowboys will go with Malik Davis and Jaydon Blue as their top backups, and neither pose a significant threat to Williams when healthy.And, hopefully, we'll get more work for Williams in the passing game in 2026. He started the 2025 campaign with 24 catches on 34 targets in his first eight games, but he only had 11 catches on 17 targets in his final eight outings, which led to his second-half decline.\nDallas has a lot of mouths to feed on offense, especially since it appears like George Pickens will return in 2026 on at least the franchise tag if a long-term deal isn't reached. Along with CeeDee Lamb and Jake Ferguson, Dak Prescott can spread the ball around to several stars without having to feature Williams.That said, Williams should get enough work in a top-tier offense -- the Cowboys were No. 2 in total yards per game (391.9) and No. 7 in scoring (27.7 points) -- and we like featured running backs in this scenario. Williams staying in Dallas is great news for his Fantasy value.We'll continue to monitor where Walker, Hall and Etienne, among others, end up this offseason. But Williams knows where he's playing in 2026, and he has the chance to be a Fantasy star since he'll remain with the star on his helmet for potentially the next three years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As trade speculation continues to swirl around Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, coach Nick Sirianni confirmed this week that the franchise \"can't guarantee\" his return for the 2026 season. Signed through 2029 after inking a multiyear, $96 million extension in 2024, Brown and Sirianni got into it on the sideline during the team's wild card playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers, further intensifying trade rumors.The on-field spat and production decrease this past season has bled into February, leading to Sirianni's non-committal remarks from the NFL combine.\"Will A.J. be here next season? I think we're still in a spot, like, I can't guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season,\" Sirianni said. \"I'm thinking I'm going to be the coach next season but you can't guarantee anything past tomorrow.\"Brown voiced his displeasure several times with lack of involvement in Philadelphia's offense this past fall despite finishing the campaign with 78 catches for 1,003 yards and seven touchdowns. There has been a sense of discomfort from Brown despite being a productive pass catcher in Philadelphia over his first four seasons, which includes a pair of Super Bowl appearances.\nFewer targets the last two years after opening his stint with the Eagles with a pair of 1,400-yard seasons in 2022 and 2023 has bothered Brown. And now, there is no open commitment from Sirianni or general manager Howie Roseman that Brown will be back next season.\"My expectation is he wants to be here. And obviously you want good players like that in your building,\" Sirianni said. \"As Howie said, it's hard to get good players in this league. A.J.'s a great player and A.J. is a good teammate and A.J. is a good person. Does he want to be here? Yes. Do I want him to be here? Yes.\"Roseman said that the Eagles are open to trade offers for Brown and always looking for avenues to improve their roster, according to ESPN.\n\"I think you go into the league year listening to offers for everything and anything,\" Roseman said. \"If someone is going to give you something you didn't anticipate and you won't even have the conversation, I don't think you're necessarily doing your job or really servicing the team you're with. You never know what someone is willing to do. Certainly, we've been in situations where there were guys we didn't anticipate trading that we got an offer that was too good, and then you balance it with what you can get there.\"Without getting into specifics on any player, we're always listening and we're always kind of open. There's very few things that I would shoot down without even hearing what that means, because how does it hurt to listen?\"The Eagles traded for Brown during the 2022 NFL Draft after shipping first- and third-round picks to the Tennessee Titans. In the current market, Philadelphia's return in a possible trade would pale in comparison given Brown's age (29) and contract situation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas -- It's been 100 minutes since No. 14 Kansas beat No. 5 Houston, 69-56, to notch Bill Self's 41st consecutive Big Monday dub, and yet, huddled in a chilly dark corner right outside of Allen Fieldhouse's Gate 12 stands a flock of Jayhawk fans just itching for a sight -- or maybe an autograph -- from you know who: Darryn Peterson. Peterson's days in Lawrence are numbered, so every moment feels fleeting and of utmost importance. Every time he trots to the bench, it's become standard to wonder if No. 22 is returning or not amid a season chalked full of injuries, criticism and a whole lot of cramps.  Which made a day like Monday feel ... weirdly normal? Self may have had the Sunday scaries after Saturday's home hiccup against Cincinnati, but there were no Monday blues. Kansas won on Big Monday as it will perhaps for the rest of time, and Peterson played a full 30 minutes, showcasing nearly the full gamut of what has become The Darryn Peterson Experience (patent pending). Arguably the top prospect in the 2026 NBA Draft abruptly got subbed out after a 96-second shift in the second half. When the dreaded black heating pads were spotted, everyone in the building wondered if it was happening again. This time, those pesky cramps stayed away, and Peterson got to finish what he started. When Peterson splashed the dagger trey with 3:06 left to put big, bad Houston to bed for good, Kansas' much-maligned star finally got to experience what he dreamed about. He's still playing right now for the crowd pops like that one that sent the fieldhouse into a tizzy.  \n\"It was electric out there today,\" a quiet, confident Peterson said. \"Part of the reason of coming to Kansas is the environment.\" \n        \n            \n                NBA Draft Big Board 2026: Kansas' Darryn Peterson sits at No. 1 in prospect rankings despite sitting out again\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPeterson describes himself as an \"antisocial loner,\" perhaps as a shield to deflect the barbs that have been pelted into his front door. He missed seven games with a hamstring injury that lingered for a month, spanning most of November and into early December. He missed romps over Towson and Davidson in mid-December with cramps. He missed a Jan. 24 runaway win over rival Kansas State with an ankle sprain, but the fervor ramped up to a new level when Peterson dominated the first half of his head-to-head matchup with BYU's AJ Dybantsa on Jan. 31 before exiting early in the second half with cramps. Kansas held on -- barely -- to win that game, but the microscope was here to stay. When Peterson warmed up for a jiffy but didn't play against then-No. 1 Arizona on Feb. 9 due to sickness, the boil began in earnest. When cameras caught him asking out of last week's win over Oklahoma State with cramps, the crockpot exploded. Peterson's love for basketball has been cross-examined. Peterson's been accused of dreaded load management. Peterson's buy-in for Kansas has been questioned. He's been given a harsh \"DNP\" nickname. Hall of Famer Dick Vitale even called it a \"soap opera\" and pleaded for a divorce between Kansas and Peterson. \nIt's just ... a lot. \"Someone has something to say after every game this year,\" Peterson said. \"I don't really pay attention anymore.\" Peterson's camp finally broke its silence this week. \"You can't pray for rain then complain about the mud,\" Darryn Peterson's father, Darryl, told CBS Sports on Monday. \"We embrace what comes with this journey. The good and bad. I'm so grateful for this year, this season, and for what's to come. It has taught so many life lessons to prepare Darryn and our family for what he's about to go through being the No. 1 pick and future face of someone's franchise [and] the league.\"  Supporting cast coming together Real stakes for all parties are intertwined in all of this because Kansas believes it has what it takes to scale the mountain if it can just get and stay whole for the next few weeks. Self, unabashedly, loves this team. St. Bonaventure transfer point guard Melvin Council Jr. has become a cult hero in Lawrence. The student section barks when he touches the rock as an ode to Council's tenacious dawg persona. The 23-year-old has stepped into the role of comedian, pest and emotional leader for this Kansas group. Peterson is the most talented player, and big man Flory Bidunga is one of the elite defensive players in all of college basketbal.  \nBut Council is the team's soul, and what he says goes, most of the time, until he brings up a 20-passenger limo that won't start unless high-level defense is played in Monday's postgame press conference. Veteran wing Tre White and Peterson could only suppress their laughs for so long at an analogy that didn't make a ton of sense but somehow struck all the right notes to explain what makes Council tick and why he's become so beloved in this hoops-loving town. \"Last year's team wasn't quite as connected, in my opinion,\" Self told CBS Sports. \"They liked each other. We just had too many interests last year. Whereas this year, you know, Melvin's a 23-year-old kid that comes in here, and he's thinking one thing: ball. Other guys can be a sixth-year senior, and they're thinking of life after college. There's just a different thing. Those guys last year liked each other, but it wasn't the connectivity through the game that really made them like each other, where I think this is much more of that.\" White has emerged as a steady, two-way, high-level producer who drains left-corner treys at a 42% clip now. Council is a jet in the open floor who can really pester opposing lead guards. Bidunga is a freaky defender, who blew up Houston's actions left and right in what turned out to be the Cougars' worst offensive showing of the season. Redshirt-freshman Bryson Tiller is not consistent, but man, his good days are very, very potent. \nBut Peterson is the skeleton key. Even though his top-end burst, power and explosiveness haven't been on full display, Peterson's combination of size and shooting is essential for Kansas. Houston's Kelvin Sampson described him similarly to Tennessee's Chaz Lanier, who led the Volunteers to the 2025 Elite Eight. Council will go a step further. \"He's Batman, that's all I gotta say,\" Council says. Peterson played 32 cramp-free minutes against Cincinnati and 30 minutes against Houston just two days later. Selection Sunday is impossibly less than three weeks away, and 21-7 Kansas is tracking to be a No. 2 or No. 3 seed, but it needs to be at full strength for more than just two games in a row. Kansas' starting five of Council, Peterson, White, Tiller and Bidunga have played 161 minutes together, per CBB Analytics. That's far behind the eight-ball compared to some of the titans Kansas could face in the NCAA Tournament: \nStarting lineup minutes, per CBB Analytics   RankTeamStarting Lineup Minutes8Purdue2967Florida2805Houston2702Arizona2556UConn20714Kansas161\"Do I know who we are? No,\" Self said. \"But I still think we got time to figure it out. But it was a big step in the right direction having Darryn out there the vast majority of the time. ... I think when in some of those games without Darryn, even though it stunk, it may have been not the worst thing for us because it forced guys to be players as opposed to be contributors. Now we just have to find a blend and a balance.\"The finality in college basketball is unlike any other. It can be over so violently quickly, and there's more than a puncher's chance that Peterson will exit college basketball's spotlight with so much left unsaid. Like, why does he only wear plain black shoes? Or what movies is he obsessed with? Gate 12's doors swing open one more time, and a twinge of hope is palpable.  It wasn't Peterson, but no one is going home.  They're waiting for Batman. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys have one of the best kicking weapons in the NFL in Brandon Aubrey, but if they're not careful, they could end up losing him this offseason. Aubrey is set to be a restricted free agent, which means the Cowboys will have almost every chance to hold on to him, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to happen. If the Cowboys reach a long-term deal with Aubrey before free agency starts on March 11, then they'll keep him, but if that doesn't happen, then things could get interesting. And right now, it's starting to look like things will get interesting. During an interview at the NFL Scouting Combine on Monday, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones admitted that the team has been trying for months to get a deal done with Aubrey, but the two sides haven't been able to agree on a number. \"We've been in talks with Aubrey [since] before the season started,\" Jones said, via The Athletic. \"It's been a journey, but we haven't been able to get to a point where we can all agree, so it hasn't gotten done, but we'd love to get him done.\"\nIf the two sides don't agree to a new deal, the Cowboys would have to place a one-year restricted free agent tender on Aubrey. For the 2026 offseason, here are the three tender options along with how much Aubrey would make for the upcoming season (contract estimates via Overthecap): First-round tender (One-year, $8.02 million)Second-round tender (One-year, $5.81 million)Right-of-refusal tender (One-year, $3.55 million)If the Cowboys were to use any of these three tenders on Aubrey, that means another team could come in and make an offer. If a team does make an offer, the Cowboys have the right to match it. If the Cowboys used a first-round tender on Aubrey and he ends up signing with another team, then his new team would have to give Dallas a first-round pick as compensation. However, if Aubrey didn't get any offers, he'd make $8.02 million on one-year deal with the Cowboys in 2026 as part of the first-round tender. In that situation, he'd become the highest-paid kicker in NFL history by far (The current title belongs to Harrison Butker, who makes $6.4 million per year with the Chiefs). \nWith the second-round tender, if Aubrey leaves for another team, then Dallas will get a second-round pick in return. With the right-of-refusal tender, the Cowboys would get zero compensation if Aubrey signs with another team. In all three instances, the Cowboys would get a chance to match any offer that's made to Aubrey, so they do hold some serious leverage here. Once again, the Cowboys could avoid this entire situation by getting a long-term deal done by March 11, but if that doesn't happen, then the 31 other teams will be free to call him and make an offer (The Cowboys could also hit Aubrey with the franchise tag at a cost of $6.9 million, but then they wouldn't be able to use the tag on any other player, so that seems unlikely). Aubrey, who holds the NFL record for most field goals of 60 yards or more, is the ultimate kicking weapon and he's one of the few kickers in the NFL who would be worth almost any price you have to pay to get him, including a possible first-round pick. \nWith that in mind, let's take a look at a four teams who should try to steal Aubrey from the Cowboys. One note here, there are plenty of teams that need a kicker, but we're going to stick with mostly indoor teams on our list, because Aubrey seems to thrive indoors. According to Pro Football Reference, he's hit 93.8% of his field goal attempts while playing indoors in his career (dome or retractable roof), but just 78.3% while playing outdoors. No, that's not a great percentage for outdoor kicks, but one of those misses came from 70. Basically, Aubrey is asked to do things that almost no other kicker in the league is asked to do, which hurts his accuracy rate. This man is a weapon, so let's check out who should pay up to get him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsThe Rams had one of the worst special teams units in the NFL last season and a big reason for that is because they struggled in the kicking department. Joshua Karty started the season as the kicker, but after hitting just 66.7% of his field goals through eight games, the Rams decided to move on. Harrison Mevis took over after that and went 12 of 13 to close out the season, which was solid, but he was never really tested from long range. He only attempted two kicks from outside 45 yards and he went 1 of 2 (50%). \nSince taking over the Rams' coaching job in 2017, Sean McVay has never had a true long-range kicker like Aubrey. During his three years in Dallas, Aubrey has hit seven field goals from 59 yards or longer, which is a huge number when you consider that the Rams have had ZERO field goals of 59 yards or longer during McVay's nine seasons with the team. In 2025, the Rams were one of just three teams that didn't have a single field goal longer than 52 yards. Aubrey, who has a career long of 65 yards, is the only kicker in NFL history with three field goals of 63 yards or longer. With NFL teams getting the ball at the 35 on a touchback thanks to the new kickoff rules, the Rams would need just 15 yards to essentially be in Aubrey's range. Back in Week 2, the Cowboys were in that exact situation. After the Giants scored a touchdown to take a 37-34 lead on Dallas with just 25 seconds left to play, it looked like the Cowboys were going to lose, but they didn't, because they have Aubrey. After the ensuing kickoff, the Cowboys drove just 21 yards, which put Aubrey in range for a 64-yard field goal that sent the game to overtime. \nAubrey then won the game in overtime with a 46-yard kick. As crazy as it sounds, four of the Rams' five regular-season losses might have gone differently in 2025 with Aubrey on their team. Week 3: Eagles 33-26 over Rams. The Rams lost this game because Philly blocked two L.A. field goals, including one that the Eagles returned for a touchdown. Aubrey gets a lot of height on his kicks and NONE of his field goal attempts were blocked in 2025, so the Rams likely win this game with Aubrey. Week 5: 49ers 26-23 over Rams. Karty missed a 53-yard field goal in the second half of this game and that's exactly kind of kick that you bring in Aubrey for. Maybe the Rams still don't win if that kick goes through -- because it would have only meant a tie game -- but it certainly would have made things more interesting. Week 16: Seahawks 38-37 over Rams. Mevis missed a 48-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, which definitely hurt. Also, the Rams had a first-and-10 at their own 49-yard line in the final minute of regulation. With Aubrey on your team, you only need a few yards to get in field goal range and the Rams likely would have had called plays differently to reflect that. Instead, Matthew Stafford threw three straight incompletions and the Rams punted in an eventual loss. Week 17: Falcons 27-24 over Rams. The Rams got the ball at their own 35-yard line with just 21 seconds left and no timeouts. Stafford shot for the sideline on four straight throws, but came up empty each time. With Aubrey on the team, the Rams could've taken a shot over the middle as long as it got them to at least the 50. At that point, they could have spiked it and at least given Aubrey a chance from long range. There are only two or three kickers who would have a realistic chance from 68 and Aubrey is one of them. Rams general manager Les Snead invented the \"F them picks\" philosophy and nothing would go along with that more than giving up a second- or first-round pick for Aubrey. That's right, I said first-round pick. If the Cowboys put a first-round tender on him, I still think this move would make sense for the Rams. They have two first-round picks and giving one up for the ultimate kicking weapon would be the ultimate \"F them picks\" move. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThere is no team that had a bigger kicking nightmare in 2025 than the Atlanta Falcons. They finished tied for first place in the NFC South with an 8-9 record and they probably would have made the playoffs if they had a better kicker. Let's take a look at all the times that a missed kick cost them a win last season: \nWeek 1: Buccaneers 23-20 over Falcons. The Falcons lost their opener after Younghoe Koo missed a 44-yard field goal with just two seconds left. The Falcons decided to move on from Koo after the miss. He went 2 of 3 in the game against Tampa Bay, but after hitting just 73.5% of his field goals in 2024, the Falcons had lost confidence in him. Week 9: Patriots 24-23 over Falcons. The Falcons went on the road and had a chance to tie the game up in the fourth quarter after scoring a touchdown with under five minutes left to play, but John Parker Romo missed the extra point. If he had made the kick, it would have tied things up at 24 and the Falcons might have beaten the eventual AFC champions. Week 13: Jets 27-24 over Falcons. In this game, Zane Gonzalez missed a 50-yard field goal in the second half, which definitely hurt considering the Falcons ended up losing by three. That's three games that could have gone a different way with better kicking, and as you may or may have not noticed the three kicks above were all missed by different kickers, which means that yup, the Falcons used THREE DIFFERENT KICKERS last season. With Aubrey on the team, the Falcons probably win at least one of those games and with one extra win, they would have won the NFC South. Over the past three seasons, the Falcons have only hit ONE field goal of more than 56 yards. In that same span, Aubrey has hit 13. With a new head coach in place, the Falcons are starting over this season and starting over at kicker by adding Aubrey would be a smart move. \nFalcons fans have spent the past few months trying will this move into existence and now, Atlanta will have a chance to make it happen. Getting Aubrey would certainly be a bold move for Matt Ryan, who is in his first-year as the lead decision-maker in the Falcons' front office. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsThere's no coach in the NFL who takes kicking more seriously than John Harbaugh. During his time in Baltimore, the former Ravens coach had Justin Tucker, who was arguably the best kicker in NFL history during his prime years. After moving on from Tucker, the Ravens drafted Tyler Loop, who had a solid rookie season before missing a potential game-winning field goal in Week 18 that would have sent Baltimore to the playoffs. \nIn a twist of irony, the coach who prides himself on finding kickers lost his job because of a kicker. Now that he's in New York, you can bet that Harbaugh will look to fix the kicking position. The Giants used four kickers (and one punter) in 2025 and those kickers combined to hit an NFL-worst 87.8% of their extra points. Those kickers also combined to hit just 57.1% of their kicks from 40 yards or longer. Dating to the start of the 2024 season, the Giants haven't hit a single field goal longer than 55 yards. \nThe Giants do have Graham Gano under contract, but he's going to be 39 years old and he's missed 28 games over the past three seasons, so it won't be surprising if Harbaugh decides to bring a kicker in and if he wants to shock the rest of the league, that kicker will be Aubrey. It's a move that would be win-win because it would help the Giants and make a division rival worse off at a key position. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsChad Ryland was the Cardinals' kicker last season and he hit just 75.2% of his field goal attempts, which was the lowest percentage for any kicker with 25 attempts or more. Ryland hit just 58.8% of his kicks from 43 yards and longer, including 1 of 4 from outside 57 yards. As bad as the Cardinals (3-14) were last season, this is a team that lost seven games by seven points or less. Ryland missed at least one field goal in three different games that the Cardinals lost by three points or less. If the Cowboys use a second-round tender on Aubrey, the Cardinals would have to give up the 34th overall pick in the draft to get him, which might be too expensive for this roster. Getting Aubrey only makes sense if you think it might put you over the top or in the Giants' case, if you have a head coach who's obsessed with having the best kicker in football. For the Cardinals, this cost might be too high, but the argument for it is that it's not every day you have a chance to land a weapon like Aubrey, so why not do whatever possible to make it happen. \nUsing a first- or second-round pick to steal Aubrey might seem crazy, but he's certainly worth it, especially since the NFL is in an era where almost every game seems to be close. In 2025, there were a total of 73 regular-season games decided by three points or less, which was tied for the most in NFL history. Every NFL team should be trying to get an edge wherever it can to help it win close games and when you have a kicker like Aubrey, that gives you an edge over everyone else. \n            ",

To be clear, I get it. Algorithms are algorithms. But, eventually, all algorithms are gonna have to figure out a way to take into account the reality that Self never loses at home on Big Monday.Final score: Kansas 69, Houston 56.As the \"Aint No Seats Podcast\" noted on X, the Jayhawks have been underdogs three times in the past two months inside Allen Fieldhouse.Those games have unfolded like this:\n1/13/26: Kansas 84, Iowa State 63 (despite the Jayhawks closing as 3.5-point underdogs).2/9/26: Kansas 82, Arizona 78 (despite the Jayhawks playing without Darryn Peterson, the favorite to go No. 1 in the 2026 NBA Draft).2/23/26: Kansas 69, Houston 56 (despite the Jayhawks being only two days removed from a double-digit loss at home to a Cincinnati team that entered just 1-9 in Quadrant-1 opportunities this season).Bottom line, Allen Fieldhouse is a special place -- what happened there Saturday notwithstanding. Kansas is up to No. 11 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Duke remains No. 1 for the third consecutive day. Houston is down to No. 6. Next up for the Jayhawks is Saturday's game at Arizona. FYI: those two teams now have the third-best odds (Arizona)  and the ninth-best odds (Kansas) to win the 2026 NCAA Tournament, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

    "body": "\n        There is no debate about who the 2026 NFL Draft's top running back is this draft cycle. Notre Dame's Jeremiyah Love has that title locked down. Love led all of college football with 35 touchdowns rushing and 40 touchdowns from scrimmage across the 2024 and 2025 seasons, and he took a massive leap in production in 2025. He went from averaging 70.3 rushing yards per game in 2024 to 114.3 in 2025, a jump of 44 yards per game. That led to Love earning the 2025 Doak Walker Award as college football's best running back and becoming just the sixth player in FBS history with multiple seasons of averaging over 6.5 yards per carry while amassing at least 15 rushing touchdowns. He enters the 2026 draft cycle as this year's 10th-best overall prospect, according to CBS Sports' rankings, but will he actually fly off the board inside the top 10? Let's take a look at five potential landing spots for the Fighting Irish superstar ahead of his 2026 NFL Scouting Combine performance. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans Saints (No. 8 overall pick) The New Orleans Saints may have found something in 2025 second-round rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who won five of his nine starts, including four of the last five, to end the year. \nHowever, New Orleans averaged just 18.0 points per game, ranking 28th out of the NFL's 32 teams last season. That figure was the lowest by a Saints offense since 2005, the final season before Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees and head coach Sean Payton joined the franchise in 2006. Some of that had to do with years of wear and tear catching up to New Orleans' five-time Pro Bowl running back Alvin Kamara: he produced career lows in yards from scrimmage (657) and scrimmage touchdowns (1) after missing the final six games of the 2025 season with knee and ankle injuries. Kamara, who will turn 31 in the final year of his contract in 2026, could very well be entering his last year as a Saint, and the franchise needs to begin planning for the future. Drafting Love would give New Orleans an ideal successor to the franchise's all-time leading rusher while, simultaneously, providing some much-needed playmaking juice for Shough. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs (No. 9 overall pick)The Kansas City Chiefs need an upgrade at the running back position in the worst way. Running backs Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt began the 2025 season so slowly that quarterback Patrick Mahomes needed to be the team's leading rusher with 222 yards on the ground through the first six weeks of the year. \nHunt ended the season as Kansas City's rushing leader with 611 yards rushing, but both he and Pacheco are set to become free agents this offseason. Hunt is a nice short-yardage back, but he's no longer a bell cow as he enters his age-31 season in 2026. Pacheco cannot be relied upon to stay on the field, considering he missed 14 games over the last two seasons amid various injuries.That's why Love makes plenty of sense for Kansas City with the ninth overall pick. Mahomes can have a dependable running back to lean on as he eases his way back into action after suffering a torn ACL on Dec. 14 last year. Plus, Eric Bieniemy is back in charge as the Chiefs offensive coordinator in 2026, having spent the 2025 season helping lead the Chicago Bears to the No. 3 rushing attack in the NFL at 144.5 yards rushing per game as Ben Johnson's running backs coach. He would be an ideal coach to pair up with Love. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams (13th overall pick via Atlanta Falcons)Yes, the Rams just inked running back Kyren Williams to a three-year, $33 million extension, but Los Angeles could make the most of being in the upper half of the draft in 2026 by selecting the best player available at this spot in Love should he fall this far. Selecting Love could embolden the Rams to sell high on Williams and trade him for draft compensation, which would also free up $9.07 million in cap space for the NFC runner-up. Head coach Sean McVay could make sweet, sweet music with Love, who would become the most talented running back he's had since 1017 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Todd Gurley.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens (14th overall pick)Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry is an alien. At the age of 31 in 2025, he was the NFL's second-leading rusher with 1,595 rushing yards. That marked his fifth career season with 1,500-plus yards on the ground, tying Hall of Famer Barry Sanders for the most such seasons in NFL history. However, Henry is now 32 years old, so it's fair for the Ravens to begin planning for the future at the running back position in order to continue to take some of the rushing burden off of two-time NFL MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson's plate. Jackson was derailed by a hamstring injury this past season, but adding Love would allow the Ravens dynamic dual threat to save his rushing chops for break glass in case of emergency situations, which could extend Jackson's career. Plus, new offensive coordinator Declan Doyle comes over from the Bears where he helped Chicago have the league's No. 3 run game, 144.5 rushing yards per game, under head coach Ben Johnson. This could be an ideal home for Love. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Jets (16th overall pick via Indianapolis Colts)New York Jets running back Breece Hall, who is a dynamic player, is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Given all the various needs the Jets have, it wouldn't make sense for New York to allocate significant cap space to re-sign him. However, New York could use a new lead back for an offense that ranked as the NFL's second-worst in 2025, scoring just 17.6 points per game. Getting Love smack dab in the middle of the first round would be a strong value for the 2026 draft's top rusher. He could help make life a lot easier for whoever ends up being the Jets' starting quarterback in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The speed record in the 40-yard dash will be challenged at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine thanks to a handful of wide receivers with jet fuel in their tanks expected to run in Indianapolis.Former Texas star Xavier Worthy made history two years ago with the fastest 40-yard dash in combine history at a lightning quick 4.21. Unofficially ruled a 4.22 at the first, the official time came in one-hundredth of a second faster to spark the all-time mark.Initial burst, explosiveness and acceleration are vital factors each of these athletes possess toward setting a new mark. For many projected first-rounders, however, a less-than-stellar showing in the 40 can hinder draft stock and there's a few high-end prospects expected to skip the speed portion of the event.After speaking with various NFL scouts, this is the group that continued coming up in conversation:\nBrennen Thompson, WR, Mississippi StateThe expectation from most insiders is Thompson should top the charts and potentially challenge Worthy's all-time mark. Thompson is long removed from his 10.18-second 100-meter dash showing in high school, but consistently clocked in the sub 4.3s at Oklahoma before his transfer to Mississippi State. The Bulldogs measured Thompson at 23.7 MPH in the preseason before he led the  SEC with five catches spanning 50 or more yards last season.Barion Brown, WR, LSUIn terms of overall team speed, few were faster last season than LSU, who have several former players expected to blaze a trail in Indianapolis. One of those athletes is Brown, who scored six career kickoff return touchdowns in the SEC at Kentucky and LSU. The fastest player on Day 1 at the Senior Bowl earlier this year, Brown clocked in at 20.35 MPH on the Zebra Technologies performance tracker and his straight line get up as a long-strider is fluid. One of his top highlights last season was a 99-yard punt return score in LSU's bowl game against Houston.Chris Hilton, WR, LSUHilton played behind several all-conference wideouts during his time in Baton Rouge, but holds a program record after once posting a 23.7 mph run on the GPS. Hilton averaged 19 yards per catch in his career and has a second gear few others possess this cycle, but battled leg and ankle injuries during his career and rarely saw consistent targets. He's at full strength this month and has prepared to flex his best in the 40.\n\"You're focusing on potential with Hilton and his skill set is similar to Tyreek Hill without the production,\" one NFL Draft scout told CBS Sports.Domani Jackson, CB, AlabamaStraight line speed is Jackson's speciality, though he didn't get many opportunities to showcase that blaze with the Crimson Tide outside of chasing the opposition's WR1 on the outside. He shows a knack for closing quickness in coverage as a former five-star.  Jackson tied California's state record in the 100 meters with a head-turning 10.25-second time that ranked No. 2 nationally in 2021, but prep showings aren't always a perfect translation.D'Angelo Ponds, CB, IndianaA former track star, Ponds makes up for his lack of size with superlatives across the board in several categories as a potential first-round cornerback, including his instincts, ball skills and of course, his speed. Rarely beaten with the Hoosiers, his closing quickness is among the best this cycle at the position and few players are faster in coverage. Ponds' interception return for a touchdown in the College Football Playoff semifinals against Oregon was a spotlight play, one his coaches at Indiana saw throughout the last two years in practice. If there's a wild-card speedster inside Lucas Oil Stadium who could surprise with a jaw-dropping time, numerous scouts are pointing to Ponds.\n\"Ponds is probably the fastest DB I saw on tape,\" one evaluator who spent time at the Senior Bowl said.Other speedsters to watch: Daylen Everette, CB, Georgia; Aaron Anderson, WR, LSU; Zachariah Branch, WR, Georgia \n            ",

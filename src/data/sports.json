    "body": "\n        After a 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 12 LSU Tigers shook off all doubts with a statement 70-65 victory over No. 2 Texas on Sunday. This was the Longhorns' first loss of the season, and also LSU's first win over an AP top two team since 2008.\"I'm sure you've heard, but coach (Kim) Mulkey says she wants us to be tough,\" Mikaylah Williams said in her postgame broadcast interview. \"And I think that's something we've really taken pride in after those first two losses. Being tough, sticking together and playing hard. That's something that we've done and that's something we've been successful at so far.\"The sold-out crowd in Baton Rouge was electric all 40 minutes, but they exploded when Williams practically sealed the deal with a three-pointer that made it a three-possession game with just 1:18 remaining. This was just another example of the impact she had on Sunday. She had a complete performance that included 20 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 5 steals.\nHere is a closer look at how LSU upset Texas:A stifling defense that shut down Rori HarmonThe Tigers got off to a rough start offensively as they went just 7 of 26 from the field, but their defense made sure Texas didn't get hot either. \nLSU held the Longhorns to 25 points in the first two quarters, which is their lowest scoring half this season. Although Texas has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, the team finished Sunday with a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Jordan Lee has been one of the most consistent players for Texas, but she only made three field goals all day. Meanwhile, point guard Rori Harmon had just two points, going 1 of 7 from the field. Harmon sat out the entire fourth quarter after Vic Schaefer decided to go with Bryanna Preston.\nLimiting Madison Booker, especially in the first halfBooker was the spark for a Texas comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, but despite finishing the day with 24 points on 10 of 16 shooting, those stats don't tell the whole story. LSU's defense, with Williams being a key part of it, limited Booker to just four points and three turnovers in the first half. She also had two fouls in those first two quarters and was dangerously close to fouling out as she picked up her fourth early in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the loss, Booker is already thinking about how to lock in and bounce back when the Longhorns take on South Carolina.\"Coach said it, we are not ready for Thursday,\" Booker said postgame. \"We are still going to come no matter what, but we have to get ready. We have to prepare again and we have to try to fix our mistakes.\"Fighting for reboundsLSU no longer has Angel Reese or Aneesah Morrow to take over in the rebounding category. Kim Mulkey has been talking all season about how she wants the whole team to make a conscious effort in this area, and they did just that against Texas. LSU won the battle on the boards 44-35, which means the Tigers' grueling practices have paid off.\n\"We've had practices with a rebound bubble on, so the ball can't go in so you have to rebound,\" Williams said postgame. \"If you didn't get it, there was running involved. \"I'm proud of how we rebounded today.\"\nShowcasing depth, with five players scored in double digitsWilliams was the star of the show on Sunday, but there were multiple Tigers who stepped up during big moments. Four other LSU players joined her in the double-digit club with 10 points each, including Jada Richard, who hit a stunning buzzer-beater at the end of the second quarter following a steal and dime from Williams.\nFlau'jae Johnson was coming off her highest scoring game of the season in the win against Georgia. She only made four field goals against Texas but her impact was still felt throughout the game. When the Longhorns were working on a comeback, Johnson got an and-one with 7:15 remaining to keep injecting energy into her team and the crowd. The 5-foot-10 guard also got the crowd going with a block against 6-foot-6 center Kyla Oldacre later in the fourth quarter.\nMaLaysia Fulwiley is still cleaning up aspects of her games, but her moves also make the game exciting. Another key bench player is ZaKiyah Johnson, who Richard described her as a \"dog\" postgame.\n            ",

Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard touchdown pass with just 38 seconds left to lead the Rams to a 34-31 comeback win over the Panthers. In the second game, the Bears stormed back from an 18-point halftime deficit to stun the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard scoring pass with just under two minutes left to play for the game-winning score. The win for the Bears was the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. It was also the third-largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL playoff history. After a wild opening day, the drama continued on Sunday with the Bills pulling off a 27-24 win over the Jaguars in a game that saw four lead changes in the fourth quarter. The Bills will now head to the divisional round for the sixth straight year. In the second game on Sunday, there was more madness with the 49ers pulling off the biggest upset of the opening round with a 23-19 win over the Eagles. With San Francisco's win, that ends Philadelphia's bid to become the NFC's first repeat Super Bowl champ in more than 30 years. It also means that the NFC West is now just the second division over the past 25 years to send three teams to the divisional round. The 49ers will be joining the Rams and Seahawks. The final game on Sunday will take place in New England where the Patriots will host the Chargers. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) Jaguars\nBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8:15 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETAFC divisional round games: TBA at (1) BroncosTBA vs. (6) BillsAFC NOTE: The Broncos will host the Bills if the Patriots beat the Chargers on Sunday night.

    "body": "\nThe penultimate game of Wild Card Weekend comes on 'Sunday Night Football' as the New England Patriots host the Los Angeles Chargers at 8:15 p.m. ET. The Patriots are 3.5-point favorites at DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under is 45.5, matching the second highest total on the board for the first round of the 2026 NFL playoffs. The kickoff temperature is expected to hover around freezing, so that'll be a factor when crafting NFL DFS strategy for any showdown slates on sites like DraftKings or FanDuel.Chargers running back Omarion Hampton (ankle) is active after missing Week 18 and being listed as questionable for 'SNF'.

His rushing production increased as well as he piled up 450 yards and four scores on the ground.

His season-long numbers are down compared to last year, but he's still shown big-play ability recently, making a catch of at least 25 yards in each of his past two games. He's also scored six times in the past 12 games, showing that he has around a coin flip's chance to find the end zone in this playoff matchup. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet McConkey to go Over 3.5 receptions at DraftKings:\nHow to set Chargers vs. Patriots DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles are looking to defend their title of Super Bowl champions, and their postseason journey begins this Sunday with a wild card matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. In the first half of this NFC showdown, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni and star wideout A.J. Brown had to be separated following a heated exchange.Late in the second quarter, Brown dropped a deep ball on a third-and-9. Sirianni raced down the sideline to seemingly confront him. Brown took issue with whatever his coach said, and also had some words for Sirianni before the two parties were separated by staff members -- including Dom DiSandro.Check out what happened, here:\nAt the halftime break, Sirianni told sideline reporter Erin Andrews, \"Emotions, they run high especially in the playoffs.\" The coach said he and Brown will be just fine.NFL Media's Mike Garafolo hypothesized that Sirianni ran over to Brown not to chastise him for his drop, but to make sure he was getting off the field so that he wouldn't pick up a penalty for too many men on the field. \nBrown has been critical of Philly's offense multiple times this season. He maintains that the source of his frustration is not about targets, but about the efficiency of the unit at large. \"I think if we're really focused on winning and doing our job, we can't just keep slapping a band-aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble,\" Brown said in November. \"At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense? We're so great, and that's what I'm getting at. It's not about I don't care about winning or all I care about is stats. No. It's been week after week sometimes, we're not doing our job on offense. So you can't just keep slapping a band-aid over that and you expect to win late in the year ... it's not going to happen. \"Last year, what it was, thank you for the ring, but it's a new season. They adapted, we have to adapt and we have to continue to get better and try to find new ways. That's where the frustration comes in. It's not about winning, you guys. I want to win, yes. I want to help contribute as well, do our thing on offense as well. I think that's fair.\" \nIn 15 regular-season games played this year, Brown caught 78 passes for 1,003 yards and seven touchdowns. He's crossed 1,000 yards receiving in all four seasons with the Eagles, but his 1,003 yards marked his lowest total in Philly. \n            ",

The only sure thing going into Monday: No. 1 Arizona will remain No. 1, and it also might have the strongest grip on the ranking for any No. 1 team all season, to boot.Arizona's share of first-place votes has fallen each of the last three weeks -- from 42 to 38 to 32 last week -- as No. 2 Michigan made its case for No. 1 and ate into its hold on the spot. But Michigan's first loss of the season Saturday at home to Wisconsin as 19.5-point favorites means the runway is clear for the Wildcats to seize full control at No. 1. The most first-place votes a team has gotten this season was Purdue's 46 in Week 4. Arizona could and likely will enter that territory Monday.\nMichigan's loss also clears the way for undefeated Iowa State to move up one spot to No. 2 -- which would mark not just its highest ranking of the season but also tie its highest standing in the AP poll in program history. Only once has ISU ranked No. 2 in the poll -- and that came Week 11 of last season.\n        \n            \n                College basketball scores, winners, losers: Michigan loses first game, Nebraska tops Indiana, remains unbeaten\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs you can tell, Michigan's loss is the precipitating event that will cause this inevitable commotion Monday, and how AP voters handle the Wolverines in the poll is a mystery. My guess, however, is that Michigan -- 14-1 overall and still leading the sport in scoring margin -- will settle in ballots and remain somewhere inside the top five.\nIn fact, that's hardly the toughest decision for voters this week as they prep their ballots. Ten teams ranked 13th or worse suffered at least one loss this week. There is going to be plenty of shuffling in that area, and also perhaps some new teams enter the rankings because of it. Let's get to my projections below. 1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Monday will be the fifth consecutive week for Arizona at No. 1 in the AP poll. It won twice vs. Big 12 foes by double figures this week to improve to 16-0 on the season.

    "body": "\n        There have been a lot of incredible comebacks in the NFL and football fans were treated to another one in the wild card round of the 2025 NFL Playoffs. The Chicago Bears were down 21-3 against the Green Bay Packers at halftime and rallied from an 18-point deficit to advance to the divisional round.It seemed like the Packers were going to run away with it and defeat their divisional opponents on the road, up 21-6 through three quarters, but as Bears quarterback Caleb Williams reminded everyone after the victory, games are 60 minutes.The Bears were prepared to play hard until the final whistle, using another historic comeback as a reminder that games aren't over until the clock says 0:00. Bears coach Ben Johnson told reporters after the playoff win that during training camp he showed his players the New England Patriots' 25-point Super Bowl comeback over the Atlanta Falcons. He used it as a reminder to not give in, even with a large deficit.The Bears have two players on their current roster that were part of Super Bowl LI nine years ago. Guard Joe Thuney was on the Patriots and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett was on the Falcons. Back in 2017, the Patriots flipped a 28-3 deficit into a 34-28 overtime victory. Both players were asked to share their experiences from the game and Johnson believes the team found value in their stories.\"It was just great to get perspective from both of those players of how that game went down. I think it's just a good lesson to be learned that its 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game is still being played and there's a lot of time left,\" Johnson said on Saturday.\n\"That was my message to the group,\" Johnson continued. \"Was just reminding them that this has been done before. And rather than saying 'woe is me' and 'oh, crap, we're in a hole,' it's more of an opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we'll never forget. And that's what they did.\"The message clearly worked, because Chicago outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to win their first playoff game in 15 years.The comebacks by the Patriots and Bears do have one thing in common: Matt LaFleur was on the losing sideline in both games. LaFleur was a quarterbacks coach for the 2025 Falcons, and he, of course, is the current Packers coach. LaFleur is now part of the largest blown lead in Falcons history and the largest blown lead in Packers postseason history.\nThe 2026 season is set to be the final year of LaFleur's current deal and the team will benefit by making a decision on his future sooner than later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl-winning head coach John Harbaugh wants to keep coaching. There is little doubt that he will keep coaching in 2026. And this week will provide more clarity for Harbaugh and interested teams about just where that will be next season.Harbaugh will soon put together his interview schedule for this week, sources tell CBS Sports. Sources from multiple teams say they are proceeding with their own searches but are waiting to hear from Harbaugh so that they can work around his schedule.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh set to interview with teams next week: Ranking three best fits for ex-Ravens head coach\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are eight head-coach vacancies across the league, including the Baltimore Ravens that fired Harbaugh last week after nearly two decades at the helm. And there could be more.Two sources on interested teams said their belief is Harbaugh's top choices among the vacant jobs are the New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons in some order. Those sources added the Tennessee Titans are in third place, while a third, different source said there is real and mutual interest between Harbaugh and the Cleveland Browns.\nReports of Harbaugh's demands are inaccurate, according to a source with knowledge. Harbaugh will command a high salary based simply off his resume, and some level of roster say is inherent in attracting a coach of that caliber. But a demand of $20 million in salary and full roster control are not required to land Harbaugh's services.Other teams will do what they can to work their way into the Harbaugh mix. And, of course, the biggest question is if other jobs will become available.Matt LaFleur's future in Green Bay is center stage in the NFL. He is 76-40-1 all-time in Green Bay, and he's been to the playoffs in six out of his seven seasons there. But he's been the seventh seed each of the past three years with just one victory, and he's coming off a brutal loss to the rival Chicago Bears on Saturday where his team blew a 21-3 halftime lead.\nNext season is the last on LaFleur's contract, and new Packers CEO Ed Policy has said he doesn't wish for someone to coach in a lameduck year. So the Packers will seemingly either extend LaFleur or part ways with him, via a firing or a trade.In theory, time is ticking on Green Bay's decision. With a fourth of the league's head-coaching jobs available and everyone else already in the interview process, the Packers wouldn't want to get started too late if they had to do a coaching search this cycle. And trading LaFleur would present other challenges that are also based on timing.\n        \n            \n                Green Bay has big questions to answer after all-in season ends with its largest blown lead in playoff history\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTo trade LaFleur would mean the Packers would have to trade the rights to his contract to another team for what would surely be a first- or second-round draft pick. And since he's entering the final year of his contract, an extension with the new team would have to be in place. LaFleur, who is not able to speak with other teams, would have to evaluate that team himself. Such a maneuver could not take place in mere days following the playoff collapse.\n\"Firing him instead of trading him would be asinine,\" one NFC executive said Sunday. \"I just don't really know who you're hiring that's better if you're Green Bay. But certainly shouldn't pay him to work for someone else next year.\"If the Packers and LaFleur part ways, both would be at or near the top of their respective rankings. In Green Bay, the organization presents as one of the most successful and stable franchises in all of sports with a bona fide quarterback and pieces that make them a perennial playoff contender. LaFleur, 46, would be a hot coaching candidate with his success in Green Bay and ability to call offensive plays as the head coach.Currently, multiple sources surveyed across the league have the Ravens, Giants and Falcons as the top three jobs in some order.\nThe NFL has aimed to slow down the hiring process in recent years, and that has worked with general success. Coaches on playoff teams still must balance preparing for their postseason opponent and interviewing for a life-changing opportunity, but teams have been hiring later in January (and February) than even four or more years ago.There is no team of the eight with vacancies that can hire a head coach right now based off NFL rules, which mostly center on in-person interviews with diverse coaches.As part of the Rooney Rule, the NFL requires teams to interview at least two external candidates who come from diverse backgrounds. Instituted in 2002, the Rooney Rule has been tweaked and expanded in recent years as a way to help qualified minority candidates get the opportunities they deserve.\nIn-person interviews with coaches currently employed by other teams cannot begin until Jan. 19, just after the divisional round of the playoffs. Recent history suggests the hires will begin in earnest that week. But a team can strike sooner than that.Last year the Patriots hired Mike Vrabel on Jan. 12. New England finished their season on Jan. 4, fired Jerod Mayo within hours of the season ending, and then quickly rushed through two interviews with external minority candidates who were not in the league then -- and still are not today -- in order to clear the way to hire Vrabel. Though they landed one of the top candidates on the market who has led them to a big turnaround in Year One, the Patriots were heavily criticized publicly and privately for how they handled the search.In order for a team to hire Harbaugh, or any other coach, or potentially trade for a coach like LaFleur, they would have to have conducted at least those two in-person interviews. That has not yet happened with any club yet.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As is often the case in January, weather may play a significant role in what happens during Sunday night's AFC wild-card showdown between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers in the first weekend of the NFL playoffs. While the temperature is slated to be at or slightly above freezing, strong gusts of wind are expected throughout Sunday night, which will be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The wind is expected to pick up significantly just about an hour before the 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff. Both teams could face winds ranging between 20-23 mph throughout the game. Obviously, strong gusts of wind could make kicking and throwing the ball a much tougher assignment. From a kicking standpoint, Sunday night's weather may benefit the Chargers, who have one of the NFL's best field goal kickers in Cameron Dicker. Dicker, whoever, is used to kicking under a roof in mild weather Southern California, so it'll be interesting to see how he does tonight if he is asked to kick against a strong wind. In terms of the offenses, it appears that the Patriots are more prepared to handle such conditions. New England was sixth in the league in rushing during the regular season and was fourth in touchdown runs. The Patriots' rushing attack has been led by the duo of rookie TreVeyon Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson, who rushed for a combined 1,514 yards and 16 touchdowns during the regular season. \nThe Chargers also aspire to run the ball, but injuries at the running back position have prevented Jim Harbaugh's team from being a dominant running team. The team lost Najee Harris to a season-ending injury back in Week 3 and was without rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton for half the season after he too sustained an injury. Hampton (ankle) has been labeled as questionable for Sunday night's game. If Hampton can't go, Los Angeles will once again have to rely on Kimani Vidal, who rushed for a team-high 643 yards during the regular season. The Chargers have also received solid contributions on the ground from quarterback Justin Herbert, whose 498 yards on the ground this year were a career high. Depending on how the wind is blowing, the winner of tonight's kickoff could play a key role in the outcome. If there is a strong wind blowing in one direction, the team that wins the opening kick may elect to kick with the wind at the back, similar to how the Giants famously took advantage of the strong winds during their NFC title game win over Washington 39 years ago. \nIronically, the Giants' defensive coordinator that night was Bill Belichick, who was the Patriots' coach the last time New England won a playoff game. The Patriots are looking to snap their seven-year drought without a playoff win on Sunday night. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While there are plenty of on-field/on-court/on-ice moments carrying us through this particular weekend, Major League Baseball finally saw a big splash as well: the Cubs have agreed with three-time All-Star third baseman Alex Bregman on a five-year, $175 million deal.Let's examine the fallout.The Cubs fitEven in losing free-agent right fielder Kyle Tucker to free agency, there was an argument that the Cubs were perfectly fine running it back with their position players. Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya can split catching duties. Michael Busch, Nico Hoerner, Dansby Swanson and Matt Shaw filled out the infield. Ian Happ, Pete Crow-Armstrong and Seiya Suzuki are set in the outfield and Moisés Ballesteros seems ready to take on everyday DH work. Still, I recently noted that the offense could sure use at least one upgrade to help take the Cubs to the proverbial next level.Bregman replacing Shaw in the lineup, at least in theory and on paper, makes that happen.\nYes, Shaw was a better hitter in the second half, but .258/.317/.522 in a 63-game sample isn't enough to take a player like Bregman off the table. Further, Shaw hit .222/.313/.375 in the last month of the season and .118/.318/.118 in the playoffs. Even if you believe in Shaw down the line, Bregman is an upgrade in the short term for a playoff team.Cubs trade bait?First things first, let's be clear: The Cubs don't have to trade anyone. If they decide they want to strengthen the organization elsewhere by dealing from the infield crowd, though, it's possible. There have been rumors for weeks that Hoerner could be moved. Personally, I think that would be an outrageously stupid move, given that I believe he's one of the best \"glue guys\" in baseball. But, sure, we'll humor the rumor mill and point out that the Cubs could move him in his last year before free agency and put Shaw at second.\nMore likely is Shaw being dealt. There's plenty of potential: he posted 3.1 WAR as a rookie at age 24 and he can play both second and third -- and even shortstop, in a bind. If the Cubs truly believed he was ready for a star turn, they wouldn't have signed Bregman to a five-year deal. Then again, Hoerner is only one year away from free agency, so keeping Shaw around provides a backup plan for 2027.As noted, the Cubs don't have to make a trade. If they do, either Hoerner or Shaw could go. No Marte? For much of the offseason, Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte has been rumored to be on the trading block. Instead, the D-backs have decided to hold onto their All-Star infielder. \nThis might seem odd to mention here but these are all pieces of the glorious tapestry that is the MLB offseason right now. Plenty of contending teams could use an infield upgrade and with Bregman and, seemingly, Marte off the table, other pieces now become more in demand. Speaking of which ...Bichette front and centerBo Bichette is coming off a season in which he hit .311 with a 129 OPS+ and was a beast in the World Series. He's a shortstop, but can also handle second base and, conceivably, could play third if a team asked him to. With Bregman off the board and Marte no longer a viable trade candidate, Bichette is the top infield option and it's not particularly close. There's already a lot of smoke with the Red Sox and Bichette and we'll hear more about a handful more suitors in the coming days. Donovan could followIt's always domino effect with these things, right? Let's suppose that Marte is really off the market and the Cubs are going to hold onto Hoerner. Even if Shaw is available, Cardinals All-Star utility man Brendan Donovan is better, meaning he's in line behind Bichette for contenders seeking an infield upgrade. \nDonovan, who turns 29 in a few days, is under team control through 2027. He hit .287/.353/.422 (119 OPS+) with 2.7 WAR last season. He recently agreed to a $5.8 million contract for 2026 ahead of the arbitration deadline.The hunch here is the Donovan rumor mill won't really start churning until Bichette signs, but with Bregman and Marte off the market, that could be soon.It's all related. And it's all pretty fun right now here in the middle of January for all things MLB rumors.\n            ",

The South Bend Tribune published a story Sunday detailing a police report from New Prairie High School's wrestling coach stemming from an incident that occurred on Jan. 3, at Mishawaka High School.New Prairie high school wrestling assistant coach, Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of assault in a police report after both were in attendance at the Al Smith Wrestling Invitational. Notre Dame released a statement Sunday saying Freeman had no physical contact with Fleeger.Mishawaka police investigated the accusation and reportedly submitted their report to the prosecutor's office. It is unknown if charges have been filed from the incident.\"Vinny Freeman, head coach Marcus Freeman's son, was verbally accosted during and after his wrestling match by a local wrestling coach,\" the statement reads. \"Marcus and Joanna Freeman intervened and removed Vinny from the station. At no point did coach Freeman physically engage with anyone. We believe the police report, which includes video evidence, fully exonerates coach Freeman and makes clear these accusations are totally unfounded.\"\nThe altercation between Freeman and Fleeger allegedly happened after Vinny Freeman lost a match. The South Bend Tribune reports that police did not reveal the extent of the alleged contact between Freeman and Fleeger, who exchanged words in a hallway.This report comes on the heels of Freeman vowing to \"run it back\" with Notre Dame in late December amid interest from various NFL franchises. Notre Dame's fifth-year coach agreed to a restructured contract that puts him in the \"top tier\" of compensation among college coaches after turning down interest from two NFL franchises, according to Sports Illustrated reports. \nFreeman signed a lucrative extension ahead of last season's playoff appearance.\n            \n    ",

While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss, while the Houston Texans franchise has never won a road playoff game. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

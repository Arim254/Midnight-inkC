Matt McMahon is probably out at LSU, and I have to wonder if the players are focused on the rest of the season or the transfer portal. The Tigers are just 2-9 in SEC play and coming off back-to-back home losses to Georgia and Arkansas by a combined 41 points. LSU could also be without leading scorer Dedan Thomas for the fourth straight game. I wish the Vols shot free throws a little better, but dominating the offensive glass and getting easy baskets off turnovers should be enough to cover.\" Back Tennessee to cover at DraftKings here:Over 157.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-105)\"Texas Tech has played seven games against power conference opponents that finished with 70 or more possessions. The totals in those games, all decided in regulation, were 155, 162, 182, 163, 140, 167 and 158,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"The thought here is that when the Red Raiders get sped up the totals creep up as well, and Arizona is the most up-tempo team in Big 12 play. Arizona's interior defense is really going to force Texas Tech to connect from outside, but the Red Raiders are currently leading the Big 12 with 41.2% three-point shooting in conference play. With Arizona looking to bounce back from the Kansas loss and Texas Tech desperate to improve its 3-3 road record, count on 70-plus possessions and a higher-scoring affair in Tucson.\" Back the Over at DraftKings here:Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)The Over has hit in six straight UConn games, with all six totals set at 136.5 points or greater, including five games set at more than 142 points. The Huskies cleared the Over by at least five points in five of those six games, in large part due to their own offensive domination. UConn has scored at least 85 points in three of its last five games. Meanwhile, Georgetown went Over in its last game, an 80-73 loss to Villanova on Feb. 7. Georgetown has the 128th-ranked scoring defense in the nation, allowing 73 points per game this season. The model projects the Over to hit in 78% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The NASCAR season officially gets revved up on Sunday, Feb. 15, when the checkered flag drops on the 2026 Daytona 500. The race is scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on FOX. This NASCAR betting guide provides information for new and veteran sports bettors alike, including where to wager on the 2026 Daytona 500 and popular betting markets for the NASCAR Cup Series season opener.Where to bet on the 2026 Daytona 500Here are some available sportsbook promos new users can receive when signing up for a sportsbook and wagering on the 2026 Daytona 500.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst bet matched up to $250 in bonus bets, win or lose CBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets back if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanatics10 x $100 Bet Match in FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets instantlyCBSBET365Betting on NASCAR and the 2026 Daytona 500Like most sports, there are hundreds of options across the major sportsbooks that bettors can choose from when wagering on NASCAR. The Daytona 500 odds available at sportsbooks include which driver will win the race, as well as the race team and manufacturer the winning driver represents. Many sportsbooks offer head-to-head matchups between Daytona 500 favorites, as well as groups of drivers where you can pick who finishes highest among them. You can also pick a driver to finish in the top three, top five, top 10 and even top 20 at some books, lowering your payout but giving you a better chance to cash in. The sportsbooks also have NASCAR futures, including Cup Series odds on series champion and over/unders on driver victories for the season.Bet on the 2026 Daytona 500 at BetMGM here:Race winnerThe major sportsbooks are in agreement that Ryan Blaney, Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin and pole-sitter Kyle Busch are the favorites, with Logano and Blaney at least co-favorites at most of them. That quartet shares co-favorite status at +1200 at bet365 and Caesars, but Logano is the +1000 top choice at FanDuel while Hamlin is +900 favorite at DraftKings, followed by the other three at +1000. Blaney and Logano are co-favorites at both Fanatics (+1000) and BetMGM (+1200). Austin Cindric, who won at Daytona in 2022, isn't far behind the favorites, priced at +1400 or +1600 at most sportsbooks. But if you are keen on the former Cup Series Rookie of the Year, you can get odds of +2000 on him to win at DraftKings. Kyle Larson, the 2025 Cup Series champion, ranges anywhere from +1400 (Caesars) to +2000 (FanDuel).The sportsbooks see William Byron, the 2025 regular-season champ and the two-time defending Daytona 500 champ, having a solid chance to win his third in a row to open the NASCAR season. He is +1400 at DraftKings and BetMGM and bet365 and Caesars (+1800). Byron finished second at last week's Clash at Bowman Gray, and the winner of that preseason race, Ryan Preece, is anywhere from +2200 (Caesars) to +3250 (Fanatics). Other drivers expected to be in the mix for the victory include Chase Elliott -- he is anywhere from +1300 at Fanatics to +1600 at DraftKings -- and Brad Keselowski (+1600 at at Caesars, +2200 at bet365).Bet on the winner of the Daytona 500 at Fanatics now:More Daytona 500 oddsYou can make Daytona 500 predictions and picks on any number of outcomes from Sunday's race. You can bet on a driver to finish anywhere from first to within the top 20, and there are bets available on most laps led, team and manufacturer results. There are even over/unders on the winning car number, how many cars will finish on the lead lap and most laps led by any single driver.BetMGM sets the over/under on the winning car number at 19.5, with both sides priced at -115. Caesars sets four ranges for the winning car number -- 0-8 (+275), 9-18 (+260), 19-28 (+300) and 29+ (+165). The sportsbook also has three over/under options, with 19.5 set at the same odds as BetMGM, while it also has 12.5 (Over -225, Under +175) and 22.5 (Over +175, Under -225). At BetMGM and Fanatics, you can get +100 if the winning car sports an odd number in an even/odd wager, with even priced at -115 at BetMGM and -135 at Fanatics. Caesars has tons of prop bets, including +185 odds on whether a past Daytona 500 winner will be first to the checkered flag and -200 odds on the race to go to overtime. It also has over/unders on the number of drivers to lead a lap (18.5), and over/under on lead changes (46.5), among many other options. Bet on your favorite Daytona 500 props at Caesars Sportsbook here:Race finishes Most of these odds are similar to the Daytona 500 race winner odds, though the payout is decreased because of the lower difficulty. If you think a driver can win but aren't quite sure, you can pick them for a high finish and have a better chance at a payout. At bet365, the four favorites are also the top four choices to finish in the top three, with all four priced at +1200 to win and +400 for a top-three finish. At Caesars, Blaney, Busch, Hamlin and Logano are all +1200 to win, but Blaney, Logano and Chase Elliott are favored to finish among the top three at +330. Busch is +500 and Hamlin +600.     Elliott also is among the favorites to finish in the top five at FanDuel, joining Logano as the +160 top choice, just ahead of Blaney (+170). But at BetMGM, Elliott is +225 for a top-five finish, well behind favorites Blaney and Logano (+130). For top-10 wagers -- and top 20 at sportsbooks that offer them --- you'll be paying a lot of juice. The quartet of favorites at bet365 are -145 to finish in the top 10, while DraftKings has Hamlin as the -200 favorite. BetMGM has Blaney and Logano priced at -190. FanDuel has odds on various combinations, with many of the top drivers paired up in double chance bets where you win if either takes the checkered flag. Blaney OR Logano to win is the +550 top choice, followed by Logano/Cindric at +600. There are also triple chance options, and Blaney/Logano/Larson and Logano/Hamlin/Cindric are the +420 favorites in those odds. On other either/or bets at FanDuel, you can wager on whether one of two specified drivers places within certain finish parameters. For example, it sets a +140 payout if Hamlin OR Cindric finishes in the top five. There are also numerous combo bet options at bet365.   Bet on where your favorite drivers will finish in the 2026 Daytona 500 at FanDuel here:Team/manufacturer resultsTeam Penske is the favorite to be the winning race team at most sportsbooks, priced at +350 at Fanatics and Caesars and +370 at FanDuel and DraftKings. Hendrick Motorsports is right behind at +375 at both bet365 and Caesars, +380 at DraftKings and +410 at FanDuel. Joe Gibbs Racing is +400 at Draftkings and +500 at FanDuel and Caesars.   The Hendrick stable includes Byron, Larson, Elliott and Alex Bowman, while Penske boasts Blaney, Cindric and Logano. Gibbs has Hamlin, Briscoe, Christopher Bell and Ty Gibbs, but a team like RFK Racing (+750 at FanDuel) with a roster including Chris Buescher, Keselowski and Preece, might be enticing. Busch is part of the two-car Richard Childress team, along with Austin Dillon, and RCR is +800 at DraftKings and +900 at Caesars. But unless you like Dillon's chances to win -- he's +5000 at many sportsbooks and +3000 at DraftKings -- you should be able to get better odds on Busch to win. Chevrolet is favored to win as the manufacturer at most books, though Caesars has Ford with a slight edge at +130, ahead of Chevy at +140. The difference is much greater at FanDuel, which has Chevrolet +125 and Ford +170, and DraftKings, which prices them at +115 and +190, respectively. Toyota is third across the board, with a high payout of +325 (Caesars) and a low of +230 (FanDuel)  Among the Chevrolet drivers are Byron, Larson, Busch and Elliott, while Blaney, Logano and Cindric are among those piloting Fords. Hamlin drives a Toyota, and he is the clear favorite to be the top finisher for that manufacturer, priced at +215 at DraftKings, with Christopher Bell next at +500. Busch is the +380 top choice among Chevy drivers, followed by Byron (+550), Larson (+650) and Elliott (+650), and the Ford favorites at DratftKings are Blaney and Logano, both +300.Bet on the top teams and manufacturers in the 2026 Daytona 500 at DraftKings Sportsbook here:Head-to-head/group wagersOne of the most fun ways to make Daytona 500 picks is to choose a head-to-head matchup or group wager. You can pick a driver you think is much better than the ones he is grouped with, or pick your favorite driver against one you might not be so fond of in a head-to-head. The head-to-head matchups are often close to even odds, like with Larson and Hamlin both listed at -110 in their head-to-head at BetMGM. But some matchups can offer a plus-money payout, like in the case of Hamlin vs. Larson at DraftKings. Hamlin is priced at -140 to finish higher in the matchup, with Larson bringing a +105 payout if he does. Some books, like bet365, offer more head-to-head matchups and more that can pay plus-money.Most of the sportsbooks also offer groups of four drivers, with the bet cashing if you pick the driver with the best finish. At FanDuel, one group includes Blaney (+210), Logano (+200), Larson (+350) and Byron (+290), while another consists of Alex Bowman (+185), Connor Zilisch (+230), Daniel Suarez (+270) and AJ Allmendinger (+390). BetMGM has some evenly-matched groups, with one including Chase Briscoe (+270), Chris Buescher (+270), Carson Hocevar (+280) and Ryan Preece (+280) and another with Ty Gibbs, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Daniel Suarez and Michael McDowell where all four are priced at +275.Make head-to-head and group wagers on the 2026 Daytona 500 at BetMGM here:NASCAR and 2026 Daytona 500 betting strategiesBetting on a driver to win might seem like the best option when you think of wagering on auto racing, and while it is profitable if you cash the bet, that's not easy to do. There were 14 different winners over the 36 races in last season's Cup Series, though several drivers managed to win multiple races. Hamlin led the way with six, followed by Rookie of the Year Shane van Gisbergen, who earned five (all on road courses). Christopher Bell and Ryan Blaney each had four victories and Chase Briscoe, William Byron and Kyle Larson had three. Using some combination of your favorites in a double/triple-chance wager could be the good way to go. The payout is lower, but much like in golf, hitting an outright winner isn't as easy as it might seem.The safest bets that can still earn a decent payout are on the high finishers. Larson, Briscoe and Blaney all had a series-high 15 top-five finishes in 2025, and Larson and Christopher Bell led with 22 races where they placed in the top 10. Drivers who showed consistency while coming up short of a victory were Alex Bowman and Chris Buescher, who both failed to win but had 16 top-10 finishes. And while Blaney won four times, he had eight DNFs in his Ford. Failing to finish is a real possibility for anyone at the Daytona 500, where at least one big crash is expected, often as drivers battle on the later laps. That has opened the door for some surprise winners in the past, with Dillon leading just one lap in overtime when he won in 2018 and Michael McDowell doing the same after a crash in 2021. The volatility of super-speedway racing, especially at the end of races, make this a good time to look for value in long shots.      Weather also could come into play at Daytona, and rain is not unusual on Florida's east coast this time of year. An area of low pressure is making its way south and could arrive Sunday near the time the checkered flag is scheduled to drop. The most likely scenario seems to be scattered showers late in the afternoon and evening. Last season's Daytona 500 saw two delays that totaled more than three hours and 30 minutes, and the 2020 and 2022 races were pushed to Monday. Drivers like Larson, Chastain and Byron charge hard early in races, and Logano is known to be strong on restarts, and both can be critical skills in a race that could see several cautions or even be shortened. Four Daytona 500s, including the 2003 and 2009 editions, have been called after the halfway point because of rain.If you have access to multiple sportsbooks, make sure to check around to get the best odds. As noted above, some drivers are priced much differently depending on the book, so if there's one you like, shop around. For instance, Hamlin is the +900 favorite to win at DraftKings but can be had for +1500 at Fanatics and FanDuel, and you can get +1600 at BetMGM on Busch,  who is a co-favorite at some books.There are also odds boosts available frequently, where you can get a larger payout than the odds suggest. At bet365, a BetBoost on Joey Logano gives you +1400 odds, as opposed to the +1200 he is listed at. On a $10 bet, that means instead of a $120 profit, you can walk away with $140. Parlays also are available, with DraftKings among those offering pre-set same-race plays, and most books let you build your own.      Place your Daytona 500 bets at Caesars Sportsbook here:Responsible gamingAll bettors should practice responsible gaming and use the tools at their disposal, like setting betting activity alerts and taking timeouts. DraftKings and BetMGM offer live chat features on their platforms for users to get in touch with support 24/7, and all sportsbooks have contact information for helplines like 1-800-GAMBLER for those who need additional assistance.FAQCan you bet on the Daytona 500?Yes, you can bet on the Daytona 500 at all the major sportsbooks, with odds available on the winning driver, race team or manufacturer and many other NASCAR props on drivers and teams. There also are options for stage winners, top-5 and top-10 finishes, fastest lap, head-to-head matchups and who will win among a specified group of drivers, among many other wagers. Which sportsbooks offer betting on the Daytona 500?All major sportsbooks like bet365, BetMGM, Caesars, DraftKings, Fanatics and FanDuel offer betting on NASCAR and the Daytona 500.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The San Diego Padres have agreed to terms with veteran slugger Nick Castellanos on a contract for the 2026 season, the New York Post reports. Castellanos was recently released by the Phillies after they tried and failed to trade him this offseason. He's owed $20 million for the upcoming season, which marks the final year of the five-year, $100 million contract he signed with the Phillies prior to the 2022 season. Philadelphia will be on the hook for the vast majority of that remaining commitment, and the Padres, in turn, will owe Castellanos just the MLB minimum salary of $780,000 for 2026 because he previously cleared waivers.Castellanos is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he continued a recent pattern of decline at the plate. In 147 games for the Phillies, he slashed .250/.294/.400 (88 OPS+) with 17 home runs and 27 doubles, and he also, at times, clashed with manager Rob Thomson. Over the last three seasons, he's seen his OPS+ fall from 112 in 2023 to 104 in 2024 to last year's low-water mark of 88. For his career, Castellanos, a two-time All-Star, has 250 home runs and a WAR of 13.2 across parts of 13 big-league seasons. He'll turn 34 in early March. Defensively, Castellanos is a pronounced liability in right field, which has been his primary position for much of the last decade. With the Padres, he's expected to see limited time in the outfield while also slotting in at DH and working to adapt to first base. The bigger concern is Castellanos' declining bat. As a right-handed hitter, he still figures to be useful in platoon-advantaged situations, but absent some kind of unexpected rebound, he's likely not an everyday player at this stage of his career.\nThe Padres are coming off a 2025 season in which they won 90 games and made the playoffs for the second straight year. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        LeBron James will miss out on making an All-NBA team for the first time since his rookie year, snapping a streak of 21 straight seasons with the Lakers superstar on an All-NBA team. James will miss his 18th game of the season on Tuesday night against the Spurs, as the 41-year-old will not play in a back-to-back due to left foot arthritis. That 18th absence for James, who didn't make his season debut until Nov. 18, means he cannot reach the NBA's 65-game minimum for awards and All-NBA voting consideration. While it would've been questionable whether James would make it this year on merit based on his current production -- 21.8 points, 6.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game -- his regular absences in his 23rd season will prevent even a strong second half of the season from getting him into the conversation. His 21-year All-NBA streak seems like it'll stand the test of time for a variety of reasons. For one, it's rare to have a player reach All-NBA status as quickly as James did in his career, making his first All-NBA team as a second-year player. It's even more rare for a player to remain at that level deep into their 30s, much less as a 40-year-old as James did last year. \n\n        \n            \n                LeBron James offers blunt assessment of Lakers after loss to Thunder: 'That's a championship team, we're not'\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe closest streak to James all-time is Kobe Bryant with 15 straight All-NBA nods, offering a good representation of how incredible LeBron's run has been. No one has ever sniffed the 20-year mark in NBA history, and it'll only get more difficult going forward. Beyond the requirement of consistent greatness for more than two decades, the same 65-game threshold that officially ended any hopes James had at a 22nd All-NBA selection makes it even more difficult for stars to maintain streaks of their own. Giannis Antetokounmpo has the longest active streak with nine straight selections, but he will also miss out this season due to too many games missed. Nikola Jokić is next with seven straight All-NBA appearances, but is also perilously close to being ineligible for voting this year after missing 16 games already this season. \nLongest All-NBA streaksPlayerSeasonsDatesLeBron James212005-2025Kobe Bryant151999-2013Karl Malone141988-2001Tim Duncan131998-2010Shaquille O'Neal131994-2006Between the rules governing eligibility and the amount of talent across the league, it's difficult to see anyone coming close to matching James' mark. Records, as they say, are meant to be broken, but it would take a truly unbelievable career for anyone to top James' All-NBA streak. That officially comes to an end and is the latest reminder that the end of the James era is nearly upon us. \n            \n    ",

It was the flagship event of the night, as the league's top players showcased their athletic feats with jaw-dropping dunks. Players who weren't competing often filled the sidelines, and fans were always enthralled by the nightcap.However, over the last 10 years, the dunk contest has lost its cachet, while the 3-Point Shootout has gotten all the hype. The 3-Point Shootout has delivered in ways the dunk contest hasn't in recent years, with nail-biting finishes as everyone watches in awe as the league's elite shooters show off their skills. While we don't get the top dunkers for All-Star Saturday night in Los Angeles, the top shooters are regularly lining up to compete in the 3-point competition, giving us a star-studded event every year.\n        \n            \n                NBA Rising Stars winners and losers: VJ Edgecombe wins MVP, Cooper Flagg misses showcase with injury\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the dunk contest doesn't have high-level names, we've still seen some impressive dunks in the last two years thanks to two-time champion Mac McClung, who has decided not to defend his title this weekend. As we prepare for the night's festivities, here's everything you need to know.Bet NBA All-Star Saturday at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nHow to watch All-Star Saturday nightTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Saturday, Feb. 14Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockThe 3-Point Shootout will be the first event of the night.

But fast forward nine matches and Matarazzo's team haven't lost a single match under his leadership. Mattarazo spent over a year out of a job after being let go by Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga, but he's in the midst of one of his best spells as a manager while getting acclimated to LaLiga. While with Hoffenheim, Mattarazo was reportedly linked to the United States men's national team job before Mauricio Pochettino was hired, but opted to stay at the club. And with how things are going currently, both for the USMNT and Sociedad, that may be for the best. Below is a chart of Sociedad's Expected Goals trends for the last 29 matches, and it's clear where Mattarazo took over.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Looking at the improvements around match 20 on the chart, he has this team performing to the top of their abilities without making major changes to personnel. New manager bounces are one thing, but Real Sociedad have already beaten Barcelona and drawn Atletico Madrid under Matarazzo and are now 90 minutes from making an appearance in the Copa Del Rey final. He's already made history as the first American manager in LaLiga, and while it's a short list of American managers to take the reins in a top five league, if he can keep this up, Matarazzo can become the first American manager to manage in European competition since Jesse Marsch and David Wagner did it during the 2021-22 season with Red Bull Leipzig and Young Boys respectively.After selling stars like Alexander Isak, Mikel Merino, and Martin Zubimendi to the Premier League, Sociedad needed a rebuild, and Matarazzo has been the right guy for the job so far, helping put their academy players into the best position to succeed while getting the most out of additions like Goncalo Guedes.\nFor their next task, Sociedad will need to push their press to the next level in order to get past yet another new manager in Alvaro Arbeola's Real Madrid. Even with that seven-match winning streak in LaLiga, Real Madrid have been vulnerable, relying on Kylian Mbappe's unstoppable form in attack to get them through matches. But with the Frenchman missing two consecutive training sessions due to a knee injury, he could be a game-time decision, raising Sociedad's chances of winning the match.Mbappe has 23 LaLiga goals and 38 goals in all competitions this season, and while you always want to beat a team when they're at their best, no one wants to attempt to defend against Mbappe when he's in this form. Real Sociedad's press will give them a chance to keep this close, but even if this is where Matarazzo's run comes to an end, the effects of his management are already being seen.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Real Sociedad have risen to eighth place in LaLiga, only three points out of a Europa Conference League place, and there's no reason why they can't dream of overtaking Real Betis for a Europa Leauge spot. Things that felt improbable could be in reach if what Matarazzo has built can continue to be something sustainable in the long haul.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin is shaping up to be the sort of team that a No. 1 or No. 2 seed would dread seeing in their pod when the 2026 NCAA Tournament bracket is revealed next month. The Badgers' 92-71 win over Michigan State on Friday night only added to their growing reputation as dragon slayers in the Big Ten.The loss dropped the Spartans from a No. 3 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model to a No. 4 seed. Wisconsin is now the best-ranked No. 8 seed in the field and is well-positioned to rise once the full rundown of results from Saturday and Sunday are factored into the model.Coming just three days after an upset win at Illinois, the 21-point drubbing of the Spartans was another indicator of how potent Wisconsin can be offensively. A program that used to play slow and with an interior focus now plays with tempo a quick 3-point trigger. Friday night marked the fifth time the Badgers have hit 15 or more 3-pointers in a game this season. The guard duo of Nick Boyd and John Blackwell is performing as one of the best in all of college basketball. They combined for 53 points against Michigan State, and both rank among the top-10 scorers in the Big Ten. Again, that's a team no well-seeded team would want fo face in the second round.\nHeading into a big Saturday of action, here's the breakdown of where things stand along the top lines in CBS Sports Bracketology.

By contrast, this team is 3-5 when making fewer than 10 shots from beyond the arc. Living and dying by the 3-pointer is a notoriously risky way to live, but it has proven effective as of late in resurrecting the Badgers from a shaky start to their 2025-26 season.Wisconsin's at-large prospects looked murky after a 7-4 start that included losses to TCU, Nebraska and Villanova. At the time, though, it was unclear just how good those teams truly were. Nebraska and Villanova and are projected to make the field as at-large teams. TCU is a bubble team that has shown the ability to slay giants. The Badgers are 9-7 in Quads 1 and 2 and unbeaten in Quads 3 and 4. Following its win over the Spartans, Wisconsin is up to No. 25 in Wins Above Bubble (WAB), which is a critical resume metric used by the selection committee. The Badgers are also on the rise in predictive analytics.\nWAB measures how many wins a team has on the season vs. how many wins an average bubble team would have vs. the same schedule.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Texas A&M hanging onto spot in field of 68; TCU vs. Oklahoma State has high stakes\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMichigan State stallingMichigan State has lost three of its last four games since starting 19-2. Now 20-5 (10-4 Big Ten), the Spartans have stalled out a bit. That's not entirely uncommon for this program. A year ago, Michigan State started 18-2, but then dropped three of its first four games in February against mid-tier Big Ten opposition.From there, the Spartans won seven straight to close the regular season and beat six NCAA Tournament teams in the process. The ride didn't end until the Elite Eight. You can never count out a team coached by Tom Izzo, and these Spartans will have ample opportunity to get back onto the No. 3 seed line. If they close the regular season like they did last season, a No. 2 seed could still be on the table as well.\n            ",

Team T-Mac has the experience edge over Vince Carter's squad in that the former has the most sophomores, with five second-year players compared to Team Vince having just three. Meanwhile, Melo's team has the reigning Rookie of the Year in Stephon Castle, plus the size edge in 7-foot-2 center Donovan Clingan.\nTeam Vince lacks the caliber of those two squads and has just two players who were top-10 draft picks in V.J. Edgecombe and Egor Demin. Melo's team has four top-5 draft picks, while T-Mac has four top-6 draftees. There's a sheer talent gap between Vince Carter's squad with those two others, and even in an exhibition game like the Rising Stars Challenge, that gulf should be apparent on the scoreboard. See more predictions at SportsLine. How to make 2026 NBA Rising Stars picksBarner has studied the NBA Rising Stars game from every angle and found a critical X-factor that makes one of these teams a must-back on Friday night. See who it is over at SportsLine.Who wins the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, and which critical X-factor do you need to know about? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Barner's pick for the NBA Rising Stars Challenge 2026, all from the expert who has crushed his NBA picks, and find out.\n2026 NBA Rising Star odds, rostersSee picks at SportsLine.Team Melo (+140)Stephon Castle (San Antonio Spurs)Donovan Clingan (Portland Trail Blazers)Reed Sheppard (Houston Rockets)Ace Bailey (Utah Jazz)Dylan Harper (San Antonio Spurs)Jeremiah Fears (New Orleans Pelicans)Collin Murray-Boyles (Toronto Raptors)Team T-Mac (+175)Kon Knueppel (Charlotte Hornets)Kel'el Ware (Miami Heat)Tre Johnson (Washington Wizards)Jaylon Tyson (Cleveland Cavaliers)Zaccharie Risacher (Atlanta Hawks)Cam Spencer (Memphis Grizzlies)Bub Carrington (Washington Wizards)Team Vince (+320)VJ Edgecombe (Philadelphia 76ers)Derik Queen (New Orleans Pelicans)Matas Buzelis (Chicago Bulls)Kyshawn George (Washington Wizards)Cedric Coward (Memphis Grizzlies)Egor Demin (Brooklyn Nets)Jaylen Wells (Memphis Grizzlies)\nTeam Austin (+900)Jahmir Young (Sioux Falls Skyforce)Yang Hansen (Rip City Remix)Sean East II (Salt Lake City Stars)Ron Harper Jr. (Maine Celtics)Yanic Konan Niederhauser (San Diego Clippers)Alijah Martin (Raptors 905)Tristen Newton (Rio Grande Valley Vipers)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Forever Young will try to become the first horse to win the world's richest horse race twice when he leaves the starting gate in the 2026 Saudi Cup on Saturday at King Abdulaziz Racecourse in Riyadh. Last year, Forever Young outdueled Romantic Warrior in a stirring stretch drive to capture the $20 million race. Forever Young would end the year by winning the $7 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Del Mar, North America's richest horse race.The 5-year-old Japan bred has amassed more than $19.3 million in earnings in his career. With a victory on Saturday, he would move into second place in all-time career earnings, behind only Romantic Warrior ($31.8 million).For Saturday, Forever Young has been installed as the 4-5 morning-line favorite in the 2026 Saudi Cup odds at TwinSpires. Nysos (8-1), Nevada Beach (20-1) and Bishops Bay (30-1) round out the top four choices among the 14 Saudi Cup horses. Post time for the race is 12:40 p.m. ET.Sign up with TwinSpires and get a bonus up to $400:SportsLine racing insider Michelle Yu, who correctly picked Forever Young to win last year's Saudi Cup, is in Riyadh again this year to cover the race. She has identified her top picks for this year's running. \nHere is Yu's horse-by-horse analysis for the 2026 Saudi Cup, listed by program number:1 Banishing (50-1)The Charles Town Classic winner has been winless since August, and his best race since has been a sprint. He has twice attempted Grade 1 company and has been bested by double-digit lengths both times. This former claimer's claim to fame is a dead heat with Nysos in the Churchill Downs Stakes last May, but I would be surprised to see him turn in that sort of effort on Saturday.2 Bishops Bay (30-1)The Cigar Mile winner has been purchased by local connections to take a swing at this one-turn race, and that is a configuration we know this horse loves. He has a nice cruising speed, and past form says he should handle the added ground. Saturday will be a class test for him, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him take home a big check.\n3 Forever Young (4-5)The returning champ just doesn't run dud races. He is coming in without the benefit of a prep, which would normally be my one concern. But he obviously loves this course, and there will be pace to run at. While he might prefer a bit more ground, this track plays to a horse who can go longer. He gave us the race of the year last year when beating Romantic Warrior, and I think he does it again.4 Haqeet (50-1)This son of Arrogate is on a pattern for a good race after a loss last time out. He has been running farther, but that seems to be beneficial in the Saudi Cup. He has yet to face graded company, and this could be a shock to him.5 Luxor Cafe (50-1)This Japanese invader was well backed in the Kentucky Derby when he was a well beaten 12th to Sovereignty. His lone win after the Derby was a Group 3 so his form is nowhere near as good as the form he brought to Louisville. The decision to bring him to Saudi off the very disappointing effort in the Champions Cup in his last start is a bold move. Maybe that is a signal that he is on the upswing and has made good progression from age 3 to 4.\n6 Mhally (50-1)The local winner of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques prep, this gelding has been in fine form and brings in solid efforts at this track. He previously finished third in the Saudi Derby, which was far from embarrassing. He looked brave holding off the filly in the prep which was his first effort at nine furlongs. He could give the locals some hope, but I find him hard to put him on top given the headliners in this race.7 Nevada Beach (20-1)The Native Diver winner looked like he made the trip overseas well and was taking to the sandy surface in the mornings. Both of trainer Bob Baffert's runners got a little breeze here, which is a positive in my eyes. He was narrowly bested by Nysos in the Laffit Pincay in his last start when he got an A-plus ride. Forever Young had 11-plus lengths on him in the Breeders' Cup Classic, but this distance should suit him much better. Baffert is 0-fer in the Saudi Cup, and the more likely winner of his two runners is Nysos. Nevada Beach is a grinder though, and you can't discount Baffert anytime there is big money on the line. I do feel like horses that want more ground fare better on this strip, and that could play out with Nevada Beach. Based on his appearance this week, he seems to be thriving on this track.Bet on the Saudi Cup at 1/ST BET and get up to $500 in wagering credits:8 Nysos (8-1)This dazzling son of Nyquist has the right mentality for a $20 million score. He has been plagued by layoff lines but has never failed to return with the same prior form. His lone defeat was to the excellent Mindframe when coming off a 15-month layoff and racing in the slop, neither of which I will hold against him. He threw down against Citizen Bull to come away a Breeders' Cup champion in 2025 and returned to the races this year a winner. I love that Baffert got the racing recency into him for a peak effort in this spot. Can Nysos hold off Forever Young? I don't know, but I do think he's the most talented horse Baffert has brought to Saudi. On the flip side, Nysos is not covering the surface as well as his stablemate Nevada Beach. I wouldn't be surprised if he struggles a bit with the one-turn configuration.\n9 Rattle N Roll (50-1)Trainer Kenny McPeek is back with Rattle N Roll after a relatively disappointing run in last year's edition in which he was pretty fancied off a big win in the local prep. This year he prepped at Oaklawn Park in a less prestigious race and comes to Saudi fresh off the plane. I didn't love him last year, and I'll continue that sentiment this year.10 Star Of Wonder (50-1)An allowance type stateside, this son of Uncle Mo has found the company to his liking locally with back-to-back wins in his two Saudi Arabia appearances. I'm not sure if he will be able to traverse the 1,800 meters of this race -- he has seemed better at seven furlongs -- but configuration could be key. I don't think he has the closing kick of Forever Young or the tactical speed of Nysos.11 Sunrise Zipangu (50-1)Kyoko Maekawa is the first female trainer licensed in two countries and steps onto racing's biggest stage with a horse who gave her her first win as a trainer. However, Sunrise Zipangu has been winless since that initial score. Maekawa is confident in her charge though as she thinks turf horses have faired very well on this track. Still, he's not on the same level as the top contenders.\n12 Thundersquall (50-1)He earned a nice win in his last start here locally, but he'll be facing a different caliber of horse and already has been bested in the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. I don't see how he can improve that result.13 Tumbarumba (50-1)A decent fourth behind Nysos in the Breeders' Cup Mile was his last stateside appearance. He has had a pair of starts at Meydan in Dubai, neither of which was a victory. While he has been in the Middle East, he has not been training locally. He typical runs close to the pace, and that is his best chance to get a jump on the best horses in the world. I could see him nibbling a piece.14 Ameerat Alzamaan (50-1)This filly takes on the boys, but this is no Midnight Bisou.  A dominating Group 2 winner at the end of last year versus fillies, she took on the boys in the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques prep and finished a solid second in a field of 19.  Her conditioner said that she has shown improvement since.  Still, I can't imagine her coming out on top against horses like Forever Young and Nysos.\nPicks3-7-8-13Wagers$10 Win 3 ($10)Total: $10**Based on a $100 budget\n            ",

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game.Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday. That matchup is yet to be determined as the teams get re-seeded after the quarterfinals.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's quarterfinal clash with Italy, as well as how they got here.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

The other team will be coached by Anthony Anderson, Chris Brickley and Lethal Shooter. Among the biggest stars playing in the games are NFL receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown of the Detroit Lions and Keenan Allen of the Los Angeles Chargers. Former NBA players Jeremy Lin, Tacko Fall and Jason Williams will also play -- Lin and Fall are on the same team, which feels like it could be a significant advantage.Current NBA owners Mat Ishbia (Phoenix Suns) and Rick Schnall (Charlotte Hornets) will go head-to-head, with Ishbia, a former player at Michigan State, getting to relive the glory days.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am leaderboard is littered with the biggest names in golf, but after two rounds it's Akshay Bhatia who holds a share of the lead heading into the weekend. Bhatia has gone bogey-free around Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill over the first two days of play, following up a 65 at Pebble Beach on Thursday with an 8-under 64 at Spyglass Hill on Friday. Bhatia's iron play has led the way, as is often the case for those that succeed on the small greens at Pebble Beach. He's third in strokes gained on approach through the first two rounds. The young lefty's game has been sharp tee-to-green, and even when he's had the occasional miss, he's a perfect 6-for-6 getting up-and-down. That's the recipe for success at this event, and as the professionals lose their amateur partners for the weekend and get to focus solely on playing Pebble Beach, Bhatia will look to continue his incredible ball-striking performance. The light winds and soft greens on the California coast have created ideal scoring conditions, so even with a bogey-free performance so far, Bhatia has company at the top in the form of Ryo Hisatsune. The young Japanese star is continuing his stellar form early in the season, and while he did cool off a bit on Friday after his first-round 62 put him in another early lead, he was able to put together a solid 67 to remain in a share of the lead.\nLeading the charge from the chase group is Rickie Fowler, who matched Bhatia's 64 at Spyglass to get to 14 under heading into the weekend. Fowler is now in position to contend for his first victory since 2023, and is looking to continue a solid start to 2026. Fowler hasn't traditionally thrived at Pebble Beach, but he's been the best player in the field this week with his irons, gaining 4.8 strokes on approach so far. The 37-year-old highlighted that he feels better physically this year than he did in 2025 when he battled a shoulder injury, but was able to secure a top-50 position and a spot in all of the Signature Events this year. \"My shoulder was bad all last year so I was just trying to manage and get through as best that I could. I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top-50, so that was a nice bonus,\" Fowler said. \"So that was what I was trying to work towards to, like I said, earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.\" \nThat extended time off certainly seems to have paid off with a pair of top 20s to start the season and now a late tee time on the weekend at Pebble Beach. Fowler will need to keep up the strong iron play on Saturday and Sunday if he's going to contend for the win, but he's been lights out attacking soft greens thus far. The time to get the course was certainly the first two days, as the forecast calls for winds to pick up starting on Saturday afternoon and continue blowing 17-21 mph throughout Sunday's final round -- with some rain to add to the misery. For the leaders, that'll make it a challenge to hold up in rapidly changing conditions, but it will also make it harder for the chase pack to go low around them. The leadersT1. Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune (-15)Bhatia had a rocky start to 2026 with a pair of missed cuts, but he found something in Phoenix last week with a T3 and has carried that form into Pebble Beach. A two-time winner on the PGA Tour, we've seen that when Bhatia gets hot, he can go on a tear. Given the scoring to start the week at Pebble Beach, that'll be a must, as he's going to need to keep the pedal down to pick up the biggest win of his young career. \nHisatsune meanwhile has been on a tear for the last three weeks, and he continues to build confidence in his ability to contend with the best. After a T2 at Torrey Pines and a T10 at TPC Scottsdale, he keeps putting himself in position and learning how to handle the nerves on the weekend. The putter has been leading the way this week, and he seems extremely comfortable on poa greens that can give some players fits. We'll see if that holds up on the weekend, but a late tee time should feel like part of the routine after his last two weeks. The challenge for both Bhatia and Hisatsune will be holding off the best field of the young season with the weather expected to shift dramatically over the course of the weekend. Other contendersT3. Rickie Fowler, Sam Burns (-14)T5. Min Woo Lee, Sepp Straka, Jacob Bridgeman (-12)T8. Tom Hoge, Jake Knapp (-11)T10. Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Fitzpatrick, Keegan Bradley, Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and two others (-10)T17. Rory McIlroy, Chris Gotterup, Tommy Fleetwood and two others (-9)T34. Scottie Scheffler and 10 others (-6)\nBurns joined Fowler at 14 under, and in news that will come as a surprise to no one, it's a hot putter that has Burns in contention. Straka had a top 10 at Pebble last year and is in position to back that up again in 2026, joining Min Woo Lee in the top five. The group at T10 features some big names, but even in a sea of other major winners, Spieth is the player most are watching with interest this weekend. We haven't seen him anything close to his peak in some time, but any signs of life from the three-time major winner spark hope that he might be returning to top form. A bit further off the pace is Chris Gotterup, who finally cooled off a touch and is going to need a big Saturday effort if he's going to capture his third win of the young season. Defending champion Rory McIlroy is also at 9 under heading to the weekend, and will feel like he left a few shots out there on Friday that would've made him an even bigger threat to repeat. \nThen there's Scottie Scheffler, who is nine shots off the pace, but similar to last week in Phoenix, he bounced back from a rough Thursday to surge up the leaderboard with a Friday 66. He'll need to produce something magical to get in the mix late on Sunday, but after almost pulling off a huge come from behind victory a week ago, it's impossible to write him off. Updated 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds, picksAkshay Bhatia (+340)Rickie Fowler (11/2)Ryo Hisatsune (11/2)Sam Burns (6-1)Sepp Straka (14-1)Min Woo Lee (16-1)Jake Knapp (20-1)Rory McIlroy (22-1)Jacob Bridgeman (22-1)Xander Schauffele (25-1)If the winds pick up, this tournament could shift considerably, and it's going to be critical for players to get out to fast starts in their third round before it becomes a battle to hang on through difficult weather on Sunday. I tend to trust those leaning on ball-striking over putting when things get tough, which points me to Fowler and Straka of the guys just off the lead. I also don't hate sprinkling some of the pre-tournament favorites like McIlroy and Scheffler at longer odds, because there's certainly the potential for the top of the leaderboard to come back a bit in tougher conditions the elite players may handle a bit better. \n            ",

This is the seventh time that the annual showcase has been in the City of Angels, but the first time that the Clippers will be the sole hosts.All of the action will take place at the new Intuit Dome, which opened last season. The Clippers' arena, which cost $2 billion, has drawn rave reviews from fans and players alike, and will become the center of the basketball world for three days. Bet NBA All-Star Weekend at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The primary events are all back, but there are plenty of questions about the weekend. The Slam Dunk Contest remains devoid of stars, while the All-Star Game format has been tweaked once again. This time, it's Team USA vs. Team USA vs. Team World. The All-Star selections have been separated into three teams and will compete in a round-robin tournament. The league hopes that pitting Americans against international players will generate a more competitive environment, but we'll have to wait until Sunday to see if that makes a difference. Ahead of this weekend's festivities, CBS Sports' panel of experts made their picks for the 3-Point Contest, Slam Dunk Contest, All-Star Game and All-Star Game MVP:\n3-point Contest3-point Contest odds(Odds via

functioning Achilles would make for a great story. (Please do not get hurt doing this.) I went with the World winning the game and Wemby taking MVP because he seems to be one of the few All-Stars who actually wants to be there. You'll remember him getting ticked off at Anthony Edwards in the skills competition when Ant decided to shoot left handed for the lols. As for the dunk contest, there are no actual winners here -- certainly not the fans. We can't even get a Shaedon Sharpe for this thing?Herbert: The theme here is that I think the guys I picked will take this stuff seriously. The 3-point field is loaded, so Knueppel might be a bold choice, but his form is picture-perfect and should translate to the contest. For the All-Star \"Game,\" I just picked the team that I thought would try the hardest. (I was tempted to take Team World, but, historically, Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić have not expended much energy on this stage.) I can see Cunningham and Jalen Duren setting a competitive tone, especially with J.B. Bickerstaff coaching them. My real dunk contest pick is ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, but I went with Bryant, who says he already knows what he's going to do with his first three dunks.Maloney: Knueppel is a rookie, so you do have to wonder how he'll handle the bright lights of All-Star Weekend, but he's already established himself as one of the best pure shooters in the league and has made 45.9% of his open or wide-open 3s this season. My Dunk Contest pick is admittedly a shot in the dark, but I think Johnson will have something to prove given his status as a relative unknown. I'm going with Team World to win the All-Star Game and Victor Wembanyama to take home MVP. Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sidelined due to injury, Team World is the most talented bunch, and Wembanyama has made it abundantly clear that he's taking this more seriously than everyone else. \nSalerno: If you watched the movie \"Hustle,\" you know Kermit Wilts, AKA Anthony Edwards, loves competition. In this kind of format/showcase, guards tend to dominate. I'm going with Edwards, -- and, by extension, the USA Stars team -- to have a night to remember in Southern California. The new format hopefully will inject new life into the ASG. On Saturday night, I'm expecting the favorites to pull through.\n            ",

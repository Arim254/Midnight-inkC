UFC 324 delivered tons of action and incredible moments on Saturday night in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena. Justin Gaethje is walking away with the interim lightweight title after an instant classic in the main event with Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje and Pimblett became perfect dance partners on Saturday night after both men appeared to throw caution to the wind and throw down over five rounds. Gaethje dropped Pimblett in the first round and appeared close to finishing things off before Pimblett managed to scramble back to his feet. He was then dropped again and nearly stopped before the round ended.Somehow, Pimblett managed to bounce back and deliver some crushing blows of his own over the next four rounds despite taking incredible damage throughout. In the end, Gaethje took the decision on all three scorecards to earn the interim crown.Elsewhere on the card, Sean O'Malley returned to the winner's circle with a decision over Song Yadong in the co-main event. O'Malley, who was coming off consecutive losses to Merab Dvalishvili in title fights, called for a rematch with current titleholder Petr Yan next. O'Malley holds a split decision win over Yan in non-title action in 2022. Plus, heavyweight Waldo Cortes-Acosta picked up a third knockout win in as many months when he finished Derrick Lewis. \nCBS Sports was with you all week long with the latest news, features and other content around this massive event.

    "body": "\n        A special freshman class added another chapter to an all-time season Saturday. Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler waltzed into Mackey Arena — long a house of horrors for the opposition — and delivered a 46-point performance to lead No. 11 Illinois to an 88-82 victory over No. 4 Purdue. The Boilermakers got a brilliant showing from preseason All-American Braden Smith, but it was a slender freshman from Kansas who was the best player on the floor in this one.  Wagler wasn't alone. Just an hour earlier, Houston freshman Kingston Flemings sauntered into Lubbock and dropped a 42-point, six-assist masterpiece as the No. 6 Cougars lost 90-86 to No. 12 Texas Tech despite Flemings' jaw-dropping display. Freshmen weren't finished, however. An hour later, it was AJ Dybantsa's turn. Dybantsa ballooned for 43 majestic points in No. 13 BYU's runaway, 91-78 win over rival Utah in the Holy War. You have to go back to 1997 to find the last time that two freshmen have scored 40+ in a game, per CBS Sports research. Can you name 'em? I can't. Take a bow, Texas Southern's Randy Bolden and TCU's Mike Jones. But three? It's never been done in at least the previous 30 years of college basketball. Wagler, Dybantsa and Flemings will stand alone in the college basketball record books.  \nIt was a captivating, enthralling display of basketball. One in West Texas. One in the heart of Boilermaker country. One out in the mountains of Provo. Three unforgettable showings. One was entirely predictable. The other two? Not so much. The kids are all rightRecord-breaking performances from freshmen on Saturday.\tPlayer, teamPtsRebAstResultKeaton Wagler, Illinois4604W 88-82 at PurdueAJ Dybantsa, BYU4363W 91-78 vs. Utah Kingston Flemings, Houston4226L 90-86 vs. Texas Tech College basketball's newest stars on displayJust because Dybantsa was presumed to be the next great thing does not make Saturday's showing any less special. The hype was high for Dybantsa, but he's somehow surpassed almost all of it.  The jet-like rise of Flemings and Wagler was a bit more under the radar, though. \nHouston's best player was predicted to be Milos Uzan or Emanuel Sharp. Both of those terrific, two-way veterans have gotten out of the way to clear the runway for Flemings. The dynamic, explosive point guard has elevated into the best player on one of the Tier 1 National Championship contenders. Flemings is primed to become maybe the best player that Kelvin Sampson has ever coached in his 35-plus years as a head ball coach. A similar script has brewed in Champaign. Illinois' best player was a mystery in the preseason. Tomislav Ivisic, Kylan Boswell and Andrej Stojakovic were the likeliest candidates, but Illinois believed it could be a Big Ten contender with balance. Everybody can eat for the best offense in the land, but Wagler has cemented himself as the unquestioned best player on this team.  Saturday was his Mona Lisa. Wagler splashed nine 3-pointers to keep short-handed Illinois in the fight against behemoth Purdue. 46 points on 17 shots is video game-like stuff. It's the most points a visitor has ever scored in Mackey Arena's hallowed halls. \nMany national championship benchmarks are fallible and fickle. But one goalpost can't be moved back: every NCAA Tournament Champion since 1976 has produced a first-round NBA Draft pick except for Indiana in 1987 with Steve Alford the first Hoosier drafted that year. Alford was chosen No. 26 by Dallas, but that was a second-round selection that season.   Houston likely has a rising NBA star in Flemings and his jump-cut drives that left Texas Tech defenders in the dust will be featured heavily in the 2026 NBA Draft. Illinois also has a future first-round pick in Wagler, and unfortunately for Purdue's Jack Benter, Daniel Jacobsen and Oscar Cluff, their follies trying to guard him will be featured early and often in the Illini guard's mixtape on draft night.  They're also doing it with supreme humility and class. Flemings is beloved by his teammates near and far. Anyone associated with Illinois raves about Wagler's composure amid an out-of-nowhere rise for a recruit who was ranked No. 150 in the Class of 2025 and, at one point, was considered a potential redshirt candidate. \nArkansas' Darius Acuff Jr. delivered 31 points for the Hogs in a win over LSU. Duke's Cameron Boozer had a national player of the year-type showing with 32 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals in a win over Wake Forest. UNC's Caleb Wilson was a lean, mean, dunking machine in the Tar Heels' impressive road win over Virginia.  Savor this class. It's already proven that it is a special bunch of diaper dandies, sure to steal the spotlight again in March, just like it has in November, December and January. \n            ",

Silva is coming off a tough loss to Diego Lopes but remains a dangerous out for anyone in the 145-pound division. Plus, former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas takes on a difficult test in the fast rising contender Natalia Silva.

Nurmagomedov got a sample of what it's like to beat a titleholder by dominating former two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo in the featured preliminary match as UFC made its debut on Paramount+. Nurmagomedov, who is now neck-and-neck with Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili in the bantamweight contenders pool, had a chance to separate himself from his contemporaries on Saturday.

Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Nurmagomedov swept Figueiredo on the scorecards without much difficulty. However, many likely expected more dominance from a -1600 betting favorite, per DraftKings. Nurmagomedov stood as the biggest favorite on the entire UFC 324 card. He outstruck Figueiredo by multitudes, took him down to the mat and maintained solid ground control; however, what Nurmagomedov failed to do was put Figueiredo in serious trouble. \nMuch of that blame can be placed on Figueiredo. The savvy veteran largely backpedaled, avoiding engagement with Nurmagomedov. Figueiredo briefly unleashed his \"God of War\" persona in Round 2, but his offensive output lasted approximately 25 seconds.Ultimately, the fight was a clear but forgettable decision on a Paramount+ debut littered with knockouts. Even more concerning? Nurmagomedov was not granted a post-fight interview despite being the preliminary headliner.\nNurmagomedov (No. 2 BW) improved to 20-1. The cousin and pupil of UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov, Umar's lone loss was a competitive UFC bantamweight title fight with Dvalishvili. Figueiredo (No. 6) has had mixed success since moving up to bantamweight. He's 4-3 in the division and missed weight for this fight by 2.5 pounds.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first UFC event of 2026 kicked off the new deal with Paramount in a big way on Saturday when UFC 324 went down from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The landmark event ended in spectacular fashion with Justin Gaethje defeating Paddy Pimblett to capture the interim lightweight championship in an instant classic.The night was filled with big moments and impressive performances that set up what should be a massive year in the Octagon.Among those who came away with big wins aside from Gaethje were Sean O'Malley, Waldo Cortes-Acosta and Natalia Silva. However, Pimblett also walked away as a winner after his gutsy performance in defeat against Gaethje.\n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Paddy Pimblett elevates his status in defeat after incredible display of heart and resilience\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith that in mind, we took a look at some of the biggest takeaways from UFC 324. Let's get into it.\nGaethje is at his best fighting on instinctJustin Gaethje is interim lightweight champion once again, and he owes it all to fighting the way that made him one of the sport's most popular fighters. In recent years, Gaethje has attempted to fight with more of a strategic and tactical mind. That all went out the window against Paddy Pimblett on Saturday night. When Pimblett began to flow offensively, tagging Gaethje with flurries of crisp shots, Gaethje reverted to his old self, throwing down and meeting fire with fire. And Gaethje's fire has power few can match, as evidenced by the repeated knockdowns of Pimblett. When Gaethje is fighting instinctively, his opponents have to bring their game to an entire new level and go to places few other opponents can take them. That's why Gaethje is heading home with UFC gold.\"Yeah, my coach was definitely upset with me after the first round,\" Gaethje said of Saturday's performance. \"I just love this shit so much, it's really hard to control myself sometimes.\"Pimblett may have won in defeatSure, being an interim champion is better than any sort of moral victory, but Pimblett has plenty to be proud about. Very few men can stand up to five rounds of Gaethje's power. Pimblett showed the kind of heart and toughness that isn't able to be taught, it's something a fighter either has or doesn't. Pimblett faced some criticism for not \"deserving\" a shot at an interim title, but he proved he belongs in the Octagon with the best of the best. Even as things were going bad, Pimblett never stopped trying to win and continued to hit Gaethje with clean punches, kicks and knees.\nPimblett was one half of an instant classic and anyone who says they didn't gain respect for the Liverpool, England native is lying. As Pimblett once said, \"Scousers don't get knocked out.\" What was once a cheeky saying suddenly feels as though it might be rooted in reality.\nSean O'Malley shoots himself back into title contentionO'Malley entered Saturday having lost back-to-back championship fights to Merab Dvalishvili. It was only fair to wonder if O'Malley simply ran into a fighter who had his number, or if his time at the top of the bantamweight division was over shortly after it began. Against Song Yadong, O'Malley took a patient, professional approach, not forcing the issue against a dangerous striker in an attempt to prove something larger than can be shown in a single round. By the third round, O'Malley was rolling, tagging Yadong with a variety of strikes and asserting his dominance. With the win, O'Malley is right back in title contention, though he'll have to wait for the rematch between Dvalishvili and the man who defeated him to win the title, Petr Yan. O'Malley already holds a split decision win over Yan, making for an attractive title opportunity if Yan wins the trilogy with Dvalishvili.Waldo Cortes-Acosta and Natalia Silva make their title contention casesCortes-Acosta faced a serious test and one of the biggest stars in the UFC when he took on Derrick Lewis. Cortes-Acosta pitched a near-shutout against the UFC record holder for most knockouts, picking spots to drill Lewis with heavy leg kicks and straight punches until Lewis had nothing left and ended up on the ground, seemingly giving up as Cortes-Acosta pounded away with strikes to force the stoppage. In a heavyweight division in flux with champion Tom Aspinall sidelined for the foreseeable future due to eye injuries suffered against Cyril Gane, Cortes-Acosta made a solid case for an interim title shot.\nAs for Silva, it was already stated that a win over Rose Namajunas would earn her a title shot. Namajunas made it difficult, forcing Silva to scrap for every bit of ground. In the end, Silva won the fight by unanimous decision, picking up a third consecutive victory over a former UFC champion. Now, Silva can look forward to the challenge of facing Valentina Schevchenko for the women's flyweight championship.\n            ",

It's a busy month on Paramount+ with consecutive weeks of numbered events. UFC 325 takes place in Sydney on Jan. 31, a week after the incredible scenes from UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Volkanovski, the UFC featherweight champion, has deja vu. While he had pictured a fight against Movsar Evloev or Lerone Murphy, Volkanovski instead fights Lopes for the second time in a row. Volkanovski shushed retirement rumors, but conceded that he's closer to the finish line than the start. Already one of the best featherweights in history, Volkanovski is determined to savor every moment of his second reign as champion.Lopes took a short detour between Volkanovski fights. Lopes, who graduated from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years, is coming off a knockout win over Jean Silva that was in the running for CBS Sports' 2025 Fight of the Year. Lopes is an impressive dual threat who captured fans' attention with his ability to knock people out or submit them with equal efficacy. Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription!

Dan Hooker is one of the best action athletes in the sport, but his chin will be tested by his upcoming opponent. Benoit Saint Denis' last 10 fights ended with a finish. He touches down in Australia on a three-fight winstreak, most recently knocking out ranked contender Beneil Dariush in 16 seconds.Other notable fights on UFC 325 include Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy, the return of fan-favorite slugger Tai Tuivasa and CBS Sports' 2025 KO of the Year winner Quillan Salkilld.\nBelow is the complete fight card for UFC 325, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        The first UFC event of the landmark media rights deal with Paramount takes place on Saturday when the Octagon lands in Las Vegas for UFC 324. The card is loaded with former champions, record holders and rising stars, making for a potentially explosive Paramount+ debut.In the night's main event, Paddy Pimblett will meet Justin Gaethje for the interim lightweight championship. Gaethje is a former interim champ and also held the symbolic BMF title, while this is Pimblett's first chance as UFC gold.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Follow live updates on UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett as event debuts on Paramount+\n\"I'm happy I'm the underdog and I'm happy to be fighting someone so confident with so much momentum behind them because one thing you must understand in this game is, I don't care how confident you are, you better be perfect,\" Gaethje told CBS Sports this week. \"And he's going to make mistakes and I'm going to take advantage of his mistakes. I've said it before but I don't plan on being alive after Saturday night. I have to tell myself that he's going to kill me so that I can go into my most primal place.\"I love the pressure, I love the moments and I love the adrenaline -- it's the best drug in the world.\" Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription!

The former Cage Warriors lightweight champion faces by far his stiffest challenge to date as he hopes to continue his incredible run and rapid ascent.The card also features some former champions and rising contenders looking to make a splash. That begins in the main card opener when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight. Silva is coming off a tough loss to Diego Lopes but remains a dangerous out for anyone in the 145-pound division.

It should go without saying that Pimblett will need to show a sturdy chin early and live up to his slogan that \"Scousers don't get knocked out.\" But for as dangerous as Gaethje is, Pimblett holds a distinct advantage on the ground with his submission game opposite a strong amateur wrestling background for Gaethje that surprisingly never gets utilized in his UFC bouts. Pimblett will take his time and eventually expose the aging chin of his 37-year-old opponent in a breakthrough win. Pimblett via TKO4\nBrookhouse: Gaethje hasn't been very active in recent years and is now 37. Add in that he's taken a more patient and tactical approach to fighting in the later stages of his career and I think you have the recipe for Pimblett to win this fight. Pimblett has the length to punish Gaethje on the outside and can tangle Gaethje up and use trips to take the fight to the ground. If the fight hits the floor, that's far more Pimblett's world, whether he is attacking with submissions or dominating position to deliver strikes. This feels like a great fight for Pimblett to get the biggest win of his career. Pimblett via SUB2Mahjouri: I promised to stop picking against Pimblett after he thrashed Michael Chandler. He doesn't make it easy. Statistically, it's hard to see Pimblett's path to victory.  Pimblett is a dual-finishing threat, but falls short in key categories. Gaethje is the more powerful and experienced striker with surprisingly higher striking defense. Pimblett has the biggest advantage on the ground, but historically lacks the offensive wrestling required to take the fight there. What these overall statistics don't conclude are their recent trajectories. Pimblett, 31, makes meaningful improvements from fight to fight. Chandler and King Green are indeed over the hill, but Pimblett beat them with such ease that you can't dismiss his growth. Gaethje, 37, is nearing the end by his own admission. Pimblett will properly prepare for this dangerous task. He'll know to keep his chin down -- a recurring bad habit of his -- against a juggernaut like Gaethje. Pimblett via SUB4Mormile: Gaethje via TKOWise: Gaethje via UDSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong predictionsCampbell: O'Malley badly needs a win following back-to-back title losses to former champion Merab Dvalishvili. But the fact that Petr Yan, who defeated Dvashvili in their December rematch to once again become bantamweight king, holds a 2022 loss to O'Malley by split decision means that a rematch could be next if \"Suga\" can keep pace atop the division rankings. For as strong and solid as Yadong has become at age 28 following eight years as a UFC fighter, his style is still too basic for O'Malley not to expose over 15 minutes with his dynamic striking attack. While Yadong is durable enough to prevent O'Malley from delivering a highlight-reel statement and should prove able to keep the fight competitive, expect a return to form from the former champion. O'Malley via UD\nBrookhouse: We've seen O'Malley struggle against men who bring heavy pressure and can make him uncomfortable with grappling. Yadong isn't that fighter, though. Yadong is a good striker, but he is going to struggle to stay in his striking range, while O'Malley can work from the outside and utilize his length. Yadong doesn't really have the game to force O'Malley out of his comfort zone or rhythm and that should let O'Malley cruise to a decision win. O'Malley via UDMahjouri: O'Malley still has life in him as an elite bantamweight. He admits taking consecutive fights against Dvalishvili was a mistake, and took ample time off to address nagging injuries. He's a precise, powerful striker with a solid grappling game. Song is one of the more well-rounded fighters in the division, but his experience with elite bantamweights suggests his ceiling is below the title level. Song's win over Henry Cejudo was too competitive, considering the future Hall of Famer retired one fight later. His losses to Cory Sandhagen and Yan further drive home the point. Song can certainly play spoiler, but I fear we forget how thoroughly O'Malley dissected Marlon Vera in their rematch. O'Malley via UDMormile: O'Malley via UDWise: Yadong via TKO2Cortes-Acosta vs. Lewis predictionsCampbell: With four wins in five appearances alone over the past 10 months, Cortes-Acosta has rapidly become a legitimate threat to the heavyweight title picture. But the grind of constantly being in training camp can become a grind that sneaks up on fighters over time. And Lewis, who claims he is entering this fight in arguably the best shape of his career, is the wrong fighter to potentially make a mistake against or have an off night. Even at 40, the UFC's record holder for career knockouts is still as dangerous as ever. Lewis has won three of his last four fights, all by stoppage, and still owns the ability to weather damage before delivering the dramatic finish. The fact that Lewis feels so healthy after years of nagging injuries and fluctuating weight should be taken seriously here. Lewis via KO2\nBrookhouse: Lewis has an unbelievable ability to find ways to land fight-ending bombs against almost anyone, so he can never be counted out in any fight. That said, Cortes-Acosta is the more well-rounded fighter and has shown the ability to shift from striking to a measured, slower-paced approach to neutralizing dangerous big men. Cortes-Acosta may be willing to risk some exchanges early, but he'll likely shift to takedowns to try and keep Lewis grounded and away from throwing his looping power shots. It may not be pretty, but this is a fight Cortes-Acosta can grind away with repeated takedowns. Cortes-Acosta via decisionMahjouri: The jury is out on Cortes-Acosta. Is he a legitimate elite heavyweight or the type of hype train that Lewis feeds on? I believe it's the former. Cortes-Acosta has won seven of his last eight fights and took a round off interim title challenger Serghei Pavlovich in his lone loss during that stretch. It's Cortes-Acosta's striking defense that inspires confidence. Don't let his recent string of knockouts fool you; he knows how to stay safe and win fights over 15 minutes. Cortes-Acosta should employ a responsible style, mixing distance and footwork with carefully timed takedown attempts. If he can avoid Lewis' blitzes, an admittedly hard ask against the UFC KO record holder, he should win the fight on the scorecards or with a late knockout.

    "body": "\n        TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – If this was the end of college basketball as we knew it, it finished with a rousing ovation. As Charles Bediako, a 23-year old who was playing for the G League's Motor City Cruise all of a week ago, checked in with 16:11 in the first half, he was welcomed back to a standing ovation from many of the 13,474 Alabama fans in attendance inside Coleman Coliseum. Bediako will no doubt receive far less welcoming reactions if he's eligible to continue playing past Saturday night's 79-73 loss vs. Tennessee, but Alabama fans seemed to relish that the Crimson Tide defied the NCAA's wishes and played him. Bediako quickly scored four points after coming onto the floor including a dunk that again brought an electric Tide crowd to its feet. If you wondered why Alabama was willing to go through all this trouble, to evoke such strong and often negative reactions from its peers, this was it. In the first half, Bediako gave Alabama the kind of elite rim-runner it has been missing, scoring eight points on 4-4 shooting. He finished with 13 points, two blocks and three rebounds in 25 minutes of action. \"I thought he was good,\" said Alabama coach Nate Oats. \"He almost led us in blue-collar points. He's got to get a few more rebounds for us, he knows it and he was telling me that in the first half when he came out. The guys all loved him and he's a great teammate. He's going to help us moving forward, we just got to get him rebounding the ball a little bit especially on the defensive end.\" \nThat is an important part to remember: Alabama is going through all this trouble not because it is some revolutionary and trying to stick it to the NCAA. It is doing so because it badly needed a backup big man, and Bediako was the best possible mid-season addition available. Even with Bediako's contribution, a short-handed Alabama team without its second and third-leading scorers lost its second consecutive home game for the first time in six seasons. Bediako has another hearing Tuesday to determine if this was a one-and-done foray back into college basketball or if he can stick with this Alabama team through the remainder of the season. When asked about it Saturday night, Bediako sidestepped the question but his answer indicated he doesn't want it to end after only one game.\"My main focus is around this next game and just getting better with the team,\" Bediako said. \nIf he's successful Tuesday in getting an injunction, this could be just the beginning of what's to come in college basketball. The line between professional and college athlete has already faded to an almost infinitesimal difference. Just this year alone we've seen what we believed to be clear and impenetrable rules fall by the wayside. Parallels with Baylor's Nnaji First, it was Baylor bringing in James Nnaji, who was drafted 31st overall in the 2023 NBA Draft but never played in the NBA nor collegiately. Notably, the NCAA approved Nnaji's waiver – it did not do so for Bediako – but it still felt like a crossroads moment. Nnanji's return prompted Bediako to consider a return to college basketball after playing for Alabama from 2021-23. Bediako went undrafted in 2023 and hasn't played in the NBA but signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. That should have prevented a collegiate return – once you forego eligibility and sign an NBA deal there's no going back, or so we believed – but he successfully obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) to play in Saturday's important home game against Tennessee. \nWho knows what happens next. Some school somewhere could become even more aggressive in trying to add a former NBA player onto its roster. What about trying to convince an NBA 15th man who isn't playing to come back for another year of college basketball and an accompanying big NIL payday? This is the world we live in. The NCAA is feckless and hapless at enforcing its rules. Despite strongly worded statements from NCAA president Charlie Baker and vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt, Alabama forged ahead undeterred. As long as you can get in front of a friendly local judge, anything is possible these days. If Saturday night is any proof, the fanbase will love you for it. \"What they're doing now is exploiting the NCAA and they're forum shopping in some aspects, saying, 'Well, if that's the case, we're going to jump down from federal court to state court where we could get a more favorable result,\" said Mitch Gilfillan, a former college basketball coach and now an attorney at Quinn Johnston. \"Until Congress acts, which it does not appear that they're going to, I think you're going to continue to see more and more challenges.\"\nScott Schneider, a Title IX and employment attorney, calls it \"a real structural problem for how the NCAA is organized.\" Due to the NCAA's unincorporated association structure, it is technically a citizen in each state it has a member institution. That makes it vulnerable to state courts that may be more friendly to the local university than the national NCAA organization. Alabama coach Nate Oats had no problem with Charles Bediako returning to the Crimson Tide. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Schools look for home-court advantageIt played out in Tuscaloosa where Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts has donated at least $100,000 to the Crimson Tide Foundation, according to its website. His wife, defense attorney Mary Turner Roberts, continues to represent former Alabama basketball player Darius Miles who has been charged with capital murder in the January 2023 shooting of Jamea Harris. It's not exclusively an Alabama situation, either. It could help Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss gain a sixth year of eligibility after being denied by the NCAA and later filing a lawsuit in Lafayette County in Mississippi. It could help Duke in its recently filed lawsuit against quarterback Darian Mensah, as a local judge already granted a TRO to prevent Mensah from enrolling at another school. \n\"If they were a corporation or organized in a different way, this lawsuit that was filed against them in Alabama, what they could do at that point is remove it to federal court,\" Schneider told CBS Sports. \"But because they are a citizen in Alabama, they can't do that. You see this in the Chambliss lawsuit, you see this with (Bediako) in Alabama and you see it over and over again. If I can file a case in a favorable forum, I'm probably going to get a good result.\" Alabama will learn more Tuesday but comments like Oats' \"he's going to help us moving forward\" certainly indicate how the school thinks it'll turn out. It's not a bad election strategy for local judges to side with the popular university, either. After the game ended, fans waited to cheer on Bediako as he left for the locker room. A trio of elementary-school aged fans had handmade signs they wanted Alabama's newest basketball player to sign. In a surreal moment emblematic of where college sports is these days, Bediako gladly autographed one that read, \"Bama Pay$ Better.\"\n\"Everybody came to support,\" Bediako said. \"It felt great to be back, especially with an Alabama across my chest.\" To put it mildly, many around the sport don't believe it's quite so great that Bediako is back and playing. Critics believe actions like Alabama suiting up Bediako have left college basketball's foundation as shaky as ever. \"We just need some people to stand up and start taking a stand,\" Florida coach Todd Golden said earlier this week. In Tuscaloosa, fans gladly stood up and cheered its erosion. \n            ",

The news of Cruz's selection for the Hall of Fame was announced during Saturday's UFC 324 event, streaming live on Paramount+.Cruz was a massively influential figure during his time as a fighter, bringing a level of movement to the Octagon that was rare for the time in which he became the king of the 135-pound division.\"Dominick Cruz is one of the greatest bantamweights in combat sports history,\" UFC president & CEO Dana White said in a statement. \"Dominick was an amazing athlete who set the standard for bantamweights, and it will be an honor to induct him into the UFC Hall of Fame this summer.\"Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAfter coming up short in a bid for the WEC featherweight championship against his iconic rival Urijah Faber in 2007, Cruz moved down to bantamweight and won the WEC title with a TKO of Brian Bowles in 2010.Cruz continued to defend that title until it became the UFC championship, making Cruz the inaugural UFC bantamweight champion.Cruz's first reign as champion would not end in the Octagon. He instead was forced to vacate the title due to recurring injuries.\nDespite having been forced to vacate the belt, Cruz returned to action and retained the belt with a split decision win over T.J. Dillashaw in 2016. After losing the title later that same year, Cruz again was sidelined for an extended time due to multiple injuries.Yet again, Cruz battled his way back, going 2-2 from 2020 to 2022 before finally officially retiring from active competition.Cruz has become a staple of fight analysis, drawing on his vast high-level experience to become one of the most respected voices in the game.\n            \n    ",

The fighters overdelivered, producing fireworks for the first UFC main card on Paramount+. In the end, Silva managed to bounce back from his first UFC defeat with a strong decision win on Saturday.Allen and Silva fight with very different philosophies. Allen is a strategist: measured offensively and defensively sound. Silva is a berserker: ultra potent with reckless abandon. Allen leaned on his patented durability, overcoming close calls and marching into the fire. Allen was never overwhelmed, but couldn't keep up with Silva's pressure.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAllen looked sharp in Round 1, but a late body strike forced him to retreat under a barrage of strikes. Impressed, Allen offered Silva a high-five, which was ignored. Allen, upset by the perceived disrespect, shoved Silva after the round and was verbally warned by the referee. The wild fight continued in rounds two and three. Both men threw various kicks and spinning techniques, with Silva landing greater impact and volume. Silva's wild man reputation shone through on Saturday. With seconds left in the fight, Silva jumped onto a prone Allen's back and jumped off. \nThe competitive friction between them evaporated the moment the final buzzer sounded. Silva tearfully embraced Allen, and both men shared their mutual respect on the microphone. \nAll three judges agreed that Silva did the better work across three rounds. The Fighting Nerds' representative was awarded one 30-27 scorecard and a pair of 29-28s. During his post-fight interview, Silva set his sights on the featherweight title. His lone UFC defeat came against Diego Lopes, who is fighting for the belt a second time at UFC 325 on Jan. 31 after losing to Alexander Volkanovski last year.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Sean O'Malley wants his throne back. Song Yadong nearly played spoiler at UFC 324, but O'Malley leaned on championship mettle in the nick of time to get a crucial win in the co-main event from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\"Oh my God! God, it feels good to win! I hate losing! F---, this feels good,\" O'Malley said.O'Malley's post-fight outburst illustrates a tough road back for the former champion. Consecutive losses to Merab Dvalishvili rendered O'Malley winless since March 2024. Defeating Yadong on Saturday was paramount to proving that O'Malley is still one of the best bantamweights in the world. \"The Suga Show\" started strong. O'Malley flummoxed Yadong with fleet footwork and hyper-quick counterstrikes. He couldn't replicate such success in Round 2. Yadong took the fight to O'Malley, chewing up his leg and ragdolling him with wrestling. The fight was tied heading into the final frame with momentum firmly on the underdog's side. Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nThere are levels to MMA, and O'Malley exercised this just in time. The volume and power behind his strikes increased noticeably. O'Malley bloodied Song's face, landing more significant strikes in Round 3 than he had in the prior two rounds combined. The outcome: three 29-28 scorecards in favor of O'Malley.\n\"Petr Yan has something that I want,\" O'Malley said during his post-fight speech. \"All respect to Merab [Dvalishvili], if he gets the next shot, it's well deserved, but Petr Yan, you want that rematch, and I want that belt. Let's make it happen. Go take care of Merab, if that's what's next. If not, let's run it, baby!\"O'Malley's third-round performance might have saved his case for the next title shot. There are three fighters in the running to challenge bantamweight champ Yan: O'Malley, Dvalishvili and Umar Nurmagomedov. \nNurmagomedov's forgettable win over Deivson Figueiredo could remove him from the immediate running, while Dvalishvili and O'Malley campaign for the next title shot.\n            ",

And it's not close.How bad? How does 1-9 against the spread hit you? Even straight up, I am 5-5 the past two weeks. I went 1-3 against the spread last week -- New England was the only winner -- and 3-1 straight up.My playoffs have been so bad that there is a chance I might not finish above .500 for the year ATS.

I seem to be choking in a big way.Championship Sunday NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+5.5)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWith Bo Nix out with a broken ankle, the Broncos will turn to Jarrett Stidham at quarterback in this one. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023, but Broncos coach Sean Payton believes in him. And when he does, he usually lets the quarterback play loose.The New England defense can be stingy, especially against the run, which can put more pressure on Payton to scheme up things to make it easier for Stidham. I think Payton is one of the best play callers in the league, so I think he will.On the other side, Drake Maye will be making his first road playoff start for the Patriots. That can be daunting, especially against a good Denver defense. But Maye has been good on the road this season. Then again, this is the playoffs.The Bills ran on the Broncos last week, so I expect the Patriots to try to do the same. New England is averaging 156.1 rushing yards per game over the last seven games, but I think Denver will be better this time against the run.It would be easy to pick the Pats here based on Stidham playing. But I think the Denver players will elevate their games around him and Payton will have a big day calling the game for him. I think Denver's defense will get the best of the Pats offense.

The Seahawks rallied to win the last meeting in Seattle in Week 16 in overtime, which is why this game is at home.The Rams are playing a third straight road game, which is brutal, but teams have overcome that in the past in the playoffs. If any coach can get his team right for that, it's Rams coach Sean McVay.The Rams struggled some on offense last week in their victory over the Bears. This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now. That defensive front will disrupt the night for Stafford as the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl behind that defense.Pick: Seahawks 23, Rams 17\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One week after appearing in a G League Game, Charles Bediako made a successful return to Alabama's rotation on Saturday night, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes during the No. 17 Crimson Tide's 79-73 loss to Tennessee. Two and a half years after last suiting up for Bama, Bediako looked great in his return, adding a dynamic lob threat to the Crimson Tide's frontcourt.He finished 5 of 6 shooting from the floor -- with four dunks -- and added added three rebounds, two blocks and two steals. It was exactly the type of performance that may make the heartache of doing battle with the NCAA worth it for coach Nate Oats, who thrust his program into the national spotlight in recent days by pushing to get Bediako eligible during the middle of the season.Bediako's return to college basketball after his entry into the 2023 NBA Draft has whipped college basketball into a frenzy. The case is only the latest example of how eligibility standards in college basketball are cratering as the NCAA's rules continue to face legal challenges. An Alabama judge granted a temporary restraining order in Bediako's favor Wednesday, clearing the path for his return to the Crimson Tide.He last played for Alabama in the 2022-23 season as a sophomore before remaining in the NBA Draft pool beyond the NCAA's well-established and clearly communicated draft withdrawal deadline. That deadline has long served as a line in the sand for players weighing their futures.\nPrior to the Bediako fiasco, the precedent maintained by the NCAA was this: if you withdraw before the NBA Draft deadline, you can preserve your collegiate eligibility. If you don't withdraw and choose to remain in the NBA Draft, you are forfeiting your future collegiate eligibility. There was never any ambiguity over that until Bediako found a friendly judge who cleared the path for his return.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrow in the fact that Bediako signed multiple NBA contracts and has been away from college basketball for nearly three years and you get a messy situation that has stoked the ire of coaches around the country.The precedent now being established by the Bediako case could permanently change the enforceability of the draft withdrawal deadline, further eroding the NCAA's ability to govern college basketball. It's also just the latest domino to fall in a saga that has seen the makeup of college basketball rosters continue to change and skew in a more professional direction.\nWhile some have likened the case to that of Baylor center James Nnaji, who joined the Bears earlier this season after he was drafted No. 31 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft, there are some key differences.A pro career hasn't panned outBediako went undrafted in 2023 and has not played in an NBA game, but he did sign a two-way contract with the Spurs ahead of the 2023-24 season. He's also signed NBA Exhibit 10 deals. Both forms of contracts make him ineligible for college basketball, according to NCAA standards. This is also one key area in which Bediako's case differs from others who have played in the G League before returning to college basketball: Bediako is the first to have been under contract with an NBA organization.Here is an excerpt from the NCAA's statement made by senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt:\n\"Mr. Bediako signed three NBA contracts after competing in college for two seasons. The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract. Eligibility rules ensure high school students get a shot at earning scholarships, and we will continue to consistently apply and defend these rules.\"Charles Bediako was a key player for Alabama for two seasons before declaring for NBA Draft in 2023.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The case for returning to collegeA key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Since he's within his five-year window and has yet to play in an NBA game, Bediako's representation argues he should be able to play.\"The NCAA's arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement of its eligibility standards is inflicting immediate and irreparable harm upon him,\" said Bediako's lawyer, Darren Heitner, in a statement. \"This harm is particularly egregious given the NCAA's recent decisions granting eligibility to athletes with far more extensive professional experience, revealing a pattern of selective and inequitable application of its own rules.\"Differences between Bediako and Nnaji casesThe case involving Baylor center James Nnaji differs from the Bediako case because, although Nnaji was drafted in 2023 (the same year Bediako went undrafted), Nnaji never signed an NBA contract. Nnaji was also cleared by the NCAA to play for Baylor, whereas Bediako has not been cleared by the NCAA. Nnaji also never appeared in a college basketball game and thus was never subject to the NCAA's NBA Draft withdrawal deadline. Bediako was subject to that deadline in 2023.\nA local judge makes decisionThe temporary restraining order granted by judge James Roberts Jr., a Tuscaloosa County Circuit judge, allowed Bediako to play on Saturday. Roberts' decision drew criticism after it was revealed he is listed as a donor to the University of Alabama's athletic department.  But it won't be the final judicial say on the matter. The initial ruling covers just 10 days, which means Bediako will likely need a preliminary injunction on Jan. 27 if he wishes to continue playing.What Oats said about his roster additionAlabama needs help on the interior, and Bediako profiles as a strong rim protector after leading the Crimson Tide in blocks with 1.8 per game in the 2022-23 season. Though Bediako is averaging just 4.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 0.6 blocks in 15.1 minutes per game for the Motor City Cruise, he size, length and track record of collegiate production could benefit the Crimson Tide. Those attributes were all on display against Tennessee.\n\"He was here not that long ago, and when he was here, he was an elite rim protector, very good post defender, rebounder, very good lob target,\" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. \"And I think his game's continued to develop, and we'll try to use some of the stuff he's developed. But right now, we're just trying to get him used to playing with the players we have.\"What other coaches are saying about BediakoFlorida coach Todd Golden said \"I don't agree with it, and I don't think he should be playing.\" He also added that he doesn't fault Oats for taking a step that could help his team win games.\"We are going to beat them anyway,\" Golden said. \"If he plays, we'll beat them anyways.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Florida's Todd Golden sounds off on Charles Bediako's potential return to Alabama: 'We'll beat them anyway'\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKentucky coach Mark Pope suggested the NCAA Tournament selection committee should not consider results that occurred when a team played someone who is not eligible under NCAA rules.\"The one stop gap that is kind of spreading right now, that maybe has some legs, is that the NCAA does get to decide who gets to go to the NCAA Tournament,\" Pope said. \"They get to decide that. They have that power. \"They've been very, very clear about the rules they're going to try to enforce,\" Pope added. \"They might lose in court, but they still get to decide what games count towards the NCAA Tournament.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Plenty of the shine from the Denver Broncos' run to the AFC Championship Game came off in sudden, stunning fashion Saturday night when coach Sean Payton announced Bo Nix had broken a bone in his ankle on the second-to-last play of the game against the Buffalo Bills and would miss the rest of the season. That leaves Jarrett Stidham -- who has not thrown a pass all season -- starting against the New England Patriots with a Super Bowl bid on the line.The Patriots were always going to have the advantage at quarterback given Drake Maye is the potential MVP, but the gap widened significantly with the Nix news. It's not unprecedented for a backup to make the Super Bowl, but the mountain became that much harder to climb.The good news for the Broncos is they have built a wonderful roster around Nix -- or, for the rest of the season, Stidham. The bad news is the Patriots have done the same around Maye, turning a directionless 4-13 team into a 14-3 powerhouse thanks to the additions of Mike Vrabel and several significant free-agent signings.\n        \n            \n                Broncos vs. Patriots: AFC Championship expert picks, odds, NFL playoffs best bets, where to watch, TV, stream\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's how the two teams stack up.QuarterbackPatriots: Drake MayeBroncos: Bo NixEdge: PatriotsMaye hasn't been perfect this postseason while facing two of the NFL's best defenses -- the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans -- and he gets another tough test here. The Broncos are outstanding at all three levels, especially in the pass-rusher and cornerback departments. Still, Maye made enough plays to push New England past Houston, throwing three touchdown passes, and he has the clear edge here.\n\n        \n            \n                Where does Drake Maye's sophomore season rank among the greatest second-year QB seasons in NFL history?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRunning backPatriots: Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon HendersonBroncos: RJ Harvey, J.K. Dobbins, Jaleel McLaughlin, Tyler BadieEdge: PatriotsStevenson has quietly provided a significant boost for the Patriots, totaling 209 yards from scrimmage in two playoff games after scoring six touchdowns over his final three games of the regular season. New England also mixes in Henderson, who can break a big play at any time. Denver hasn't had consistent success on the ground since Dobbins went down with what was believed to be a season-ending foot injury, but he could return this weekend now that the Broncos have extended their season. If not, it will be a heavy dose of Harvey, with McLaughlin and Badie spelling him.Wide receiverPatriots: Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte, DeMario Douglas, Kyle Williams, Efton Chism IIIBroncos: Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant, Lil'Jordan HumphreyEdge: PatriotsDiggs has been outstanding this season, and his touchdown catch last week was one of the best of the year. So, too, was Boutte's one-handed snag.\nDiggs is a route-running master, Boutte is a big play waiting to happen, Douglas is elusive, and Williams can stretch the field. Sutton has had a terrific season for Denver, but both Franklin (hamstring) and Bryant (concussion) are dealing with injuries suffered last week. Mims is a much better player than his surface-level stats would suggest, but New England still gets the nod here.Tight endPatriots: Hunter Henry, Austin HooperBroncos: Evan Engram, Adam Trautman, Nate AdkinsEdge: PatriotsHenry had a career-high 768 yards this season and reeled in seven touchdowns. Engram arrived in Denver this offseason with significant expectations, but he was mostly quiet. Perhaps he'll be more involved with a new quarterback under center.\nOffensive linePatriots (left to right): Will Campbell, Jared Wilson, Garrett Bradbury, Mike Onwenu, Morgan MosesBroncos (left to right): Garett Bolles, Ben Powers, Alex Forsyth, Quinn Meinerz, Mike McGlincheyEdge: BroncosThis is one of the areas that should give Broncos fans the most hope. Denver's offensive line is excellent, anchored by first-team All-Pro selections Bolles and Meinerz. While it's less than ideal to start a backup quarterback, Payton does a great job with his protection schemes, and he has the personnel up front to execute them. The Broncos earned PFF's top pass-blocking grade and seventh-best run-blocking grade.Meanwhile, the New England offensive line has struggled, allowing 10 sacks in two playoff games. No. 4 overall pick Will Campbell had a tough time in both games, and he and the rest of the unit face a deep, talented pass-rushing group.\n        \n            \n                AFC Championship staff picks: Predictions, odds and more for Broncos vs. Patriots NFL playoff game\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefensive linePatriots: Christian Barmore, Khyiris Tonga, Milton WilliamsBroncos: Zach Allen, D.J. Jones, John Franklin-Myers, Malcolm RoachEdge: BroncosNow fully healthy, the Patriots' front has been terrific in the playoffs. Williams looks like the player New England splurged on this offseason, and Tonga has been one of the best bang-for-your-buck free-agent signings.\nBut it's not quite the Denver unit, which features a first-team All-Pro performer in Allen and three other very solid contributors. Franklin-Myers (career-high 7.5 sacks) has been outstanding, Jones is stout against the run, and Roach would start for many teams across the league.Edge rusherPatriots: Harold Landry, K'Lavon Chaisson, Anfernee JenningsBroncos: Nik Bonitto, Jonathon Cooper, Dondrea Tillman, Jonah EllissEdge: BroncosBonitto is an absolute star, and his 14.0 regular-season sacks (fifth in the NFL) prove it. He also sacked Josh Allen last week. The pressure numbers suggest Cooper is due to return to the sacks column; he had 7.5 in the first 10 games of the season and just a half-sack since. For the Patriots, Chaisson has been on a heater of late, with four sacks in his past three games.\nLinebackerPatriots: Robert Spillane, Christian Elliss, Jack Gibbens, Jahlani TavaiBroncos: Alex Singleton, Dre Greenlaw, Justin StrnadEdge: PushSingleton is one of the unsung heroes of this defense, terrific against the run and solid in coverage. Spillane has been one of the key offseason additions to New England's defensive turnaround.These are two strong units with underappreciated depth.CornerbackPatriots: Christian Gonzalez, Carlton Davis, Marcus JonesBroncos: Patrick Surtain II, Riley Moss, Ja'Quan McMillian, Jahdae BarronEdge: BroncosThis is another case of good vs. good. Really good vs. really good, even. Denver earns the slight edge because Surtain is a complete eraser, and McMillian is one of the league's best lesser-known cornerbacks. His interception last week could earn him more recognition.\nOn the other side, we know what Gonzalez can do. In addition to the 2025 Pro Bowler, Jones had a pick-six against the Texans, and Davis recorded two interceptions -- both athletic grabs along the sideline that showed impressive coordination.This is close to a push, but Denver gets the nod by a slim margin, with depth serving as the deciding factor.SafetyPatriots: Jaylinn Hawkins, Craig WoodsonBroncos: Talanoa Hufanga, P.J. LockeEdge: PushHufanga is an outstanding enforcer, the type of throwback, hard-hitting safety who has become less common in today's game. And don't overlook Locke, who intercepted Allen last week and added a forced fumble and nine tackles.\nNew England's duo lacks Hufanga's name recognition but played at a high level all season. PFF graded Hawkins as the No. 7 safety, and he is especially strong against the run. So, too, is Woodson. If Singleton is the underappreciated piece of Denver's defense, the same applies to Hawkins and Woodson for New England.Special teamsPatriots: Andy Borregales (kicker), Bryce Baringer (punter), Marcus Jones (punt returner), Efton Chism III/Kyle Williams/D'Ernest Johnson (kick returner)Broncos: Wil Lutz (kicker), Jeremy Crawshaw (punter), Jaleel McLaughlin/Marvin Mims Jr. (kick returner), Marvin Mims Jr. (punt returner)Edge: BroncosThe hosts hold a slight advantage here. New England is better in the punting department, and both teams feature dangerous returners, but Lutz's edge over Borregales makes the difference. Lutz hasn't missed an extra point; Borregales missed a pair early in the season and missed field goals in Week 17 and Week 18. Lutz has missed just one kick over the past two months and holds the edge in big-game experience.\n            ",

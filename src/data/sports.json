    "body": "\n        The Tuesday sports calendar is basketball-centric stateside with the NBA and college basketball taking the spotlight. Notable matchups in the NBA include Knicks vs. Cavaliers, Raptors vs. Thunder and Magic vs. Lakers. Duke vs. Notre Dame, Kentucky vs. South Carolina and Virginia vs. NC State are among the games to watch in college basketball. Other upcoming events include multiple Champions League matches in soccer and the PGA's Cognizant Classic on Thursday as the Florida Swing gets underway. The team at SportsLine uses a proven computer model that simulates every game 10,000 times, as well as a team of more than 40 Vegas experts to find the best values on the odds board for every major sport.

Qualifying SportsLine members also receive free access to Paramount+ Premium, which now includes every UFC fight! Saint Louis vs. Dayton, 7 p.m. ET Pick: Saint Louis -3.5SportsLine's model projects an 83-73 win for Saint Louis as the Billikens cover in well over 60% of simulations. Expert Micah Roberts, who is on a 38-18 roll on college basketball picks (+1869), agrees, saying:\"Saint Louis is 25-2 on the year, which brings a big target on its back. The Billikens lost their last road game at Rhode Island 81-76 as a 9.5-point favorite. They were losing at home in their last game to VCU, but had a furious comeback in the second half to win. Dayton has won and covered its last three games, but it was on January 30th that they lost 102-71 to Saint Louis. Dayton played well that day, but had 15 turnovers, and Saint Louis shot 62% from the field. Saint Louis has the No. 1 defense in the nation, holding opponents to 36.3% shooting. The Billikens are 7-1 on the road, and I think they win this one by double-digits.\"New users can bet on Saint Louis (-3.5) with the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins:Warriors vs. Pelicans, 8 p.m. ETPick: De'Anthony Melton Under 16.5 total pointsSportsLine's model is projecting 16 points as Melton has failed to hit hit points total in four of the past six road games. NBA props expert Alex 'PropStarz' Selenick, who returned more than 75 units on his NBA picks over the past two full seasons, agrees with this prop, saying:\"Melton has eclipsed this number in three consecutive games, but I believe this is a significantly inflated line considering his playing time, role and usage. Melton hovers between 22-25 minutes and while he's never been afraid to shoot, this is projected to be a paced down environment. I would also argue that Melton looks like a regression candidate as well.\"Selesnick played that line at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users can sign up with the Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBSSPORTS250BM and receive a first bet match of up to $250 in bonus bets.How to get bets bets for NBA, college basketball and more at SportsLineNow that you've seen some of SportsLine's consensus picks for Tuesday, join to get picks for every game from a proven computer model and a team of more than 40 Vegas experts.

    "body": "\n        Inter are out of the UEFA Champions League after losing 5-2 on aggregate against Bodo/Glimt in the playoffs ahead of the knockout stages. The Norwegian team are playing in the elite European tournament for the first time in their history, but the Nerazzurri's elimination isn't a big surprise as it might look today. Cristian Chivu's team lost 3-1 away in the first leg, but many thought the defeat had to do with the challenging pitch and the hostile Norwegian weather. That was not the case. Bodo/Glimt showed again on Tuesday that they are an organized team, and demonstrated why they have already won against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid earlier in the league phase. \nInter showed a different attitude this season in the European tournament, especially as compared to last season when the Nerazzurri reached the Champions League final under Simone Inzaghi, after winning one of the most incredible Champions League semifinals against Barcelona over two legs. Last season's disappointments left a mark on this squad, not just for the humiliating 5-0 defeat in the final against PSG, but also for the Serie A title lost to Napoli in the last weeks of the season. The mentality of the players seemed much more similar to the ones that started the 2023-24 season after losing another Champions League final to Manchester City. Inter decided to rebound by focusing on the domestic league, and this season is no different. The Nerazzurri are at the top of the Serie A standings with a ten-point margin on their rivals, and will face AC Milan next week at San Siro for a crucial Derby della Madonnina that might put an end to the title race before it is too late. \nIronically, the shocking elimination against Bodo/Glimt might give them an extra boost of motivation for the final stretch of the Serie A season, knowing that reaching another Champions League final looked more complicated this season. Inter, and the other Italian teams, are not at the level of the English teams or the top European giants for multiple reasons. It's not just talent but also the financial wherewithal to secure that talent. Unlike them, they are kind of forced to think about one tournament at a time, and the ineffectiveness of last season proved it even more. \nInter will also need some of their top stars back at the top of their game. Players such as Nicolo Barella or Marcus Thuram looked lost, while Lautaro Martinez is recovering from a muscular injury suffered in the first leg in Norway. His comeback, alongside that of Denzel Dumfries, will be vital for their Serie A title ambitions. Meanwhile, there were some rumors coming from Spain about a possible pre-agreement between Inter and current Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone for the summer of 2026. Inter president Beppe Marotta spoke to Sky Italy and denied the rumours as \"fake news,\" but Chivu knows perfectly this is a strange world and winning the Serie A title will be the only way to cool the rumors down.\nBodo/Glimt have written their names into the books of history and now await a clash in the Round of 16 against either Sporting CP or Manchester City. It has been a month to remember for Norway in Italy: from Johannes Høsflot Klæbo's extraordinary six gold medals at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics to Bodo/Glimt becoming the first Norwegian side since 1987 to win a knockout tie in Europe's premier club competition. Norway will celebrate, and it's not over yet. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An outstanding six-year run for left tackle Trent Williams with the San Francisco 49ers could be in danger of coming to an end. With Williams set to carry a $39 million cap number in 2026, he and the 49ers are engaged in talks but are struggling to find a contractual solution to the sizable impact he will have on the team's payroll next season, according to ESPN. If the sides cannot find a middle ground, Williams could become a free agent this offseason.The 49ers want to keep their star tackle in town despite the reported stalemate, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. John Lynch, the team's general manager, effectively said as much Tuesday at the NFL Combine.\"In recent weeks, I've met with both Trent and with his agent, Vincent Taylor, and had really good, productive and substantive meetings,\" Lynch said. \"Here's what I know. Trent loves being a Niner. We love having Trent as a Niner. It's up to us to figure that out and to thread that needle.\"There's some unique circumstances in that we all know what Trent is as a player and how great of a player he's been. He's gonna be 38 years old, so there's some things that go into that. But I think we're all on the same page and feel very positively about where that's going.\"\n        \n            \n                Trent Williams landing spots: 49ers star would have plenty of suitors from Super Bowl contenders\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA release before June 1 would save the 49ers $4.7 million in cap space. If they were to release him after that date, they would save $15.5 million this year -- though that would require them to split his dead cap hit across the 2026 and 2027 seasons.\nWilliams, a five-time All-Pro honoree and 12-time Pro Bowler, would be among the most highly sought-after players of the 2026 free agent class. Even entering his age-38 season, the veteran tackle remains a premier blind-side protector with potentially multiple more years left in the tank. He said last offseason that he would \"love to play until I'm 40.\"The 49ers and Williams agreed in September 2024 to a restructured three-year deal that made him the NFL's highest-paid offensive lineman that season.One of the few accolades that Williams has left to add to his résumé is Super Bowl champion. Remaining with the 49ers should allow him to achieve that goal, but his significant cap hit could also limit San Francisco's ability to surround him with enough talent to contend in a loaded NFC West. The 49ers secured a wild-card berth in 2025 despite finishing third in the division at 12-5. With two Super Bowl appearances and a pair of conference championship game berths since 2019, the 49ers are knocking on the door of a title. Losing one of the NFL's best tackles without getting anything in return would be a significant blow in that quest.\nWilliams joined the 49ers in 2020 via a trade with the Washington Commanders. The former No. 4 overall pick spent the first decade of his career in Washington and was a perennial Pro Bowler. He took his game to the next level upon arriving on the West Coast, securing three consecutive first-team All-Pro honors and a second-team selection in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the eighth time in promotional history, the UFC will present a fight card on Saturday from Mexico City. And, for the fifth time since that relationship began, former two-time flyweight champion Brandon Moreno will be featured prominently on the card. Moreno (23-9-2), a native of Tijuana who now lives and trains out of Las Vegas, became the first Mexican-born champion in UFC history when he captured the promotion's 125-pound title by submitting Deiveson Figueiredo in 2021, which was their second of four title bouts against one another in the history of their exciting rivalry. The 32-year-old Moreno will look to return to title contention and bounce back from a December TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira when he headlines UFC Fight Night inside Arena CDMX in the proud nation's capitol city. Moreno, who will face late replacement Lone'er Kavanagh (9-1) will also be fighting with the plight of his people in mind following days of unrest throughout the country. On Sunday, the Mexican government announced the capturing and death of powerful cartel leader Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" which set off a wave of retaliatory violence in major cities. \n\"I was walking yesterday in the streets and I stopped to watch my cellphone at all the bad news around the country,\" Moreno told CBS Sports HQ on Monday. \"Right now, in Mexico City, things here are super calm. All of the disaster is more to the north like Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Actually, my [home] city has reports of some destruction on the streets in Tijuana, that's the northwest. Thank life and thank God, my family is fine and the people all around me are fine. \"It has been really hard hours for my Mexican people. It's weird, man. It's crazy because, right now, I'm super focused on my fight but, at the same time, I know that a lot of Mexican people are focused on this bad moment. Maybe [the UFC Fight Night event] can be a nice moment for the people to try to forget the bad moment and get some joy.\"\nThe site of Saturday's card, in central Mexico, is located more than a six-hour drive away from the center of the unrest in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where citizens and tourists have been told to shelter in place. The U.S. State Department declared Tuesday that the majority of areas outside of Jalisco have \"returned to normal\" and UFC Fight Night will go on as scheduled. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Robert Whittaker is ready for a change of scenery. The former middleweight champion is planning to cross the bridge to light heavyweight. Whittaker, 35, has long contemplated a move to 205 pounds. The 20-pound leap is significant, but Whittaker prefers risk to regret.\"I'm going to give it a go,\" Whittaker told Submission Radio.  \"I know a lot of naysayers, a lot of things on the Internet  saying 'small this, small that.' Shut up, dude. I want to give it a go.  I'm on the tail end of my career, so I got to try rather than just  thinking about what ifs.\" Light heavyweight gives him another chance at reinvention. Whittaker originally cut his teeth at welterweight, where he won the Australia vs. England spin-off of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" titled \"The Smashes.\" He had mixed success in the UFC before moving up to middleweight. Whittaker started his middleweight campaign at 8-0, capturing and defending the middleweight title in the process. Lately, he's unsure if middleweight is bringing the best out of him.\n\"I've  been playing with the idea for a long time,\" Whittaker said.  \"During  the break, I was training at a heavier weight. I want to lock  in and  move into this weight division. There's no doubt in my mind I  could  make middleweight. I can make it still, I can lose the weight,  but I  just don't know if I'm getting the best out of myself, having to  cut that  weight. The camp performance kind of really suffers on the  back end of a  weight car,d and a lot of fighters can testify that.\"  Whittaker is eyeing a June return in his new weight class. He needs time to acclimate to light heavyweight, especially coming off consecutive losses for the first time in more than a decade.\"I  want to give myself the appropriate amount of time to really get all  the gears going again,\" Whittaker said. \"Especially if I'm moving up to  205, I want to adjust to the weight. I want to perform at the weight. I  want to build some muscle, etc. I want to give myself like a decent leg  of work, like a good four months to prep and come in there at my best.\"\nWhittaker is one of the best middleweights of all time. He beat many of his contemporaries in prime, including Yoel Romero, Ronaldo \"Jacare\" Souza and Kelvin Gastelum. \"The Reaper\" is coming off a submission loss to Khamzat Chimaev and split decision loss to Reinier de Ridder.More UFC newsUFC 327 is taking shape.

Arsenal have opened a six-point lead on Manchester City in the EPL, so they'll still have a somewhat split focus, but this is their best chance yet at notching a UEFA Champions League title. Expect Mikel Arteta to dial in for these matchups and they should be well-rested thanks to the bye that comes with being a top-eight seed.Chelsea: Chelsea went 5-1-2 to finish sixth in Champions League play and avoid the knockout stage. They won their two UCL matches in the 2026 calendar year. Chelsea defeated Pafos, 1-0, on Jan. 21 and then Napoli, 3-2, on Jan. 28, with Joao Pedro scoring the final two goals of the match for the comeback win. He scored in the 61st minute to tie the score at 2, then scored the eventual winner in the 82nd minute. Chelsea won UCL titles in 2012 and 2021, and look to advance to their first quarterfinal since 2023. Pedro has dominated in Europe this season, leading the Premier League with 26 points. His 10 goals are also two more than any other player in the league, as he'll be an integral player in determining how far Chelsea advances in 2026 UCL brackets.

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons will not allow former No. 4 overall pick Kyle Pitts to hit free agency, placing the franchise tag on their star tight end.  Atlanta made Pitts the first NFL player to receive the tag this offseason shortly after new Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski was asked about the former Pro Bowler during the NFL Combine. While he didn't specifically discuss Pitts, Stefanski stressed how much he values his position. \"I love the position. I coached it. It was my first position to coach on the offensive staff, was tight ends there with the Vikings under coach (Mike) Zimmer,\" Stefanski told the assembled media. \"I love the position because of the versatility that it provides an offense. And you've seen it around the league. This is nothing new or earth-shattering, but tight ends that can line up all over make life hard on a defense. Whether you can line them up outside, in the backfield, in line, you name it, we love versatility at that position.\"Obviously, Kyle's somebody that we'll talk at length more about when it comes to those types of roster conversations, but the position itself is something that we feel really very strongly about.\"\nIt was expected Atlanta would place the franchise tag on Pitts as it works towards a new deal. The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.\nPitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. Pitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts was recently the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch with intentions to use a franchise or transition tag if a deal cannot be reached by March 3. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The week of the NFL combine is when news starts to pick up again. It proves the NFL has no real offseason, and the closest thing to it is the two weeks between the Super Bowl and combine week.One of the biggest pieces of news was Tuesday's report from ESPN's Adam Schefter that Trent Williams and the 49ers are attempting to resolve their contract differences. Williams is set to count nearly $39 million against the cap in 2026, the 16th-highest figure in the NFL and the fourth-highest among non-quarterbacks, only behind Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones, 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa and Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson.The 49ers want Williams to return, and the player's representation and the team remain in contact. GM John Lynch said Tuesday, \"I think we're on the right track.\" Still, it's no guarantee.Williams is 37 and entering the final year of a three-year, $82.6 million deal he renegotiated ahead of the 2024 season. He remains one of the NFL's premier offensive linemen, making his 12th Pro Bowl and fifth All-Pro team last year. Pro Football Focus graded him as the No. 3 tackle in the NFL. He is integral to everything the 49ers do.\nIf he were to leave, he'd have ample suitors eagerly awaiting. Williams would have his pick, too. He'd be a free agent, and at this stage in his career, all that's missing among his many accolades is a Super Bowl ring. With that in mind, here are five spots he could land if he does indeed leave San Francisco.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay PackersThe Packers are set to let starting left Rasheed Walker leave in free agency. A former seventh-round pick, Walker has risen to become a solid if unspectacular left tackle, and he has not missed a game the last three seasons. He's in for a significant payday in a few weeks' time.Williams would represent a tremendous win-now upgrade for a win-now operation. The Packers have been among the league's youngest teams for multiple years, and while that core has emerged to form a contender, it's still missing a few true stars. Williams would be one. Last year, Walker was PFF's No. 53 tackle, and he committed nine penalties; Williams, again, was the No. 3 tackle, and he committed just four penalties.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago BearsGoing from one NFC North team to another, the Bears have already shown a willingness to take big swings on their offensive line. Last offseason -- their first under Ben Johnson -- Chicago traded for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signed center Drew Dalman. Right tackle Darnell Wright has continued to improve.That leaves left tackle, where Braxton Jones entered the season as the starter but got hurt and was then benched and appeared in only six games. Ozzy Trapilo ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and will likely miss most of the year. Johnson showed last year he isn't afraid to make bold moves to upgrade Caleb Williams' surroundings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysYes, the Cowboys being on this list is almost a given considering their propensity for being in the news, and, yes, they have massive financial hurdles to overcome. But with plenty of restructuring opportunities ahead -- most notably Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb -- they will work their way out of the financial hole they're currently in.\nNow for the fit. Left tackle Tyler Guyton, a 2024 first-round pick, struggled mightily in 2025 and has not inspired a ton of confidence through two seasons. Right tackle Terence Steele is a cut candidate. Add in that Williams is from Texas and, again, that the Cowboys are the Cowboys, and Dallas has to at least be on the radar, no matter how unlikely it may seem.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Steelers show no signs of entering a rebuild, even though Mike Tomlin resigned this offseason and the team's starting quarterback if the season started today would be Mason Rudolph or Will Howard. Should Aaron Rodgers return and reunite with Mike McCarthy, Pittsburgh would again look like a reasonably high-floor, low-ceiling outfit.Williams could elevate that ceiling. He's still a very good mover in space, something that would serve Pittsburgh well given Rodgers' propensity to get the ball out quickly to running backs and tight ends. Pittsburgh's current left tackle, 2023 first-round pick Broderick Jones, missed six games last year and has been inconsistent when on the field.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Wild card: New England Patriots\"He's 22 years old. He's our left tackle,\" Mike Vrabel said of Will Campbell in the aftermath of the rookie's difficult postseason. \"He'll get better and get stronger. Moments where he played well ... there's plays he'd like to have back, but we're not moving Will to center or guard or tight end or anywhere else.\"Indeed, Campbell's struggles were on full display, especially in the Super Bowl. But he was also playing at less than 100% after midseason knee surgery. The No. 4 overall pick less than a year ago, Campbell played at a very solid level prior to the injury. One bad postseason -- as a rookie coming off an injury, no less -- doesn't mean he's doomed.On the other hand, Vrabel's comments came before a player like Williams was potentially available. New England has plenty to do to ensure it's not a one-and-done Super Bowl contender, and upgrading other parts of the offense is high up on that list. But New England has the budget to go big-game hunting, and Williams is a massive talent at a crucial position.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. men's national team's Johnny Cardoso scored his first-ever goal in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, his impactful strike serving as a go-ahead goal for Atletico Madrid in their 4-1 win over Club Brugge, the tie ending with Madrid winning 7-4 on aggregate.Cardoso's goal gave Atleti a 2-1 lead on the day and a 5-4 advantage on aggregate, putting the Spanish side ahead in the tie early in the second. The play began when Giuliano Simeone received the ball from Marc Pubill, Simeone then making his way down the left flank and sitting on the edge of the penalty area before whipping a cross towards the far post. Brugge's Brandon Mechele was on the receiving end and headed the ball away, which Cardoso ran towards outside the box.The midfielder first controlled the ball with his head and sent it to his feet before letting it take a bounce, finally hitting the ball as it came back up. His powerful strike sailed through traffic and past Brugge goalkeeper Simon Mignolet before landing in the back of the net.Watch the strike below.\nHis goal ensured the knockout tie would eventually tip fully in Atleti's favor, with Alexander Sorloth completing a hattrick in the final 15 minutes of play after scoring the game's opening goal in the 23rd minute.\nIt is both Cardoso's first goal in the Champions League and his first since joining Atleti in the summer, and comes at a very important juncture in his season. He has just 19 appearances for the Spanish club after dealing with a series of injuries but has regularly played in the new year, building match fitness as final preparation is underway for players and coaches alike ahead of the World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Cardoso is a USMNT hopeful with 22 caps, but just as injuries have disrupted the early months of his time with Atleti, he has been out of the national team fold for several months. He was last with the group during their run to the Concacaf Gold Cup final, but he played only 11 total minutes during the competition, all in the group stage, as fitness issues hampered his ability to take part in the rest of the tournament.Cardoso boosts World Cup chancesCardoso's uptick in form is the latest in a bundle of good news for USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino in recent weeks, with midfielder Tyler Adams and forward Ricardo Pepi recently making their way back to the pitch after sustaining injuries early this winter. It means that Pochettino will likely have his entire player pool available for selection ahead of March's friendlies against Belgium and Portugal, and the U.S.' final matches before the World Cup roster will be finalized in late May. Regular minutes at the club level are a prerequisite for Pochettino as he makes his squad selections, and for Cardoso, his playing time with Atleti will prove crucial as the countdown to the World Cup continues. For a young player who has been unlucky with injuries, his outings with Atleti will help him make his World Cup case, illuminating his strengths as a player and demonstrating a level of usefulness to the national team ahead of an all-important tournament.\nCardoso is not regarded for his passing ability, average at best amongst defensive midfielders in LaLiga. He makes up the difference in a handful of other categories, though – he handles the more rugged parts of the job well, ranking in the 93rd percentile for tackles and 96th when compared to other players in his position in Europe's top five leagues. Though his goalscoring abilities are a smaller part of his game, his attacking skills are also impressive for a deep-lying player; the combination of his skills was on full display against Brugge. The goal is the highlight of his performance, but he completed two recoveries before the final whistle, each of them important as Brugge chased an equalizer that never came.The 24-year-old, though, can be mistake-prone at times. He was the Atleti player marking Joel Ordonez's goal in the first half, a step behind the opponent as Pubill's attempted deflection landed on the Brugge player's head instead. Cardoso's poor passing ability was also on display in one of the USMNT's pre-Gold Cup friendlies against Turkiye, a potential foe in the World Cup group stage, providing a perfect opening for Arda Guler to score the equalizer before a 2-1 defeat for Pochettino's side.\nHe will need to work to cut that element out of his game as he reaches his peak years, perhaps resigning him to a spot on the USMNT's bench at the World Cup should he make the cut. It likely puts him behind Adams in the pecking order; the Bournemouth midfielder is essentially the U.S.'s longtime favored player in that position. Even during a few injury-filled years himself after the 2022 World Cup, no one has ever gotten close to filling Adams' void or trying to unseat him in the process. There is unlikely room for them to share the pitch, either – Cardoso and Adams have not started a match together since Pochettino took over, though the sample size is small considering both of them have been in and out of the squad through injury.\nPochettino's midfield continues to shift as the head coach experiments with his options, handing a wide variety of players a chance to impress in national team colors in his 16 months on the job. Cardoso has thrust his name into the conversation but he will have a few rivals for a limited number of roster spots, a list of names that includes the likes of Lyon's Tanner Tessman and the Vancouver Whitecaps' Sebastian Berhalter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Running back Breece Hall is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, but the New York Jets are adamant about keeping their top ballcarrier on the roster. If the sides cannot come to an agreement on a contract extension in the next week, general manager Darren Mougey said the Jets will use either a franchise tag or transition tag.Given the Jets' struggles last season and Hall's looming free agency, the four-year veteran was widely viewed as a prime candidate to be moved at the trade deadline. Instead, he stuck in New York and could be poised to play another year with the franchise that selected him with a second-round pick in 2022.\"The tags are an option,\" Mougey said at the NFL Combine. \"Ideally we'd find a way to get a deal done and keep Breece around. I think I've said that for the last year since I've got here. Breece is a good player. Want to find a way to keep him around. We've been going through that process and are still doing so. We have a week to find out -- if we can't get to an agreement -- which way we'll go with that tag.\"The deadline to use one of the tags is March 3. That gives the Jets one week to sign Hall to a new deal before paying $14.5 million on a franchise tag or $11.7 million on a transition tag.While a lack of team success throughout Hall's career leads to questions about whether the running back would be willing to re-sign with the Jets, Mougey said he believes there is mutual interest in sticking together. That suggests the sides could still get a deal done before March 3.\n\"I do get the sense that Breece wants to be here,\" Mougey said. \"We've had good conversations throughout the season, after the season. So just finding a way to do that.\"Hall would be among the NFL's top free agents if he hit the open market. Instead, signs point to him returning to the Meadowlands in some capacity. The most reasonable path to Hall landing on a different roster in 2026 is if the Jets use the transition tag on him, a running back-needy team extends an offer and New York declines to match.While the Jets have been mired in mediocrity since Hall's arrival in 2022, the Iowa State product remains a bright spot on the roster and one of the most valuable players around which New York could build. In the three years since a torn ACL halted a stellar rookie season, Hall has been a model of consistency, playing in all but two games and tallying at least 876 rushing yards and four touchdowns per season.\nHall is also among the most prolific receiving backs in the NFL. He is coming off his first 1,000-yard rushing season but did take a step backward as a receiver with 36 catches, 350 yards and one touchdown -- each representing personal lows for a full season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos are coming off one of the best seasons in franchise history. They went 14-3, surging past the Kansas City Chiefs to win the AFC West and earn the No. 1 seed in the conference before falling a game short of a Super Bowl appearance. Still, coach Sean Payton is making a major change for 2026 in hopes of sparking the offense. Payton revealed Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine that he is giving up play-calling duties to new offensive coordinator Davis Webb. Payton called Webb \"extremely talented,\" and said this decision is best for the team. \"It was something I kind of knew during the year. He and I visited on a handful of occasions. He's extremely talented. With regards to play-calling, I think he'll be really good at it,\" Payton said. In 2025, Denver's offense ranked 14th in scoring (23.6 points per game) and 10th in total offense (342.6 yards per game), while second-year signal-caller Bo Nix completed 63.4% of his passes for 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. At face value, those numbers are pretty solid, but there was a reason why Denver fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi last month. The Broncos made a habit of putting pressure on themselves with slow starts. In fact, Denver registered 12 comeback wins this past season -- an NFL record.\nIt was evident all year. The Broncos played with their food in the season opener against the lowly Tennessee Titans in a 20-12 victory, and then lost their next two games. In Week 5, the Broncos had to score 18 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, 21-17. Two weeks later, the Broncos came back from down 19-0 in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Giants, 33-32. According to CBS Sports Research, those 33 points were the most scored in a game in NFL history by a team that was being shut out entering the fourth quarter. Broncos fans were left wondering why their offense waited until the final 15 minutes to start playing.Payton struggled to get Nix and his offense into a rhythm. It's easy to criticize the quarterback whenever the offense can't stay on the field, but some of Payton's third-down play calls were questionable, including in critical situations. Look no further than Denver's controversial decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 in the first half of the AFC Championship game instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal in an eventual three-point loss. Payton called a bootleg or play-action pass that was doomed from the start. He said afterwards that he regretted the play call more than the decision to go for it. The other facet of this decision is the promotion of Webb, who clearly has already earned the trust of Payton and Nix. \nWho is Davis Webb?The 31-year-old Webb spent the past three years as the Broncos' quarterbacks coach. He served as the team's pass game coordinator in 2025 as well. A former NFL quarterback himself, Webb was selected in the third round in 2017 by the Giants. However, he played in just two NFL games before turning his attention to coaching. Webb has experienced a meteoric rise in the coaching world. He received head-coaching interest from the Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens this offseason. Webb could have found a job as an offensive coordinator for another team, but the Broncos promoted him following Lombardi's firing and are now giving him play-calling duties.Longtime NFL backup quarterback Chase Daniel, who played for Payton in 2017 with the New Orleans Saints, had high praise for Webb.\n\"I can't fathom Sean Payton ever giving up play calling knowing how he operates,\" Daniel wrote. \"And that should tell you everything you need to know about Davis Webb.\"Payton said just as much. \"I would only do that [give up calling plays] if I felt like it would help our team,\" Payton said. \"I'll still be involved with what we do offensively, just like what we do defensively. But I do think [Webb] has a gift. He's real sharp. I'm glad he's on our staff. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n            ",

Morris filed the suit in a Virginia state court after the NCAA denied his request for an eligibility waiver in January.The basis of Morris' waiver request was that he sustained injuries at TCU in 2022 and 2023, and he argued that he should have qualified for medical redshirts in both campaigns. Morris played four games in 2022 and seven games in 2023 after utilizing a redshirt in 2021. His 2020 season at Oklahoma did not count toward his eligibility clock because of a one-time waiver granted to all athletes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Morris stayed healthy each of the last two seasons and played full campaigns at North Texas and Virginia. He led the American conference in passing yards (3,774) and touchdowns (31) in 2024 and transitioned nicely to the ACC, where he guided Virginia to the first 11-win season in program history and a berth in the conference championship game.If the court grants Morris relief against the NCAA's eligibility rules, he could return to Virginia in search of College Football Playoff contention. The Cavaliers climbed as high as No. 14 in last season's CFP Top 25 rankings and would have secured an automatic berth into the bracket had they defeated Duke in the ACC title game.\nMorris's suit against the NCAA is the latest example of an athlete attempting to use the court system to gain additional eligibility. These cases have largely defined the early portion of the college football offseason, and athletes found mixed results.A Mississippi judge granted Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss a temporary injunction that will allow him to spend another season with the Rebels on the heels of a stellar debut campaign as one of the SEC's top signal-callers. Chambliss made a similar petition to Morris, stating that he was physically unable to compete in 2022 due to a respiratory condition.\nTennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, meanwhile, was denied injunctive relief in a ruling that served as a major victory for the NCAA. Aguilar's case was different from the others, as he argued that his years spent in junior college should not count against his NCAA eligibility clock. That was the argument former Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia used to gain an additional year in a landmark case last offseason.\n            \n",

Freshman Darryn Peterson can take over any game, but staying in those games has been a challenge as he's dealt with a series of minor injuries and cramping issues. The Jayhawks entered the weekend having won nine of their last 10, but were stunned at home by Cincinnati, a double-digit underdog, on Saturday. That showed their downside, but recent wins against Iowa State, BYU, Arizona and Texas Tech also prove that they'll be a dangerous team in March.Duke Blue Devils: Jon Scheyer's squad made the Final Four last season, but he had to replace his entire starting five after they all left for the NBA. Enter superstar freshman Cameron Boozer, who is averaging 22.8 points, 10.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. Duke is off to a 24-2 start and in the hunt for a No. 1 seed during March Madness with one of the most talented rosters in college basketball. Join the CBS Sports 2026 NCAA Men's Bracket Game here.\n2026 NCAA Tournament Women's teams to watchNow that you know where to play 2026 NCAA Women's Bracket Games, here are some teams to watch as the 2026 NCAA Tournament approaches: UCLA Bruins: Cori Chase's squad made the Final Four for the first time in program history last season and are cementing their status as a contender in 2026.

    "body": "\n        There are lots of ways to score points, but usually quarterback play, offensive line strength and dynamic playmakers are essential to building an explosive offense in college football. Indiana featured all three last year, riding the nation's No. 3 scoring offense all the way to a historic College Football Playoff National Championship. They weren't alone, though, with seven CFP teams ranking No. 32 or better in points per game in 2025. So while it's not a guarantee of success, fielding an offense that can score points at will provides a definitive advantage and a leg up in a landscape growing more competitive by the day. Coming out of the 2026 recruiting and transfer portal cycle, some teams appear better equipped than others to light up the scoreboard next season.Here's a projection of which college football teams could field the most explosive offenses in 2026:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. TexasTexas added Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman along with running backs Hollywood Smothers (NC State) and Raleek Brown (Arizona State) to help reshape the offense for 2026. The Longhorns won bidding battles for Coleman and Smothers, who combined for 12 touchdowns at their previous stops last season.Arch Manning is coming off the best outing of his career after outdueling Michigan's Bryce Underwood in the Citrus Bowl, a postseason showing that mirrored the second-half surge that accelerated his development. If Manning takes another step, this Texas offense could rival the best of the Sarkisian era on the Forty Acres -- a stretch that already includes consecutive CFP semifinal appearances.Like other elite programs that are a grenade-pin pull away from another level in 2026, everything starts up front for Texas. The Longhorns have reloaded with a bevy of highly rated portal additions who will flourish only if Manning has time to operate. If Texas controls the line of scrimmage, the pieces are in place for this SEC power to stress opposing defenses behind elite play-caller Steve Sarkisian and a rising star at quarterback.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. MiamiAssuming the Hurricanes overcome the loss of four impact starters along the offensive line, Miami should continue generating explosive plays and scoring at a rapid pace next fall. The arrival of Duke transfer quarterback Darian Mensah -- along with his top target Cooper Barkate and former South Carolina slot receiver Vandrevius Jacobs -- gives Shannon Dawson flexibility and eases the burden on Malachi Toney.Targeted heavily down the stretch of his freshman season, Toney set a single-season program record with 109 receptions.Veteran running backs Mark Fletcher Jr. and Jordan Lyle also return. Three of Fletcher's six 100-yard performances came over the final four games, when Lyle was limited by injury.\nProjecting ahead, Mario Cristobal's likely starting offensive line could include Matthew McCoy, Samson Okunlola, SJ Alofaituli, Jamal Meriweather and five-star freshman tackle Jackson Cantwell -- the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2026 class. If that group controls the line of scrimmage the way Miami did in 2025, the Hurricanes could be borderline unstoppable offensively.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. IndianaAfter leading the Big Ten in scoring offense each of the past two seasons, expectations may be bordering on unrealistic entering Curt Cignetti's third year. Fresh off a national championship, Indiana must replace a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, its top two running backs, leading receivers Elijah Sarratt and Omar Cooper Jr., and three offensive line starters.Few programs, however, are better positioned to absorb that level of change. Indiana's recent success has been driven by player development and precise scheme execution.\nCignetti has tabbed TCU transfer Josh Hoover as the replacement for Fernando Mendoza. Boston College transfer Turbo Richard adds explosiveness to the run game, while Michigan State's Nick Marsh and Tulane's Shazz Preston join Charlie Becker to reshape the receiving corps.The mentality up front is not expected to change. Whether the Hoosiers maintain their edge -- and the offensive efficiency that has defined this run -- will be determined quickly at the line of scrimmage.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Ohio StateRyan Day's decision to hire former NFL coach Arthur Smith as offensive coordinator has drawn mixed reviews, much of which is tied to Smith's results at the professional level. The college game presents a different equation, however, particularly when elite programs can overwhelm opponents with superior talent. That setting could allow Smith to thrive.\nAt Ohio State, Smith is expected to employ a streamlined, run-oriented approach while creating calculated downfield opportunities for Jeremiah Smith and others. Quarterback Julian Sayin ranked among the nation's most efficient passers as a redshirt freshman, and a significant leap is anticipated from the Heisman hopeful.Despite transfer portal losses at wide receiver, the Buckeyes remain loaded at the position, highlighted by the additions of five-star prospects Chris Henry Jr. and Jerquaden Guilford. Smith, Devin McCuin and Brandon Innis are projected starters, with Bo Jackson back at tailback.Solidifying the offensive line rotation looms as a key offseason priority. Day has emphasized the need to play at least eight linemen with positional versatility, underscoring the importance of depth and flexibility up front.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. OregonNo program in the country owns a better quarterback situation than the Ducks after Dante Moore's decision to skip the 2026 NFL Draft and return to school. Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola is behind him, along with a couple of guys the coaching staff feels great about in Akili Smith Jr. and Brock Thomas. As freshmen last season, Jordon Davison and Dierre Hill Jr. showed out in the backfield and are anxious to take on featured roles. The biggest loss on offense is tight end Kenyon Sadiq -- a projected first-rounder. Jamari Johnson will get the first crack at matching his production at the position. Dakorien Moore, Jeremiah McClellan and Evan Stewart return as featured options at wideout. There might be slight statistical drop off with elite offensive coordinator Will Stein taking over at Kentucky, but Oregon has proved annually under Dan Lanning that this offense is a tough one to contain.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Notre DameThere will be no Jeremiyah Love or Jadarian Price to rescue the offense when needed next season, but Fighting Irish offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock has little reason to panic. After losing the first two starts of his career, C.J. Carr responded with 10 consecutive wins, finishing with 2,741 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was tied for No. 2 in the country in yards per attempt (9.4) and fifth in passer rating (168.06).\nAneyas Williams is expected to receive the first reps at running back, though Notre Dame could opt for a committee approach in 2026.Ohio State transfers Mylan Graham and Quincy Porter join a talented group of pass-catchers that includes Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison, who led the team in receptions and receiving yards as a junior.And if there is one position group Notre Dame rarely worries about, it is the offensive line. The Fighting Irish are consistently well-coached up front and typically set the tone in the trenches. With a favorable schedule ahead, this offense should post significant numbers throughout 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. LSUWhen you assemble the nation's top-ranked transfer portal class and commit every available resource to making Year 1 under Lane Kiffin a success, the expectation is immediate production.In addition to landing former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt, Kiffin added USC signal-caller Husan Longstreet and overhauled LSU's wide receiver room with 12 newcomers. The offensive line also projects as a major strength, anchored by five-star Colorado transfer Jordan Seaton. That unit must improve after uneven play last fall, when the Tigers struggled at times to protect Garrett Nussmeier and failed to meet lofty preseason expectations.Tight end Trey'Dez Green returns as a proven playmaker, and Harlem Berry -- the No. 1 running back in the 2025 recruiting cycle -- opted to remain with the program to see what Kiffin and his staff can build.\nKiffin engineered a rapid offensive turnaround at Ole Miss with tempo and efficiency. He will attempt to replicate that formula in Baton Rouge after bringing offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and several assistants with him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Texas TechTexas Tech's CFP shutout loss to Oregon left a bitter taste inside the program, a stark offensive failure that set the offseason narrative. Coach Joey McGuire quickly identified and addressed his offensive needs needs during this transfer portal cycle, adding Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby and four wide receivers, including two from Power Four programs. Another strong portal class positions Texas Tech to compete for a Big 12 championship and a playoff berth -- provided the offense performs at a high level, especially given personnel losses on defense. In 2025, the Red Raiders often leaned on their defense to make plays, a luxury they may not have next fall.Optimism rests partly on a talented backfield anchored by returning contributors Cameron Dickey, J'Koby Williams and Quinten Joyner, who will be counted on to lift the offense next season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Ole MissWith quarterback Trinidad Chambliss receiving an injunction to play a sixth season, the Rebels look like a juggernaut in 2026. Auburn transfer Deuce Knight was once an insurance policy, set to take over under center if Chambliss' court challenge fell through. Now he'll be a luxury. Retaining college football's most potent running back also helps after Kewan Lacy stiff-armed the pursuit from LSU and Kiffin to stay with the Rebels. He's a 1,400-yard rusher who scored an SEC-leading 23 touchdowns last fall.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Oklahoma StateEric Morris fielded the nation's top total offense (512 yards per game) and scoring average (45.1 points) at North Texas last year. Transitioning from the Group of Six to the Power Four presents a new challenge, but Morris's system is proven -- and he persuaded his two best North Texas players to follow him.Oklahoma State could emerge as college football's most-improved team thanks to Morris and a top-10 transfer class, highlighted by quarterback Drew Mestemaker and tailback Caleb Hawkins. The Cowboys are poised for multiple high-scoring Big 12 shootouts, with plenty of fireworks and eye-popping numbers expected from their all-conference-caliber offensive talent.\n            ",

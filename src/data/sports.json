    "body": "\n        The No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers will begin their College Football Playoff journey when they face the No. 9 Alabama Crimson Tide on Thursday. This 2026 Rose Bowl matchup is the second of the CFP quarterfinals, as the two programs will face off for the first time ever. Indiana (13-0) is the only undefeated team left standing, is coming off a 13-10 victory over Ohio State in the Big Ten title game and boasts the Heisman winner in Fernando Mendoza. Alabama (11-3) knocked off Oklahoma, 34-24, in the CFP First Round after dropping the SEC Championship Game to Georgia. The winner will advance to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. This will be IU's first game in program history as the AP No. 1 team. The Hoosiers are 7.5-point favorites in the latest Indiana vs. Alabama odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 47.5. IU is at -260 on the money line (risk $260 to win $100), while Bama is priced at +211 (risk $100 to win $211).

The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner. With two prolific offenses, 50 combined points are projected as the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Alabama vs. Indiana, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Indiana vs. Alabama spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

The Hurricanes rushed out to a 14-0 lead, then withstood a second-half rally to pick up a 24-14 win and earn a spot in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal. There the 'Canes will face off against No. 6 Ole Miss. The Rebels stunned No. 3 Georgia on a late walk-off field goal to pull off a 39-34 win in one of the best games in CFP history. Styles make fights and Maimi-Ole Miss certainly stacks up as a clash of different approaches. On one side, the Hurricanes are built to win at the line of scrimmage with a dominant offensive and defensive line. While the Rebels aren't goncg to concede the trenches, they clearly revolve around dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who willed them to a win over Georgia in the quarterfinals.On the other side of the bracket, No. 5 Oregon flexed its muscles in a 23-0 victory over  No. 4 Texas Tech. The much-hyped Red Raiders defense held its own, but it was the Ducks who stole the show on that side of the ball, recording a shutout and picking up a convincing win. But the quarterfinals' most convincing victory belonged to No. 1 Indiana. The Hoosiers dismantled No. 9 Alabama 38-3, leaving no doubt on their way to a semifinal rematch with the Ducks in the Peach Bowl. These two teams met on Oct. 11, with the Hoosiers taking home a 30-20 victory that announced Indiana as a true national title contender in 2025. Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson was benched in the second half against No. 1 Indiana in the No. 9 Crimson Tide's 38-3 loss in the Rose Bowl on Thursday. Backup Crimson Tide quarterback Austin Mack entered the College Football Playoff quarterfinal in Simpson's place with Alabama trailing 24-0 in the third quarter. Simpson took a big hit in the first half while trying to extend for a first down and has been grimacing while throwing the ball. He tried to come back and play in the second half. The hit was on Simpson's lower back and led to a fumble, which the Hoosiers converted into points. However, Simpson has struggled to create explosive plays during a heavyweight battle with the Hoosiers. The junior completed 12-of-16 passes for 67 yards and added 17 yards on the ground, but was held without a score in his snaps. \"Ty had an injury, obviously, and he really wanted to try to go out there,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said after the game. \"And we treated him there at halftime. He gave it a series.\n\"I know he feels like he let down the team, and there's no way that that's the case. He went out there, tried to battle. That's who he is, so I'm never going to let that be a thing where he let us down in any way. So making sure he knows that.\"Mack came off the bench and played good snaps in relief of Simpson, including leading the Crimson Tide's lone field goal drive. The California native completed 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards, but was also sacked multiple times in the loss. Mack's three drives averaged nearly eight plays per drive compared to only five for Simpson's drives. Alabama scored only three points in their loss to the Hoosiers, failing to reach multiple scores for the second time in three games. The Crimson Tide finished the year losing three of their final six games, including losing three of four against ranked opponents. \nAfter the win, No. 1 Indiana heads to face No. 5 Oregon at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are the final remaining undefeated team in college football, and hope to become the first 16-0 team in major college history. \n            \n    ",

After a dominant win over Tulane in the first round, the Rebels stunned Georgia 39-34 thanks to a late field goal drive from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss to reach the CFP semifinals against Miami. Pete Golding, who took over after Lane Kiffin departed for LSU, is now 2-0 as a the Rebels' coach with both of those victories coming in the CFP. Yet Kiffin still has a strong rooting interest in his former team.Despite Kiffin no longer being with the program, he still benefits financially from the Rebels' playoff win. That's because, as part of the agreement of Kiffin leaving Ole Miss before its CFP run, LSU agreed to pay his playoff bonuses if the Rebels kept advancing.That means that Kiffin earned $250,000 from LSU on New Year's Day thanks to the Rebels win over Georgia. That comes in addition to the $250,000 he made on their win over Tulane in the first round for a cool $500,000 payday. If Ole Miss wins the national title, Kiffin could earn up to $1 million.\n\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin's return to Ole Miss with LSU set for September 2026 as SEC releases complete football schedule\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe former Ole Miss coach signed a seven-year deal worth $91 million in Baton Rouge, which comes with opportunities to earn more via incentives, according to records obtained by The Advocate. Before incentives, Kiffin will make $13 million per year. One of the escalators in Kiffin's contract requires a raise to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship, according to the Advocate.\n            \n    ",

Then, on New Year's Day, Oregon put out one of the best defensive performances of the season as it blanked Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. Next, we found out why Indiana was the unquestioned No. 1 team entering this tournament as Curt Cignetti's Hoosiers demolished Alabama. Finally, in one of the best games of the year, Ole Miss rallied to stun Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Now, we move on to the semifinals where Miami will clash with Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, while Indiana and Oregon will take part in a rematch from their game earlier this season in the Peach Bowl. Below you can stay updated with the College Football Playoff schedule as we move onto the semifinal round. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss vs. (10) Miami: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasOrange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New Orleans\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Florida — The smell of sweat and cigar smoke permeated through the Oregon locker room and there was a feeling of satisfaction for a Ducks team that had just punched its first ticket to the College Football Playoff semifinals in more than a decade. Though the 23-0 shutout win against Texas Tech was far from perfect, it was a statement victory that answered some concerns and affirmed some of the programs core principles under Dan Lanning. Junior linebacker Matayo Uiagalelei was a little bit frustrated he hadn't been able to score on his strip sack of Behren Morton in the third quarter, one of four turnovers forced by Oregon's defense that led to 13 of the Ducks' points, but as he sat in his locker after the game he was happy to have set up the offense with an easy touchdown on the next play. Those forced turnovers are part of an aggressiveness that the defense, and the team in general, carry into every single game. \"We talk about it all the time, one of the deciding factors in the game is the turnover margin,\" Uiagalelei said, reflecting on the play. \"So getting the ball and keeping the ball when you have it is one of the keys to the game.\" The aggressiveness to attack the ball and make plays on defense is matched by an aggressiveness on offense that includes the strategic use of tempo but also some risk-taking when it comes to fourth downs. Dan Lanning has had fourth down decision-making as a storyline throughout his young coaching career, and in one of the biggest games since he took over the Ducks' program he chose to go for it on fourth down eight times. \nPrior to Thursday's showdown with Texas Tech, Oregon had gone for it on fourth down just 22 times in 13 games. Now that doesn't suggest that the Ducks were not aggressive before, because as one of the top offenses in the country there isn't always a decision to be made when it comes to fourth downs. But against the Red Raiders and their ferocious defensive front, Oregon failed to convert on third down as often as they usually do and therefore faced more tough decisions. The successful conversions didn't always lead to points, but they extended drives to keep the ball out of the hands of Texas Tech's offense while also adding snaps of wear and tear for the opposing defense. One of those successful conversions came on a fake punt near midfield, where a unique formation spread out Texas Tech's punt return unit and allowed linebacker Teitum Tuioti to get free as a pass catcher. Tuioti said after the game he thinks it was his reception in a game since high school, but clearly he was prepared for the moment to pull in the toss from James Ferguson-Reynolds. \n\"I think that's our mindset,\" Lanning said of the decisions to go for it on fourth down. \"We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. And [we] just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\"For Lanning and Oregon, the commitment to aggressiveness allows his players to play free. If the messaging was mixed or if the decisions were not consistent, there would be a human nature to allow doubt to creep in when plays like the fake punt or key fourth decisions are called. Because while Oregon went for it on fourth down on eight different occasions the Ducks also failed to convert four times, including a fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line. But instead of letting those failures deflate the team, the defense jumped right back on the field with the intention to attack and get the ball right back. \"I'm grateful that Coach Lanning is aggressive and that he takes his shots,\" Tuioti said after the game. \"But we understand that if it doesn't go that way we are ready to put out the fire. That's what we do, we've got to get the ball back to our offense and that's our main job.\" \nThat's how four turnovers lead to 13 points and Oregon was able to bury Texas Tech in its biggest deficit of the season before the end of the third quarter. This was an Oregon defense that had something to prove after allowing James Madison to score 34 points and amass 509 yards in the College Football Playoff's first round. The Ducks were never in danger of losing the game thanks to an outstanding offensive start, but the leaders of the defense knew that wasn't their standard. Linebacker Bryce Boettcher acknowledged in a conversation on CBS Sports HQ after the game that all the hype and buzz around Texas Tech's defense did create a little bit of an edge for the Ducks as they looked to not only right their wrongs from the opening round but prove that they were just as much of a group that could win the game as their opponents from Lubbock. So now Oregon advances to the College Football Playoff semifinals and the Peach Bowl, set to face either Indiana or Alabama. It's the first time the Ducks have been in the CFP semifinals since finishing as national runner-up in 2014-15 and now in this year's tournament have logged two wins against conference champions. Beating Texas Tech was arguably the biggest win for the program since last year's Big Ten Championship Game against Penn State (another win that warranted firing up postgame cigars), but there is so much more work to be done for this Oregon team to accomplish its ultimate goal of a national championship. \nThat game, by the way, would be back here in Hard Rock Stadium on Jan. 19. And the fact that Oregon pitched a shutout win on the same field where the Ducks could ultimately claim the school's first national championship was not lost on some. \"This place was amazing, and we want to be back,\" Tuioti said. \"So we have to make sure we handle business and win.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman is joining the Miami Dolphins as a consultant in their search for a new general manager, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports. While it's not a permanent role with the organization, Aikman will serve in an \"advisory capacity\" and assist in helping the franchise find a new leader for the team's front office. Aikman, 59, works as an analyst for ESPN's broadcast of \"Monday Night Football.\" Aikman, who won three Super Bowls as the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, has worked as an NFL color analyst for nearly 25 years, and the Dolphins valued his league-wide insights, per Jones. \nThe Dolphins fired GM Chris Grier in October after almost a decade as the team's top personnel man. The move to fire Grier came after a 2-7 start, but Miami owner Stephen Ross opted to keep coach Mike McDaniel. The Dolphins are 5-2 since and sit at 7-9 entering Sunday's season finale against the New England Patriots while dealing with an uncertain future at the quarterback position after the benching of Tua Tagovailoa.Grier had been with the Dolphins since 2010 and became general manager in 2016. Champ Kelly has been serving as the team's interim GM since Grier's firing. McDaniel is in his fourth season as coach and holds a 35-32 record over that span. He led the Dolphins to the postseason in his first two seasons but will finish with consecutive losing seasons after going 8-9 last year. \nAikman said during a recent appearance on the Sports Business Radio Podcast that a front-office role is something he could entertain down the road.\"Will it come along at some point? Maybe, I doubt it, but maybe,\" Aikman said last month. \"As I've often said, if it doesn't…there will be a part of me that always wonders as to whether or not I could have done the job. I'd like to think I could and would be good at it. But unless you do it, it's just talk.\"Aikman acknowledged the learning curve would be steep with a career move like that.\n\"I'm not opposed to hard work…it's not so much the hours that would be involved, it's more about at my age currently, there would be a learning curve,\" Aikman said. \"Would an organization be willing to allow that to happen? It's a young man's game, it's a young man's world.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18, and they're going to have their quarterback back in the lineup. Lamar Jackson, who has been dealing with a back contusion, will play in the battle for the AFC North crown, he confirmed to reporters Thursday.\nJackson suffered the injury when he got kneed in the back in Week 16 against the New England Patriots and then missed Week 17 against the Green Bay Packers but was a full participant in both Wednesday's and Thursday's practices. He's on track to have his first full week of practice in nearly two months.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson \"looked good\" at practice on Wednesday. On Thursday, Jackson said he \"feels great.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game the Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Packers.\n\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.After Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England. Furthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh.\nBut the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the final non-College Football Playoff bowl games of the 2025 season will take place on Friday night in Charlotte when Mississippi State faces Wake Forest in the Duke's Mayo Bowl. Jan. 2 will feature four bowl games (Mayo, Armed Forces, Liberty and Holiday) to close out bowl season. Despite going 5-7 in the regular season, Mississippi State received a bowl game invite due to its high Academic Progress Rate (APR). With other teams opting out of bowl games, it paved the way for the Bulldogs to play an additional game, despite not clearing the six-win mark typically needed to become bowl-eligible. The Bulldogs lost their final three SEC games, with the lone win against a conference opponent coming against Arkansas earlier in the year. Wake Forest went 8-4 in Year 1 of the Jake Dickert era. The Demon Deacons went 6-2 down the stretch after starting 2-2 with losses to Georgia Tech and NC State. With a win, Wake Forest can reach the nine-win mark for the first time since 2021. \n Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest: Need to know for Duke's Mayo Bowl Year 2 of the Jeff Lebby era could end in style: In Year 1 of his tenure at Mississippi State, Lebby led his team to a 2-10 record. The Bulldogs opened the 2024 campaign with a win over Eastern Kentucky but lost 10 of their final 11 games to finish with just two wins. Mississippi State also went winless (0-8) against SEC opponents. This season was a clear sign of growth despite the record. Mississippi State recorded a dramatic win over Arizona State earlier in the year and beat Arkansas for Lebby's first SEC win at the school. A win over Wake Forest can bring positive momentum into 2026. Dickert has Wake Forest back on track: After recording back-to-back seasons with four wins, Wake Forest got back on track this season by doubling its win total. After former coach Dave Clawson resigned at the conclusion of last season, the program hired Dickert away from his post at Washington State. The results from Year 1 of his tenure have been overwhelmingly positive. The program is on the verge of finishing with nine wins for just the third time since 2007. Another look at Mississippi State's Kamario Taylor: Taylor, a four-star prospect from the 2025 recruiting cycle, made his first career start in the Egg Bowl against Ole Miss. Taylor finished that game 15-of-31 for 178 yards and ran 20 times for 173 yards and two touchdowns. The bowl game will be another huge opportunity for him to show why he could be the future answer at quarterback for Lebby's team. \n Where to watch Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest live Date: Friday, Jan. 2 | Time: 8 p.m. ET Location: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North Carolina TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest prediction, picks\nMississippi State might've found its long-term answer at quarterback in Taylor. This bowl game will be another opportunity for him to showcase his dynamic ability as a dual-threat. Although Wake Forest is on the verge of reaching the nine-win mark for the third time since 2007, I expect Mississippi State to get it done. The Bulldogs win by a touchdown to close out the bowl season. Pick: Mississippi State -3.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chip Patterson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brandon Marcello\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    John Talty\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Richard Johnson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Shehan Jeyarajah\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brad Crawford\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chris Hummer\n                            \n            MSU -3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miss.

    "body": "\n        What's one more rematch in the College Football Playoff? After seeing two in the first round of the tournament, we get a third as No. 1 Indiana and No. 4 Oregon will meet in the Peach Bowl semifinal on Friday, Jan. 9 in Atlanta. Indiana won the first meeting, going on the road to beat Oregon 30-20 at Autzen Stadium in one of the biggest games of the regular season. It was also a moment when the country took notice of Indiana and recognized that while last year's team was never able to break through against elite competition, this year's team might just be a little different.It's a big game for the Big Ten as well. This meeting marks the third time in the last four seasons that the Big Ten has had two schools in the semifinals, and it also means the Big Ten will have a team in the championship game for the third straight season, giving it a shot to win its third straight national title with a third different team.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about IndianaIn a sport not known for having Cinderella stories, the Indiana Hoosiers are the closest thing you're going to get. A program with no positive football history to speak of, they burst onto the scene last year with a brash, mostly unknown coach named Curt Cignetti. Cignetti led Indiana to an 11-2 record last season that ended with a College Football Playoff loss to the same Notre Dame team that would lose to Ohio State in the national championship.\nMost discounted Indiana's ability to pull off an encore in 2025, but this year's Hoosiers team was even better. The addition of Cal transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza helped take the offense to another level, which resulted in Indiana going 13-0 during the regular season and winning the Big Ten with a 13-10 win over Ohio State. It also resulted in a Heisman Trophy for Mendoza, the first in program history.Still, not even those accolades quieted all the doubters, but you won't hear from them as often after Indiana crushed Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl. Blowout victories have been nothing new for this Indiana team. Nine of the team's 14 wins this season have come by at least 20 points, with seven coming by 30 or more. That's what happens when you combine an explosive offense with a bone-crushing defense.\n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about OregonThe Ducks did not enjoy their postseason last year. After running through their first Big Ten campaign with an undefeated record and winning the conference, they had their doors blown off in the Rose Bowl by an Ohio State team they beat in the regular season. There has been no such postseason letdown this year.Oregon took care of the upstart James Madison 51-34 in the first round of the College Football Playoff and followed that performance with a 23-0 shutout victory over Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl a week ago. Those were their first wins in the playoff since the inaugural edition in 2014 when they beat Florida State.However, if you haven't paid much attention to college football since then, these Ducks may not look like the ones you're thinking of. This is not a high-flying, up-tempo offense that's trying to run 100 plays and score 60 points every game. While it certainly has that offensive potential, Dan Lanning's Oregon squad is built along the lines of scrimmage and more closely resembles the Georgia teams where Lanning was a defensive coordinator.\nOn offense, the team is led by QB Dante Moore, who could be a first-round pick in the NFL Draft this spring. Still, while Moore is talented and has plenty of excellent receiving options at his disposal, Oregon has been reliant on its run game in the second half of the season -- and as the ground game goes, so go the Ducks. It found plenty of space to maneuver against James Madison, and the Ducks scored 51 points. It struggled against Tech, and Oregon struggled to score touchdowns.What didn't struggle is the defense. Oregon's unit may not be full of the household names and obvious first-round picks, but there aren't many defenses in the country that do a better job of taking away big plays and forcing you to put together long, arduous drives to put points on the board. Every yard you gain against this unit feels like five.Peach Bowl odds, predictionThey say it's hard to beat the same team twice during the regular season, yet we've seen it happen already in this College Football Playoff. Indiana beat Oregon 30-20 earlier this season in Oregon's own building. This meeting will be at a neutral site, and given the struggles of Oregon's offense against Texas Tech, I'm not overly confident they'll figure things out against another really good defense. I'm taking Indiana this time, too. Pick: Indiana -4.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Historically, it's hard to find a more stark contrast in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals than you'll see in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal. No. 9 Alabama has a strong argument as the most successful college football program of all time, ranking high in all-time wins, national titles, Heisman winners, bowl wins and conference titles. On the other side, you have Indiana, outside the top 100 in all-time wins and fresh off its first outright conference title since 1945. Alabama is coming off a dramatic first-round CFP win against Oklahoma. The Crimson Tide trailed by 17 points in the first half before rallying for a 34-24 victory, becoming the first team to win a road game in the 12-team CFP format.Indiana is making its second consecutive CFP appearance and will play in the quarterfinals for the first time in program history. The Hoosiers lost to Notre Dame in the first round last season but went 13-0 this year and defeated Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game to earn the Rose Bowl berth.With inclement weather conditions expected at the 2026 Rose Bowl, a rarity for this legendary game, anything is on the table. \nFollow along with live updates and analysis as Indiana faces Alabama in the 2026 Rose Bowl Game. Where to watch Alabama vs. Indiana liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Indiana: Players to watch in Rose BowlTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Simpson is coming off one of his strongest performances in weeks after leading Alabama to a dramatic win over Oklahoma. He completed 19 of 29 passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide erased a 17-point first-half deficit. Simpson enters the Rose Bowl having thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns against five interceptions. For Alabama to pull the upset, the offense will need him at his best.\nRyan Williams, WR, Alabama: Williams has been one of the more puzzling players in college football this season. After a standout freshman campaign, his production has been inconsistent. He has recorded two receptions or fewer in each of his past four games, including a one-catch, five-yard outing against Oklahoma. The Rose Bowl would be an ideal stage for Williams to rediscover his big-play form.Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has been one of Alabama's most reliable defenders this season. He finished with five tackles against Oklahoma in the CFP first round. On the year, Hubbard has totaled 66 tackles (40 solo), three forced fumbles and four interceptions. Alabama's defense will be under the spotlight against Indiana's potent offense.Fernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: Mendoza transferred from Cal this offseason and immediately elevated Indiana's offense. In 13 games, he completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Known for his accuracy, Mendoza threw for 222 yards and a touchdown against Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, a performance that effectively sealed the Heisman Trophy.\nOmar Cooper Jr., WR, Indiana: Indiana features multiple receivers capable of stretching the field, and Cooper has been the most productive. He leads the team with 58 receptions and 804 receiving yards and finished second with 11 touchdown catches, trailing only Elijah Sarratt.Rolijah Hardy, LB, Indiana: Indiana ranked second nationally in total yards allowed and points per game, and Hardy has been a central figure in that success. He leads the Hoosiers with 87 tackles and eight sacks and has added four pass breakups this season.Alabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nLast year, the Rose Bowl produced one of the biggest shockers of the entire football season. No. 1 seed Oregon was stunned by Ohio State after finishing the regular season with a perfect record. Not saying that will happen, but I expect this game to be competitive. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has proven he can lead his respective teams to wins over ranked opponents. Indiana wins, but this will be a one-score game throughout. Pick: Alabama +6.5 (-102) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Before the 2025 season, Texas Tech's megaboosters came together and decided to pull off a once-in-a-lifetime gamble. The Red Raiders invested heavily in a stacked transfer class, and by extension delivered the greatest season in program history. The magical campaign ended with a thud on Thursday in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. The Red Raiders lost a 23-0 slugfest against No. 5 Oregon in the Orange Bowl as their top-rated offense ground to a halt. Texas Tech made a calculated decision to stick with incumbent quarterback Behren Morton instead of paying top dollar for a transfer. Morton was a multi-year starter in the program and the staff opted to surround him with some better playmakers, including Miami (OH) transfer receiver Reggie Virgil. However, Morton was putrid in the Red Raiders' final game against Oregon. From the opening snap, Morton looked out of sorts. He threw two terrible interceptions and ran into multiple sacks, ultimately finishing with only 137 yards passing, one of the worst games of his career. \nThe Red Raiders' strategy was aided by their confidence in backup quarterback Will Hammond, who they see as a future star in Lubbock. However, Hammond tore his ACL in the second half of the season, leaving Wake Forest transfer Mitch Griffis as the only scholarship quarterback on the roster behind Morton. With a quarterback like Duke's Darian Mensah in the program instead of Morton, could it have swung a title shot? However, it was a historic moment from the Red Raiders. The program had not won an outright conference championship since 1955, or posted 10 wins in a year since 2008. They had not won a Big 12 title of any type since the league was formed in 1996. \nThe defense held its own as one of the best units in college football. Linebacker Jacob Rodriguez finished top-five in Heisman Trophy voting, and edge rusher David Bailey put incredible production on tape in the loss to Oregon. Regardless of the outcome, the unit will go down in the Red Raiders record books. Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire told CBS Sports before the season that the goal was to reach the Big 12 Championship Game for the first time. Anything from there was a bonus. The season ends as a success, but now a pivotal offseason begins with major questions circling around the Red Raiders. \n        \n            \n                West Texas boom: Inside Texas Tech's bold all-in bet on NIL and the billionaire landman responsible\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFocus shifts to offenseTexas Tech is expected to turn to the transfer portal once more to discover and develop a new generation of defensive playmakers. But with the level of talent going out the door, there's almost no pathway for the defense to replicate its historic season. Instead, the offense becomes the new priority. \nMorton graduates after three years leading the program, leaving a vacancy at the position. The staff has been incredibly high on redshirt freshman Will Hammond, who came off the bench to lead a second-half run in the win against Utah, but Hammond tore his ACL and could miss the start of the 2026 season. With Hammond sidelined for a while, the Red Raiders are expected to look to the transfer portal for a quarterback. Some early reports have connected Texas Tech to Cincinnati transfer Brendan Sorsby, rated the No. 1 transfer in college football. However, Sorsby is receiving significant interest. Arizona State's Sam Leavitt, Nebraska's Dylan Raiola and Iowa State's Rocco Becht are other potential targets. Offensive lines are perhaps the toughest players to revamp in the portal, and the Red Raiders tried. Left tackle Howard Sampson led a group of four offensive line transfers, many of whom started games. However, it was ultimately not enough to build a serious bully-ball unit against the best teams in the sport. Four out of five offensive linemen could be gone in 2026. \nEasily the biggest reason for offensive optimism comes at running back. Both Cameron Dickey and J'Koby Williams are back for another year, and the Red Raiders will benefit greatly from the return of former USC transfer Quinten Joyner from injury. Replacing a generationTexas Tech invested heavily in the portal for the 2025 season and the vast majority of those players are gone to the NFL. The Red Raiders will lose irreplaceable pieces like linebacker Jacob Rodriguez, edge rusher David Bailey and defensive tackle Lee Hunter. The first focus will shift to the returners, especially in the secondary. Cornerbacks Brice Pollock and Amier Boyd could both come back. Linebackers John Curry and Ben Roberts, too. Defensive tackle A.J. Holmes has a decision to make after a strong finish to the year. \nHowever, nearly the entire top-rated pass rush will be off to the NFL. Holmes is the only player with multiple sacks who could be back. Four of the five defensive ends on the depth chart are seniors. There aren't obvious answers coming for the front. That said, the Red Raiders had an incredible hit rate on defensive transfers in 2025, even compared to other big-spending programs. Getting production out of Bailey, Hunter, Rodriguez and many more will make Lubbock an attractive landing spot for defenders hoping to take the next step. The final prognosisTexas Tech's wild gamble paid off as an unabashed success, and one that will echo through the future years of Red Raiders football. When players tour the Womble Football Center, there will be a Big 12 championship trophy greeting them at the entrance, and College Football Playoff logos across the walls. \nThe first step is done. The second step will be much more difficult. The 2026 season will be about proving that the Red Raiders have legitimate staying power. If the recruiting class is any indication, Texas Tech is off to a solid start. The program signed six players rated in the Top247, including five-star recruits offensive tackle Felix Ojo and defensive end LaDamion Guyton. There won't be a fully opened checkbook in 2026 as the rule changes make such spending sprees more complicated. But if this year is any indication, megabooster Cody Campbell, general manager James Blanchard and the Red Raiders will find a way. \n            ",

Six months separate the United States men's national team from now and kicking off the World Cup on home soil, but Mauricio Pochettino has restored belief that this is a team that could make noise. They ended 2025 unbeaten in their last five matches, and Pochettino's plan and the depth of the side are shining in key areas.Excelling against Paraguay and Uruguay to end the year, the challenges will only get harder for the USMNT with Belgium and Portugal on the docket in March, but that's a good thing as players will be able to show what they can do against teams who will be in the mix to win the World Cup. That does mean that it's time for another World Cup roster prediction, as the end of the year has brought changes at the fringes of the side.Playing time concerns are still an issue in the squad with members such as Yunus Musah and Gio Reyna not playing consistently for their clubs, but with the tactical vision for the USMNT becoming clearer, let's take a look at predicting the roster as we're now six months out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nUSMNT roster locksA section that has been dwindling as regression has hit the USMNT pool, this is a group of players who, if healthy, are still expected to be in the squad and likely start matches. \nGK Matt FreeseDEF Tim ReamDEF Chris RichardsDEF Antonee RobinsonDEF Sergino Dest MID Weston McKennieMID Tyler AdamsFWD Christian PulisicFWD Folarin BalogunOne group of players that hasn't changed is the locks of the squad. If these players are healthy, not only will they be in the World Cup squad, but they'll also be starting the first match for the USMNT, facing Paraguay on June 12 to kick off the tournament. It's a critical moment for the side, but if they're successful at the World Cup, this is the group who will need to be in top form to make it happen. It's not ideal that Tyler Adams is injured to begin the year, but he could be healthy by the March international break when the USMNT will face Portugal and Belgium as World Cup preparation kicks into high gear, but there is a very real possibility that the Bournemouth midfielder isn't at peak fitness when the World Cup kicks off which would be quite a blow to the national team. If someone were to fall out of this group, it'd possibly be Weston McKennie, who missed the September and October international breaks, but with him being back in the midfield rotation for Juventus, there's no reason why a performing McKennie won't be in the World Cup squad. Behind them, things are wide open, considering the lack of depth in defense. Malik Tillman is also probably a lock, but as another player who has had to come in and out of the USMNT squad due to injury, I hesitate to fully put him with this group of players.\nKeeper is also set unless something drastic happens, with no keeper earning a start under Pochettino, except Matt Freese during 2025. Despite Matt Turner getting consistent playing time since returning to the New England Revolution, it hasn't resulted in caps for the USMNT, so that only increases the chances that Freese is the number one when the World Cup gets underway.Players on the bubbleCristian Roldan (Midfielder): The Seattle Sounders man has not only showcased his leadership credentials with the USMNT, but he's also been an integral part of transitioning defense into attack when McKennie isn't in the squad. Now that he's gotten so much playing time under Pochettino while also representing the United States at the 2022 World Cup, it's hard to see a situation where Roldan doesn't make this squad.Roman Celentano (Goalkeeper): A strong performer for FC Cincinnati, Celentano is someone who has been called in under Pochettino, but due to Freese's form, it has kept him from doing much at the national team level.Miles Robinson (Defender): Holding down the Cincinnati defense in front of Celentano, Miles Robinson is someone who Pochettino values in defense. He may not start many games, but Robinson has been among the first names that Pochettino looks to to close out matches, which is a valuable skill.Malik Tillman (Midfielder): Even with the coaching change at Bayer Leverkusen, Tillman has stuck in the lineup while also shining with the USMNT when called into the squad. Injuries kept Tillman out for some of 2025, but moving into 2026, he's someone looking to claim a starting role at the World Cup.Auston Trusty (Defender): Another member of the team with a new coach heading into the new year, as Wilfred Nancy has taken over at Celtic, Trusty is looking to capitalize on the USMNT defense shifting to a back three. One of the defenders who has experience playing in that system, a steady time at Celtic could easily see him make the squad.Gio Reyna (Forward): When Gio Reyna scored for the USMNT against Paraguay, it felt like he made the World Cup squad. While he has yet to nail down a consistent starting role at Borussia Monchengladbach, he's still one of the most talented players in this squad, and Reyna being on the pitch makes things easier for the rest of the USMNT attackers. As long as he's playing regularly in Germany, Reyna will be in the squad.Tanner Tessemann (Midfielder): Thriving after his move to Lyon, Tessemann is someone who can fill multiple roles for the USMNT. He's gotten playing time as a defensive midfielder and as a centerback, versatility that could be key with the national team mixing things up tactically.Ricardo Pepi (Forward): Expected to start more matches for PSV than he has, Ricardo Pepi has made the most of his situation, scoring 10 goals in all competitions so far this season. Now linked to a move to Fulham, there's a chance that Pepi could be joining another American in Antonee Robinson. But, even if that doesn't happen, Pepi is in a situation where he can earn significant playing time and push to cement a role as one of the first players off the bench for the USMNT.Alex Freeman (Defender): Growing by the match under Pochettino, Freeman came from out of the blue, but he's knocking on the door of the World Cup. Showing his two-way skill as a wing back, Freeman is helping push Pochettino to take four fullbacks to the World Cup. Freeman hasn't met a challenge that he hasn't risen to, and he doesn't show signs of slowing down anytime soon.Haji Wright (Forward): With Coventry City flying atop the Championship, Wright is back to getting called into the national team setup on a regular basis. Able to play on the wing or as a traditional nine, Wright's versatility will be important for the USMNT going forward. Max Arfsten (Defender): Able to play as a defender or essentially push up the pitch as a wide midfielder, Arfsten is another player who brings important versatility to the squad. Robinson may be the starter at left back, but it doesn't get much better as far as a change of pace option go.Brenden Aaronson (Midfielder): The top assister for Leeds United this season, it seemed like Aaronson didn't have much of a shot at making the World Cup squad, but his work rate and vision have kept him around the fringes. Only time will tell if that's enough, but Aaronson is doing enough to ensure that he's in the mix right now.Patrick Schulte (Goalkeeper): Probably the best current keeper in the pool with the ball at his feet. If Schulte doesn't get injured ahead of the Gold Cup, Freese may never get his shot to start for the USMNT. With a strong season, Schulte could be the starter in net, but he's falling behind in the rankings.Mark McKenzie (Defender): A player who Pochettino has talked about the art of defending with, McKenzie is someone who could be a surprise starter at the World Cup. He has settled in well since making the move to Toulouse in France, and as another player who is comfortable in a back three or a back four, this could be McKenzie's time.Diego Luna (Midfielder): Becoming Pochettino's right-hand man, Luna now has to prove that he can perform against top opposition. Scoring against Uruguay is a start, but the tougher challenges are yet to come as his performances against Belgium and Portugal will go a long way to determining Luna's World Cup fate.Tim Weah (Forward): Back in France with Marseille, he has been able to play on the wing as well as at wing back, which is a boon for the USMNT. Pochettino has shuffled his position with the national team, but it doesn't feel like there's a scenario where Weah isn't in the squad, although he may not be a starter.Sebastian Berhalter (Midfielder): The Vancouver Whitecaps man has quickly become one of the best players in the squad at delivering set plays. His play on the pitch needs improvement to truly be at a USMNT level at the World Cup, but if someone needs to deliver a free kick or a corner to change the outcome of a game, there are worse options.Patrick Agyemang (Forward): Finding the back of the net for Derby County in the Championship, Agyemang is showing why Pochettino had faith in him. The forwards ahead of him are performing so this is a tenuous spot, but with players like Wright also being able to shift out wide, there's space for another out and out number nine.On the outside looking inHere's a look at those who have missed the cut in this projection:Yunus Musah (Midfielder): Now at Atalanta, Musah has struggled to stick in the starting lineup, and that has also kept him from pushing into Pochettino's plans, but there is still time for a late charge into the side.Jack McGlynn (Midfielder): Injuries have set McGlynn back, so priority one will be getting back to full health, but if he can do that, the Houston midfielder is talented enough to push for a place in the World Cup squad.Noahkai Banks (Defender): Called in by Pochettino but not yet receiving a cap, Banks is someone who the Argentine manager has spoken highly of. In a thin defense, Banks could turn up in the World Cup squad if he continues his strong form for Augsburg.Joe Scally (Defender): The shift to a back three and Scally's versatility will give him a chance, but if he's given opportunities against top teams, his performances for the national team will need to improve after a disappointing November window.Matt Turner (Goalkeeper): It feels like Turner will either be the starter for the USMNT or out of the squad with no in between. Back in New England, he's playing soccer, which is a start, but will there be enough time?Johnny Cardoso (Midfielder): Struggling to make his mark at Atletico Madrid, Cardoso has to be kept in the picture because if he does break into the XI, that would also be enough to earn a role with the USMNT.2026 roster projection Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew).Defenders (9): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Auston Trusty (Celtic),Mark McKenzie (Toulouse FC).\nMidfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Tanner Tessemann (Lyon).Forwards (7): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County).\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

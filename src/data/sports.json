The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner. With two prolific offenses, 51 combined points are projected as the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Alabama vs. Indiana, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Indiana vs. Alabama spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama left Wednesday's 134-132 win over the New York Knicks with a slight hyperextension in his left knee. Initial tests came back negative and ruled out a major injury, according to ESPN.Webanyama jumped for a rebound and landed awkwardly with 10:32 left in the fourth quarter. His left foot moved forward as he approached the ground, which caused his knee to bend inward. He fell to the floor and grabbed his knee in pain, and after he returned to his feet, he limped off the court and into the locker room for examination.While he returned to the bench after a short stay in the locker room, the Spurs determined Wembanyama's night over after 24 minutes of action. He scored 31 points and racked up 13 rebounds before his premature exit.\"Have not been able to talk to the medical staff yet, but I saw what everybody else saw,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said postgame. \"There's a visual there, but obviously he finished the game on the bench with his teammates, so that made me feel good. I have no idea what to say, but it was good to see him walk back out and be able to finish the game on the bench with his teammates.\"\nWembanyama said he expects to be back for the Spurs' next game, a Friday road contest versus the Indiana Pacers.\"Feeling good, just sore,\" Wembanyama said. \"I was 'this' close to coming back in the game. They had to hold me back.\"The Spurs trailed the Knicks, 102-96, when Wembanyama left the game but rallied to eliminate the deficit as part of a 71-point second half. Both teams entered the day in second place in their respective conferences, and the contest was a critical one as they remain locked in chases with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Detroit Pistons for the top spots.\nWembanyama, a reigning All-Star and former Rookie of the Year, has been instrumental in the Spurs' rise toward the top of the Western Conference this season. He averaged 24 points per game over the first 20 games of the year and is on pace to average a double-double for the third consecutive season to open his career. He has become an even more potent offensive weapon this season with a career-high 51.4% shooting clip.Wembanyama's injury is reminiscent of the one Nikola Jokić sustained on Monday. The Denver Nuggets superstar was diagnosed with a hyperextended knee -- which will sideline him for at least four weeks -- after he also had his leg bend awkwardly in the middle of game action.The Spurs already spent a month this season without Wembanyama due to a separate injury. The third-year star sustained a calf strain against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 14 and did not return until Dec. 13 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He eased back into the lineup, coming off the bench for six games before returning to the starting five on Dec. 27. Wednesday's contest was just his third start since the calf injury.\n            ",

Rather than picking a side, the SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Over 40.5 total points as a part of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Both sides feature top quarterbacks in college football in Julian Sayin at Ohio State and Carson Beck at Miami. The Buckeyes are favored by 7.5 points, according to the latest college football odds at DraftKings. The model also has a Wednesday best bet from the NBA, backing the San Antonio Spurs to cover as 2.5-point favorites against the New York Knicks.

San Antonio won five straight after that Cup final loss. The Spurs are 15-5 over their last 20 games, not including the Cup final, which doesn't count toward each team's overall record, as the Spurs are 23-9 on the season. Victor Wembanyama is having another dominant season, averaging  24 points, 11.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 3.0 blocks as a matchup nightmare. The Knicks (23-9) will also be without Josh Hart (ankle) and Mitchell Robinson (ankle). The model expects the Spurs to protect home court, projecting them to cover in 61% of simulations. Back the Spurs at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Ohio State vs. Miami: Over 40.5 total points Both these teams average more than 30 points per game this season, with Ohio State at 32 ppg and Miami at 31.2 ppg. They both utilize top quarterback play to achieve offensive success. Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting after throwing for 3,323 yards and 31 touchdowns with six interceptions, flanked by a top wide receiver duo in Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate. Meanwhile, Carson Beck was one of the most sought-after quarterbacks in the transfer portal after throwing for more than 3,000 yards in back-to-back years at Georgia. Beck has 3,175 passing yards this season. With these two established quarterbacks leading the way, the model projects the Over to hit in 63% of simulations. Back Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Thunder (-15.5) vs. Trail Blazers The Thunder have the No. 2 scoring offense (122.1 points per game) and No. 1 scoring defense (107.9 ppg) allowed in the NBA this season. The Spurs have been their kryptonite, but outside of San Antonio, the Thunder are 28-2 this season. Portland is one of those two non-Spurs losses in a 121-119 final in November, but the Thunder defeated the Trail Blazers, 122-95, in their next matchup.

    "body": "\n        New Year's Day has traditionally been one of the biggest days in college football, and it's no different during the College Football Playoff era, with a trio of quarterfinal games on Thursday's slate. The January 1 CFP schedule begins with No. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl at noon ET, followed by No. 9 Alabama vs. No. 1 Indiana in the Rose Bowl at 4 p.m. ET, and finally No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.The SportsLine projection model and SportsLine's team of experts have you covered on the incredible CFP slate. The model is backing a pair of underdogs later in the day, projecting Alabama to cover as 7-point underdogs and Ole Miss to cover as 6.5-point underdogs in its College Football Playoff best bets. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson is backing Oregon to cover as 2.5-point favorites for Thursday's college football best bets.

Bet it now at BetMGM: Oregon (-2.5) vs. Texas Tech\"This game sets up to be a chess match throughout the afternoon, with both Oregon and Texas Tech looking to set up and eventually execute explosive plays against elite defenses,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"It's a chess match that will be fascinating to watch play out and likely set up a close game deep into the second half. It's just at some point, we're going to need a quarterback to make a game-saving or game-winning play, and right now, I'd rather side with Dante Moore in that discussion. He's made some huge throws late in games this season, and I like his odds more to be able to do so again.\" Back Oregon at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Alabama (+7) vs. Indiana Indiana defeating Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game left no doubt that the Hoosiers are capable of winning a national championship. However, defeating Alabama by more than a touchdown is a tough task for any program. Alabama had a shocking opening-week loss to Florida State, but has since won 11 of 13 games, and its only loss by more than a touchdown came in a 28-7 final against Georgia in the SEC championship game. Indiana is 13-0 in a historic season, and the deserved favorite led by Heisman Trophy winner and possible No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft in quarterback Fernando Mendoza. However, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson is sixth in the nation with 3,500 passing yards, and the model views seven points just too many to give a program like Alabama. The model projects the Crimson Tide to cover in 63% of simulations. Back Alabama at Caesars, where new users get their first bet matched up to $250 in bonus bets:Ole Miss (+6.5) vs. GeorgiaGeorgia needed a furious fourth-quarter comeback to defeat Ole Miss despite being the home team in their regular-season matchup this year. Ole Miss led, 35-26, in Athens entering the fourth quarter before Georgia scored the game's final 17 points to win, 43-35. Although that means Georgia over this number, that was at home, and on Thursday, they'll meet at a neutral site. Ole Miss will be without head coach Lane Kiffin, who is now with LSU, but many of the assistants from their regular-season meeting will be on the sideline. Ole Miss went 12-1 this season and had no issue in a 41-10 win over Tulane in the first round of the College Football Playoff. The model projects Ole Miss to cover in 57% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- Miami received plenty of attention for its high-profile transfer quarterbacks and dynamic offensive playmakers. But when the Hurricanes were at their zenith, \"The U\" was defined by physicality. No. 2 Ohio State was a perfect stress test for the surging Hurricanes, fresh off their first playoff win. On the third play of the game, the Ohio State offensive line parted like the Red Sea and kraken-like defensive ends Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor broke through for the first of many sacks on Buckeyes quarterback Julian Sayin. \"It's just three and four,\" defensive end Rueben Bain said. \"That's just what three and four do, playing fast, playing physically, just playing that brand of football.\" Three and four in this case refers to Mesidor and Bain, the best defensive end combination in college football. And for the Hurricanes, the duo is a throwback. \nNo. 10 Miami didn't just beat Ohio State in one of the biggest upsets of the playoff era. They pulverized them, turning 9.5-point underdog status into a 24-14 win against the reigning national champions. The Hurricanes held the Buckeyes to negative rushing yardage in the first half and rushed for more yards against Ohio State than any team since the season opener. Miami coach Mario Cristobal is an offensive line coach by trade, and his physical presence permeates through the program. The Hurricanes have recruited and developed at an elite level in both trenches, developing consensus All-Americans on both sides. At a time where offensive lines are regressing nationally, Miami is only getting better. \"When you look at what we go against every day, when we go good-on-good, that's my favorite period of practice,\" defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman said. \"It's not exactly the same look you're going to get, not exactly the same formation, not the same pitcher – but you're seeing the fast fastball.\" \nWhen going against Ohio State, both trenches were more than ready for the challenge. The Hurricanes got after Sayin from the start. After sacking him in the first, the Buckeyes tried to go to the quick game and Keionte Scott jumped the route and returned it 72 yards for a touchdown. The defense finished with five sacks, including three combined by Mesidor and Bain. In the second half, Miami tried to use short passes and interior runs to take Miami's star edge rushers out of the game. But on the game's deciding drive, Ohio State was called for a holding that prevented points. Miami was able to put the game away with a field goal. The Buckeyes have been the standard up front across college football for years. At the Cotton Bowl, there was no question which was the more physical team. \n\"They're a good unit, they've got good guys on their team,\" Mesidor said. \"But at the end of the day, if you give me and Rueben one-on-ones, we're going to take advantage of that all day. I take us every time.\" In the game's waning moments, the Miami offensive line took over. Running back CharMar Brown came off the bench to deliver 26 physical yards, adding to game MVP Mark Fletcher Jr.'s 115 all-purpose yards. It was the second week in a row that Cristobal leaned on his signature offensive line and running game to close things out. Again, it led to a game-sealing touchdown drive. \n\"We keep getting better and better up front,\" Cristobal said. \"We don't think we have arrived by any stretch, but we certainly think we're getting better. When you play a team like that that's been the number one defense in the country the entire year, you have to. And you have to not only hit, but you've got to be willing to take the hits and keep coming.\" Miami was the subject of controversy when it passed Notre Dame to take the final at-large spot in the College Football Playoff rankings. After wins over No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State, the Hurricanes have proven they belong. In the next round, Miami gets the winner of Georgia vs. Ole Miss and a date in the semifinals at the Fiesta Bowl. After passing the program's biggest test in at least 20 years, Miami is ready to fight with anyone they meet. \n\"[Cristobal] told me that we'll get this program back to national championship status,\" Fletcher said. \"We'll just continue to keep on going on one game at a time.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ryan Williams isn't going anywhere -- at least not right now.Ahead of No. 9 Alabama's College Football Playoff quarterfinal against No. 1 Indiana at the Rose Bowl on Thursday at 4 p.m. ET, the Crimson Tide wide receiver said Tuesday he plans to return to Tuscaloosa and will not enter the transfer portal. The decision reaffirms his commitment as his on-field production -- and national standing -- have taken a noticeable step back.\"Of course,\" Williams told AL.com when asked if he'd be back at Alabama for his junior season in 2026. \"I'm Alabama through and through. I have no intentions of being anywhere else.\"In an era when high-profile players routinely explore options after uneven seasons, Williams' stance is notable. Sources told CBS Sports there was significantly more smoke last year around the possibility of Williams transferring after his phenomenal true freshman season. This winter, there has been no comparable behind-the-scenes buzz -- not the kind typically associated with players reassessing value, role or opportunity in the portal.Williams saying he will stand pat comes at a moment when the conversation around him has shifted sharply.\nAs a 17-year-old freshman in 2024, Williams burst onto the scene with 865 yards and eight touchdowns on 48 receptions. Over Alabama's first five games, he caught 19 passes for 544 yards and six touchdowns, including a six-catch, 177-yard performance against Georgia that instantly placed him among the sport's breakout stars.Since then, consistency -- particularly at the catch point -- has been elusive. Williams' 12.7% drop rate ranked 47th-worst among 347 FBS wide receivers with at least 40 targets last season, according to Pro Football Focus. Over the final eight games of 2024, his production dipped sharply as defenses adjusted and opportunities narrowed.In 2025, Williams has 636 yards and four touchdowns on 43 receptions, down from his freshman totals despite a similar workload. His 18.9% drop rate ranks fourth-worst among 352 qualifying FBS receivers, per PFF -- a stark contrast for a player once viewed as a future focal point of Alabama's offense.\nRyan Williams receiving statsYearGamesTargetsReceptionsYardsTouchdownsDrop Rate2025136943636418.9%2024138748865812.7%Williams has acknowledged the frustration without deflecting responsibility.\"It's not always going to be sunshine and rainbows,\" Williams told AL.com. \"So whether you call it a 'sophomore slump' or whatever you call it, I know who I am and I know when the time is right my performance will be what's best for the team.\"Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has remained publicly supportive, focusing less on production and more on process.\"He had such a big year last year as a freshman,\" DeBoer said Tuesday. \"I know you can always have more, but there's just been a non-stop level of work that he puts in. His attitude, people can always say stuff, but you don't know. When you're there with him, and you see the smile, the work, the team-first attitude that he has, you can't help but root for him.\"DeBoer acknowledged the uneven production but emphasized patience -- and belief.\"He's going to have a game like he's had at different times where he goes off, and I'm just waiting for that moment because when it is, it's going to be awesome,\" DeBoer said. \"And we're all going to be super happy for him. And I know it's coming sooner than later.\"Williams, a five-star prospect from Saraland (Alabama) ranked as the No. 3 wide receiver and No. 8 overall recruit in the 2024 class. He also reclassified, meaning under a traditional timeline he would only now be in his freshman season. Instead, his early explosion reset expectations almost overnight.As Alabama prepares for Indiana on college football's biggest postseason stage, Williams remains part of the plan. For now, staying put appears to be the clearest path forward, even as the standard he set early continues to loom.\n            ",

In claiming Diggs, the Packers will take on the $472,000 he's due for his base salary in Week 18. Diggs was waived by the Cowboys earlier this week after \"a cumulation of multiple factors both on and off the field,\" per CBS Sports insider Jonathan Jones. Among the final disputes between Diggs and the team came when Diggs reportedly requested to stay at home in Washington after Dallas' game against the Commanders on Christmas. The Cowboys denied that request, but Diggs opted to stay anyway and was waived days later. Now he will join a Packers team that is 9-6-1 and locked into the NFC's 7-seed. The Packers have lost three games in a row as injuries have piled up on both sides of the ball. Star pass rusher Micah Parsons is out for the season after suffering a torn ACL, while quarterback Jordan Love missed the Packers last game with a concussion and remains in protocol going into Week 18. \nDiggs will join a cornerback rotation led by Keisean Nixon, who has started all 16 games for Green Bay so far, but has been a bit shaky beyond Nixon. Carrington Valentine (11 starts) and Nate Hobbs (five starts) have occupied the spot opposite Nixon this season, but Diggs will give the Packers another potential option in the defensive backfield. How quickly Diggs can get up to speed with the defense and whether he'll get on the field in Week 18 remains to be seen, but the Packers will hope to get him comfortable enough with at least some packages to contribute once the playoffs arrive. \nDiggs played in eight games for the Cowboys this season, starting six, and had 25 tackles in 2025 for Dallas. \n            \n    ",

After an almost two-week dead period, the College Football Playoff is set to return Wednesday with the quarterfinal round of games. On paper, this is one of the most thrilling playoff slates we have seen yet. It got started with No. 10 Miami stunning No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. The Hurricanes jumped out to a 14-0 lead early then withstood a second-half rally from the reigning champs to take home a 24-14 win. The action on New Year's Eve sets the table for a busy New Year's Day. No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 5 Oregon kick things off at noon in the Orange Bowl, which represents the Red Raiders' playoff debut. No. 1 Indiana starts its journey at 4 p.m. ET in the Rose Bowl. The Hoosiers will have to get past a resurgent No. 9 Alabama, which won its first playoff game under Kalen DeBoer in dominant fashion when it went on the road and trounced No. 8 Oklahoma. Then, the Sugar Bowl plays host to an SEC rematch in the nightcap. No. 3 Georgia and No. 6 Ole Miss have become familiar foes in recent years; this will be the fourth time they've played each other since 2023 and the second time this season. Georgia rallied from a 35-26 fourth-quarter deficit on Oct. 18 to secure a 43-35 victory against the Rebels. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternQuarterfinalsThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5) Oregon -- : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (9) Alabama -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6) Ole Miss --:  8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20\n(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, Texas\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State's season came to a shocking, premature end in the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff. Losing back-to-back games after starting the season an incredible 12-0 will not sit well with fans in Columbus. Still, the future seems just fine in Columbus because the Buckeyes are expected to once again have one of the nation's most talented rosters in 2026.The Buckeyes (12-2) couldn't repeat as national champions, which is clearly becoming increasingly challenging to attain in this new era for the sport, but don't be surprised if Ryan Day's crew is ranked within the top three in the preseason polls next season. The Buckeyes, who have advanced to the CFP in five of the last seven seasons, will return a load of talent on offense, but will be forced to rebuild the defense for a second straight offseason after several former role players blossomed into superstars around mainstays like safety Caleb Downs.The Big Ten is as rugged as ever, though Michigan and Penn State -- two of the Buckeyes' chief rivals -- will undergo sizable changes under new head coaches. Plus, there's Indiana, the defending Big Ten champs, who broke through this season by beating the Buckeyes in the conference title game.But it's Ohio State that will likely emerge as the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten.\nRyan Day faces more unnecessary pressureRyan Day's record is fantastic at 82-12, yet he will face unnecessary pressure after losing back-to-back games to end the season.The Buckeyes' four-game winning streak in the CFP came to an end, and critics will only look for more weaknesses in Day's armor after he seemed to silence the \"big game\" criticism last season with a national championship. He deserves grace, but he couldn't beat Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game and failed to reach the conference title game in 2024 after losing to rival Michigan. The Buckeyes haven't won the Big Ten since 2020.The good news is Day finally beat Michigan to end the regular season to end a four-year losing streak, but Ohio State fans only expect the best in Columbus. They crave titles, and missing out on a Big Ten title and losing their first CFP game prompts more questions about Day as a big-game coach. That's unfair. He's an elite coach. Still, questions will pop up, especially after Ohio State scored only 14 points with Day calling the offense in the quarterfinals.\nHow does Day handle the pressure? Does he motivate him more? Does he make any tweaks?The nation's best players return on offenseYouth is the best gift. Quarterback Julian Sayin and receiver Jeremiah Smith are expected to return next season, as they are not yet eligible for the NFL Draft.Sayin completed nearly 80% of his passes during his first full season as a starter, and could (should?) be the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy when the season begins. He also has his best weapon returning: Smith, who will undoubtedly be motivated after being left out of the Heisman Trophy conversation late in the 2025 season.\nHe eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for a second straight season, but his production dipped despite his targets increasing as he averaged nearly two more catches per game than he did as a freshman.Receiver Carnell Tate is expected to leave for the NFL, and could be the first receiver overall to be drafted in April.As many as eight starters could return on offense, including four offensive linemen. That offensive line was incredible most of the season, allowing only six sacks in 12 games, but then allowed 10 combined sacks in the back-to-back losses to Indiana and Miami to end the season. If this isn't a top-5 offense next season, something is seriously wrong.\nAnother rebuild for the defenseMost of Ohio State's starting defense is expected to depart for the NFL Draft, including Thorpe Award winner Caleb Downs.It can't be undersold how impressive this defense was despite losing eight starters from the 2024 team. Five defenders earned All-America honors, which proves just how deep this roster can be every season.Will the trend of simply reloading a top-5 defense continue? It won't be as \"easy\" as it was in 2025. First-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia was fantastic at retooling the defense, but proven backups stepped up in the fall, and now it's likely the Buckeyes will need to turn to the portal for some crucial pieces in the trenches. \nLosing All-American linebackers Sonny Styles and Arvell Reese is also daunting, along with Downs and cornerback Davison Igbinosun on the back end. Reese was the heartbeat of the defense, and he might be the most important piece to replace. The future will be defined by underclassmen like linebackers Payton Pierce and Riley Pettijohn, who were both former four-star prospects. The defensive line will be overhauled with All-American tackle Kayden McDonald likely destined for the first round, and edges Kenyatta Jackson Jr. and Caden Curry, the team's sacks leaders (17.5 combined), projected to be picked in the first three rounds. The Buckeyes could reload quickly here via the transfer portal, with a lack of proven depth stepping in as starters. The thinking here is the Buckeyes could go after as many as three linemen/edge rushers.Redshirt senior Beau Atkinson, a North Carolina transfer, can step in at defensive end, but depth is an issue heading into the portal season.\nWho's next at OC?Offensive coordinator Brian Hartline has been a critical component to Ohio State's success on the field and on the recruiting trail. He departs to become South Florida's head coach after eight seasons with the Buckeyes.Hartline was responsible for signing eight five-star receivers during his time in Columbus. Most of those blue-chips turned into household names and first-round draft picks. He signed at least 12 receivers who ranked in the top 10 nationally at their position, including five No. 1s, according to 247Sports.Who does Day hire to replace him as OC? Hartline moved to the sideline to focus on receivers in the CFP. Will Day simply continue to call the plays next fall as he did in the postseason?\nMore importantly, who is Ohio State's go-to recruiter for receivers?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The quest for a repeat national championship is over. No. 2 Ohio State lost its second consecutive game in a 24-14 upset at the hands of No. 10 Miami and fell out of the College Football Playoff bracket in surprise fashion.Buckeyes coach Ryan Day, bewildered by his game plan's ineffectiveness, lamented the slow offensive start to a contest that his team never led. Ohio State went scoreless in the first half of a game for the first time since the 2016 CFP semifinals, and the 14-0 hole it fell into proved too deep to overcome.\"When you have a start the way that we did, you put yourself at risk of having to be really darn near perfect in the second half to go win the game,\" Day said postgame. \"We put ourselves behind the 8-ball.\"The backbreaking play came in the second quarter when quarterback Julian Sayin threw an interception to star Miami defensive back Keionte Scott, who returned it 72 yards for a pick-six. The touchdown put the Hurricanes up by two possessions, and while Ohio State surged over the ensuing two quarters to draw within three points, it was never able to get over the hump.\nBelow is everything Day said after the loss to Miami in the Cotton Bowl.On whether the first-round bye contributed to the slow start:\"I felt like it took us a while to get into the rhythm of the game. I thought we did coming out of the second half. By then it was going to take a very, very efficient second half to win the game, being down 14-0. But I felt like at that point we got into a rhythm. When we had that drive there where we took a shot, it was incomplete and the next play was a hold, that got us way behind the chains. That was the drive that we needed to go win the game. When you have a start the way that we did, you put yourself at risk of having to be really darn near perfect in the second half to go win the game. We put ourselves behind the 8-ball.\"We worked really hard during the last three weeks leading up to this game to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win the first half, be ready to go. I thought we had an excellent plan on that and what we did. I think the guys bought into it. But at the end of the day, we didn't get it done. That starts with me and goes down from there. I take responsibility for not getting the guys ready. As you know, we spent an inordinate amount of time putting the plan together to get everybody ready to go play in that first half, and we didn't win the first half. We gotta figure out why that was and learn from it moving forward.\"On how the offensive struggles will impact his offseason staff decisions:\"Fresh off the game so gotta evaluate it all, but early on, I felt like we had a hard time. Gabe [VanSickle] was struggling a little bit early on with his first big spot there. We were scrambling a little bit. We lost Austin [Siereveld]. They have an excellent front. I thought the guys battled and got back into a rhythm. I thought we had a good plan going in on how to get the ball out of our hands quick, but that obviously didn't work. We took five sacks. We gotta get back to it and figure out where we're going to go moving forward, but we gotta sit down and evaluate all of it.\"\nOn the injuries to OT Austin Siereveld and CB Lorenzo Styles Jr.:\"As you know, we were in this spot last year when we lost Seth [McLaughlin] and we lost [Josh] Simmons. This is part of playing this time of year. You gotta have depth, and you gotta perform in those moments. That's the bottom line. It's our job as coaches to get them ready and to do what they can. Lorenzo had a shoulder there and Austin had a leg contusion. He was in tears because he wasn't able to go back in the game. The decision was made that we weren't gonna put him back in the game when he was struggling at that point, but he would've done anything he could to get back into the game to play in this thing. He cares about his teammates and wanted to finish.\"We obviously got a team of guys that have poured a lot into this program. Some guys, this will be their last game as Buckeyes. It's going to hurt and sting. I just wanted to make sure they still know how much we appreciate everything we do and everything they've done for this program. But it hurts right now. It hurts for those guys. They put a lot of work and time into this thing. It's our job as coaches to make sure that we figure out ways to put them in a situation to be successful, so at the end of the day, it's our responsibility to do that. We've gotta take a hard look at that and figure out what it is that we gotta get done to get better.\"On Styles' injury:\"He's been dealing with a shoulder all season.\"On pushing the gas pedal offensively:\"I think you saw us play with a little bit of tempo today, but when you're not getting first downs early on, you gotta make sure you're getting the right plays and doing what you need to do to get first downs. I think that some of that stuff did give us a little bit of juice in the second half when we needed to. I thought that gave us an advantage at times in the game. But it wasn't done near good enough. All things that we'll make sure we look at.\"\nOn the breakdown in pass protection:\"It's hard to just say one thing. We tried to help out -- they have a very good front. We felt like it was a little bit of a different scheme than what we dealt with the week before against Indiana. Indiana was a lot of pressure, a lot of movement, a lot of twisting and things. This was a bigger group of guys who are a hard-charging front. We went in with a certain plan, and you can tell right from that first third down that we had a hard time. Being on silent, we didn't quite get off the ball on that one. That caused the first sack, and it kind of went from there.\"I do think there was a point where we got it under control. We were moving the ball pretty good. Certainly the play that [Keionte] Scott made there on the pick-six was a huge part of the game. He triggered and hit that thing, and we didn't quite execute it right in terms of what was going on on the perimeter. I think Julian's decision to throw it was the right thing to do at the time. But he made a heck of a play and that, early in the game, certainly flipped the scoreboard fast and put us in a hole. At that point, you gotta fight yourself out of it, and we weren't able to do that.\"We wanted to be aggressive. We felt like we did have an advantage downfield in the passing game. That was the give-and-take of it. Jeremiah [Smith] ended up with 157 downfield. We felt like we could do that and we were gonna be aggressive, but we also knew the give-and-take of it. That was part of what we were working through. At the end of the day, it didn't work.\"\nOn whether the change in play-callers led to the slow start:\"I gotta go look at it all and figure out what that was and what that is, because it's not good enough. Look at it all. We gotta do better. We gotta do better. That's the bottom line. Whatever it takes to get better, we'll do.\"On Caleb Downs likely playing his final game at Ohio State:\"What Caleb Downs has done for Ohio State and does every day, most of it you see is on the field, but what I see is off the field. He's a special young man who has done a lot for this program. I'll forever be indebted for what he's done for us. Not only his play but what he stands for off the field, who he is. His family is tremendous. He played his tail off tonight. Nobody hurts more than he does.\"On Julian Sayin's future:\"This is somebody who hasn't played a lot of football. It's his first year of playing. He competes. He works at it in the meeting room, what he does in terms of his preparation, what we put on his plate in getting us in and out of plays, protection checks. This guy here has got a very, very bright future ahead of him. I think Julian has a chance to be as good as he wants to be. Now, he's gotta learn from this. That's a big part of playing quarterback. When you look at a lot of the guys who have success at the highest levels of college football, they have a lot of games under their belt. Julian's got this season to learn from and grow from, and he's going to come back even stronger next year.\"\nOn the decision to use a silent count:\"Indoors here. We've played here before. It doesn't take a lot to really echo inside here. So we felt like that was the right thing to do.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) would be a part of that effort remains up in the air, though things are trending in a positive direction as Jackson was a full participant in Wednesday's practice.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters, \"He looked good,\" after watching Jackson practice.Harbaugh said on Monday that the team would have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice, saying, \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"If Harbaugh's words on Wednesday are any indication, they'll have the two-time MVP under center with their playoff hopes on the line in Week 18 when the Ravens play the Steelers with the AFC North on the line.\nJackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

If the Miami Hurricanes have a say in it, the defending national champions may exit the month with a pair of blotches and a great deal of disappointment.After being idle for more than three weeks, No. 2 Ohio State (12-1) begins the defense of its crown in the Cotton Bowl as it faces No. 10 Miami (11-2) at 7:30 p.m. ET in a 2025 College Football Playoff quarterfinal at AT&T Stadium. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame for the national title last year and began this season with 12 consecutive victories before dropping a 13-10 decision to Indiana on Dec. 6 in the Big Ten Championship.Ohio State hasn't played since, receiving a first-round bye in this year's CFP tournament despite the loss to the Hoosiers. The Hurricanes don't have nearly as much rust to shake off, as they upset No. 7 Texas A&M 10-3 on Dec. 20 in a first-round matchup as Carson Beck threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Malachi Toney with 1:44 remaining in the fourth quarter to snap a tie.The Buckeyes are making their third consecutive appearance in the Cotton Bowl as they defeated Texas 28-14 last year in a CFP semifinal game after losing to Missouri 14-3 in 2023. Miami, which is in the playoff for the first time, has lost its last six bowl game appearances - including a 42-41 setback against Iowa State in the 2024 Pop-Tarts Bowl.There are five games on Wednesday's NBA evening schedule, one of which has the New York Knicks (23-9) visiting the Frost Bank Center to take on the San Antonio Spurs (23-9) at 7 p.m. ET. The Knicks enter the matchup with a three-game winning streak, while the Spurs have lost the first two contests of their three-game homestand.Six games are on the NHL's evening slate, including a showdown between the red-hot Buffalo Sabres (20-14-4) and Dallas Stars (25-7-7) at 8 p.m. ET at American Airlines Center. The Sabres enter with a nine-game winning streak, their longest since reeling off 10 straight victories from Nov. 8-27, 2018. Meanwhile, a half-dozen college basketball games take place on Wednesday evening, with one being a Big East clash between St. John's (8-4) and Georgetown (9-4) at 8 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. Both teams have been off for more than a week, with the Red Storm's last contest being an 85-59 triumph over Harvard on Dec. 23 and the Hoyas most recently routing Coppin State 97-67 the previous day.Ohio State is a 9.5-point favorite against Miami in the latest consensus college football odds. The Spurs are 2.5-favorites against the Knicks, the Stars are -159 on the money line against the Sabres and St. John's is a 9.5-point favorite versus Georgetown.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 31. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchMiami vs. Ohio StateTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Arlington, Tex. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 40.5 (-113) | Expert: Miami +9.5 (-110, Tom Fornelli)Ohio State is first in the nation with a minuscule average of 8.2 points allowed and has yielded more than 10 only three times this season. Miami is anything but a slouch in that department as it gives up 13.0 points per game to rank fourth in the country. However, both teams are averaging more than 32 points scored, with the Buckeyes (34.9) 16th nationally and the Hurricanes (32.2) placing 28th. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see either squad coming anywhere near its average but feels a fair amount of points will be scored as the Over hits in 63% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Tom Fornelli (11-4, +650 on his last 15 college football ATS picks) believes Miami's defense, which boasts one of the best front lines in the country, will slow down the Buckeyes' offense enough to keep this matchup close and get a cover.NBA best bets, where to watchKnicks at SpursTime: 7 p.m. | Location: San Antonio | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Spurs -133 | Expert: Karl-Anthony Towns Under 25.5 points + assists (-113, PropBetGuy)The Knicks are looking to complete a perfect three-game road trip after beginning it with victories against the Atlanta Hawks and New Orleans Pelicans. The Spurs haven't lost three straight overall this season, let alone three in a row on their own court, where they were 11-2 prior to their current homestand. San Antonio also will have revenge on its mind after falling 124-113 in the 2025 NBA Cup championship game earlier this month. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Spurs will get what they desire as its simulations have them winning 62% of the time. San Antonio limited New York's Karl-Anthony Towns to 16 points and just one assist in the NBA Cup title matchup, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (23-9, +1236 on his last 32 NBA player prop picks) doesn't believe the 30-year-old will fare any better against Victor Wembanyama this time around.NHL best bets, where to watchSabres at StarsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Sabres +1.5 (-182)The Sabres' current surge has been nothing short of amazing, and they are one victory away from matching the franchise record of 10 straight set during the 1983-84 season and equaled in both 2006-07 and 2018-19. Six of the nine wins during their current run have come on the road, where they went 2-9-2 over their first 13 contests this season. Buffalo hasn't won seven in a row away from home since posting a nine-game streak in 2005-06. The Stars are second in the NHL with 57 points and have earned at least one in each of their last six outings, but they came away on the wrong side of an overtime decision and a shootout in their last two contests. The SportsLine Projection Model feels the Sabres' winning streak will come to an end in Dallas but sees a tight battle as Buffalo covers the spread in 67% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchSt. John's at GeorgetownTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Washington, D.C. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Georgetown +9.5 (-114)These schools have been battling since 1909 and the rivalry only got more intense when they became members of the original Big East Conference in 1979. The Red Storm lead the all-time series 69-57 and have won each of the last nine meetings. However, only one of Georgetown's last six losses to St. John's was by double figures. The Hoyas enter this matchup having won three of their last four contests, with the lone setback over that stretch being by three points. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks another tight battle will take place, as its simulations have Georgetown covering the spread 59% of the time. \n            ",

New York has the most road victories (14) this season and is 14-8-2 away for one of the best road winning percentages in the league. The Panthers have won back-to-back Stanley Cups, but they are 21-15-3 for 45 points, which is ninth in the Eastern Conference this year. The Rangers are 19-18-5 for 43 points, and given their strong play on the road, the model projects them to win in 52% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Bucks (-5.5) vs. Hornets (-110)The Bucks defeated the Hornets, 123-113, in Charlotte on Monday, and they'll have the homecourt advantage for tonight's matchup.

The Bucks are 2-1 in his return. The two-time NBA MVP is averaging 28.9 points and 10 rebounds per game this season, and he had 24 points in just 25 minutes against the Hornets on Monday.

Fifita (26 TD passes, just 5 picks in 2025) was doing many of the same things this season as Brent Brennan got his regime back on course after a difficult 2024. Meanwhile, we wonder about the Ponies' focus after blowing their chance at an ACC title game berth in the season-ending loss at Cal.\" Back Arizona at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more college football, NBA and NHL picks on Friday?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

Both should go off in their matchups, and both are great prices on DraftKings and FanDuel.I'll start with Wilson, who is $6,600 on DraftKings and $7,300 on FanDuel. Marvin Harrison Jr. (foot) is out, which means Wilson should be a star against the Rams. Harrison missed four games this season and left early in another, and Wilson averaged 25.8 PPR points over that span. In those five games, Wilson averaged 14 targets per game, and he also had 11 catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns on 16 targets against the Rams in Week 14.\nBurden is $5,300 on DraftKings and $6,100 on FanDuel, and he should stay hot against the Lions, who are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Burden just had eight catches for 138 yards and a touchdown on nine targets in Week 17 at San Francisco, and he now has at least 14.4 PPR points in each of his past two games. Both of these receivers will be popular in Week 18, but I don't care. Wilson and Burden are going to go off in this scoring period, and I want them in my lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 18, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\nDid someone put an injury curse on the Denver Nuggets?One game after three-time MVP Nikola Jokic was lost for at least four weeks with a hyper-extended left knee, the Nuggets lost Jokic's backup, Jonas Valanciunas, to a right calf strain in Wednesday's win over the Raptors. Like Jokic, Valanciunas will be out for at least four weeks, according to reports.Denver already had been playing without injured starters Aaron Gordon (hamstring), Christian Braun (ankle) and Cam Johnson (knee).On Friday, the Nuggets that are still standing will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers at Rocket Arena. Though the Cavaliers (19-16) have gotten off to a slow start relative to last season, they have won their last two games, against the Spurs and Suns. Cleveland is a big 13.5-point favorite against injury-depleted Denver.While Cavaliers vs. Nuggets is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes 10 NBA matchups and four college football bowl games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Jan. 2. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at CavaliersTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Cleveland | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers -13.5\nThe Cavaliers have started to come around a bit offensively. Over their last six games, they are averaging 120.5 points per 100 possessions, which ranks seventh in the NBA over that time. They are 4-2 over that stretch, with the only losses coming to the Knicks and Rockets, two of the league's best teams. For the season, Cleveland is now up to 116.3 points per 100, which is 10th in the league. On Friday, the Cavs will face a Nuggets team that had just 110.4 points per 100 without Jokic, far below its season average of 123.5. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NBA game 10,000 times, says Cleveland has a 66.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Cavaliers -13.5.Thunder at WarriorsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: San Francisco | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +8.5\nThe Thunder (29-5) may have a Spurs problem, but the rest of the league has a Thunder problem. Oklahoma City is 0-3 against San Antonio but 29-2 against everyone else. On Friday, the Thunder will face a Golden State team that has been playing better basketball recently. Over the last 11 games, the Warriors are 7-4 with the sixth-ranked offense (118.4 points per 100 possessions) and eighth-ranked defense (111.8). For the season, they are averaging 114.3 points per 100 on offense and 111.8 on defense. The SportsLine Projection Model says that Golden State has a 68.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Warriors +8.5.College football best bets, where to watchLiberty Bowl: Navy vs. CincinnatiTime: 4:30 p.m. | Location: Memphis, Tenn. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cincinnati +7.5 | Expert: Navy -7.5 (Mike Tierney)\nThe Cincinnati Bearcats (7-5) had the most efficient passing offense in the Big 12 this season (157.41). But that was behind star quarterback Brendan Sorsby, who has decided to enter the transfer portal and opted out of the bowl game. He is one of at least a dozen Cincinnati players who have opted out. Even with those players, the Bearcats ended the season on a four-game losing streak. Meanwhile, Tierney notes that Navy (10-2) ranks 34th in the country is scoring offense (31.2 points per game). \"These aren't your grandad's Midshipmen,\" he says. He adds, \"Navy can score enough for a cover even with the hook.\" The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees and says that the Bearcats have a 65.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Cincinnati +7.5.Holiday Bowl: Arizona vs. SMUTime: 8 p.m. | Location: San Diego | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 51.5 | Expert: Arizona +1.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nThe Arizona Wildcats (9-3) ended the regular season having won five straight games, including a 23-7 victory over rival Arizona State in Tempe. The Wildcats' turnaround was keyed by their defense, which ranked fourth in the country in passing yards allowed (155.9 per game). Arizona also led the country in turnover margin (+1.33 turnovers per game). The Wildcats have the defenders to slow SMU's passing offense, which ranks 12th in the nation (283.5 yards per game). Marshall also questions whether the Mustangs (8-4) will be motivated to play in this game after narrowly missing out on reaching the ACC Championship Game. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 58.0% chance the teams combine for 52 points or more and gives a C grade to Over 51.5.Duke's Mayo Bowl: Wake Forest vs. Mississippi StateTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Charlotte | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Mississippi State -3 | Expert: Wake Forest +3.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nQuarterback Robby Ashford ended the season on a roll for the Demon Deacons (8-5), passing for 634 yards and five touchdowns against two interceptions over the last two games. He will face a Mississippi State defense that couldn't slow a nose bleed this season, ranking 103rd in total defense (405.8 yards per game) and 94th in scoring defense (29.2 points per game). Meanwhile, the Wake Forest defense has a good matchup against the Bulldogs. The Deacs are eighth in the nation in tackles for loss (7.2 per game), while Mississippi State (5-7) is 128th in the FBS in allowing tackles for loss (7.42 per game). \"The Deacs overachieved all season as they also covered seven of their last nine games,\" Marshall says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees, saying that the Bulldogs have a 57.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Mississippi State -3. Looking aheadNFL: Seahawks at 49ersTime: 8 p.m. Saturday | Location: Santa Clara, Calif. | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Seahawks -1.5 | Expert: Seahawks -1 (Larry Hartstein)\nThe No. 1 seed, a bye week and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs will be on the line when the Seattle Seahawks (13-3) and San Francisco 49ers (12-4) collide at Levi's Stadium on Saturday. These teams previously met in the season opener, with San Francisco escaping with a 17-13 victory at Lumen Field. Since then, the 49ers have endured numerous injuries to star players but enter Saturday on a six-game winning streak. However, Hartstein notes that Trent Williams, George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey are all dealing with injuries. In addition, \"[The San Francisco offense has] not lit up good defenses, and Seattle's is elite,\" Hartstein says. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Seahawks have a 53.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Seattle -1.5.\n            ",

Mike Vrabel's squad clinched the AFC East last week, but their work is not complete. The Patriots can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC and the invaluable first-round bye with a win on Sunday paired with a Denver Broncos loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Patriots are coming off a dominant 42-10 win over the New York Jets last week. New England scored touchdowns on six straight drives to begin the game, while Drake Maye became the first player to ever complete 90% of his passes and throw for 250 yards and five touchdowns. As for the Dolphins, they upset Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17, 20-17. Rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers earned his first NFL victory, and flashed some of his potential as well. Let's break down this divisional matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game\nWhere to watch Dolphins vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium - Foxborough, MassachusettsTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -10.5; O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Dolphins vs. Patriots: Need to knowStefon Diggs situation: The Patriots were in the headlines for the wrong reasons this week. Wide receiver Stefon Diggs faces charges of felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery following an incident in his home earlier this month, according to CBS Boston's review of paperwork filed in Dedham District Court. While the NFL is looking into the matter, Diggs is expected to play Sunday. Drake Maye's MVP case: The Patriots' second-year signal-caller registered just four incompletions compared to three total touchdowns last week against the Jets, and is now a relatively heavy favorite to win NFL MVP. He is listed at -295 at DraftKings, while Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is now +225 following his three-interception performance in Week 17. Maye leads the NFL in completion percentage (71.7%), yards per attempt (8.9) and passer rating (112.9).Containing De'Von Achane: A key to victory for New England is containing the explosive Dolphins running back. De'Von Achane ranks fifth in the NFL in scrimmage yards (1,838) and leads the league with 40 rushes for 10 or more yards. He's crossed 100 scrimmage yards in 10 games this season, including a 225-yard explosion against the Buffalo Bills in Week 10. Quinn Ewers gets another start: The Dolphins ended the Tua Tagovailoa era in Week 16, and gave the keys to the offense to the rookie Ewers. In two starts, he's thrown for 432 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. The former Texas star would really turn some heads if he were able to upset the Patriots on Sunday. Dolphins vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots are 13-3 against the spread in their last 16 games when favored by double digits, and are an impressive 11-5 against the spread this season. While the Patriots destroyed the Jets by 32 points last week, I don't see this game being as lopsided. Miami has won five of its last seven games after starting the season 2-7, and is 9-1 against the spread in its last 10 games against the Patriots. New England wins this game, but the Dolphins cover the big number. Pick: Dolphins +10.5, Under 45.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Cincinnati (6-10) picked up its second straight win in a 37-14 rout of the visiting Arizona Cardinals. Cleveland (4-12) recorded a 13-6 upset win over the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers that deprived Pittsburgh of a chance to capture the AFC North ahead of its Week 18 showdown with Baltimore. These two teams will end the season the way they started it. Back in Week 1, the Bengals left Cleveland with a hard-earned, 17-16 win. The Browns' starting quarterback that day, Joe Flacco, is currently backing up Joe Burrow in Cincinnati after making six starts for the Bengals earlier this season after being dealt from Cleveland prior to the trade deadline. \nWhere to watch Browns vs. Bengals liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, Ohio TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bengals -7.5, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings)Browns vs. Bengals: Need to know Finishing strong. After getting shut out at home by the Ravens in Week 15, the Bengals have responded with two wins by a combined score of 82-35. Cincinnati received stellar performances in both games from Burrow, who completed 77.8% of his passes with six touchdowns and no picks in those games while averaging 307 passing yards per outing. The Burrow effect. Cincinnati is 5-2 this season in games with Burrow and 1-8 in games without him. The Bengals started 2-0 before going 1-8 after Burrow sustained a turf toe injury that sidelined him for nine weeks. Had the Bengals managed to win two more games during Burrow's absence, there's a very good chance that Cincinnati would be vying to win the AFC North division title this weekend. Burrow's supporting cast. The Bengals have one of the league's most formidable group of skill players, led by Ja'Marr Chase, who has been targeted a league-high 175 times this season. Cincinnati's offense also features Tee Higgins -- who has caught a team-high 10 touchdown passes this season -- and running back Chase Brown, who is 53 yards away from recording his first 1,000-yard season. Improving defense. Burrow's injury and a subpar defense is what ultimately sunk the Bengals' ship this season. A positive, though, has been that the defense has steadily improved under first-year coordinator Al Golden. Specifically, the team has received encouraging seasons from former first-round pick Myles Murphy, rookie linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. and 2023 third-round pick Jordan Battle. Myles chasing history. After being held without a sack against the Steelers, Myles Garrett remains a sack away from breaking T.J. Watt and Michael Strahan's single-season sack record. Garrett currently has 22 sacks. Sanders' struggles. Shedeur Sanders threw the game-winning touchdown pass against the Steelers, but he also threw two interceptions that could have been costly. Sanders has thrown seven interceptions against just two touchdown passes over his last three games.  Browns vs. Bengals prediction, pick \nCleveland, led by Garrett, has a tough defense that could prevent Burrow & Co. from lighting up the scoreboard as much as they have in recent weeks. That being said, I expect the Bengals to pick up their third straight win while ending their season on a high note. Garrett will get his coveted sack record. Pick: Bengals -7.5, Under 44.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Whether they'll look to improve upon that seeding or rest some of their key players remains TBD.\"We want to win the game,\" Bills coach Sean McDermott said Monday. \"That's number one.\"However, several players are nursing injuries -- including quarterback Josh Allen who is dealing with foot soreness -- and it's unclear who will play and if they will handle their normal workload.\n\"We talked a little bit [Sunday] night,\" McDermott said. \"Haven't had a lot of time just to isolate those situations, Josh Allen included.\"The Bills could climb as high as the No. 5 seed with a win and some help from elsewhere, potentially losses by the Chargers, Texans and/or Jacksonville Jaguars. Here are all of the seeding scenarios.Back to the stadium farewell, if the Bills end up as the No. 7 seed it would guarantee that Sunday's finale would be the last Bills game played in Highmark Stadium, where the team has played since 1973. Buffalo will play in a new stadium across the street starting next season. Before that, though, they have some business to take care of, not just Sunday but into the postseason.\nWhere to watch Bills vs. Jets liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Highmark Stadium -- Orchard Park, New YorkTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -7, O/U 38.5 (via DraftKings)Bills vs. Jets: Need to knowWho could see their normal workload reduced for Buffalo? If the Bills want to focus on health rather than seeding, Allen would be the prime candidate to see a light workday -- if he plays at all. Allen has dealt with right foot soreness that limited him in practice last week. For what it's worth, last season Allen appeared briefly in Week 18 so that he could say he played in every game. Perhaps that will be in store again. James Cook, Joey Bosa, Dalton Kincaid, Dawson Knox and other players could get some extra time off before the postseason begins.Jets hunting draft pick. It's been a tough debut season for coach Aaron Glenn. The Jets are on their third quarterback -- undrafted rookie Brady Cook -- and are 3-13. They've lost each of their last three games by at least 20 points. But they also own the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft as well as the Colts' first-round pick -- a selection that currently slots in at No. 18. Both picks could get even better this week, too, if the Jets and the Colts lose again.Bills hope run defense improves. Regardless of who plays and who doesn't, Buffalo would like to see improvements from its run defense. Only the New York Giants are allowing more yards per carry than the Bills (5.3), though Buffalo did a nice job last week, limiting the Philadelphia Eagles to just 82 yards on 26 carries (3.2 yards per attempt).Bills vs. Jets pick, prediction\nWithout knowing exactly who is going to play for the Bills, this could be a tough one to pick. But if McDermott says the Bills want to win, then they should win. Plus Buffalo will be wearing the red helmets and the throwback unis of the early '90s era squads that went to -- but lost -- four straight Super Bowls. And you know that \"Bills Mafia\" doesn't want to see that team from the Meadowlands get the last win at Highmark. Besides, the Jets have looked completely lifeless, so even if it's Mitchell Trubisky leading the way for the hosts, they're worth believing in.

During Atlanta's current three-game winning streak, Cousins has thrown for six touchdowns and just one interception and taking just two sacks.Shough, meanwhile, has shown encouraging flashes since becoming the Saints' starter in Week 9. During New Orleans' current four-game winning streak, Shough has thrown for four touchdowns (and run for two more) and just one interception. He has completed over 71% of his passes during that span, and he has gone over 300 yards passing in each of his last two games.However, the biggest importance in this game might not have anything to do with either team. Thanks to a long list of tiebreakers, if the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers on Saturday night, the Falcons could still save Carolina's playoff hopes by winning this game. The Saints would do the same for the Buccaneers with a win.\nLong story short, if the Buccaneers win Saturday night, they still need the Saints to win come Sunday. Any other combination, and the Panthers will head to the playoffs as NFC South champs.Here's how to watch Atlanta-New Orleans, along with betting odds, top things to know and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Falcons -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Saints: Need to knowBijan Robinson chasing history. Even in a disappointing season in Atlanta, Robinson has distinguished himself as arguably the best player in the NFL, bar none. Robinson had 229 yards from scrimmage in the Falcons' 27-24 upset win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and is now up to 2,255 on the season. With another 100 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into the top 10 for a single season. With another 200 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into second. The all-time record is 2,509, set by Chris Johnson in 2009. Robinson would need 255 yards from scrimmage to pass that. Regardless, it has been a magnificent season.Cousins, Shough trying to prove themselves. With Penix recovering from a torn ACL, there's a chance Cousins heads into the offseason as the Falcons' potential starter to open 2026. There's also a chance, however, that the Falcons get out of the Cousins contract. Cousins is due a $10 million roster bonus on March 17, 2026. Whether it's in Atlanta or elsewhere, though, Cousins, assuming he wants to keep playing, will want to put more positive play on display. Shough, meanwhile, has impressed as a second-round rookie, so much so that the Saints could continue to build around him, rather than try to replace him this offseason.Rams also have a vested rooting interest. As outlined above, there's a chance the Panthers and the Buccaneers are watching this one very closely. The Rams won't be watching it as closely, but they will still be impacted by it. The Falcons' 2026 first-round pick belongs to Los Angeles. The more Falcons losses, the better for the Rams; the pick could still end up in the top 10.Falcons vs. Saints pick, prediction\nBoth of these teams have played some surprisingly inspired football down the stretch of seasons in which they've long been eliminated from the playoffs. The difference here, between two clubs already with one eye on the offseason ahead, will be Robinson. He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage in the first meeting, a 24-10 Falcons win, as ATL's defense sacked Shough five times.

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule and results for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

After two seasons atop the division, the Detroit Lions will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2022. On Sunday, they'll try to play spoiler against the new division champion, the Chicago Bears, who are playing for a chance to capture the NFC's No. 2 seed. With a win over the Lions, the Bears would host division rival Green Bay in the wild card round. Chicago will drop to the No. 3 seed, however, if they do not defeat the Lions and the Eagles beat the Commanders. The Bears will be the No. 2 seed if both they and the Eagles lose on Sunday. Along with playing the role of spoiler, the Lions are also trying to record their fourth consecutive winning season. Detroit started 7-4, but were eliminated from playoff contention after last week's loss to the Vikings evened its record at 8-8. \nWhere to watch Lions vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation:  Soldier Field -- Chicago, Illinois TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -3, O/U 50.5 (via DraftKings)Lions vs. Bears: Need to know Last time we met. After a season-opening loss, the Lions responded with an emphatic, 52-21 win over the Bears in what was Ben Johnson's first game against his former team. Johnson was asked afterward about Dan Campbell's decision to go for it on fourth-and-goal late in the game despite the lopsided score. \"What's he supposed to do?\" Johnson said. \"It's fourth-and-goal, what do you want him to do? Yeah, he could have kicked the field goal. They don't kick field goals; they go for it there. He was doing what he's supposed to do. That's what he does.\"Hungry Bears. A big reason for Chicago's success this season has been its ability to force turnovers. The Bears lead the NFL with 32 forced turnovers this year, which includes at least one forced turnover in 14 of their first 16 games. Ironically, Chicago's loss to Detroit in Week 2 is just one of two games this year where it didn't force a turnover. Ball hawking secondary. The Bears' secondary has played a key role in the defensive's success in terms of getting turnovers. Chicago has picked off 22 passes, with safety Kevin Byard recording a league-high six picks. Captain Comeback. Caleb Williams has often been at his best late in games. He's led six fourth quarter comebacks and six game-winning drives this season. Dynamic duo. Williams has been complemented by one of the league's best running back duos in D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. This duo has combined to rush for 1,816 yards and 14 touchdowns and caught 50 passes for 440 yards and one score. Wounded Lions. Injuries have played a key role in Detroit's disappointing season. They are currently dealing with several notable injuries, including ones to wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), lineman Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness) and linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion). Lions vs. Bears prediction, pick \nWhile I can definitely see the Lions duplicating what they did in 2022 (upsetting Green Bay on the road in a game that meant nothing in terms of the playoffs), it's hard to pick against a Bears team that still has something to play for, along with the fact that there is a score to settle after losing by 31 points in Detroit back in Week 2.  Pick: Bears, -3, Over 50.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Their game against the Las Vegas Raiders will be the last of their 2025 season, and it could be the last of Travis Kelce's prolific career.As injuries mount, Kansas City is limping to the finish line this season. Third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun will try to get the first win of his career and halt the Chiefs' five-game losing streak. The major story going into this one is the future of Kelce, who might be suiting up for the final time. While a win would hurt the Chiefs' position in the 2026 NFL Draft, I'm sure they would love to send their legendary tight end out with a win, if this is it for him.How bad have the Raiders been? They've lost 10 in a row, and the latest one was a 24-point defeat at the hands of the lowly New York Giants. Las Vegas now possesses the No. 1 pick in the draft, and why mess it up now? The Raiders have gone nearly three months without a win, and there are no signs that will change this weekend. Maybe Las Vegas can force feed Ashton Jeanty in the hopes of getting him to 1,000 rushing yards.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC West matchup.\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, NevadaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -5.5, O/U 36.5 (via DraftKings)Chiefs vs. Raiders: Need to knowKelce's farewell?: Kelce hasn't announced that he is retiring after the season, but it seems like that's certainly a possibility. If Sunday does bring the end of his career, it was one of the best we've ever seen from a tight end. He's third all-time among tight ends in both receptions (1,077) and receiving yards (12,990). He's also the franchise leader in total touchdowns with 85. Whenever his career ends, Kelce can start getting sized up for his Hall of Fame jacket.Raiders have lots to lose by winning. The Raiders haven't won anything since Oct. 12, so why start now. By beating the Giants last week, the Raiders took possession of the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft. That will allow them to get their pick of whatever quarterback they desire -- or trade down for a haul if they determine the 2027 quarterback class is stronger. Either way, Las Vegas has little to gain from actually winning this game.AFC West woes for Las Vegas. Few teams have been as terrible against their own division than the Raiders. Over the team's last 11 divisional games, Las Vegas is 0-11 with an average margin of defeat of 11.8 points. Oftentimes, division games are more competitive than you might expect, but that's not been the case when the Raiders match up against other AFC West teams.Chiefs vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nThis may be a trap, but I don't see how the Raiders cover this spread. Sure, Oladokun has struggled mightily in each of his first two appearances this season, but have you seen Las Vegas play football recently? At least Kansas City has shown the ability to play competent football. The Chiefs just went toe-to-toe withe Broncos last week. Give me Andy Reid's squad by a wide margin.

    "body": "\n        On Dec. 18, the Los Angeles Clippers were crushed by the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder. With the loss, their 10th in their last 11 games, they fell to 6-21 on the season, which at the time was tied for the third-worst record in the NBA. As Christmas approached, it seemed there was no end in sight for the Clippers' misery. They were five games out of the final Play-In Tournament spot in the Western Conference, trade talk was rampant and tanking wasn't really an option because their 2026 first-round pick belongs to the Thunder. Two weeks later, the Clippers are beginning the New Year as the hottest team in the league. They've won six games in a row -- the NBA's longest active winning streak -- to improve to 12-21 and are now just 1½ games out of the Play-In spots in the West. Over this span, they have the best offensive rating (127.2), defensive rating (105.6) and net rating (+21.6) in the league. \"We're still trying to get better individually and as a unit,\" Kawhi Leonard said after the team's win over the Utah Jazz on Thursday. \"We might not be contenders but we just gotta keep fighting.\" \nThe Clippers still have plenty of work to do to salvage something from this season, but the situation no longer looks completely hopeless. Let's take a closer look at how the Clippers have turned things around lately, and whether this resurgence is sustainable. Kawhi has reminded everyone of his brillianceSince 2017, the last time he reached the 70-game mark, Kawhi Leonard has played in 358 of a possible 669 regular season games (53.5%) for the San Antonio Spurs, Toronto Raptors and Los Angeles Clippers. You may not know when Leonard is going to suit up, but when he does, there are few players you'd rather have. His recent play has been a strong reminder of his place in the league's hierarchy when he's fully healthy. \nDuring the winning streak, the 34-year-old Leonard is averaging 39 points, 8.5 rebounds, four assists, 2.7 steals and 1.5 blocks on 53.2/44.1/93.5 shooting splits. He has three 40-point games in that span, including a career-high 55 points in the Clippers' win over the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons on Dec. 28. If you take only the last five games into account, Leonard joined Kobe Bryant as the only players in league history to have a five-game span where they averaged 40-plus points on 50/40/90 shooting splits with a perfect record, per Opta Sports. \nNotably, Leonard has attempted as many shots in the restricted area (29) in the last six games as he did in his first 17 games this season. He's made 75.9% of them, and has thrown down nine dunks, which is a telling sign that he feels healthy and trusts his body. Just look at this slam against the Trail Blazers. \nLeonard is also taking more 3s than ever before. Against the Jazz, he took a career-high 16 attempts, and during the six-game winning streak is shooting 44.1% on 9.8 attempts a night. After the Clippers' win over the Rockets, Leonard said he's trying to \"get as many 3s up as possible.\"Since the winning streak began, the Clippers have outscored their opponents by 117 points in 230 minutes with Leonard on the floor. For the season, the Clippers are 10-13 with Leonard in the lineup and 2-8 without him. When he's on the floor, they have a +2.7 net rating, and when he sits it plummets to -5.5. \"Finally getting healthy, finally being able to play enough minutes to be very, very effective. When he's healthy, he's one of the top guys in the league,\" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after Leonard's career-high effort. \"We've been able to see that as of late.\" \nAs always, though, \"when he's healthy\" is a major qualifier for Leonard. Can he stay on the floor consistently over the next three-plus months? The answer will likely determine whether the Clippers are able to grab a postseason spot. 3-point luck?Since Lue took over as head coach of the Clippers in 2020, the team has never finished higher than 14th in 3-point attempts per game, but has also never finished worse than seventh in 3-point percentage. Early this season, they were staying true to their inside-out approach, but were not hitting enough 3s to make up for the lack of volume. During their six-game winning streak, however, they've flipped a switch. Their 3-point attempts are way up -- their 51 3-point attempts in their win over the Jazz on Thursday were the second-most in franchise history -- and they've made at least 14 3s in each win. \nJust look at the difference:Period3PA3P%League ranksFirst 27 games35.535.1%20th / 20thLast 6 games40.541.2%t-7th / 3rd\"If they're good shots,\" Lue said, when asked if he wanted his team taking as many 3s as they did against the Jazz. \"You gotta take those shots, that's the way the game is being played nowadays.\"Leonard, Brook Lopez, Nicolas Batum, Kris Dunn, John Collins and Kobe Sanders are all shooting at least 38.5% on two or more attempts per game during the winning streak. Ironically, James Harden (30% on 8.3 attempts per game) is the one key contributor who has been ice cold in this span. As a team, the Clippers are shooting a league-best 50.5% on wide-open (closest defender six-plus feet away) 3s and 38.5% (fourth-best) on pull-up 3s over the last six games. Worringly, though, they're tied for 15th in wide-open 3 attempts per game (19) and 2nd in pull-up 3s (13). It's difficult to have sustained efficiency on that type of shot diet. The Clippers have also completely turned around their 3-point defense. They went from the worst 3-point defense in the league over the first 27 games to the best during this winning streak. PeriodOpp. 3PAOpp. 3P%Opp. league ranksFirst 27 games37.438.9%20th / 30thLast 6 games31.727.9%4th / 1stGetting Derrick Jones Jr. back from a knee injury has certainly helped their 3-point defense, as has playing the Rockets, Kings and Pistons, who are 30th, 29th and 28th, respectively, in 3-point attempts per game. Additionally, teams are just missing open shots. Here's a look at the Clippers' opponents' wide-open 3-point shooting:Period3PA3P%League ranksFirst 27 games18.742%11th / 28thLast 6 games1734.1%t-8th / 5thAnd the Clippers' opponents' open (closest defender four-to-six feet away) 3-point shooting:Period3PA3P%League rankFirst 27 games15.437.3%26th / 29thLast 6 games1223.3%5th / 1stThe Clippers are giving up about the same number of wide-open and open 3s during this winning streak as they did earlier in the season, but opponents are making them at a significantly lower rate. The drop-off in opponent open 3-point percentage, in particular, is stunning.While the Clippers were unlucky early in the season, they've been extremely lucky during the winning streak. It will be interesting to see how they fare in their next three games, which are against the Celtics, Warriors and Knicks -- all 3-point heavy offenses. Yanic and KobeThe Clippers went all-in on experience this offseason. They brought in Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Lopez and Collins, and re-signed Harden and Batum. On opening night, they had the oldest roster in NBA history, with an average age of 33.2 years. Almost immediately, the plan fell apart. The Clippers looked completely out of place in the modern NBA, which is becoming faster and more athletic with each passing year. Experience isn't worth much if you can't keep up with your opponents. Beal ended up playing just six games before being ruled out for the season with a hip injury, while Paul was banished from the team early last month. \nWith Beal and Paul gone, and others in and out of the lineup due to injuries, Lue has had to turn to rookies Yanic Konan Niederhäuser and Kobe Sanders -- their first- and second-round selections in the 2025 NBA Draft. That duo, which combined for 16 points, 14 rebounds, four assists, a steal and two blocks on 7-of-14 shooting in the Clippers' win over the Jazz on Thursday, has given the team a much-needed boost of youth and athleticism. \"I thought his energy, just being able to sprint the pick-and-rolls and get out of the rolls fast enough to get behind the defense, was good,\" Lue said about Niederhäuser after he put up 16 points and six rebounds in their win over the Kings. \"I thought he was really good defensively at the rim, either blocking shots or altering shots. His energy -- running the floor, pick-and-rolls, getting off of it. He has done a really good job, and he is only going to get better.\"\nDuring the six-game winning streak, Niederhäuser is putting up 5.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and one block on 61.1% shooting in 18.4 minutes per game, while Sanders is contributing 6.5 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.8 assists on 55.6% shooting in 18.8 minutes a night. It will be interesting to see if either rookie remains in the rotation once Ivica Zubac and Bogdan Bogdanovic are healthy, but it may be wise for Lue to find them some minutes. They've both proven that they can help on certain nights, at least during the regular season. \n            ",

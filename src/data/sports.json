Miami's defense has risen to the occasion as of late, holding each of its last four opponents to 17 points or fewer while also notching 10 takeaways during this stretch. On offense, Mike McDaniel has a rushing unit that ranks fifth in yards per carry and eighth in yards per game. De'Von Achane is on pace for nearly 2,000 scrimmage yards, while Jaylen Wright had 107 yards and a touchdown last week.

That's relevant because Miami has lost 13 straight games with temps under 40 degrees, as Tua Tagovailoa is 0-8 in his career in such contests. The Dolphins quarterback has had a season to forget, as he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and now has to face a Pittsburgh defense which has racked up the second-most takeaways (23). As for Aaron Rodgers, he's coming off a season-high of 284 passing yards and also rushed for his first score since 2022 in last week's win over Baltimore. He faced the Dolphins twice last year while with the Jets, and the four-time MVP totaled five passing touchdowns and averaged 306.5 yards through the air. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Steelers vs. Dolphins           picksFor Dolphins vs. Steelers on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 46 combined points.

Manchester United has won five of its eight matches since the start of October, with two draws and a loss mixed in. Bournemouth has lost or tied each of its six matches since beating Nottingham Forest on Oct. 26, though they've had a lot of success in this matchup of late.Kickoff from Old Trafford in Manchester is set for 3 p.m. ET. Manchester United are -120 favorites (wager $120 to win $100) in the latest Manchester United vs. Bournemouth odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Bournemouth are +280 underdogs (wager $100 to win $280).

Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis for Manchester United vs. Bournemouth on Monday.Manchester United vs. Bournemouth best betsBoth teams to score & Over 2.5 goals (-118, 0.5 units)Manchester United to win (-118, ).5 units)Bruno Fernandes to score or assist (-118, 0.5 units)Manchester United should be able to extend their unbeaten streak to four games when they host a struggling Bournemouth team at Old Trafford on Monday.The Red Devils moved up to sixth in the Premier League table after thrashing Wolves 4-1 in their last game. Results have been solid in recent weeks, and it seems like the players are finally adapting to manager Ruben Amorim's system.They're building momentum, and they look capable of beating Bournemouth. The Cherries have zero wins, two draws and four defeats from their last six games, which is concerning.Defensive issues derail Bournemouth's seasonManchester United are winless in their last four games against Bournemouth. They lost 3-0 at home to the Cherries last season, and the teams then played out a 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium in April.Bournemouth have actually won their last two matches at Old Trafford by a 3-0 scoreline, which should give the players confidence. However, their away form is poor this season.Andoni Iraola's men have picked up just one win, two draws and four defeats from seven games on the road. They've scored 11 goals on their travels, but they've also conceded 19 times.Bournemouth's defense was decimated in the summer. Milos Kerkez joined Liverpool, Ilya Zabarnyi moved to PSG, Dean Huijsen moved to Real Madrid and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga also left the club.Those departures have taken their toll, and Bournemouth have conceded a lot of goals this season. They've only kept one clean sheet in seven away games, which doesn't bode well for their chances of containing Man U's expensively assembled forwards on Monday.The Cherries still look strong in attack, with Antoine Semenyo and Junior Kroupi leading the charge. They've scored in six out of seven away games, and they should find the back of the net at Old Trafford.Bet Manchester United vs. Bournemouth at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet wins:Fernandes leads Man United's resurgenceManchester United are currently enjoying their strongest run of results since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager last year. The Red Devils have secured four wins, three draws and just one defeat from their last eight league games.Bruno Fernandes has been at the heart of their resurgence. The Manchester United captain has four goals and six assists in 15 games this season, and he scored twice in the 4-1 win against Wolves last time out.Mason Mount also looks back to his best, while striker Matheus Cunha always looks dangerous in attack. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo may miss this game, as they're due to play at the Africa Cup of Nations soon, but United should still have enough firepower to exploit Bournemouth's defensive frailties.It could be a tight game between two evenly matched teams, but home advantage may ultimately sway this one in Manchester United's favor.Bet Man U vs. Bournemouth at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:\n            ",

Last week saw Minnesota play its most complete game of the year, scoring its second-most points (31) while allowing its fewest (0) as J.J. McCarthy had his best game as a pro. The second-year QB had three passing touchdowns and no turnovers as he has a great chance of continuing that type of production versus Dallas' 31st-ranked scoring defense, especially with it still missing CB Trevon Diggs (knee). The Cowboys rank dead last, however, in passing defense, with additional bottom-two rankings in both third-down defense and redzone defense. The Vikings' defense is light years ahead of the Cowboys, with the former ranking No. 3 in the redzone and No. 4 against the pass. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Cowboys can coverThe Cowboys have covered in four of their last five home games in 2025, while the Vikings have dropped four of their last five, overall, versus the spread. Dallas' success is predicated on its offense, which is elite, as Dak Prescott leads the NFL in both passing yards and QBR, as the Cowboys rank first in total yards and third in points scored. At home, the Cowboys are averaging 32.7 points, which is twice as much as the 16 ppg that the Vikings are averaging outside of Minneapolis. Additionally, no team has committed more turnovers than the Vikings, who also have the league's second-worst turnover differential, and giving the ball away will only allow Dallas' high-octane offense to put more points on the scoreboard. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Cowboys 10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points.

Tigres enter with a 1-0 lead in the two-legged affair thanks to Angel Correa's solo goal as he looks to push Tigres to their first title since 2023, when they won the Clausura. Here's everything to know about the huge match which you can watch live on CBS Sports Network.How to watch Toluca vs. Tigres, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Nemesio Diez -- Toluca, MexicoTV: CBS Sports Network Odds: Toluca -105; Draw +280; Tigres +250Correa's arrival in Mexico during the summer from Atletico Madrid has pushed Tigres to new heights while also turning around his own career. After being a rotational player in Spain, Correa joined ahead of the Club World Cup and hasn't looked back, scoring 15 goals and assisting four more in all competitions for Tigres. His eight goals during the regular season helped the team cope with injuries to Andre-Pierre Gignac, and now Tigres seem well placed for when the 40-year-old eventually decides to hang up his boots. But there are titles to win first, as Gignac, Correa, and Juan Brunetta will look to give the Toluca defense fits. But that doesn't mean that Toluca will go down easily. They come in atop the pile after earning the top seed in the playoffs while also looking to defend their Clausura 2025 trophy, where they took down Club America. Behind the hot scoring of Paulinho, Antonio Mohamed's Toluca side have become a tough-to-break-down outfit, and hosting this second leg, this will be a back-and-forth affair at the Estadio Nemesio Diez. Attackers may take the headlines, but these are also the teams that allowed the fewest goals in league play, with Tigres allowing 16 and Toluca allowing 18 in their 17 matches played. Goals could be hard to come by, but with it being the second leg in a final, things could open up if one side has to chase the match late.\nIn four of the last five finals, the second leg has seen at least two goals scored, and three of those saw three or more goals scored, so going by form, there will be goals despite the strength of these defenses. Only one team can win, and with only one goal separating them, it's anyone's guess who will win the Apertura final. \n            \n    ",

Their 10-year streak of making the playoffs is over. Their nine-year streak of winning the AFC West has come to an end. And their streak of making the AFC title game in every year of Patrick Mahomes' career and the Super Bowl in each of the previous three seasons are finished as well.The Chiefs were eliminated by virtue of their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, the Buffalo Bills' victory over the New England Patriots, the Jacksonville Jaguars' win over the New York Jets and the Houston Texans' win over the Arizona Cardinals. They came into the day with only the slimmest of playoff hopes, but those hopes were dashed as they fell 16-13 in a tightly contested, defense-dominated game against their division rivals. \nThe loss was Kansas City's seventh one-score defeat of the season, with the Chiefs continuing to struggle in close contests just a year after dominating such games by going 11-0 in them during the 2024 regular season. The Chiefs were at one point 5-3 and seemingly recovered from their cold start to the season, but they lost five out of six games to fall all the way out of contention.Worse yet, Mahomes limped off the field late in the game with what appeared to be a serious knee injury. After undergoing an MRI, the team officially announced later on Sunday that the three-time Super Bowl champion suffered a torn ACL. In the announcement, Kansas City noted that Mahomes and the team are currently exploring surgical options. \nMahomes was down and in pain for several minutes and eventually had to be helped into the locker room by the training staff. Gardner Minshew entered in his place and played out the final drive for the Chiefs, only to be intercepted on his final pass attempt of the game, sealing both the loss and the Chiefs' fate. \nJust before the official news came out of Mahomes' torn ACL, he posted a message on X that seemed to indicate the severity of the injury. \n\"Don't know why this had to happen,\" Mahomes posted. \"And not going to lie it's hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Patrick Mahomes sustained a left knee injury in the Kansas City Chiefs' 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday and departed from the game with 1:53 remaining. An MRI later on Sunday confirmed that the superstar quarterback sustained a torn ACL in that knee, the team announced, and Mahomes and the team are exploring surgical options for the season-ending injury.The injury occurred while Mahomes was rolling out toward the sideline and throwing the ball downfield. A Chargers defender pulled him to the ground during the throw, and his leg bent awkwardly as he lost his footing.\"Don't know why this had to happen,\" Mahomes said on social media. \"And not going to lie it's hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever ⏰\"Mahomes remained down on the field for multiple minutes while trainers examined his leg. He was in clear discomfort and removed his helmet before rising to his feet and walking into the medical tent. Trainers then helped him walk up the tunnel and into the locker room.\n\"I don't know, but it doesn't look good,\" Reid said of the severity of Mahomes' injury before an MRI revealed the ligament damage. \"You guys saw it. We'll just see where it goes.\"The Chiefs trailed, 16-13, when Mahomes left the contest. He completed 16 of 28 passes for 189 yards without a touchdown, and he threw one interception and took five sacks. Mahomes did find the end zone with his legs, however, and took two carries for 15 yards and a touchdown. Gardner Minshew closed the game in relief of Mahomes and could not deliver a game-tying or go-ahead score.While Mahomes figures to miss the majority of the offseason as he works through his recovery and rehab processes, CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo said the timelines bode favorably for the Chiefs to have their quarterback at full strength for the 2026 season opener and beyond.\n\"The average ACL rehab is approximately 6-8 months,\" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ. \"He will miss OTAs, which come around March. But he'd be actually almost jogging by OTAs. So I have zero concerns short-term. He will have surgery within the next 48 hours. That's the best window to do that. And he will have no long-term concerns.\"Patrick Mahomes injury clouds Chiefs' outlook for 2025 and beyondWith the loss and the results in other games on Sunday, the Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention. Kansas City faced a number of elimination scenarios entering Week 15, and a string of results occurred in the early window to dash its postseason homes. The loss to the Chargers, combined with the Jaguars' win over the Jets, the Bills' win over the Patriots and the Texans' win over the Cardinals triggered a nightmare outcome for the Chiefs, who will watch the playoffs from home for the first time since 2014.The 10-year playoff streak was the second longest in NFL history behind the Patriots' 11-year run from 2009-19. This is thus the first time in Mahomes' nine-year career that he will not participate in the postseason.\nWith this appearing to be the end of the line for Mahomes in 2025, it could conclude a golden era of Chiefs football. Kansas City will await a decision this offseason from tight end Travis Kelce as he decides whether to continue playing or to enter retirement. The Mahomes-Kelce era marked one of the all-time great quarterback-tight end pairings and produced nine AFC West titles, five AFC crowns and three Super Bowl championships.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 lived up to the hype. Leading up to the slate, it was poised to be one of, if not the, defining weekend of the 2025 regular season. As the action unfolded, we started to see the playoff picture come into focus, particularly with teams that will not be vying for a Lombardi Trophy this winter. Most notably, the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were officially eliminated from playoff contention, meaning neither Patrick Mahomes nor Joe Burrow will be a factor in the AFC. That's good news for Josh Allen, who helped the Buffalo Bills rally from a 21-point deficit against the New England Patriots to keep his team's hopes of leaping into first place in the AFC East alive. Naturally, there are numerous takeaways from the pandemonium that Week 15 produced. But which of those takeaways are something that will have legs for the final three weeks, and which are merely an overreaction? Below, we'll determine just that by taking a look at some of the notable storylines from Week 15 and figure out which we should take seriously and which we should chalk up as a mere overreaction. Josh Allen has played himself into the MVP conversationOverreaction vs. reality: RealityJosh Allen was sensational in Week 15. The Bills QB kept his team's hopes of winning the division alive by rallying from a 21-point deficit over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. Allen led a second-half rally that saw Buffalo outscore New England 28-7, and the defending NFL MVP led five straight touchdown drives in the process. Allen finished the day throwing for three touchdowns to go with his 193 yards through the air and a 123.1 passer rating. \nThis was the third time this season that the Bills rallied from a deficit of 10 or more points, and the second in as many weeks. Not only does this latest comeback win keep Buffalo in range of the AFC East crown, but it should also thrust him into the MVP conversation with Drake Maye (who he just defeated) and Matthew Stafford. Allen just notched his third season with at least 25 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns, which is the most in NFL history. If he gets Buffalo back atop the division, there's a strong case for a back-to-back MVP.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Bills alive in AFC East, Chiefs eliminated, Broncos and Rams clinch\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEagles have fixed their issues on offenseOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionPhiladelphia looked like a well-oiled machine during Sunday's 31-0 win over the Raiders. Jalen Hurts completed 12 of his 15 passes for 175 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 39 yards on the ground. This was Hurts' first game with three or more passing touchdowns since Week 8, and he had just four passing touchdowns over his last five games combined. Meanwhile, the Eagles averaged 5.9 yards per play and converted 10 of their 13 third-down situations in the win. While this was encouraging for the offense, I wouldn't exhale fully if I were Philly. The Las Vegas Raiders are arguably the worst team in the NFL, and have struggled mightily in the secondary. Had the Eagles not had their way with them through the air in Week 15, it would've been a five-alarm fire. Simply put, they did what they were supposed to do and snapped a three-game losing skid in the process. Lucky for them, they get another easy matchup next week against a poor Commanders pass defense, so the good times should continue to roll. Have they actually fixed their issues, though? That remains to be seen. \nZac Taylor coached his last meaningful game for BengalsOverreaction vs. reality: RealityJoe Burrow made headlines this week when he made ominous comments about his playing future. However, I think more eyes should be on his coach. After a shutout loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati is officially eliminated from playoff contention, which should make the seat under Zac Taylor hotter than the surface of the sun. While he may not get the boot in the immediate aftermath of this contest, I believe he coached his last meaningful game for Cincinnati in Week 15, with the club potentially looking for new leadership once the regular season officially concludes. When you pair Burrow's comments with the lackluster effort we saw unfold in Week 15, this feels like an organization that has no one to inspire, which falls on the shoulders of Taylor. Jaguars are the best team in the AFC SouthOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThe Jaguars just notched their fifth straight win and is 10-4 on the season, which keeps them in first place in the AFC South. While the Jags are the No. 3 seed in the conference, I still have a hard time thinking they are the best in their own division, let alone one of the top clubs in the AFC. Trevor Lawrence was spectacular in Week 15, throwing for five touchdowns and adding a rushing score.\nAs impressive as it was, we have to point out that it came against the lowly New York Jets, and this current winning streak hasn't seen them beat a ton of powerbrokers in the NFL (Chargers, Cardinals, Titans, Colts, Jets). Next week's game at Denver will be a better barometer as to who this team actually is, and how we should view it in the overall playoff picture in the AFC. I think if you gave every playoff team in the AFC some truth serum, each would confess rather playing Jacksonville than Houston at the moment.  Shedeur Sanders played his way out as Browns QB of the futureOverreaction vs. reality: RealityIt was a memorable day for Shedeur Sanders for all the wrong reasons. The Browns quarterback struggled mightily in a 31-3 loss to the Chicago Bears, completing just 51.4% of his passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. Those turnovers should be Cleveland's biggest concern as the Browns continue to evaluate the rookie as a potential franchise quarterback. \nSanders had just two interceptions over his first three career starts, so to see the floor fall out from under him here may be the first domino that takes him out of consideration as the QB of the future. Certainly, Sanders didn't do himself any favors in convincing the Browns to steer clear of drafting a young signal-caller.  \nSeattle is fools' gold after nearly losing to Philip RiversOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThe Seahawks were nearly the butt of the joke throughout the NFL, had they not pulled off a last-minute comeback to avoid being upset by the Colts. Specifically, it would've been a horrendous look for a team earmarked for the playoffs to lose to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hadn't played an NFL game for 1,800 days. Naturally, allowing Rivers to run somewhat efficiently has folks wondering if we're viewing Seattle all wrong. Are they really as big a threat as their 11-3 record indicates? Or are they merely fools' gold, and this outing against Rivers was a glimmer of their fraudulence? With a massive showdown with the Rams on deck for Thursday, I think Seattle was simply caught sleeping a bit in this game and looking ahead to that matchup. Its strong play defensively and an offense centered around Jaxson Smith-Njigba is enough to make them dangerous in the playoffs, even if it didn't quite look like it on Sunday. Micah Parsons' injury dashes Packers' Super Bowl hopesOverreaction vs. reality: RealityWeek 15 couldn't have gone worse for the Packers. Coming into the day, they were the No. 2 seed in the conference and in first place in the NFC North. However, after losing to the Broncos, they've fallen all the way to the No. 7 seed, with the Bears leaping back ahead of them. To make matters even more dire, star pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss with what is reportedly feared to be a torn ACL. \nIf/when that injury is confirmed, Parsons' absence this season could also result in the end of Green Bay's Super Bowl hopes. Parsons was the straw that stirred the drink of their defense and led the unit with 12.5 sacks on the season. With him out of the picture, it completely changes how opposing teams game plan against them and dramatically lowers the ceiling of the defense. With a pivotal game against the Bears next week, his absence will be felt almost instantly. \n            ",

Grubbs, a three-star Notre Dame signee and the No. 31 quarterback in the 2026 recruiting cycle, connected with receiver Barrett Schulz downfield.The only problem was that Schulz, a three-star FIU signee playing in his future home stadium, was several yards short of the end zone. As he fought off several Vero Beach tacklers, Schulz turned and handed the ball off to teammate Tavarius Brundidge Jr., who found paydirt for the game-winning touchdown.\nThe exchange between Schulz and Brundidge looked close to being an illegal forward pass. Asked about that after the game, Vero Beach coach Lenny Jankowski said his team was the victim of a freak play.\"Yeah, there's a lot of things. I mean, the kid had gone out of bounds and came back in. Hats off. It was an incredible play to keep it alive. It's a freakish thing, and unfortunately we came up on the short end of it.\"\nThat play wasn't the only miraculous aspect of this win for Lake Mary, which captured its first state championship in school history. The Rams trailed 21-3 at halftime, and they were in position to win the game at the end because Vero Beach took an intentional safety with 12 seconds left.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Hawks big man Kristaps Porziņģis is expected to be sidelined for the next two weeks as he undergoes further evaluation stemming from an illness he's been dealing with, per ESPN. Porziņģis has already missed six of the team's last seven games due to the illness, and while he's going to miss some more time, the Hawks want to prioritize the long-term of this season, rather than a few more missed games in December.This isn't the first time Porziņģis has dealt with a mysterious illness. During the 2025 NBA playoffs when he was still a member of the Boston Celtics, the Latvian big man struggled with lethargy, saying, \"The breathing wasn't good. I did everything I could potentially to feel as good as I could, but my engine wasn't running the way I wanted.\" He played through the postseason, but mustered only 25 total points in Boston second-round loss to the Knicks. In four of the six games, he played fewer than 15 minutes a night.Porziņģis was later diagnosed in the offseason with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is an autonomic disorder causing rapid heart rate, and dizziness when standing as blood in the body doesn't evenly distribute across the body. After the diagnosis, Porziņģis and his doctors found ways to manage his POTS, which includes things like a high salt diet. He was able to play for the Latvian national team at EuroBasket this past summer, where he averaged 20.2 points and 8.7 rebounds over six games.\nHowever, Porziņģis, 30, said in early December, after returning from missing four consecutive games to drop 25 points, that he doesn't believe what he's dealing with currently is related to POTS.\"No, I wouldn't say it's the same thing,\" Porziņģis said after the Hawks' loss to the Nuggets on Dec. 5. \"I just wasn't feeling too good, honestly. Just not being healthy healthy, you know? But I wouldn't say it's the same stuff from last season, so that's good.  \"I think I kind of put that behind me even this summer playing for the national team, but anyway, just catching whatever it's frustrating, you know? I want to be healthy. And I will be healthy.\"\nThe hope is that a resolution will come of Porziņģis' illness, because when he's healthy he's capable of getting you a double-double one most nights as a two-way big who can space the floor out to the 3-point line and provide high-level rim protection on defense.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Coming into it, Week 15 had the potential to be the defining weekend in the NFL and it's living up to that billing. There were several playoff scenarios at play this weekend, and the overall picture is starting to crystallize. One thing that is not wrapped up, however, is the AFC East crown. The New England Patriots had an opportunity to secure the division on Sunday with a win, but the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-point deficit to keep those hopes of winning the AFC East alive for at least another week. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals are officially eliminated from the playoffs after the Baltimore Ravens secured a key AFC North win to keep their playoff pursuit going. Maybe the most significant development, however, came at Arrowhead Stadium where the Kansas City Chiefs have been officially eliminated from playoff contention. Moreover, Patrick Mahomes left the contest late in the fourth quarter due to a left knee injury, which has since been revealed to be a torn ACL. The late afternoon window then took the baton from the early slate, and ran with it. The Los Angeles Rams clinched a playoff berth with their win over the Detroit Lions, as did the Denver Broncos after outlasting the Green Bay Packers in a heavyweight showdown from Mile High. Meanwhile, the Carolina Panthers had an opportunity to sit atop the NFC South, but found themselves on the wrong end of the scoreboard with the New Orleans Saints pulling off the upset. \nWith an epic Week 15 slate unfolding before our eyes, now is the perfect time to take a live look at the playoff picture. Below, we'll break down who's currently in and out of the postseason.AFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-2)New England Patriots (11-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Buffalo Bills (10-4)Houston Texans (9-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersAfter winning their 11th straight game thanks to a 34-26 victory against the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos are 12-2 and have officially clinched a playoff berth. They have a solid cushion in the AFC West, and have even more breathing room in their pursuit of the No. 1 seed thanks to Buffalo defeating the New England Patriots. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had an opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over Buffalo on Sunday, but blew a 21-point lead in Week 15 to snap their winning streak. New England remains in first place in the division, but the Bills are lurking. \nBeyond Buffalo, this loss currently doesn't help the Patriots in their pursuit of Denver for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars have now won five straight games following a blowout victory against the New York Jets. That helps keep them in first place in the AFC South over the surging Houston Texans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensPittsburgh is back in first place in the AFC North after defeating the Ravens; however, there's still a lot to be determined in this division. Baltimore just took down the Cincinnati Bengals, so a lot will be riding on the Steelers' matchup against the Miami Dolphins on Monday night, especially with another head-to-head matchup with Baltimore still on deck in Week 18. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers notched their 10th win of the season and eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs from playoff contention on Sunday with a nail-biting win at Arrowhead. That victory not only keeps them as the No. 1 wild card team, but they are still within range of Denver in the AFC West. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt cannot be overstated how important Buffalo's comeback win over the Patriots was. After erasing another double-digit deficit, the Bills are still alive in the AFC East race, meaning there is still a line to a higher seed and a home playoff game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (9-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have clawed back into the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed and are coming off an impressive win over the Cardinals at home. They've now won six straight and are on the heels of the Jaguars in the AFC South, so there is room for this climb to go even higher.\nIn the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward, especially after being unable to pull off the upset in Seattle. The team that may have the best chance of this group to make the postseason is the Ravens (7-7), especially after shutting out the Bengals to move back to .500 on the year. That has them right behind the Steelers (who play on Monday) in the AFC North with one more head-to-head still to go in the regular-season finale.Surprisingly, the Dolphins (6-7) are still lurking on the outskirts after winning four straight games, but a lot needs to go right. On top of likely needing to win out, Miami would need some wild card contenders to collapse, as it currently loses head-to-head tiebreakers to the Colts, Chargers and Ravens. \n\n        \n            \n                Predicting the entire 2025 NFL playoff bracket and Super Bowl winner as we enter Week 15\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC standingsx-Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Chicago Bears (10-4)Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Seattle Seahawks (11-3)San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)x-clinched playoff berth  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams have officially clinched a playoff berth after taking down the Detroit Lions in Week 15. Not only did they punch their ticket to the postseason, but this win helped L.A. keep both the Seahawks and 49ers at arm's length as both NFC West rivals are hot on their heels. Next week's matchup against Seattle will prove to be monumental in securing the division. Right now, however, Sean McVay and Co. are in the driver's seat for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (10-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears have notched double-digit wins on the season after soundly taking down the Cleveland Browns at Soldier Field. Thanks to the Denver Broncos defeating the Packers, Chicago has vaulted back up to first place in the NFC North and are currently the No. 2 seed in the conference. Of course, this puts even more emphasis on what was already a massive matchup with Green Bay next week. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a blowout win against the Raiders. Jalen Hurts bounced back nicely with three passing touchdowns, and the victory helps the Eagles hold firm atop the NFC East. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEven after that demoralizing loss to the Falcons on Thursday, the Buccaneers come out of Week 15 in first place in the NFC South. That's thanks to the New Orleans Saints upsetting the Carolina Panthers to push them to 7-7 on the season. Tampa Bay holds the tiebreaker over Carolina at the moment due to a better win percentage against common opponents. However, both head-to-head matchups are still on deck, which will kick off next week in Carolina. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (11-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle barely escaped Week 15 with a win. The club let Philip Rivers hang around just long enough to put the Colts within range of an upset, but a game-winning field goal drive with 18 seconds left in regulation helped secure the win. The Seahawks are now 11-3, which has then neck-and-neck with the Rams for first place in the NFC West. L.A. currently holds the tiebreaker due to a head-to-head win back in Week 11, but these two will square off on Thursday.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if their division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. \nThere's a world where the 49ers could surprisingly jump much higher in the standings if certain pieces fall their way over the next three weeks. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)Remaining schedule: at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and in first place in the NFC North, they've suddenly dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed after falling to the Denver Broncos. That defeat helped Chicago move on top of the Packers for first place in the division, which puts an even greater emphasis on next week's matchup. Even worse, pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss due to a serious knee injury. Because Green Bay swept the season series over the Lions, the Packers have some wiggle room to play with before falling out of the playoff picture entirely. \nIn the huntThe Lions (8-6) have their backs against the wall a bit after falling to the Los Angeles Rams. That defeat continues to keep them on the outside looking in on the playoff picture as the No. 8 seed as they are in third place in the NFC North. They aren't out of the race quite yet, but they certainly need to win out and get some help along the way. The Carolina Panthers (7-7) had a golden opportunity to create some space between them and the Buccaneers for first place in the NFC South, simply needing a win over the Saints to move to 8-6, while Tampa Bay stumbled to 7-7 with a loss to Atlanta on Thursday. However, the Panthers allowed New Orleans to pull off the upset, which sent them back to .500 on the season. Because they're knotted with Bucs, they lose the tiebreaker due to an inferior record against common opponents. Of course, the Panthers can get back into it with two of their remaining three games on the season against Tampa.  The Cowboys (6-7-1) are on life support after losing to the Vikings on Sunday night, all but ending any hopes of securing a postseason berth. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former Ohio State coach and multiple national champion Urban Meyer is sympathizing with the family of Sherrone Moore following his firing this week at Michigan, stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Meyer says the conversation is independent of football after Moore was arrested and charged with felony home invasion and stalking after the ordeal.\"Last night, I said a prayer for that family. I mean, you've got three little girls,\" Meyer said on this week's The Triple Option Podcast. \"You've got a guy that was on top of the world a week ago. They're up 6-0 on the Buckeyes at home. And then, also, you wake up, and they're in this situation. Rivalries aside, this is all human element. \"Now, this is something that, from what you read, that's some serious stuff that went on. And just, all of a sudden, you start seeing the impact. Forget football. Who cares about football?''Moore, a 39-year-old married father of three, was terminated for cause following a university investigation that signaled a clear violation of policy. Michigan likely will be off the hook for nearly all of Moore's $14 million buyout since he was fired for cause.\nMeyer went 83–9 in nearly seven full seasons at Ohio State and was unbeaten against Michigan before stepping down in 2018. In 2021, he served as coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars for only 13 games before he was fired during a tumultuous season, that included missing a plane ride home after a road game, locker room issues and a former player accusing Meyer of kicking him during warmups. Meyer denied the incident, but the team fired him later that same day.Michigan finished 8-5 in Moore's debut season last fall before improving to 9-3 this year. The Wolverines had a chance to be in the final College Football Playoff discussion during rivalry weekend prior to a loss to the Buckeyes. Moore served a two-game suspension to start this season for his involvement in the sign-stealing scandal centered around Connor Stalions during the Jim Harbaugh era.\nAs it stands, Michigan is preparing for a Citrus Bowl appearance against Texas under interim coach Biff Poggi. Moore's last call with media prior to his firing was a call with reporters surrounding the Wolverines' postseason matchup and how many players were considering skipping the contest. Moore would not answer a question concerning NIL contract language involving certain Michigan players being incentivized to play in the game. He also said Michigan wouldn't know how many of its draft-eligible players would opt-out of the matchup in Orlando, but expected \"a lot more playing than not playing.\"\"We just really want guys that want to play in the game,\" Moore said. \"You don't want to have to promote people based on [if] they get rev share to play in the game. You want guys that just want to play football.\" \nJust under 72 hours later, Moore was fired and soon after detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township prior to charges being filed. In the aftermath of Moore's firing, Michigan is now looking inward and the university's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The New York Giants got a scare in the fourth quarter when Jaxson Dart exited the game after taking a hit from two Washington Commanders defenders. Dart was able to return a few plays later, but it prompted more questions about how the Giants and interim coach Mike Kafka are protecting their franchise quarterback.On a first-and-goal play, Dart tried to run for a touchdown when he was met by Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman, who make up a combined 639 pounds of defensive lineman. Dart left the field and took the well-trodden path to the blue injury tent.\nFortunately for the Giants, Dart was able to return for the fourth-down play, but the rookie quarterback has taken too many hits like that throughout the season. In November, Dart missed two games due to a concussion. Despite that -- and today's scare -- Kafka said the team won't change much about its offensive game plan.   \"We're not gonna change much in terms of how we play the game,\" Kafka said. \"I think just having the thought process for how we scheme it up. We had a couple opportunities where he's protected and he's got somebody in front of him. On that one particular play where he got out, that was a pass. I think there's not much you can do there. Of course we have his health, and everyone's health, in mind when we call plays.\"\nKafka added that Dart's mobility is one of his \"great strengths, and there's no denying that. Dart ran six times for 63 yards against the Commanders. It's just a matter of Dart recognizing when to protect himself.\"He knows,\" Kafka said. \"He's a smart football player. He knows when he needs to protect himself and when he needs to go make a play. I trust him to do that. That's probably the most important thing. The guys on the field trust him to do that.\"\nThe 2-12 Giants have three games remaining, and the team has been out of playoff contention for a while now. (New York does, however, at the moment, still own the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.) Keeping Dart healthy down the stretch should be a priority for New York, but it sounds like the team won't be holding him back on the ground.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer ended all speculation Sunday afternoon alluding to potential interest in the Michigan vacancy with the Crimson Tide set to Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff next week. DeBoer was considered among the best fits for the Wolverines soon after Sherrone Moore's firing earlier this week.DeBoer was scheduled to meet with media on Monday, but released a statement ahead of that appearance.\"My family and I are very happy in Tuscaloosa and remain extremely grateful for the support of President Mohler, Greg Byrne, the board and so many others,\" DeBoer said through Yea Alabama, the Crimson Tide's NIL collective. \"We have an incredible opportunity in front of us, so my sole focus is on Alabama football and our preparations to play Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff. I have not spoken and have no interest in speaking with anyone else about any other job. I am fully committed to this program and look forward to continuing as the head football coach at the University of Alabama.\"In his second season with the Crimson Tide after taking Washington to the 2023 national championship game, DeBoer is 19-7 at Alabama, which faces Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff on Friday night.\n\"We are proud to have Coach DeBoer leading our football program at The University of Alabama,\" Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne said in a statement. \"He is an incredible coach and does an excellent job with the development of our student-athletes, both on and off the field. Just as he is committed to this team, we are committed to him, and we look forward to taking the field Friday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\"DeBoer's statement came after Ryan Williams and other players mentioned rumors on social media being difficult to avoid.\"Yeah, of course we see it on TV, but I mean, he's gave his best effort here,\" Williams said Friday. \"Focused on playing against Oklahoma, we're not really worried about it. ... I mean, at the end of the day, he serves us 100% and that's our coach, so we're going to play for him. External noise is external noise, so we just focus on the internal.\"\nThis isn't the first job opening this cycle where DeBoer's name immediately emerged. DeBoer denied previous speculation about the Penn State vacancy prior to the Nittany Lions' hiring of Matt Campbell, but had not addressed the Michigan situation until Sunday.DeBoer and the Crimson Tide's chief focus can now be on the Sooners after a previous loss to Oklahoma last month put Alabama in several playoff elimination games down the stretch. The Crimson Tide suffered three giveaways during that 23-21 setback in Tuscaloosa despite doubling Oklahoma in total yardage and largely dominating the contest.The Alabama-Oklahoma winner plays unbeaten and top-seeded Indiana at the Rose Bowl in the quarterfinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        South Carolina is entering the 2025-26 season as the national champion runner-up and the No. 2 team in the nation, but the Gamecocks are having to adjust after losing star forward Chloe Kitts to a torn ACL. Although it is a significant loss, coach Dawn Staley said the team still feels confident moving forward without her.\"It's not like we're going to ask someone to be Chloe because that's impossible,\" Staley said at the SEC media day on Tuesday. \"But we're unafraid to go into the season without Chloe. We're not going to skip a beat. Our players know that anytime we sustain any kind of injury, we believe in the system that we put together. We believe in the players we've assembled.\"...We'll figure out a way and we'll make adjustments. I'm somewhat glad it happened at this time when you don't have to make adjustments midseason. You go with who is healthy to go.\"\nKitts has been a key part of South Carolina's back-to-back championship appearances. She started 38 games last year while averaging 10.2 points and a team-best 7.7 rebounds per game. Her veteran leadership will still be valuable from the sideline, but her teammates roles will have to change without her on the court.Florida State transfer Ta'Niya Latson has been the most talked-about addition to the roster since she led the nation in scoring last year. However, former Mississippi State center Madina Okot will also play an important role in the frontcourt with Kitts out and forward Ashlyn Watkins taking this season off to work on her personal life. Last season with the Bulldogs, Okot averaged 11.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks in the 34 games she started. \nMeanwhile, forward Joyce Edwards had a strong freshman season coming off the bench. She led the Gamecocks in scoring with 12.7 points per contest and was the third most consistent rebounder behind Kitts and Watkins.\"Joyce is probably going to take the brunt of it because she just has more playing experience under us, but the same conversations I'm having with Joyce, with or without Chloe, I'm having,\" Staley said.Staley's rosters typically have depth and don't rely on one particular player. In this particular area, the coach pointed out that sophomore Adhel Tac is \"much improved\" and senior Maryam Dauda is playing \"extremely well.\"\"I just really need them to be themselves,\" Staley said of her players. \nThe Gamecocks will tip off their 2025-26 season on Nov. 3 against Grand Canyon.\n            ",

However, she doesn't believe the league is getting a female head coach anytime soon.\"If I'm the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,\" Staley said during Tuesday's SEC media day. \"It's going to be about being a female coach. So you as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach.\"Staley said she took the interview with the Knicks because she has known team president Leon Rose for decades. The team ultimately hired Mike Brown, who was most recently the coach of the Sacramento Kings from 2022-25 and ended that tenure with a 107-88 overall record. Staley also interviewed for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021.Ultimately, not getting an NBA job was not a big loss for Staley, whose Gamecocks have won two of the last four national championships. \n        \n            \n                Women's college basketball AP Top 25: UConn takes No. 1 spot in preseason poll ahead of South Carolina\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NBA job interviews were serious, but Staley admitted she might not really have it in her to be that kind of trailblazer. She was also asked if she thinks there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime, and she wasn't feeling too confident about it. \n\"No, I don't,\" Staley said. \"And I hope I'm wrong.\"That being said, she would be happy to help any woman who wants to try. \"If there is somebody that is interested in knowing and interested in being the first female NBA coach, I've got all the information,\" Staley said. \"Come see me, because I'll get you prepared for the interview. \n\"And if there are NBA franchises that are interested in hiring a female, I'm here, too, because you've got to be ready to take that on and all the things that it comes with because it's not just about hiring the first female coach.\"\n            ",

Use my full name, Nicholas Mangold, and my birthday, 1/13/1984. I am deeply grateful to anyone that would consider donating.Most of all, I'm thankful for my family, who have been my rock every step of the way. This situation has reminded me how lucky I am to have such an amazing family, friends, and community behind me.While this has been a tough stretch, I'm staying positive and focused on the path ahead. I'm looking forward to better days and getting back to full strength soon.

    "body": "\n        Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put together one of the all-time great individual seasons for an NBA star in the 2024-25 season when he became the first player to win the league's scoring title, MVP, Finals MVP and a championship in the same season since Michael Jordan pulled off the same astonishing feat in 1997-98.  And yet, despite producing a season we haven't seen in almost 30 years, I found myself on an island when ranking Gilgeous-Alexander in the top spot as the CBS Sports staff put together its Top 100 players in the NBA ahead of the 2025-26 season. That is because Nikola Jokić is busy rewriting history books himself, and he is a more than worthy candidate for that No. 1 position. The three-time MVP produced the best statistical season of his career in 2024-25, averaging a monstrous triple-double (29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists) and doing so on outrageous efficiency (66.3% true shooting).  \n        \n            \n                NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat I won't do here is argue against Jokić's greatness or insinuate he is anything short of an all-time great. I will state the case for Gilgeous-Alexander occupying the top spot for the upcoming season, as I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a superstar with similar dominance, but at the point guard position.  \nGilgeous-Alexander is the best version of the traditional, three-level scoring guard we've seen since Jordan. Even at his peak, Kobe Bryant didn't match the ruthless efficiency with which Gilgeous-Alexander operates as a high-volume scorer, never topping 46.9% from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander, meanwhile, has averaged north of 30 points per game in three straight seasons, shooting 51.0% or better in all of them.  Beyond the efficiency, what separates Gilgeous-Alexander as a scorer from many of his contemporaries is his consistency. He has become the thing that separates the elite from just the greats -- inevitable. There are plenty of players in the NBA capable of great things in any given game, but an exceptional few who reach that level on a nightly basis. He has counters prepared for every defensive approach, allowing him to continue getting to his spots (and, yes, the foul line), scoring with efficiency, and keeping the Oklahoma City offense on track -- avoiding the pitfalls of grinding OKC's offense to a halt while trying to create for himself.  He scored fewer than 20 points in a game one time in the 2024-25 regular season (an 18-point outing in the fourth game of the season) while scoring 30 or more on 49 occasions. In the playoffs, he had three outings below 20 points, while scoring 30 or more in 15 of the Thunder's 23 playoff games en route to the title, even while struggling with his three-point shot against defenses trying to force anyone else to beat them.  \nFor as much as we discuss Jokić orchestrating everything for the Nuggets, Gilgeous-Alexander serves as an equally important engine for Oklahoma City. His 34.8% usage rate last season was third in the league, behind only LaMelo Ball and Giannis Antetokounmpo, with a key difference being SGA was doing so on the league's third best offense (119.2 offensive rating) -- Antetokounmpo's Bucks were 10th (115.1) and Ball's Hornets were 29th (106.7).  It's exceedingly rare for a team as successful and efficient as the Thunder to rely so heavily on one player for creation, but that's a testament to Gilgeous-Alexander's abilities as both a scorer and facilitator. He pulls all of the strings for the Thunder and has learned how to toe the line between being an elite scorer and individual creator, while also keeping his teammates involved and engaged. Gilgeous-Alexander is tasked with making the right decisions with the ball almost all the time and does so astonishingly well, as his efficiency extends beyond scoring. He turns it over at a freakishly low rate, as his 8.6% turnover rate is the lowest of any of the top 20 in usage rate in the NBA last season.  Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now: \nGilgeous-Alexander couples that offensive prowess with high-level defense, operating as a plus-defender like a select few of his elite offensive peers. He led the league in defensive win shares last year (4.8), unquestionably a byproduct of a dominant team defense from Oklahoma City, but he plays his part in making the Thunder elite on defense both at the point of attack and as a versatile, switchable cog in the machine.  That two-way ability puts Gilgeous-Alexander in a rare breed of superstar. It is what makes the Thunder not just a title contender but the runaway favorite entering the season. At 27 years old, the Canadian star is just entering his prime, and the terrifying proposition for the rest of the league is that it's possible he's still capable of being even better, with a long runway in front of him to rack up more accolades, titles and awards.  Jokić is the current gold standard for sustained excellence as a superstar. He has three MVPs and two runner-up finishes in the last five years, producing stat lines never seen from anyone, much less a center. However, I believe Gilgeous-Alexander has a chance to pull off a similar run at the point guard position. He benefits from having the longest title window possible in the modern NBA with the construction of this Thunder team, but make no mistake, they're in that position because of him.  \nThe SGA era may very well be upon us, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's carrying the torch as the league's best player for years to come.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The ACC released its preseason predicted order of finish on Tuesday ahead of the 2025-26 college basketball season.Duke was picked to win the conference in the annual preseason poll, while NC State forward Darrion Williams was given conference preseason Player of the Year honors. Williams transferred from Texas Tech to NC State to play for first-year coach Will Wade this offseason.After reaching the Final Four for the first time in the Jon Scheyer era, Duke will look to get back to college basketball's biggest stage with a handful of key newcomers on the roster. One of those players is former five-star forward Cameron Boozer -- the son of former NBA great and Duke player Carlos Boozer -- who is in contention to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft.\n        \n            \n                AP Top 25 poll reactions: North Carolina overrated, Kansas underrated in preseason college basketball rankings\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRounding out the top five of the ACC standings behind Duke are Louisville, North Carolina, NC State and Virginia. Two of those teams will have first-year coaches in Wade (at NC State) and Ryan Odom (at Virginia). Odom was hired this offseason to replace former coach Tony Bennett, who retired just weeks before Virginia's season-opener last fall.Here is the full poll, followed by overrated and underrated observations from the predicted order of finish. \nACC preseason predicted order of finishRankSchool (First-place votes)Points1Duke (34)8662Louisville (15)8423North Carolina7414NC State7105Virginia6236SMU6167Clemson5108Miami5009Syracuse48910Notre Dame47711Wake Forest41212Virginia Tech35513Georgia Tech31514Pitt30115Florida State22116California15617Stanford13818Boston College107\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Overrated: North CarolinaPredicted finish: 3I wrote about North Carolina earlier this week and why they were labeled \"overrated\" in our annual preseason AP Top 25 poll overview. The Tar Heels were preseason ranked No. 25 in that poll, and I explained why NC State should've gotten the nod at the final spot, so it's only right to double down because UNC was picked ahead of NC State in this poll, too.This season is going to be a make-or-break year for UNC coach Hubert Davis. After getting into the NCAA Tournament as one of the final four teams in the field, UNC will have to be better this season to avoid sweating on Selection Sunday. UNC's resume included just one win over a ranked opponent and the Tar Heels went 0-3 against Duke. I do like North Carolina's frontcourt of Caleb Wilson and Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar. Alabama transfer Jarin Stevenson is also someone who could contribute to winning. I still think UNC is an NCAA Tournament team, but the Tar Heels are going to have to show up in marquee nonconference games against Kentucky, Kansas and Michigan State this season. Betting odds to win conference +700\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     Underrated: NC StatePredicted finish: 4The hype around NC State is real. Less than two years removed from a miraculous run to the Final Four under former coach Kevin Keatts, Wade has assembled a roster that can compete for the ACC crown right away. \nThe obvious headliner from NC State's portal class is Williams, who played a huge role in Texas Tech reaching the Elite Eight this past spring. Williams is a bulldozer down low and is a matchup nightmare for smaller defenders. He can raise the floor and ceiling of this group. Tre Holloman (Michigan State), Terrance Arceneaux (Kentucky) and Ven-Allen Lubin (North Carolina) are three more names I'm keeping an eye on. I wouldn't be shocked if NC State finishes in the top three of the ACC standings. Betting odds to win conference +700\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Overrated: VirginiaPredicted finish: 5Last season was chaotic for Virginia, as the program finished ninth in the ACC with an 8-12 conference record. The Cavaliers went out and hired Odom away from his post at VCU to bring life back into the program. The hire was good in a nutshell, but I have questions about the roster that make me think Virginia could finish below fifth in the final conference standings.I also like some of the teams behind Virginia, such as SMU, Clemson, Miami and Syracuse (more on them shortly). The name I'm keeping an eye on this season is San Francisco transfer Malik Thomas, who averaged nearly 20 points per game last season. If he can bring scoring to a team that finished No. 346 among all Division I teams in scoring offense, Virginia could outperform its preseason ranking. Betting odds to win conference +2200\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Underrated: SyracusePredicted finish: 9Similar to Davis at North Carolina, this is also a make-or-break season for coach Adrian Autry at Syracuse. The program finished 14-19 last season (7-13 in ACC play) and missed the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive season.Syracuse is my sleeper team in the ACC this year. J.J. Starling returns and the program also added a pair of top-35 recruits from the 2025 cycle in Sadiq White Jr. and Kiyan Anthony, who is the son of former Syracuse great and NBA legend Carmelo Anthony. Outside of the top four or five teams, the ACC is wide open. Look for Syracuse to finish in the top half of the ACC standings. Betting odds to win conference +5000All sports betting odds via DraftKings sportsbook, check out the latest DraftKings promos to get in the game.\nPreseason All-ACC First TeamPlayerSchoolCameron BoozerDukeMarkus BurtonNotre DameDarrion WilliamsNC StateMikel Brown Jr.LouisvilleRyan ConwellLouisvilleSecond TeamPlayerSchoolIsaiah EvansDukeBoopie MillerSMUJ.J.

The former blue-chip recruit primarily came off the bench during his freshman season and despite receiving some draft buzz, decided to return to school for his sophomore season.Evans has been compared to former Duke player and current member of the Toronto Raptors, Brandon Ingram. Evans shot 41.6% from the 3-point line last season in 13.7 minutes per game. He has a chance to solidify himself as Duke's second-best player behind Boozer. If he does that, he will be in the running to earn first-team ACC honors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     Overrated: Ryan Conwell, G, Louisville It's never easy to single out any player on these lists, but if I had to choose one, it would be Conwell. Part of that reasoning is how much of a step forward I think Evans will take at Duke this season. The other factor is that Louisville is loaded with talent. I firmly believe that Mikel Brown Jr. -- whether it's from Day 1 or in March -- will be the Cardinals' best player. \nConwell was one of several key newcomers on Louisville's roster. He had a fantastic season at Xavier and posted similar scoring numbers during his 2023-24 season at Indiana State. Conwell is a volume 3-point shooter who will help tremendously. Part of my reasoning is that there will be a lot of mouths to feed, which could open the door for someone like Evans to land on the first team over Conwell.\n            ",

Kiffin's fifth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels are one of only two unbeaten SEC teams left on the board and are looking to win their second straight against the No. 9 Georgia Bulldogs for the only the second time since 1990.\"I think in five years, in the regular season, they've only lost to Alabama and then in our game here last year ... so it's a very challenging team to always play, especially there,\" Kiffin said. \"So we're going to have to have a great week of preparation and prepare to go on the road in a very tough environment with elite players and a phenomenal coaching staff, led by Kirby (Smart) and what he's been able to do.\"I said yesterday in the call (with media) when asked that he finds a way to win a lot of games in a lot of different styles and overcome a lot of adversity in games and keep his team together. That's why he's the best coach in college football now.\" Gunning for their first playoff appearance in program history, the Rebels control their destiny the rest of the way with Saturday's game marking one of only two left on the slate against a ranked opponent.\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss is the Rebels' breakout star, who signed after spring camp from Division II Ferris State to be Austin Simmons' primary backup. However, with Simmons on the mend in recent weeks, Chambliss led Ole Miss to several marquee victories including a 24-19 decision over LSU.\"They get the best players in the country and Kirby, I think like coach Saban, recruits size and speed and it's always really obvious with them, especially in warmups when you're out there,\" Kiffin said.\nOver his first five seasons, Kiffin has three top 15 finishes and in the portal era, has shown an adept acumen for transfer talent. That's a different philosophy for the most part from Smart's recruiting strengths, but Kiffin has a chance to do what few have done in the SEC against him this weekend — beat him for the second straight year.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        This season marks 34 years on the college basketball sidelines for Arkansas coach John Calipari. With other old-guard coaches backing out of the sport by the year, those unable or unwilling to fully embrace the NIL and revenue-sharing era could soon be extinct. And Calipari made it clear at SEC Media Days Tuesday that he is part of that contingent.Imminent retirement may not be on the table for the three-time National Coach of the Year, but if his methodology proves untenable, he said that is when he would call it a career.\"I want to help 25 to 30 more families,\" Calipari said. \"The only way you do that is you're transformational as a coach. You're not transactional. If I become transactional -- I'm going to pay you this to do this and that -- then I won't do this anymore. I don't need to.\"\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Each AP Top 25 team's strengths, weaknesses and depth chart entering 2025-26\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCalipari's final years at Kentucky came with a clear ceiling, and many attributed the early-round NCAA Tournament exits to his staunch commitment to an outdated model. Calipari was as successful as they came when recruiting one-and-done elite high school prospects was a surefire method to reach the Final Four. But as the transfer portal led teams to stock up on veteran standouts and resulted in experienced teams winning championships, Calipari fell behind.\"I think all of those said I've done what I do, and I'm not willing to do 'all this' to stay in the profession,\" said Calipari. \"If you watched us in practice, you would say, 'He's still connected.' I'll know before anybody else that it's transactional now. That's why if someone put their name in the portal, I said, 'You're not coming back,' because it's not going to be transactional. If this is what you want, let's go, let's work together.\"\nMost first-year coaches load up on transfer talent to construct their debut rosters. Despite inheriting an empty locker room at Arkansas, Calipari took just two transfers from programs not named Kentucky. High school recruits, and those who followed him from his old school, made up his Sweet 16 squad.One of the \"transactional\" elements of college basketball with which Calipari says he disagrees is the constant transferring from program to program in search of paydays. Players who seek to use every last ounce of their eligibility to capitalize on their earnings potential also do not fit into the Calipari model. The second-year Razorbacks coach wants to reform those realities at a sport-wide level.\"Part of the reason I'm still doing this, my son is in coaching,\" said Calipari. \"We've gotta fix some of this stuff before we're out for our own children. Right now, the things we're dealing with, we want to put it to other people, but the thing is filtered down to the coach and coaches. …\n\"Why would kids want to stay in school five extra years? For money. Well, we've gotta say 'You've got five years to play four, and that's it. That's all.' If we get those two things in order, we're on the path to being better.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Three weeks away from the 2025 NFL season's trade deadline, the Dallas Cowboys are at a crossroads in terms of how their football team is playing.The offense and defense are literally polar opposites of each other: the Cowboys' offense is third in scoring (29.7 points per game) and first in total yards per game (387.5), but the defense ranks 31st in points (30.7) and last in total yards (411.7) allowed per game.The 2025 Cowboys (2-3-1) are on track to become NFL's third team ever with the most offensive yards gained and defensive yards allowed per game alongside the 1955 Chicago Bears (8-4 finish) and the 1985 San Diego Chargers (8-8 record). Those teams missed the playoffs.Yet, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones is certainly open to making a trade before the Nov. 4 deadline.\n\"We have thought all along that if we see a way to improve this year with a trade at the deadline, then we'll take advantage of it,\" Jones said Tuesday. \"That's what we positioned for to start this year -- to have ammunition to do things if we have an opportunity. ... I don't have a trade in mind right now at all. If that comes about right now if someone is on the phone calling.\"If there were a trade to be made, Jones would likely look at doing so on the defensive side of the ball to help the aforementioned scoring and total defenses. Dallas is equipped to make a blockbuster deal since the Cowboys are equipped with four first-round picks across the next two draft after trading All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay for Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-rounders.The last time Jones pulled the trigger on an in-season trade around the deadline and parted with a first-round pick was during the 2018 season. That's when the Cowboys started 3-4 in their first year without Dez Bryant, the franchise's all-time leader in receiving touchdowns (73). Following a narrow 20-17 defeat at Washington in Week 7 of that year, the Cowboys parted with their 2019 first-round pick the next day and acquired Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper from the Raiders. That move sparked Dallas to a 7-2 finish, ending the regular season with a 10-6 record and atop NFC East.\nWould Jones consider making a trade of that magnitude in 2025 to help his ailing defense? He was quick to point out that Clark only counts for $3 million on the Cowboys' 2025 cap sheet this season after being traded over from the Packers a week before the season kicked off.That puts Dallas in a place where making a deal for 2024 NFL sacks leader and Cincinnati Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson, hypothetically speaking, feasible. Dallas currently has $31.145 million in cap space, which is the NFL's second-highest figure this season behind only the New England Patriots ($53.653 million), according to OverTheCap.com. Hendrickson's 2025 cap hit is $25.166 million.\"If there is a trade that would help the defense, we're in position to make that trade,\" Jones said. \"I want to remind everybody... one of the great things about our trade that we had with Green Bay is that our tackle [Clark] makes about $22 million a year. He costs us, too. We're getting a 20-something million-dollar player for $2 million, $3 million right now, and he's playing about as well as anybody on [our] defense. Why do I bring that up? That alone has increased our flexibility of being able to look at potential trades right whereas you might have had hand cramps before.\n\"So, we're in position to look at a trade. That doesn't mean we're going to make one. We certainly had in mind when we started the season that we were going to have ammo to be more flexible in terms of what we do with the roster as we move along this year and, of course, as we get into the next couple of years.\"While most of the conversation with Jones was spent addressing the nature of his underachieving defense, he made sure to note the high-level play of both quarterback Dak Prescott, who has thrown for 10 touchdowns and no interceptions in the past three games, and wide receiver George Pickens, who has a receiving touchdown in five consecutive games.Jones alluded to the potential of getting All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (ankle sprain), rookie first-round pick and right guard Tyler Booker (ankle sprain) and All-Pro returner/wide receiver KaVontae Turpin (foot) back in Week 7 for the Cowboys' game against the Washington Commanders. The team hopes to get all three on the practice field this week and test their potential availability for Sunday, coach Brian Schottenheimer said Monday.\n\"Our offense is playing at a level that, we can play better, but I'm pretty proud of how we played so far,\" Jones said Tuesday. \"We do have some serious help on the way, and that's part of the reason I feel as good as I do, because Dak is playing outstanding.\"Certainly, Pickens is playing outstanding. And we've got some other people that are really doing their part that are showing up. I'm going to be pretty general here because I like what we're doing over there [on offense].\"Another element that Jones, team chief operating officer Stephen Jones and vice president of player personnel Will McClay will factor into their calculus when weighing the possibility of a deadline deal are explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown (knee) and rookie third-round pick cornerback Shavon Revel (knee) potentially returning.\nOvershown has been working out on the resistance cords with the Cowboys' rehab group off to the side at practice lately. The linebacker's availability is a topic for every team personnel meeting when the front office and coaching staff discusses players who are rehabbing injuries. He doesn't anticipate Overshown returning until at least after the Cowboys' mid-November Week 10 bye.\"It does add to try to speculate on how Overshown is going to impact this defense,\" Jones said. \"It's speculation at best. The same thing with Revel. We hear about him doing things out here that are just amazing, but he hasn't played in the NFL. You know that's going to cost you some place if he's on the field.\"So, that's part of the nuances that you have to work through. We will weigh what are the likelihood of the players that we've got coming back, how they will impact and where that will put this team as opposed to if we should add a player in a trade.\"\nWill Jones kick off extension talks with WR George Pickens?Pickens has been everything that Dallas hoped for when it landed the electrifying wide receiver and a 2027 sixth-round pick in early May's deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2026 third-rounder and 2027 fifth-rounder. His six receiving touchdowns tie the Detroit Lions' Amon-Ra St. Brown atop the NFL this season, and Pickens' 525 receiving yards rank third.Pickens is having an impact similar to the aforementioned Cooper -- Pickens is tied for the most receiving touchdowns (six) in a player's first six games with the Cowboys since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, according to CBS Sports research.Jones concurred, which is why he's thinking about carving out future cap space for the 24-year-old Pickens next offseason.\n\"Well, again, I don't want to sit here, and as you know, that even has a competition to it in its very aspect of it,\" Jones said when asked if he would begin contract talks with Pickens. \"He is doing more than we could, than we did expect or that we could have expected. What's really special is he's a real plus to have around the team. He's a real plus around his teammates. He's a great plus around those coaches. Those coaches really think highly of him, and so he's not only doing it on the field. He's doing it as a part of the team concept. That's very important and, in his particular case, should be noted.\"We'll weigh that. We knew full well that if things really went like we wanted them to go, certainly, we need to think about having some room available if we're going to pay a second receiver at that level.\"Remorseful about Dak Prescott having a Tony Romo-like career trajectoryA case can be made that no one in the NFL this season is quarterbacking at a higher level than Prescott. He enters Week 7 leading the NFL or ranking in the top five across a multitude of passing statistics despite playing missing Lamb, center Cooper Beebe (ankle sprain) and Booker the past three weeks.\nPrescott's current 71.6% completion rate would rank as the highest in NFL history by a player who also led the league in pass attempts, according to NFL Pro. Prescott leads the NFL with 229 passing attempts entering Week 7.Dak Prescott This Season, NFL RanksNFL RankCompletion Percentage71.6%4thPass Attempts2291stCompletions 1641stPass Yards1,6172ndPass TD132ndPasser Rating104.69thSack Rate3.0%3rdCompletions of 25-Plus Yards171stAcknowledging Prescott's high-level play led to Jones getting remorseful about the years in which Dallas contended for Super Bowls with Prescott but ultimately fell short. The Cowboys' 61.3% regular-season-winning percentage (78-49-1) with Prescott as their starter is the eighth-best rate among 28 quarterbacks to start at least 70 games in the span of his career since 2016.That's right in line with his predecessor Tony Romo, who went 78-49 (61.4%) as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. Romo's was good for the seventh-best mark among 24 quarterbacks to start at least 70 games in the span of his career as a starter from 2006 through 2015.\"I think Dak is a heck of a quarterback,\" Jone said. \"All of them [seasons] ... were there at times, right around that rim. One of the things that I probably have a sense of remorse is that we didn't, when those guys were playing quarterback like that, to get one -- get a chance to get a Super Bowl.\"... You don't think that I didn't jump up a lot of mornings in those years that we've had Dak, or we had Romo when they were ready to play and say, 'Let's get a Super Bowl.' It would be done. I didn't say, 'Let's don't,' being tongue in cheek.\"What I regret is we haven't been able to get it done. We have been around the rim a lot. ... I don't hang my hat on teams that are playing well enough to have a shot at it. I think this team has a shot. I think some of those teams did.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League continues this week with a second round of fixtures, and Matchday 2 is poised to deliver another thrilling chapter after an exciting opening week with plenty of goals and surprises. The competition saw 39 goals scored across nine matches during the opening round, and the new Swiss model format delivered on its promise to deliver unpredictability. The explosive start was highlighted by FC Barcelona's spectacular display of goalscoring, defeating Bayern Munich 7-1. It was a dominant showcase for Liga F sides in general, as Atletico Madrid handed St. Polten a lopsided 6-0 loss, and Real Madrid claimed a 6-2 victory over AS Roma.Current title holders Arsenal were handed a tough 2-1 loss by tournament giants OL Lyonnes, as Haitian international Melchie Dumornay scored a first-half brace for the French side. Opening day set the stage for a critical Matchday 2, where teams will look to either build on early momentum or recover from initial setbacks.For the first time, CBS Sports will be the exclusive U.S. home of the UWCL, with every minute of the action available across different platforms.

Arsenal will try to bounce back from a disappointing result against Lyon on day one when they go against Benfica. The Portugal side are known for strong home performances, and it'll be another test for the current title holders and their ability to bounce back. Another English side that need a response is Chelsea. The Blues were held to a 1-1 draw against Twente and will try to get their campaign on track at home against Paris FC, another side also looking for more points. Chelsea will have the backing of Stamford Bridge, but Paris FC will want a better showing as well after letting a two-goal lead slip last week. German squad Bayern Munich will want to make a statement against Juventus after a miserable showing against FC Barcelona. The Bundesliga side needs points and to chip away at goal differential after losing 7-1. It won't be easy against an eager Juventus side that's looking to build off early tournament success with their 2-1 win over Benfica. USWNT players to watch in the UWCL: Multiple USWNT players featured in the Champions League last week, and others who are still hopeful. Goalkeeper Phallon Tulis-Joyce had a massive performance with Manchester United. She's the squad's starting keeper and helped the team earn a clean sheet and its first win of the tournament. Alyssa Thompson is off to an impressive beginning with Chelsea, got the start last week against Twente, and another on Sunday during the Blues' win against Tottenham. She'll likely remain an option as head coach Sonia Bompastor manages minutes across the roster. Fullback Emily Fox is Arsenal's starting fullback, and they'll rely on her against Benfica, while Jenna Nighswonger has yet to be utilized by manager Renée Slegers in the tournament or in domestic competition. Additionally, Crystal Dunn has also not yet checked into matches for Paris Saint-Germain.Meanwhile, head coach Jonatan Giraldez has utilized all his American players for Lyon. Midfielders Lindsey Heaps, Lily Yohannes, and Korbin Shrader each played roles during Lyon's opening day victory against Arsenal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 NFL schedule has several interesting quirks which could add a bit more interest to NFL picks. Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are  touchdown favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time through the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders.Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Week 7 NFL picks could account for several factors from recent performance to NFL betting trends to scheduling oddities. All of the updated Week 7 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 7 NFL picks now. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests.Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears.Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 7 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 7 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup is approaching next year, and qualifying is well underway with more than half of the spots now accounted for. There are now 48 teams after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and will end on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City.With the tournament's expansion, the European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.Three teams have already secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Cape Verde will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 524,877, Cape Verde became the second-smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup, behind only Iceland, which had a population of 350,000 when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.Let's take a look at who has already booked their tickets to the World Cup:Already qualified for the 2026 World CupWorld Cup hostsSince the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. \nUnited StatesMexicoCanadaAFC QualifiersIranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaOFC QualifierNew ZealandCONMEBOL QualifiersArgentinaBrazilEcuadorParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCape VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandChaos in UEFATeams such as England are starting to book their place in the World Cup, as the winners of each qualifying group will head directly to the tournament.

That means that teams such as Wales, Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland, Moldova, and San Marino could have chances to be in the UEFA playoff even if they don't finish second in their groups.That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoff. These also won't conclude until March of 2026.A tough route for NigeriaCAF qualifying could also see some powerhouse teams struggle to make the World Cup. South Africa and Cape Verde winning their groups will send Nigeria and Cameroon into the playoff round. Each of the nine group winners will all head directly to the World Cup in spots that have been decided, but only the four best second-placed teams will advance to the second round, which will take place during the November international window. \nThat round will see those four teams face each other in a playoff that will determine the CAF representative in the inter-confederation playoff. Teams qualified for CAF playoffs:DR CongoBurkina FasoCameroonNigeria Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs?The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups. A playoff will take place in North America in March, including one team each from the following regions: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, alongside two from Concacaf to determine the final two places in the World Cup. The bottom four teams in the FIFA World Rankings will be drawn into two single-elimination matches, where the winner will advance to face the top two teams in the rankings, with the winners of those two matches qualifying for the World Cup. \nCurrently in the inter-confederation playoffsOFC: New CaledoniaCONMEBOL: BoliviaWhen is the World Cup draw?Paths to the World Cup final will be revealed on Dec. 5 in a ceremony taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.. At that time, teams will know what groups they will be drawn into, and while the final teams will still need to be determined, placeholders will be used for their spots in the draw.  \n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:Brewers (+105) vs. Dodgers The Dodgers walked away with a 2-1 victory on Monday, but Los Angeles is just 1-9 in its past 10 meetings with Milwaukee. Freddy Peralta is set to start on the mound for the Brewers, and he's given up two earned runs or fewer in four of his last five outings. SportsLine's model is calling for Milwaukee to win in 56% of simulations, which is substantially different from the consensus odds implied probability of 48.1%. Bet it at bet365 here:South Alabama (-7) vs. Arkansas StateArkansas State limps into tonight's contest having lost four of its past five games. South Alabama has dominated this series in recent years, winning five of the past six meetings against the Red Wolves.

As of now, we don't expect any of them for Week 7. We also aren't ranking DJ Moore, who spent Monday night in the hospital and is now day-to-day, according to Head Coach Ben Johnson. The only positive news is that none of these injuries are considered season-ending. We should get all four back sooner rather than later, just like we are anticipating getting Rashee Rice, CeeDee Lamb and Mike Evans back in Week 7. You don't need me to tell you but they should move right back into your starting lineup.One of the ramifications of all these injuries is that it becomes almost impossible to get away from struggling starters, even in bad matchups. That obviously includes A.J. Brown and Keenan Allen, but this week it may also include Jerry Jeudy. Jeudy leads the Browns with a 21.7% target share since Dillon Gabriel took over as QB and the team could be without David Njoku in Week 7. His opponent, the Dolphins, have given up at least one touchdown to a receiver every week. Last week Keenan Allen was the first wide receiver this season to see at least seven targets against the Dolphins and score fewer than 13 PPR Fantasy points. Tee Higgins probably falls in the same boat after posting a season-high 62 receiving yards against the Packers. The Steelers are giving up 160 yards per game to the position.Here is the rest of the Week 7 WR Preview:\n\n        Week 7 WR Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            29.5% -- Mike Evans had a 29.5% target share the first three weeks of the season. If he is active, you should start him.15.3% -- George Pickens had a 15.3% target share the first two weeks with CeeDee Lamb. He has seen a 24.3% target share since Lamb went down. We are expecting Lamb back in Week 7.50.5% -- Over half of the Seahawks air yards have gone to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. 2.53 -- Amongst wide receivers with at least 30 targets, Tre Tucker's 2.53 Fantasy points per target ranks second only to DK Metcalf.6.2 -- Kendrick Bourne's 6.2 yards after catch per reception ranks third behind DK Metcalf and Khalil Shakir. This is a product of the Kyle Shanahan system and Bourne is a WR3 at worst until Ricky Pearsall gets back or Jauan Jennings gets healthy.17.6% -- Van Jefferson led the Titans with a 17.6% target share after Calvin Ridley left early. It was the first time he has seen more than two targets in a game this year.79.5% -- Josh Reynolds has a 79.5% route share over the last three weeks. He is probably the WR1 in New York until Garrett Wilson gets back.37 -- The Colts are giving up 37 PPR FPPG to wide receivers this year. Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen are both starts if Quentin Johnston remains out.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n

but he has six catches in each of his last two games and leads the Colts with a 20.5% target share since Week 2. I would still prefer to start Pittman, but that gap continues to shrink, and both are worthy of consideration as low-end WR3s. Dows has posted a 76% catch rate this year but has only averaged 8.3 yards per catch, so he is more valuable in full PPR than he is half or non.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #5\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    NE -7\n                                    O/U 42\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                43rd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                40%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    34\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    196\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Both Elic Ayomanor and Van Jefferson are desperation adds as we expect the Titans to be without Calvin Ridley.

He has averaged 13.2 PPR FPPG in those 11 games, scoring at least 9.5 points in all but one of them.\n            \n            \n\nStashes (WR Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NO\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -5.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                48th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                28%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    150\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It's coming. I am not sure it is coming in Week 7, though if DJ Moore is out it might, but I do believe Burden will eventually become a wide receiver who plays a majority of the snaps in this offense this year. And what he has shown us in short spurts is enough to get excited about. Burden has 16 fewer targets than Olamide Zaccheaus but seven more yards. It is very common for rookie wide receivers to break out and win leagues in the second half. Burden looks like one of the best candidates.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n

Wide receivers are averaging 2.21 Fantasy points per target against the Bears this year. Two wide receivers have seen at least nine targets against the Bears. Amon-Ra St. Brown turned 11 targets into 38.5 PPR Fantasy points and George Pickens turned nine targets into 17.8 PPR Fantasy points.

pass-heavy game plan for Las Vegas. What we don't expect is Brock Bowers back, which should mean a target share north of 20% for Tre Tucker. He has been as good as anyone at turning opportunity into Fantasy points and his deep ball ability makes him a fantastic tournament play.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 7 Fantasy football projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Denver Broncos and Washington Commanders are interested in adding a wide receiver as we near the halfway point of the regular season, as NFL Media reports that the two teams will host former Tennessee Titans first-round pick Treylon Burks on a visit. Burks hit waivers earlier this month, and predictably cleared them coming off injury. The former No. 18 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft tore his ACL in practice last year, and then broke his collarbone during a training camp practice session in July. The Titans infamously selected Burks with the pick acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles in the A.J. Brown trade. He failed to live up to expectations, catching 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown in just 27 career games played. Injuries unfortunately headlined Burks' career to date, as he's never played more than 11 games in a single season. However, just 25 years old, Burks could benefit from a change of scenery.\nThe Broncos' passing attack has been disappointing this season, as it ranks No. 16 in the NFL (206.8 passing yards per game). Courtland Sutton is the only wide receiver averaging over 42 yards per game. Bo Nix completed just 4 of 10 passes for 49 yards in the second half of the ugly win over the New York Jets Sunday in London, and his 88.2 passer rating ranks No. 24 in the NFL.As for the Commanders' potential interest in Burks, their wide receiver room is injured. Terry McLaurin missed the last three games due to a quad injury, Noah Brown only played two games this season due to groin and knee injuries, then Deebo Samuel played through a heel injury during Washington's Monday night loss to the Chicago Bears. Chris Moore and rookie Jaylin Lane emerged as Jayden Daniels' leading receivers in Week 6. \nBurks was a legitimate star at Arkansas, and picked up First Team All-SEC honors in 2021 after catching 66 passes for 1,104 yards and 11 touchdowns in 12 games played. However, he struggled to find his footing in the NFL. \n            \n    ",

Where can you turn for guidance amid this dizzying whirlwind?    Right here is where. Chris Towers and I will be making the Offseason Tracker our home base for the next few months, churning out content as the news warrants. Here, you'll get a breakdown of all the moves that matter for Fantasy Baseball without all the fluff. (OK, maybe a little fluff.)          Bookmark it. Read it.

Apart from his two months with the Rangers at the end of 2025, our only recollection of Kelly is with the Diamondbacks, so we know exactly what to expect. The only question would be if he's beginning to age out at 37, seeing as he was more hittable during his 10 starts with the Rangers. No organization would have a better read on him than the Diamondbacks, though, and they're willing to pay him $20 million each of the next two years. His velocity and ERA estimators have held steady, so I think you can draft him with confidence as an innings-eating rotation stabilizer in the fifth or sixth starter range. You'll probably end up using him more than you expect to. --Scott WhiteIsaac Collins traded to RoyalsFor a minute there, Collins was the hot thing in Fantasy, slashing .338/.425/.544 over a two-month stretch from June 12 through Aug. 11. And while he slashed only .182/.303/.293 thereafter, slipping into more of a part-time role, he still ended up reaching base at a .368 clip as a rookie. That's likely what attracted the Royals to Collins, and with them, the switch-hitter is more likely to play every day.\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIL\n                    \n                         \n                        Milwaukee\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .263\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OBP\n                                    \n                                    .368\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .779\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    372\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nMy fear, though, is that the midseason hot stretch inflated his stat line beyond what's actually reasonable and that the season simply ended before the correction could be fully applied. He wasn't a highly regarded prospect, doesn't hit the ball with much authority, and doesn't make contact at an unusually high rate. He's good at taking walks, as his minor league history also shows, but major league pitchers will put a stop to that if the bat isn't impactful enough. They're better at controlling where the ball goes and will simply pound the strike zone. Maybe Collins will excel with the Royals and give them their own version of Sal Frelick. It's more possible with them than with the Brewers. But that's modest upside for a player with such a questionable profile, making him not worth considering outside of five-outfielder leagues. --Scott WhiteDustin May signs with Cardinals\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.96\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.42\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    132.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    123\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nNot a bad gamble for the Cardinals when you consider that May was a prized commodity as recently as a year ago. He was coming back from flexor tendon surgery as well as a Tommy John revision, and obviously, things didn't turn out so well. The Dodgers decided to cut bait, shipping him to the Red Sox for a couple of minor leaguers, but it didn't improve his circumstances at all. If nothing else, the Cardinals can provide him with opportunity given the sorry state of their starting rotation. He's lost about 2 mph from all three versions of his fastball (four-seamer, two-seamer and cutter), but he still gets wicked horizontal movement on several of his pitches. He's too much of a project to draft in standard-size leagues, but if he starts getting some buzz this spring, that could change. --Scott White Kenley Jansen signs with TigersIt wasn't even a week ago that I said Kyle Finnegan would be the favorite for saves in Detroit after signing a two-year, $19 million deal. I take it all back. Jansen, the active saves leader and fourth on the all-time list with 476, becomes the most proven closer manager A.J.

Jansen presumably wouldn't go to a team that didn't promise him the closer role. The last time he got fewer than 25 saves in a season (2020 excluded) was 2011. It's true he's not as dominant as he once was, but he continues to get the job done at 38 and has a good chance for 30-plus saves on an expected contender. You should target him among the top 15 relievers in leagues that reward saves. --Scott WhiteJorge Polanco signs with MetsOut with Pete Alonso. In with ... Jorge Polanco? Yes, the Mets are going the thrifty route to replace their All-Star first baseman, signing a longtime second baseman with the intention of transitioning him there.

He had patellar tendon surgery prior to the season, a condition he had been managing for years, and the underlying data backs up the resurgence, namely through improved exit velocities a greatly improved strikeout rate. In theory, he's going to a better venue, but his xHR by ballpark is about the same in New York and Seattle over the past few years. Mostly, Polanco's value is tied to his second base eligibility, given that it's the weakest infield position, and this move puts him in the conversation for top 10 there. --Scott White \n Robert Suarez signs with Braves \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #75\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 34\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    69.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        S\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    75\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    2.97\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nKen Rosenthal already answered your question: The Braves still expect to use Raisel Iglesias as their closer in 2026. The deal will pay Suarez $13 million in 2026, with $16 million due in each of 2027 and 2028; with Iglesias only under contract for one more year after re-signing earlier this offseason, the plan here seems pretty clear. For 2026, Suarez is an overqualified setup man; in 2027, he should enter as the odds-on favorite to close. Of course, he might end up closing in 2026 anyway, as Iglesias lost the feel for his slider in 2025 and subsequently lost his job (before eventually winning it back). Winning it back from Suarez, who has a 2.87 ERA and 76 saves over the past two seasons, might be a tougher task. Iglesias remains in the top-12 closer discussion for 2026 drafts, but he's got to be viewed as a riskier pick now than he was before the Suarez signing. --Chris TowersPete Alonso signs with Orioles\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .272\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    126\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    87\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .871\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    624\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nAfter he sat on the free agent market until February last offseason, Pete Alonso found his home much earlier this time around. And, for the first time in his professional career, he won't be with the Mets, as he landed with the Orioles Wednesday on a five-year deal that will make him one of the highest-paid first basemen in MLB history. It's a move that answers some questions for the Orioles lineup in 2026 and raises plenty more for the Mets.

Finnegan may not be of the same stature as Kyle Schwarber, who also chose to stay put Tuesday, but he could be of use in Fantasy if he ends up claiming the closer role for the Tigers.

Basically, they had him throw his splitter twice as often, and clearly, they think those gains will stick. --Scott White    Kyle Schwarber signs with Phillies    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    111\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    132\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    197\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nKyle Schwarber returning to the Phillies is a big deal for real-life baseball. Schwarber is one of the 15 or so best hitters in baseball (and the number of better power hitters is an even shorter list), but he's also been an integral part of the Phillies' clubhouse during their recent run of contending, and they were fighting off a number of other contenders and would-be contenders for Schwarber's services. That's a list that included unexpected names like the Reds and Pirates, as well as the Orioles, Mets, and others who were all in on Schwarber to the tune of at least $100 million. His landing spot could have fundamentally reshaped the look of any one of about a half-dozen teams.   For Fantasy, though, this deal doesn't really matter all that much. We'll always take the status quo reigning when that involves an elite hitter staying in a good lineup, and it's probably the best chance Schwarber has to recreate his incredible 2025 season. But it also doesn't – or shouldn't – change how anyone views him for Fantasy. It's the status quo, after all.   \nI will say this: I think Schwarber's price in drafts is probably at least a little bit unreasonable. After sporting an ADP near 70th entering 2025, he's sitting at 24.5 in early NFBC drafts so far. He was worth that in 2025, but he also hit 18 more homers than he had in 2024 and nine more than any other season in his career, so expecting a repeat is probably asking a lot. He'll hit 40 or so with elite run production numbers, but he hasn't hit better than .248 since 2021 (when he was shielded from many of the toughest lefties on the schedule in a way he no longer is) and he is a Util/DH-only player for Fantasy. None of that should be considered a deal breaker, but it can create some tough team-building complications when it costs a second-round pick. --Chris Towers   Edwin Diaz signs with Dodgers  \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    111\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    132\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    197\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nEdwin Diaz joining the Dodgers is another move that feels more momentous in real life than in Fantasy. The Dodgers' bullpen was their biggest weakness in 2025 and now they've signed the best closer on the market. Of course they did. But Diaz was going to be a closer no matter where he signed, and if anything, signing with a team that gave out a huge contract to another close last offseason and has other pitchers with closing experience means there might be a bit more risk in drafting Diaz than there was before. He'll probably remain a dominant force and secure 35-plus saves for the Dodgers, but he's volatile enough that it's not impossible to foresee a world in which he loses this job. Remember, it happened to him for a stretch in 2024.   Tanner Scott is obviously undraftable in most leagues now, while Devin Williams seems secure a top-12 closer and a high-profile bounce-back candidate if the Mets stay out of the closer market moving forward. --Chris Towers \n   \tHarry Ford traded for Jose Ferrer   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SEA\n                    \n                         \n                        Seattle\n                    \n                                            • #47\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 25\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.48\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    76.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    71\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThat the Mariners would trade Ford, who has been one of the top catcher prospects from the time he was drafted in 2021, was all but certain given the Cal Raleigh of it all. That they'd get only a blah reliever in return was unexpected. But wait, wasn't Ferrer the Nationals' closer by the end of last season? Yeah, because they traded everyone else away. He throws hard, but the numbers certainly aren't closer-caliber, and even if you want to say his 3.03 FIP is more indicative of his ability than his 4.48 ERA, so what? Left-handers who get ground balls at a high rate, while useful, generally aren't considered top trade currency.

What about Ford? Well, the Nationals do have Keibert Ruiz locked up through 2030, but he was ravaged by concussions in 2025 and has performed below expectations each of the past two seasons. Unlike Raleigh, he's a catcher that Ford could reasonably overtake. Ford stands out most for his plate discipline, having reached base at a .408 clip in 2025 and a .405 clip for his minor league career, and he has playable pop to his pull side. He had been a prolific base-stealer in the past but put a stop to that in 2025, for some reason. With as deep as catcher is right now, you won't need to make a big play for him even in two-catcher leagues, but that could change if he garners a lot of buzz this spring. --Scott White      \tJhostynxon Garcia traded for Johan Oviedo   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PIT\n                    \n                         \n                        Pittsburgh\n                    \n                                            • #51\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 23\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Minors\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .267\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .810\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    434\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    45\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    131\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThere were three lesser prospects moved in this deal as well, but we'll stick to the principle players. The Password, as Garcia is commonly known, is a borderline top-100 prospect who got nine plate appearances for the Red Sox last year after a productive showing between Double- and Triple-A. But while power is supposed to be his calling card, he delivered only an 86.4 mph average exit velocity in his 81 games at Triple-A. His home run output relies on him pulling the ball in the air with regularity, and because PNC Park rates as the worst home run venue for right-handed hitters, that's ... kind of a problem. Garcia also had a high chase rate at Triple-A, not to mention a high miss rate on pitches in the zone, so there are ample reasons for skepticism here, even if this traded offers him a much clearer path to playing time.   \n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #24\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 27\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    2-1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.57\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    40.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    42\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nOviedo also strikes me as more of a curiosity than a true asset. His nine starts late in 2025 at least showed him to be healthy after a lengthy recovery from Tommy John surgery, but the outings were short, with only one exceeding five innings, and the 3.57 ERA was undercut by a 4.92 FIP. While he shows some potential as a bat-misser, it's not nearly enough to make up for his vulnerability to walks and home runs, and my guess is that he'll serve more as a swingman than a full-time starter for the Red Sox. --Scott White       \tEmilio Pagan signs with Reds    \"My guess today is that Pagan does not sign as a closer.\" That's what I said on the Fantasy Baseball Today podcast Monday night. But the one way to ensure he'll remain a closer is to re-sign with the team that just used him as a closer, and that's exactly what happened Wednesay Monday Emilio Pagan signs with Reds re-upped him on a two-year $20 million deal.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #15\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 34\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    32\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    2.88\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    68.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    81\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIt could work out fine. It obviously did in 2025, seeing him recording 32 saves with a 2.88 ERA. But it marked only the second time in six years that he had an ERA below 4.40, and he remained as homer-prone as ever, which accounts for the 3.72 FIP and 3.91 xFIP. Pitching in Cincinnati should only exacerbate those home run problems, and just because he dodged a bullet the first time doesn't mean he will again. He deserves to be drafted among the top 20 relievers, just because there are only so many in line for saves, but there's definite bust potential. --Scott White \n \tCedric Mullins signs with Rays \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #28\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .216\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .690\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    435\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nMullins' production has been in decline for a while now and hit rock bottom when he batted .182 with a .565 OPS after joining the Mets in a midseason trade. But he's still a plus defender in center field (which is more than can be said for Chandler Simpson), his exit velocities have held fairly steady even with the diminished production, and he just delivered a career-high pull-air rate. There are worse gambles a thrifty club could make than to ink a former 30/30 man to a one-year, $7 million deal. My best guess is that Mullins fits into some kind of platoon and puts up usable power/speed numbers for a five-outfielder league. Seeing as he's a career .189 hitter with a .519 OPS at Tropicana Field, though, I'd be more likely to adjust those expectations down than up. --Scott White     \tAnthony Kay signs with White Sox    Early December is apparently the time to shop for failed major league pitchers who rehabilitated their value in East Asia, because Kay becomes the third such player to sign in two days. He's the first to sign out of Japan rather than Korea, and while his 2025 strikeout rate wasn't nearly as impressive in Cody Ponce's, he was playing in the tougher league.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHW\n                    \n                         \n                        Chi.

He's now primarily sinker/cutter rather than fastball/slider, becoming the sort of extreme ground-ball pitcher (56 percent rate in 2025) that can overcome a modest strikeout rate, and has a much broader arsenal in general. He's unlikely to be much more than a streamer in Fantasy, particularly pitching for a non-contender like the White Sox, but as with every pitcher who takes this career path, there is the potential for a surprise. --Scott White    \n    \tCody Ponce signs with Blue Jays    After an unremarkable stint with the Pirates earlier in the decade, Ponce spent a few years refining his game overseas, and it culminated with him earning MVP honors in the Korean Baseball Organization last year. The award is easy to understand given the numbers, but what's behind those numbers? Apparently, he's added 2 mph to his fastball since we last saw him in 2021, and he's also added a kick change (sometimes identified as a splitter) that produces incredible tumbling action with its minimal spin (often below 1,000 rpm). Though he also has a sweeper, it's the fastball and changeup that primarily account for his 12.6 K/9, the highest for any former MLB pitcher coming back from the KBO.    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TOR\n                    \n                         \n                        Toronto\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 KBO\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    17-1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    1.89\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.94\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    180.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    41\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    252\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Blue Jays are making a reasonable-sized commitment, too.

They're convinced Ponce can hold down a rotation spot for them, and I'm convinced he'll at least be viable in Fantasy, with his core components suggesting even better than that. Still, the 2026 starting pitcher crop is deep enough in upside plays that I couldn't justify using more than a late-round pick on him. --Scott White        \tRyan Weiss signs with Astros    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #69\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 KBO\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    16-5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    2.87\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.02\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    178.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    207\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA former fourth-round pick of the Diamondbacks, Weiss wasn't good enough to reach the majors before departing for Korea in 2024, but after putting together impressive numbers there in 2025 (see above), he'll get a chance to compete for a spot in the Astros rotation on a one-year, $2.6 million deal. That's not a great financial commitment, obviously, which suggests that a market failed to develop for the soon-to-be 29-year-old. Between that and the lack of clear explanations for Weiss' breakthrough (beyond vague references to improved command and a broader secondary arsenal), I'm inclined to think it was less about Weiss himself than his competition. He may have stretches when he's streamable, but barring some eye-opening performance this spring, he should go largely undrafted in Fantasy. --Scott White         \tDevin Williams signs with Mets     The Bronx chewed up and spit out Williams, heretofore a lockdown ace of a closer, but surely the other New York borough will makes for a gentler landing. Or ... not at all. In fact, this deal offers little in the way of closure because the Mets' mountain of resources allows them to pursue another big-dollar reliever, up to and including Edwin Diaz, who would of course take precedence over Williams in the ninth inning. But the Mets are paying Williams closer money -- three years, $45 million, along with additional incentives -- so for now, let's presume he's their closer.     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

His pitches all had the same shape and velocity. He missed bats at his usual elite rate. His 3.11 xERA and 2.68 FIP were both much lower than his 4.79 ERA. He was basically the same pitcher. The results were just worse. Normally, you'd bet on a rebound in that scenario, and I still think that's the right move, which is why I rank him just inside my top 12 relievers. But I'd feel better had he signed somewhere else. --Scott White          \tRyan Helsley signs with Orioles     While some teams were reportedly eyeing Helsley as a rotation candidate, the Orioles plan to use him as a closer with Felix Bautista (shoulder) expected out for the majority of 2016.

It's not the sort of contract that an ace reliever who's entirely worry-free would get, but it's a robust commitment nonetheless. With the Orioles expected back in playoff contention, you should anticipate drafting Helsley in the 12-15 range at relief pitcher. He's has the potential to be top five. --Scott White           Dylan Cease signs with Blue Jays      \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TOR\n                    \n                         \n                        Toronto\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    168\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    215\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.55\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.33\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n$210 million is a lot of money for a pitcher coming off a 4.55 ERA. But as I wrote in my more in-depth breakdown of the signing, that ERA doesn't come close to telling the whole story with Cease. Yes, he's frustratingly inconsistent. He's also a true workhorse, taking the ball every fifth day and providing volume and strikeouts. With ERA and WHIP risk, sure, but there's obviously plenty of upside there, too. He's going off the board in early drafts around 80th overall, as the 20th SP off the board or thereabouts, and that seems like a perfect fine value for a guy with his mixture of upside and projectable volume. There aren't many pitchers whose absolute best-case scenario is as enticing for Fantasy as Cease's. --Chris Towers              Sonny Gray traded to Red Sox         \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #54\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 36\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    180.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    201\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.23\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Red Sox have been expected to make a big splash in either free agency or in the trade market for a rotation upgrade, and this trade might be it. Gray struggled to a 4.28 ERA and 1.23 WHIP last season, but his underlying metrics were more indicative of a top-of-rotation arm, including a 26.7% strikeout rate, 3.39 FIP and 3.29 SIERA. The 36-year-old has seen his velocity decline in consecutive seasons, however, and his quality of contact metrics took a big step back in 2025, which is why his xERA was a more pedestrian 3.90 mark. He's a solid pitcher, both for the Red Sox and for Fantasy, but I don't think he's a needle-mover in either instance at this point in his career, even if the Red Sox might be able to get him in their pitching lab and squeeze some extra value out of him. There's still room for the Red Sox to upgrade this rotation, in other words. --Chris Towers              Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke traded to Cardinals        In exchange for Gray, the Cardinals got a couple of interesting younger arms. Fitts is more of a known quantity, and he hasn't given us much reason to be excited. He had a 5.00 ERA with even worse peripherals in 2025, so while he might slide into the Cardinals rotation, it'll mostly be for a lack of better options.  Clarke is the more interesting long-term project, with a fastball that can touch 100 mph and a slider that is already a weapon. The rest of the arsenal is a work in progress. He walked 27 in just 38 innings across two levels of A-Ball in 2025, so this is a real project. If all comes together, he might be able to hack it as a starter, but he looks more like a Ryan Helsley-in-waiting type of high-leverage bullpen arm in the long run.        The other thing worth noting here is that, with Gray out of the picture and Miles Mikolas leaving via free agency, there are multiple holes in the Cardinals rotation right now. Prospects Quinn Mathews and Tink Hence have experience in the high minors and could be options for the 2026 rotation, though both have troublesome 2025 campaigns that could lead the team to want to see more success at Triple-A before they make that call. For Fantasy, those are both names to know heading into spring training in case they can steal rotation spots. Liam Doyle, a 2025 first-round pick, seems likely to be more of a midseason consideration after he threw just 3 2/3 post-draft innings in the pros, but he could absolutely be a fast riser early in 2026, too. --Chris Towers               Marcus Semien traded for Brandon Nimmo         \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEX\n                    \n                         \n                        Texas\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .262\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    81\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .760\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Mets and Rangers continued the early offseason trend of trading major leaguers for other major leaguers in an exchange of two aging ones with multiple years remaining on their deals.

Statcast estimates he'd have a dozen more home runs during that same two-year span if he had played every game at Citi Field. That's my biggest takeaway from this trade, but Chris Towers has written a complete breakdown of it, which you can find here. --Scott White                  \tRaisel Iglesias signs with Braves         \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #26\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 35\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.00\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    67.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    73\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIglesias re-ups for one year at exactly the same rate ($16 million) as the previous three. Clearly, the Braves were looking for continuity, and that makes the analysis here rather easy. He's the closer again for an expected contender and a near lock for 30 saves, provided he stays healthy. He missed that number by one in 2025, mostly because of some early-season struggles. Once he cut back on his slider, though, he was clearly back to form, compiling a 1.25 ERA, 0.69 WHIP and 10.0 K/9 in his final 45 appearances. That'll play, all right, and positions Iglesias to be one of the first 12 relievers off the board in 2026. --Scott White                   \tGrayson Rodriguez traded for Taylor Ward          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .228\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    103\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .792\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    579\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nWhat a fall for Rodriguez, who was regarded a couple years ago as one of the game's burgeoning aces after a multi-year run as a top-10 overall prospect. Now, the Orioles have dealt him away for one year of some 32-year-old outfielder who just hit .228. That's not entirely fair to Ward, who also connected for 36 home runs in 2025, but most projections have him regressing to 25-30 in 2026. He's also joining a team that's loaded with solid-but-less-than-All-Star-worthy corner bats. There already wasn't room in the lineup for all of Dylan Beavers, Samuel Basallo, Coby Mayo, Tyler O'Neill and Ryan Mountcastle. Now, there's room for one fewer. It won't be Ward, but does that mean we'll have to wait even longer for Basallo to contribute in Fantasy? If so, that's a bummer.          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAA\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

The lat has been a recurring problem, also costing Rodriguez time in 2024 and as a minor leaguer in 2022, and the elbow required debridement surgery in August. The Orioles only made this deal because they couldn't trust him to stay healthy, but having said that, he wouldn't be the first pitcher to overcome a multi-year injury trend and still go on to meet his potential. We have no evidence that his stuff has diminished with this latest rash of injuries, so I'm still inclined to rank him as a top 75 starting pitcher for 2026. This trade is sure to give some drafters pause even at that late stage, though.  --Scott White                    \tTrent Grisham signs with Yankees          Grisham's decision to accept the qualifying offer is a curious one given that he just had far and away his best season, homering 34 times as the primary center fielder for the Yankees. Some major outlets were projecting him to receive a four- or five-year deal for a similar annual value as the qualifying offer, but his agent probably has a better read on the market.          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYY\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

You might think the return to Yankee Stadium will help, given that he's a left-handed batter, but he actually hit two-thirds of his home runs on the road. If the Yankees are serious about giving Jasson Dominguez regular playing time next year and also bringing back Cody Bellinger, Grisham may be fighting for at-bats again. The Yankees still make for a better landing than a lot of clubs, but you can understand why drafters might approach Grisham with some skepticism in 2026. --Scott White                    \tGleyber Torres signs with Tigers          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    74\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    79\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .745\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    532\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA modest showing by Torres in 2025 led him to accept the Tigers' qualifying offer rather than testing the free agent market, and you might think a return to Comerica Park is a bad move for his Fantasy value given its reputation. But it actually played well for right-handed hitters in 2025, and Torres batted .285 with a .449 slugging percentage there compared to .223 and .327 on the road. On balance, he performed well below his .271 xBA and .452 xSLG, having delivered his best average exit velocity in three years and some of his best walk and strikeout numbers ever, so some better luck would go a long way toward redeeming him in Fantasy. He's not a surefire top-12 choice, though, even at a position as thin as second base. --Scott White                    \tBrandon Woodruff signs with Brewers          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIL\n                    \n                         \n                        Milwaukee\n                    \n                                            • #53\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    64.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    83\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nSomething tells me that if Woodruff hadn't gone into the offseason nursing a lat injury, he wouldn't have had to accept the Brewers' qualifying offer, instead pursuing a multi-year deal. But now, he's back in prove-it mode after already overcoming a more significant shoulder injury in near miraculous fashion. Even though the shoulder capsule surgery that he underwent in 2023 took 3 mph off his fastball -- normally a career-ender for a pitcher, particularly one so fastball-reliant -- he basically picked up where he left off statistically, even delivering the best strikeout rate of his career. A new cutter is largely to credit for saving him, and his fortunes rose and fell with its usage. He'll be plenty motivated now that he's pitching for a contract again, but he would have been worth selecting among the top 36 starting pitchers either way.  --Scott White                     \tShota Imanaga signs with Cubs           The Cubs' decision to decline Imanaga's three-year, $57.5 million option after the season makes more sense now that we see the way everything played out. They probably suspected he'd accept the $22.025 million qualifying offer, which he did, so now they still have him but without the multi-year commitment.          \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHC\n                    \n                         \n                        Chi.

It's sort of misleading to call it his sophomore season given that he's 32, and his age contributed to those fears of decline as well. Still, he was effective when healthy, remaining a standout for WHIP in particular. No one will mistake him for an ace in 2026, but he should be drafted in the middle rounds. --Scott White                                 \tJosh Naylor signs with Mariners          Normally, a hitter signing with the Mariners wouldn't be the most favorable outcome given T-Mobile Park's reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue.

His 11 stolen bases in 93 games with the Diamondbacks were surprising enough, but then he had 19 in just 54 games with the Mariners. Given his 3rd percentile sprint speed, some other team might have put a stop to that, but the Mariners don't seem to care. He was succeeding, after all. It's doubtful he steals 30 again, which is why he remains only eighth in my first base rankings, but a return to the Mariners improves Naylor's chances of remaining a base-stealer in some capacity.

    "body": "\nA pair of AFC playoff hopefuls will meet in a pivotal 'Monday Night Football' matchup to conclude NFL Week 15 as the Miami Dolphins visit the Pittsburgh Steelers. Miami (6-7) has won six straight, most recently defeating the Jets, 34-10, to get back into postseason contention. Pittsburgh (7-6) is coming off a 27-22 win over Baltimore and sits atop the AFC North. The Steelers lead the all-time series by the narrowest of margins, 15-14.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh. Miami won the last matchup, 16-10, back in 2022. The latest Dolphins vs. Steelers odds have Pittsburgh as 3-point home favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 42.5. Before making any Steelers vs. Dolphins     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Miami's defense has risen to the occasion as of late, holding each of its last four opponents to 17 points or fewer while also notching 10 takeaways during this stretch. On offense, Mike McDaniel has a rushing unit that ranks fifth in yards per carry and eighth in yards per game. De'Von Achane is on pace for nearly 2,000 scrimmage yards, while Jaylen Wright had 107 yards and a touchdown last week. The Dolphins also get to face a Pittsburgh defense that is reminding no one of the Steel Curtain, as the Steelers rank 27th or worse in total yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Steelers can coverThis game is in Pittsburgh at night, which plays into the forecast calling for a game time temperature of 25 degrees. That's relevant because Miami has lost 13 straight games with temps under 40 degrees, as Tua Tagovailoa is 0-8 in his career in such contests. The Dolphins quarterback has had a season to forget, as he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and now has to face a Pittsburgh defense which has racked up the second-most takeaways (23). As for Aaron Rodgers, he's coming off a season-high of 284 passing yards and also rushed for his first score since 2022 in last week's win over Baltimore. He faced the Dolphins twice last year while with the Jets, and the four-time MVP totaled five passing touchdowns and averaged 306.5 yards through the air. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Steelers vs. Dolphins           picksFor Dolphins vs. Steelers on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 45 combined points.

Many of the NFL games with playoff implications occur later on Sunday, including a Sunday Night Football matchup when the Dallas Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings. The Cowboys, who at 6-6-1 are in the playoff mix, have been elite at home in recent weeks, with victories over both teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. That's a trend the SportsLine Projection Model expects to continue on Sunday Night Football, backing the Cowboys to cover as 5.5-point favorites in its NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook, down a half-point from the opener. Cowboys vs. Vikings has an over-under of 47.5, down one from the opening line, and the model is calling for a 30-20 Dallas victory.A pair of SportsLine's top experts have picked a side from games in the 4 p.m. ET slate that could vie for the game of the week for Rams vs. Lions (+6, 54.5) and Packers vs. Broncos (+1.5, 42.5). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Broncos should not be underdogs at home against anybody, not with a 10-game SU win streak,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The fact Denver is winning these games close shouldn't be held against Sean Payton's crew; their style of game simply is methodical, with few big plays these days on offense, and the defense is good enough to win most games. Margins can start to expand for Denver when the stop unit begins to convert pick-sixes and scoop-and-scores like a year ago. That hasn't happened as much this season, but the Broncos keep winning as Bo Nix and the offense do just enough each week. Note the Pack has covered just three of its last 12 away.\" Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lions (+6) vs. Rams\"I have the Rams as the best team in the league in my power ratings, but I'm jumping on the Lions with this line at 6 at DraftKings,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"Detroit has the No. 1 scoring offense in the league after a big game against the Cowboys, with a top-five mark in net yards per pass attempt and yards per rush. Recent losses have come down to uncharacteristic struggles on fourth down, and a typical day on that front will allow them to stay close. There are a few teams I trust more to get a backdoor cover if needed as well. The lookahead was 4.5 and the Lions had a much-needed big win. Why the inflation? I think this line should be 4.\" Back Detroit at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cowboys (-5.5) vs. VikingsThe Cowboys are 4-1-1 straight up at home this season, and 4-2 against the spread at AT&T Stadium. Dallas defeated the Eagles, 24-21, and the Chiefs, 31-28, at home over the last three weeks, and this current version of the Vikings isn't nearly the competition level of the two teams that played in last year's Super Bowl. Dallas is third in the NFL in scoring at 29.3 ppg this season, including 32.7 ppg at home. Dallas gave up 44 points on the road to the Lions last week, but their defense has performed much better at home since adding to the unit at the trade deadline. Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy has the third-worst quarterback rating of 48 QBs this season. The Vikings are 26th in the league at 19.6 ppg this season, and the model doesn't expect Minnesota to be able to keep pace with Dallas, projecting the Cowboys to cover in 60% of simulations. Back the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\nThe Dallas Cowboys returned from their bye and posted three consecutive victories to give themselves an opportunity to earn a playoff berth, but they made their path to the postseason much more difficult with their 44-30 road loss to the Detroit Lions last week.Dallas' playoff chances weren't great prior to the matchup with Detroit, but they became much slimmer with the defeat as the Cowboys (6-6-1) will need plenty of help before they host the Minnesota Vikings (5-8) at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football. Their best shot at a postseason spot is overtaking the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (8-5), who enter Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season with a three-game losing streak, for the NFC East title.The San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears occupy the final two wild card spots in the conference with 9-4 records, and a loss to the Vikings would effectively end the Cowboys' chances to grab one of those berths. But even with a win, Dallas would need Philadelphia's struggles to continue, and the Eagles are hosting the 2-11 Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday and face the 3-10 Washington Commanders twice over the final three weeks of the season.Minnesota ended its four-game slide with a 31-0 rout of Washington last week and would like nothing better than to deal a major blow to Dallas' playoff hopes. The Vikings will have to find a way to slow down CeeDee Lamb, however, as the Cowboys star receiver is expected to be in the lineup after exiting last week's contest with a concussion. The 26-year-old wideout was extremely effective against the Lions prior to leaving in the second quarter, hauling in six passes for 121 yards.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Golden State Warriors (13-13) and Portland Trail Blazers (9-16) at 9 p.m. ET at the Moda Center. The Trail Blazers have lost six of their last seven contests but won both of their previous meetings with the Warriors this season.Meanwhile, the NHL has six games on its slate, one of which has the Montreal Canadiens (16-11-4) hosting the Edmonton Oilers (15-11-6) at the Bell Centre at 7 p.m. ET. The Oilers enter with a point streak that reached five games with their 6-3 road triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday.There also are plenty of college basketball games on Sunday, including a matchup between Washington State (3-7) and USC (9-1) at 7:30 p.m. ET at the Galen Center in Los Angeles. The Cougars are in the midst of a four-game losing streak, while the Trojans bounced back from their lone defeat of the season with a 94-81 triumph over San Diego last time out.The Cowboys are 5.5-point favorites against the Vikings in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Warriors are 4.5-point favorites against the Trail Blazers, the Oilers are -130 favorites on the money line against the Canadiens and USC is a 14.5-point favorite against Washington State.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Dec. 14. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchVikings at CowboysTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Arlington, Tex. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Cowboys -5.5 (-112) | Expert: J.J.

It was Dallas' fifth win in its last six matchups against the Vikings but first in that span by more than four points. The SportsLine Projection Model sees another comfortable triumph by the Cowboys, who cover the spread in 61% of its simulations. SportsLine fantasy football expert Dave Richard (11-2, +980 on his last 13 NFL player prop picks) believes J.J.

The Warriors have exceeded their 113.7-point average in back-to-back games after producing 112 or fewer in five consecutive contests, while the Trail Blazers have scored more than their average of 117.5 points in three of their last five outings. And even though Golden State and Portland combined for 250 or more points in both of their previous meetings this campaign, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations say the Under for Sunday's matchup hits almost 71% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (33-19, +1206 on his last 52 NBA ATS picks) likes Golden State to cover since the Trail Blazers are reeling and Stephen Curry, who averaged 36.5 points against Portland over the first two showdowns, is back from his quad injury.NHL best bets, where to watchOilers at CanadiensTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Montreal | TV: NHL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Canadiens +109Both teams were on the road Saturday, with Edmonton posting a three-goal victory in Toronto and Montreal dropping an overtime decision to the Rangers in New York. The Canadiens have won only one of their last four contests both overall (1-2-1) and at home (1-3-0), while the Oilers have won three straight on the road. However, that streak has only improved Edmonton's record away from home to 7-8-3, and the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the run will end as Montreal wins in 54% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchWashington State at USCTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: USC -14.5 (-112)The Cougars have lost seven of the nine games they've played against teams with a record over .500 and are facing a Trojans squad that received another strong offensive performance from Chad Baker-Mazara in Tuesday's 94-81 triumph over San Diego. The senior guard scored 31 points on 8-of-11 shooting, marking the fourth consecutive game and sixth this season in which he produced at least 21 points. Baker-Mazara is fifth in the nation in scoring with an average of 21.9 points, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees him helping the Trojans to a big win on Sunday as they cover the spread in 56% of its simulations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season kicked off on Saturday when Washington defeated Boise State, 38-10, in the LA Bowl. Even with that, many college football bowl confidence pools remain open, and there are 45 more bowl matchups (including all College Football Playoff games) as the college football bowl schedule includes some stylistically intriguing battles. No. 12 BYU, who just missed out on the College Football Field, will play No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27. Other matchups that day include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), UConn vs. Army (-7) and LSU vs. Houston (-3). BYU is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest college football bowl odds, but will they actually show up motivated after it looks like they weren't given serious consideration for the 12-team playoff? Motivation is always a factor during bowl season and it's something that you'll need to consider as you make your college football bowl confidence picks along with opt-outs, transfer portal news, injuries and many more factors. Penn State's Zane Durant and Tennessee' Chris Brazzell, for example, are among the players who have already opted out.Before entering any college football bowl confidence pools, be sure to see the college football picks from SportsLine's Thomas Casale.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years.So before filling out your college football pool picks or making any college football bets, you need to see Casale's college football bowl confidence picks.

The Aggies finished 11-1 and 7-1 in the SEC, tying for first place, but missed out on playing in the conference championship after losing at Texas 27-17 on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes, who tied for second with four other teams at 6-2 in the ACC and were 10-2 overall, have won four in a row.Quarterback Marcel Reed helps power the A&M offense. The sophomore has completed 61.8% of his passes for 2,932 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 153.2 rating. He has also rushed 89 times for 466 yards (5.2 average) and six touchdowns. In a 38-17 win over No. 22 Missouri on Nov. 8, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns. Miami, meanwhile, is led by senior quarterback Carson Beck.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 MLB offseason is six weeks old and so far 21 of our top 50 free agents have signed and our No. 1 trade candidate has been dealt. Spring training is two months away and there is still a lot of player movement to come between now and then. Here now are Sunday's hot stove happenings.  AL East teams pursuing King\nFree-agent right-hander Michael King has three AL East teams chasing him (Orioles, Red Sox, Yankees), reports the Boston Globe. He declined the $22.025 million qualifying offer from the Padres earlier this offseason and therefore is attached to draft pick compensation, potentially affecting his market. We ranked King as the 17th-best free agent available this winter.King, 30, knows the AL East well from his time with the Yankees, who sent him to San Diego in the Juan Soto trade. He had a terrific 2024 that saw him finish seventh in the NL Cy Young voting. Shoulder and knee injuries derailed his 2025, though he's seen as something of a buy-low candidate, especially since he's proven he can start or be an effective multi-inning setup man.  D-backs bring back Kelly  \nArizona's search for pitching has led them to a familiar face. The Diamondbacks and Merrill Kelly are reuniting on a two-year contract worth $40 million, reports The Athletic. Kelly, 37, had been with the D-backs since 2019 before being traded to the Rangers for three prospects at this summer's deadline. We ranked him as the 27th-best free agent available this offseason.  \nZac Gallen is a free agent and unlikely to return to the D-backs, who will also be without Corbin Burnes to begin 2026 (he had Tommy John surgery in June and won't return until after the All-Star break at the earliest). Kelly will step into a rotation that includes the recently signed Michael Soroka and holdovers Ryne Nelson, Brandon Pfaadt, and Eduardo Rodriguez.    Frontrunners emerge for Donovan  \nThe Giants and Mariners have emerged as the frontrunners for Cardinals super utility guy Brendan Donovan, reports The Athletic. St. Louis hopes to land multiple prospects in return, most likely pitchers given the team's needs. The Cardinals are not prioritizing short-term wins and Donovan, 28 and two years away from free agency, doesn't align with the club's contention cycle.  Second base is Donovan's best position and the Giants and Mariners both have openings at the keystone, the latter after Jorge Polanco bolted for the Mets. Donovan has played every position except catcher and center field in the big leagues though. He's a good hitter and one of those players you can always find a way to get into a lineup. He's been a popular trade target this winter.  \n  Several teams interested in Robert  \nThe Mets, Padres, and Pirates are among the teams with interest in White Sox center fielder Luis Robert Jr., according to Francys Romero. The ChiSox declined to trade Robert at the deadline and instead picked up his $20 million club option for 2026, hoping to get a better return in the offseason. Chances are Chicago will have to eat some of that money to facilitate a trade.Robert, 28, has not hit much the last two years, though he remains a top flight defensive center fielder and baserunner. He's two years removed from a 38-homer season. Given the dearth of quality center fielders in the sport right now, there are worse dice rolls than the 28-year-old Robert. If the White Sox don't like the offers this winter, they could keep him and try again at the deadline.    \tYankees interested in Romero  \nThe Yankees are among the teams with interest in Cardinals lefty reliever JoJo Romero, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Romero, 29, is a year away from free agency, making it likely St. Louis will move him this offseason. The sinker specialist has posted an above-average ground ball rate throughout his career and even closed at times this past season.  \nNew York already has a ground ball lefty in sidewinder Tim Hill, though they place an emphasis on ground balls and limiting home runs in the late innings, hence their interest in Romero. Quality lefty relievers are imperative in the AL East, which houses lefty hitters Roman Anthony, Jarren Duran, Jonathan Aranda, Gunnar Henderson, Brandon Lowe, and Daulton Varsho, among others.   \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday Night Football in Week 15 in a pivotal matchup for Dallas to keep its postseason hopes alive. The Cowboys are 6-6-1 on the season, but 3-1 over their last four games with victories over both Super Bowl qualifiers (Eagles and Chiefs) from last season. CeeDee Lamb suffered a scary-looking concussion last Thursday, but the additional time off between games allowed him time to recover and clear the concussion protocol. The elite Cowboys WR1 is a full-go for SNF, and with that, the SportsLine model views Lamb as a top option for Week 15 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorers bets when online sports betting.The model also has another Dallas wide receiver, George Pickens, featured in its Week 15 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets, along with Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison showcasing value at Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer odds. Before making any Cowboys vs. Vikings picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at sportsbooks, be sure to see the Week 15 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest NFL odds. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 15 on a 50-35 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has revealed its top Vikings vs. Cowboys anytime TD scorer prop picks for Sunday Night Football: Best Week 15 Cowboys vs. Vikings anytime TD prop picks:CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (+115)George Pickens, Cowboys (+115)Jordan Addison, Vikings (+195)\nCeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (+115)Lamb had six receptions for 121 yards on eight targets despite playing just 46% of snaps last week, as he had to leave the game early with a concussion. But Lamb has cleared the concussion protocol and will be back for a Cowboys team that likely needs to win each of its final four games to have a chance at making the playoffs. Lamb has more than 110 receiving yards in back-to-back contests, including a touchdown two weeks ago, and he has scored in two of his last four games. Lamb continues to be the clear No. 1 option in the offense, averaging 9.5 targets per game over his last six games, and with that volume, he's always a threat for a touchdown.\nGeorge Pickens, Cowboys (+115)Pickens' name has been dragged through the mud a bit this week, with some questioning his dedication on certain routes last week, which played a role in Dallas' 44-30 loss to the Lions on Thursday Night Football. But Pickens has been one of the most reliable receivers in the league the majority of the season, ranking seventh in receptions (78), third in yards (1,179) and tied for fifth in receiving touchdowns (eight). He has at least nine targets in six straight games, as Dak Prescott has shown complete faith in him when Lamb is drawing double teams or additional defensive attention. The Cowboys could look to get Pickens back on track early to silence the noise around last week, and the model projects him to score in more than 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds for a Sunday Night Football touchdown.\nJordan Addison, Vikings (+195)The Vikings' offense has been a disaster for the majority of recent weeks, however, last week was not one of those games. Minnesota scored 31 points against the Commanders, including J.J. McCarthy throwing a career-high three touchdowns after passing for six scores in his first six games of the year. The Vikings are out of the postseason chase, so the team's main priority the remainder of the season should be evaluating if McCarthy is the quarterback of the future. The best way to figure that out is to allow him to throw -- and throw often. Justin Jefferson will receive the majority of Dallas' improved defense's attention, which should create TD opportunities for Addison. The model's simulations have Addison as the Vikings' most likely touchdown scorer on Sunday Night Football.\nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Vikings vs. Cowboys in Week 15 Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        A season which began in late August is reaching its conclusion, with that being the 2025-26 college football bowl schedule. There are 46 FBS bowl games, so there are no shortage of opportunities to make college football bowl bets. The LA Bowl kicked things off on Saturday, with Washington defeating Boise State, 38-10, and then the first round of the College Football Playoff begins on Friday, Dec. 19. The opener is a matchup of Blue Bloods as Alabama is a 1.5-point road favorite over Oklahoma per the latest college football bowl odds.That's one of a handful of games with a college football spread of 3 points or fewer. Others include Missouri State vs. Arkansas State (-1.5), Arizona State vs. Duke (-3) and Washington State vs. Utah State (-2.5), which is a matchup of future Pac-12 rivals. The Sun Devils won't have quarterback Sam Leavitt (portal/injured) or star receiver Jordan Tyson (opt out).The largest of the college football bowl spreads comes in the CFP, with Oregon favored by 21.5 points versus James Madison. Other games of interest include powerhouse programs facing off, such as Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5) in the Pinstripe Bowl and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5) in the Citrus Bowl as the Wolverines will be led by interim Biff Poggi after the firing of Sherrone Moore. Before locking in any college football bowl picks, be sure to see the latest bowl and playoff college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover almost 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-6.5, 48.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in well over 50% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule began on Saturday with Washington's 38-10 triumph over Boise State in the LA Bowl. Even with that result, college football bowl confidence pools remain open, for many, and there are 38 more matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets. Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, as Michael Van Buren Jr. will make the start. Those four TDs are the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-6.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\nThe Dallas Cowboys look to keep their NFC playoff hopes alive when they battle the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Cowboys, who are second in the NFC East, trail the first-place Philadelphia Eagles by just 1.5 games with four remaining. They are 2.5 games out of the final Wild Card spot, held by the Chicago Bears, who are the seventh seed. The game will feature quarterback J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings against quarterback Dak Prescott and the Cowboys.

McCarthy, meanwhile, has struggled at times. In seven games, he has completed 56% of his passes for 1,092 yards and nine touchdowns with 10 interceptions.

    "body": "\n        Former Ohio State coach and multiple national champion Urban Meyer is sympathizing with the family of Sherrone Moore following his firing this week at Michigan, stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Meyer says the conversation is independent of football after Moore was arrested and charged with felony home invasion and stalking after the ordeal.\"Last night, I said a prayer for that family. I mean, you've got three little girls,\" Meyer said on this week's The Triple Option Podcast. \"You've got a guy that was on top of the world a week ago. They're up 6-0 on the Buckeyes at home. And then, also, you wake up, and they're in this situation. Rivalries aside, this is all human element. \"Now, this is something that, from what you read, that's some serious stuff that went on. And just, all of a sudden, you start seeing the impact. Forget football. Who cares about football?''Moore, a 39-year-old married father of three, was terminated for cause following a university investigation that signaled a clear violation of policy. Michigan likely will be off the hook for nearly all of Moore's $14 million buyout since he was fired for cause.\nMeyer went 83–9 in nearly seven full seasons at Ohio State and was unbeaten against Michigan before stepping down in 2018. In 2021, he served as coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars for only 13 games before he was fired during a tumultuous season, that included missing a plane ride home after a road game, locker room issues and a former player accusing Meyer of kicking him during warmups. Meyer denied the incident, but the team fired him later that same day.Michigan finished 8-5 in Moore's debut season last fall before improving to 9-3 this year. The Wolverines had a chance to be in the final College Football Playoff discussion during rivalry weekend prior to a loss to the Buckeyes. Moore served a two-game suspension to start this season for his involvement in the sign-stealing scandal centered around Connor Stalions during the Jim Harbaugh era.\nAs it stands, Michigan is preparing for a Citrus Bowl appearance against Texas under interim coach Biff Poggi. Moore's last call with media prior to his firing was a call with reporters surrounding the Wolverines' postseason matchup and how many players were considering skipping the contest. Moore would not answer a question concerning NIL contract language involving certain Michigan players being incentivized to play in the game. He also said Michigan wouldn't know how many of its draft-eligible players would opt-out of the matchup in Orlando, but expected \"a lot more playing than not playing.\"\"We just really want guys that want to play in the game,\" Moore said. \"You don't want to have to promote people based on [if] they get rev share to play in the game. You want guys that just want to play football.\" \nJust under 72 hours later, Moore was fired and soon after detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township prior to charges being filed. In the aftermath of Moore's firing, Michigan is now looking inward and the university's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe've reached Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season, and while some teams aim to make late-season pushes into the postseason, others are keeping one eye on the upcoming NFL Draft and the other on their roster to see which players should and shouldn't return. Making things more complicated at this stage of the year is injuries, and there are quite a few notable ones for bettors to know for Week 15. Here's a breakdown of the most important injuries of Week 15, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. All times Eastern.Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, out)\nStar Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins is out this week with his second concussion of 2025, both of which have occurred over the last month. The Ravens need a win to try and keep pace with Pittsburgh for the division lead after dropping two games in a row to fall to 6-7.The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, while the total is very high at 51.5.Raiders at Eagles (1 p.m. ET)LV QB Geno Smith (right shoulder and back, out)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)\nKenny Pickett will be under center for the Raiders against his old team,as the former first-round pick will start in place of the injured Geno Smith, who's dealing with shoulder and back injuries. The Eagles will again be without star tackle Lane Johnson, which is bad news against Maxx Crosby. Vegas is a 12.5-point underdog here, with the total at just 38.5.Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m. ET)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, out)HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, out)\nMarvin Harrison Jr. headlines another lengthy injury list for the Cardinals, who have lost five in a row and are just 3-10 on the year. The Texans are on the opposite end of the spectrum, having won five in a row, but they are without veteran running back Nick Chubb against a lackluster Arizona defense.Houston is a 9.5-point favorite, and the total sits at 42.5.Chargers at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, out)KC WR Hollywood Brown (personal, out)KC OL Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor (out)\nThe Chargers aren't the only AFC West team with issues on the offensive line, as two Kansas City starters are out for this matchup on Sunday. The Chiefs will also be without veteran receiver Hollywood Brown in this must-win matchup, while the Chargers will be without receiver Quentin Johnston as he's dealing with a groin issue.Kansas City is a 6-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.Bills at Patriots (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nArguably the game of the week sees the Bills visit the Patriots in an AFC East clash. New England has won 10 in a row after a 1-2 start and is aiming to spoil the Bills' bid to win the division for the sixth year in a row. Buffalo is favored by 1.5, and the total is 49.5.Jets at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)NYJ QB Tyrod Taylor (groin, out)NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)\nA weird season for the Jets will be made even weirder this weekend with undrafted rookie Brady Cook starting at quarterback with both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields out. Cook completed 14 of his 30 attempts last week in relief of an injured Taylor, and he won't have reliable tight end Mason Taylor to throw to in this matchup with the AFC South-leading Jaguars.Jacksonville is favored by 13.5. The total is 41.5.Commanders at Giants (1 p.m. ET)WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out) WASH WR Deebo Samuel (illness, available)WASH RB Chris Rodriguez (groin, out)\nThe Commanders' offense is beat up with Jayden Daniels ruled out after returning last week only to get knocked out once again. Marcus Mariota will start, and he'll have Deebo Samuel to throw to as the veteran receiver is good to go. Washington won't have Chris Rodriguez Jr. in its running back rotation as he's out with a groin injury.The Giants are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 46.5.Browns at Bears (1 p.m. ET)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (calf and hand, out)CLE CB Denzel Ward (calf, out)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)\nCleveland will be down two weapons on offense with veteran tight end David Njoku and rookie running back Dylan Sampson both ruled out. Top cornerback Denzel Ward is also out for the Browns' elite defense. For Chicago, the Bears are still without receiver Rome Odunze.Chicago is favored by 7.5, and the total is 38.5.Panthers at Saints (4:25 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)\nThe main injury here is that the Saints will be without top running back Alvin Kamara once again. The veteran is out with knee and ankle injuries in this divisional clash with the Panthers, who can take first place in the NFC South with a win thanks to Tampa Bay's loss on Thursday.Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.Lions at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)DET S Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph (out)LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)\nThis massive NFC clash sees the Lions again dealing with major injuries on defense, and that's especially true in the secondary as both of the team's starting safeties are out. The Rams expect Davante Adams to play, but he is questionable with a nagging hamstring injury.The Rams are 6-point favorites while the total is the highest of the Week 15 slate at 54.5.Colts at Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)IND QB Riley Leonard (knee, will be active)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)\nThe big story here is who will start at quarterback for the Colts. Daniel Jones tore his Achilles last week and is out for the year, so Indianapolis signed Philip Rivers, who last played in 2020, to the practice squad. Rookie Riley Leonard played in place of Jones last week and also suffered an injury, but he'll be active in Seattle. Whether he starts is another question altogether. Defensively, the Colts will be down star cornerback Sauce Gardner against the Seahawks' high-flying offense.The Seahawks are 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.Packers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee, questionable)\nThe Packers and Broncos square off in what very well could be a Super Bowl preview on Sunday, and Green Bay is hoping to have its top running back on the field as Josh Jacobs is questionable. If he can't go, Emanuel Wilson would serve as lead back as third-string back MarShawn Lloyd has been ruled out. Denver is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 42.5.Titans at 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)SF RB Christian McCaffrey (back, questionable)\nStar 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury ahead of Sunday's matchup with Tennessee. This would leave Brian Robinson as San Francisco's lead back should McCaffrey be inactive. San Francisco is favored by 12.5 while the total sits at 44.5.Vikings at Cowboys (8:20 p.m. ET)DAL TE Jake Ferguson (calf, questionable)\nIt looks like Dallas' offense will be at full strength, which wasn't a certainty entering the week. Star receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol and will suit up this week, while tight end Jake Ferguson is expecting to play on Sunday despite being listed as questionable.Dallas is favored by 5.5 points. The total is 48.5.Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)\nStar Pittsburgh edge rusher T.J. Watt won't suit up this week after he suffered a collapsed lung that required surgery after a dry needling treatment. It's unclear if or when Watt will return this season for the AFC North-leading Steelers.The Steelers are 3-point favorites at home. The total is 42.5. \n            ",

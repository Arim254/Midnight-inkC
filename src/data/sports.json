    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders lost much more than just their sixth game of the season on Sunday night against the Seattle Seahawks, as star quarterback Jayden Daniels dislocated his left elbow with less than eight minutes remaining in the 38-14 defeat. Many were quick to criticize coach Dan Quinn for leaving his best player in the game with the contest already out of hand. Now, it looks like Daniels is going to miss several more contests as Washington's season continues to spiral. On Monday, Quinn took responsibility for leaving Daniels in the game too long, and risking his franchise quarterback's health.\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels injury update: Commanders star QB awaiting MRI for dislocated left elbow vs. Seahawks\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I know many of you have been asking about the thought process of Jayden being in the game in that situation. I get that,\" Quinn said. \"I've been thinking about it honestly nonstop too, and for me the answer is, man, I missed it.\"Quinn explained his thought process to reporters. On Daniels' final drive there was 12:30 remaining in the fourth quarter with his Commanders trailing 38-7. Quinn said that possession would be the last for certain players, such as Daniels and wide receiver Deebo Samuel. Quinn knew that the offensive play-calling would be relatively vanilla, and not call for Daniels to make plays with his legs -- but that's exactly where Quinn said he messed up. This is the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, who is special as a scrambler. \nOn a second-and-goal with 7:39 remaining in the game, Daniels scrambled to his right but was taken down behind the line of scrimmage by Drake Thomas. The second-year signal-caller attempted to use his non-throwing hand to balance as he went down, and that's when his elbow popped. Quinn said that Daniels did not suffer any fractures to his arm, just the dislocation. Later in the week, he will have more information regarding if his quarterback could return at some point this season. Sunday night was costly for Washington from an injury standpoint, as the Commanders also lost wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey to a broken collarbone, and cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.\nWith Daniels out, Marcus Mariota reenters the starting lineup. The veteran journeyman has started three games for Washington this season, winning one, and has thrown four touchdowns compared to three interceptions in those contests. Up next for the Commanders are the 5-3 Detroit Lions on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Since arriving in Utah with a breakout season in 2022-23, Lauri Markkanen has been one of the NBA's best stretch fours and the ninth-year pro is off to a sizzling start this season. Markkanen is averaging 33.0 points per game thus far and has scored 29 points or more in five consecutive games. However, his scoring average is inflated by a 51-point game against the Suns earlier in the year and he needed 28 shots to get to 29 points against the Hornets on Sunday. Now he'll be playing in the second game of a back-to-back against the Celtics, who will have a point to prove defensively after a blowout loss to the Rockets. With the latest NBA prop odds inflating Markkanen's over/under for total points to 26.5, the SportsLine Projection Model is targeting the Under (-125) as one of its top NBA player props on Monday.

I'm expecting some regression in one or even all of these 3 stats for a good stretch and can hit this if he 'only' plays 31 minutes (not 37), only takes 18 FGAs (not 23) and only shoots 43% (not 49%),\" SportsLine senior data analyst Stephen Oh said. \"Boston's defense was just embarrassed by the Rockets who shot 66% from 3pt range in a +27 pt blowout loss at home to Houston.

I'm still going to ride with his change in production after the Kings traded De'Aaron Fox. Before the trade he averaged 3.7 rebounds (21-22 over 3.5),\" Oh said. \"But since then he's averaged 4.1 and is 26-15 over 3.5 boards.

With 2:09 left to play, the Falcons were trailing 24-23 and sitting at New England's 48-yard line. On a second-and-10 play, center Ryan Neuzil sent a snap back to Michael Penix Jr. that the QB wasn't ready for. The Patriots quickly rushed Penix and the QB didn't want to take a sack, so he quickly got rid of the ball and he ended up getting called for intentional grounding, which is a 10-yard penalty with a loss of down. So Atlanta's second-and-10 turned into a third-and-20 from its own 42. According to Morris, the only reason the bad snap happened is because the Patriots confused his center by simulating Atlanta's snap count. \"They did a nice job, they simulated a snap,\" Morris said. \"The ball came early, it was snapped early. Within that snap, that was when we got the intentional grounding.\"\nSimulating a snap is illegal in the NFL and it's a strong accusation, so Morris was asked to clarify that he was in fact accusing the Patriots of doing that. \"They were clapping. Simulated our snap, got us to snap the ball,\" Morris said. \"That's why the ball was snapped early to [Penix], and he wasn't ready for the snap.\"If a defense is caught simulating a snap count, that's known as a \"disconcerting signal\" and it's illegal under NFL rules. If you get flagged for that in a game, it's a 15-yard penalty. If a flag had been thrown, the Falcons would have gotten a first-and-10 at New England's 33-yard line.\nSo did the clapping actually happen? You can judge for yourself by checking out a video of the play below. \nHere are the two biggest takeaways from the replay: The nine Patriots defenders closest to the line of scrimmage definitely did NOT clap. If there was a clap, it came from Patriots safety Jaylinn Hawkins. Starting at the five-second mark, it appears that he's looking at the Patriots' sideline trying to get someone's attention. It's hard to tell if he actually clapped his hands, but Neuzil did snap the ball just as Hawkins stopped moving his hands. Falcons reactionPenix was asked about the clapping after the game and although he couldn't say with 100% certainty that it actually happened, he did say that Neuzil definitely heard clapping. \"Supposedly they were clapping,\" Penix said. \"For us, whenever I'm clapping, that means I want the ball. I knew [Neuzil] said he heard them clapping, and he thought it was my clap, and he snapped the ball. I threw the ball in [Kyle Pitts'] direction. He had just released on a route. I thought I was going to be okay with the grounding part. Obviously that wasn't the case.\"\nSo Neuzil definitely heard someone clapping, but he didn't know exactly where the clapping was coming from. Patriots deny all wrongdoingIf Neuzil heard some clapping, you'd think someone else on the field would have heard it, but that's not the case on New England's side. Patriots defensive tackle Milton Williams doesn't believe that anyone on his team was clapping. \"Who was clapping? Did it look like I was clapping?\" Williams said, via MassLive.com. \"I'm going to go watch and see who was clapping. I didn't hear no clapping. I'm looking at the ball. The ball moves, I'm gone.\"\nIf it was Hawkins -- and that's a big if -- he was lined up 12 to 13 yards off the line of scrimmage so it seems like a few other people would have heard his claps if Neuzil did. During a press conference on Monday, Patriots coach Vrabel was asked about the possibility that Hawkins may have been clapping his hands to try and mess up the Falcons' snap count and he dismissed that theory. \"That wasn't anybody's intent, and I don't think that we've ever coached that or talked about that,\" Vrabel said. \"I can't spend that much time focused on it. I did look at it briefly. I certainly didn't think that that was anything that we did -- I mean, I think it's pretty loud, guys are trying to get lined up and I'm glad that we took off when they snapped the ball.\"\nVrabel was also asked if he was annoyed about the fact that Morris was accusing his team of cheating. \"I don't think annoyed. I'm trying to not waste any more time looking for anybody clapping,\" the Patriots coach said. \"I don't see anything.\"With Morris making public accusations against the Patriots, the NFL will likely be looking into this and it will be very interesting to see what the league finds. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There will now be plenty of time for Hugh Freeze to golf after Auburn fired him Sunday following an abysmal 15-19 record over three seasons. That might feel like a too easy, and frankly unoriginal, punchline about the now-fired Auburn football coach. But in talking to multiple sources within Auburn football and around the Auburn community, it is striking just how much Freeze seemed to prioritize his golf game over working to improve the Tigers' football program. Last season, for instance, he was spotted on the golf course multiple times on Sundays after losses the previous day.  After multiple stories about his affinity for golf came out this summer, Freeze seemed a bit more sheepish about being seen publicly playing golf during the season. He was sensitive about all the golf jokes -- he claimed publicly it didn't detract from his work -- and was particularly upset over comments Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin made. But he still couldn't help himself. On the Friday before a home game this season, Freeze again showed up to the golf course. As an Auburn booster told CBS Sports, \"Freeze just came out to the golf course without clubs to watch guys play golf.\"\nAs it became more and more clear that Freeze wasn't the right guy to right the ship at Auburn, there were naturally questions about why it didn't work. On paper, it seemed to make perfect sense for Freeze to succeed on the Plains. It was weird, though -- almost from the start -- and there were more and more whispers among staffers and boosters that Freeze had lost the mojo that made him an unequivocal success at Ole Miss and Liberty. He looked deflated and tired, even before a cancer prognosis this year, and didn't seem to have any real plan to fix things. \"The only problem we didn't foresee,\" one booster said, \"is that he wanted to play golf way more than coach anymore!\" ****Auburn will pay $15.8 million to make Freeze go away, the latest eight-figure payment the university has approved for a failed football coach. In just the last five years, that number totals more than $52 million. No Auburn coach has left on his own terms since 1975, despite at least one of them winning a national championship. \nFreeze had every resource and advantage available to him in ways his recent predecessors hadn't. Bryan Harsin never fit in at Auburn. The Boise native had won plenty at Boise State but quickly looked over-his-head in trying to navigate an insular community like Auburn. Harsin didn't understand the politics of the place, upset the wrong powerful boosters who preferred different coaching candidates and had the money spigot turned off in the early days of Name, Image and Likeness. By the time he figured out how important it was to have certain boosters on his side, it was too late and he was fired midway through his second season.After going outside the box to hire Harsin, Auburn went as inside the box as possible with Freeze. Never mind the fact Freeze had to resign from Ole Miss because of a \"pattern of conduct\" unbecoming of a head coach which included a dozen phone calls to escorts. Or that as Liberty's head coach he sent unsolicited messages to sexual assault survivors, including one embroiled in an active lawsuit against Liberty, defending his boss as the \"most Jesus like leader I have ever seen or been around but you take every chance you can to take a shot at him.\" \nIn a craven desire to be relevant again, Auburn valued Freeze's two wins over Nick Saban and Alabama over the litany of red flags that followed him everywhere he went. It wasn't like Auburn leaders were unaware either, even hiring a crisis public relations firm before they hired Freeze to help them navigate the potential fallout. A lesson to ADs everywhere: If you have to hire a crisis PR firm to help sell your toxic hire, just don't. Auburn hiring Freeze was a win-at-all-costs move that ultimately just delivered shame rather than any win of consequence. Unlike Harsin, the power brokers all coalesced around Freeze. After a failed coup to insert Kevin Steele as head coach after Gus Malzahn was fired in 2020, Freeze was actually the preferred candidate of many of those top Auburn supporters. He was never able to get any traction that first time around with then-university president Jay Gogue, who made clear he wouldn't support a Freeze hire. \nWhen Freeze was hired in November 2022, Auburn put a robust NIL operation behind him to go get the players he needed to get Auburn back to where it belonged. Freeze recruited the high school ranks well, signing back-to-back top 10 classes in 2024 and 2025, but in terms of overall roster management, he never really got it. Freeze admitted to his staff early on that he didn't have to deal with NIL much at Liberty and didn't really know how it worked. Despite that, according to sources, he still surrounded himself with Liberty staff who hadn't managed NIL or the transfer portal. \"From Day 1 of when they got there, I knew it'd be a shitshow,\" said a former Auburn staffer. \nWith the portal, Freeze could be slow to act and miss out on players he needed, including offensive linemen, to more aggressive programs. He'd complain about having to get on the phone with high-profile transfer portal players, according to sources, and try to pass it off to other staffers. Freeze struggled with the fast-paced nature of transfer recruiting -- how much his program is willing to pay and what the vision for the upcoming season will be -- and how different it was from his usual approach with high school recruits. Never was that more frustrating than how Freeze approached the quarterback position. ****For the many reasons Freeze lost his job, his inability to fix an increasingly predictable offense or pick the right quarterback rank at the top. \nNo one got more mileage off two wins to earn an offensive guru title than Freeze. He seemed perpetually stuck in his brief glory years back in Oxford when he beat Alabama in 2014 and 2015 before it all came crashing down. He was resistant to outside advice, especially when it came to trying to improve a stale offense that somehow got worse by the day. \"It's arrogance. It's never his fault,\" said a former Auburn staffer. \"It's always the guys on the field.\"Freeze never got the quarterback position right in his three years at Auburn. Grabbing Michigan State quarterback Payton Thorne in 2023 made some sense on paper, even if beneath the surface there were concerns. Thorne had a big 2021 season for the Spartans, where he threw for 3,232 yards and 27 touchdowns, but was coming off a much more modest 19 touchdowns and 11 interception season when the Tigers signed him. The underlying issue was Thorne no longer had running back Kenneth Walker or receiver Jalen Nailor to help him. \nEven if there were those in the building who were against taking Thorne in the first place -- and there were, according to multiple sources -- the bigger issue was that Freeze doubled down on Thorne for a second season. Despite the Tigers going 6-6 in Year 1 behind Thorne, who threw for 1,755 yards, 16 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, Freeze thought the best strategy was to surround him with more talent the way Michigan State had in 2021. Auburn went out and got highly-regarded Penn State transfer receiver Keandre Lambert-Smith and a recruiting class that included five-star Cam Coleman. Freeze opted to stick with Thorne despite multiple coaches and personnel staffers in the building pushing him to consider Washington State transfer Cam Ward. There was an internal push to go after Ward from the jump, but Freeze and quarterbacks coach Kent Austin were resistant. They didn't want to upset what they believed was a young, talented QB room that included four-star freshman Walker White and redshirt freshman Hank Brown. They did check in very late in the process with Ward, who ultimately landed at Miami, to see if he'd still consider Auburn but never went all-in to get him. They preferred to stick with what they had. \"They legitimately thought Thorne was the answer,\" said an Auburn source \"and they were wrong.\"\nFreeze was warned my multiple people in the building that keeping Thorne was the wrong move.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Ward was terrific at Miami and finished as a Heisman Trophy finalist. White and Brown both transferred after the 2024 season to Baylor and Iowa, respectively. In recent months, Senator Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn head coach, has told a story to Auburn supporters that he had tried to convince Freeze to go after New Mexico State transfer Diego Pavia instead of keeping Thorne. Freeze was plenty familiar with Pavia, who led NMSU to a shocking upset win over Auburn in that 2023 season and has been a revelation since transferring to Vanderbilt. But Freeze told the senior Alabama senator he preferred to keep Thorne and build around him in the transfer portal. \"You're a dead man if you don't have a quarterback,\" Tuberville said he told Freeze. And all it took was a few games for Freeze to realize he'd made a mistake. On the Friday before a home game against Oklahoma last season, which turned out to be another loss, Freeze admitted to a source he blew it with Thorne and should have taken a transfer quarterback instead. Auburn limped to the end of a 5-7 season knowing it had to get the quarterback position right. \nIt's one reason there was so much industry surprise when Auburn went all-in on Oklahoma transfer Jackson Arnold. The pedigree was there as a former five-star, but it had been an up-and-down first season in Norman for Arnold which included a benching. In fact, the Oklahoma team Freeze lost to was led by Michael Hawkins, who replaced Arnold as the Sooners' starter for a month. Arnold was anything but a surefire pick in a critical year Freeze needed to win big. Perhaps all it took was watching Arnold run all over Alabama in a late season win for Freeze to dream of what he could do for him in the Iron Bowl. \"He went wrong with the quarterback,\" said a Power Four personnel source who has studied Auburn. \"He f—-- that up. They've got a really good defense. You can't argue with their wide receiver group. Obviously they're not doing anything, but they're not doing anything because they had nobody to get them the football.\"It's not solely Arnold's fault -- a mediocre offensive line and uninspiring play-calling haven't done him any favors -- but when you surveyed the roster it again looked like the quarterback Freeze hand-picked over more reliable options was yet again holding Auburn back. In five SEC losses this season, Auburn lost by an average margin of 7.2 points. In those same five losses, Auburn averaged 11.4 points and 178.4 passing yards per game. The Tigers were a dreadful 20 for 74 on third-down conversions. This despite a talented group of receivers that includes Coleman and Georgia Tech transfer Eric Singleton, who are both believed to be earning seven figures annually. Freeze benched Arnold in favor of Ashton Daniels in Auburn's lone SEC win over Arkansas last week. Both played in a 10-3 loss to Kentucky that was the final straw for Auburn AD John Cohen. In a bizarre season that has included Cohen comparing Freeze to a car that may or may not start, there was no coming back from a loss to the Wildcats that elicited loud chants calling for the head coach's dismissal. DJ Durkin's defense did what it needed to keep Auburn in the game, but the offense was again listless and helpless. Auburn was too talented -- and too much money had been invested in the roster -- to accept any more failure. Freeze had been given Michelin star-caliber ingredients, but he was still serving up elementary school cafeteria meals. There was no need to prolong the inevitable any longer. ****The days of Freeze being relevant within major college football are all but over. He's all baggage and no upside at this point in his career. If you're going to sell your soul for football success as Auburn attempted, you want national championships -- not a guy who was somehow worse than Bryan Harsin. There won't be another comeback story after this. \n        \n            \n                What's next for Hugh Freeze after Auburn firing? Don't expect him to lead a Power Four program anytime soon\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFreeze leaves Auburn as one of the worst hires in school history. Given all the resources at his disposal, a 15-19 (6-16 in the SEC) record is an abject failure. He was never able to come close to replicating the Ole Miss magic that made schools want to keep giving him more chances. He still believed he was an offensive wizard until the very end even if the results were abysmal. At the time of Freeze's firing, Auburn ranked 121st in rushing offense, 104th in passing offense and 110th in scoring offense. All three of those rank in the bottom three of the SEC. For a man who used to reach out to reporters and fans and offer to pray for them over stories and tweets he didn't like, he may want to stay off the internet for a few days. The downfall of Freeze, who until the very end insisted Auburn was close to turning it around, has prompted schadenfreude across college football. Even in the face of professional disappointment, there are silver linings. It will be in the 70s and sunny this week in Auburn -- the perfect weather for a golf round or two. \n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

In the last two matches Xabi Alonso opted to leave him on the bench, but if Alexander-Arnold does play any part in Tuesday's game, he will surely receive a hostile reception. -- James Benge  Man of the match: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid: With 18 goals scored in 14 matches so far in all competitions, the start of the 2025-26 season has been phenomenal for the French star. The former PSG striker already scored five goals in the opening three Champions League matches and his return to England will mark one of the most exciting games of the week and all the eyes will be on him. Whenever that happens, he tends to deliver and this season has been no exception. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 2: Liverpool may figure out how to get out of their slump at some point, but Tuesday's clash against Real Madrid might come too soon for Arne Slot's in-flux side. Los Blancos are already a well-oiled machine under manager Xabi Alonso, with Kylian Mbappe offering enough flair to make up for the restrained approach preferred by the new boss. It was the recipe that brought them success in their 2-1 win in El Clasico, and it could do the trick again on Tuesday as Alonso's Madrid target a second statement victory in a short span of time.  --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Real Madrid to win (+160): Xabi Alonso's men may be going away from home in a trip to Anfield, but the environment isn't something that stops a team like Real Madrid. Los Blancos will have plenty at their disposal to give Liverpool's defense more than it can handle during the match. Big matches are a good time to keep plays simple, and it doesn't get much simpler than backing Kylian Mbappe to continue scoring while leading Real Madrid to victory over Liverpool. -- Chuck Booth PSG vs. Bayern Munich, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Joshua Kimmich, Bayern Munich: Given that both these sides are overloaded with high grade forward talent, it may well be that the winner is whoever can best wrestle control of midfield. PSG have perhaps the more talented triumvirate but the best individual in the engine room might be Kimmich and if he can get quick ball to the front three, Bayern can thrive. -- James BengeMan of the match: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, PSG: The Georgian winger will be pivotal for the team deployed by Luis Enrique on Tuesday, considering some key injuries that are affecting the French giants this month. We can probably expect a lot of goals in the game that will take place in Paris and the former Napoli winger can benefit from it. In the two matches he's played so far in Europe this season, Kvaratskhelia already scored twice and provided one assist. More coming. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Paris Saint-Germain 3, Bayern Munich 1: One can never truly count out a team with the attacking talent of Bayern Munich, but these days, it is increasingly difficult to bet against Paris Saint-Germain. Manager Luis Enrique's reinvention of the team got them all the way to a historic treble last season and their quality has barely dimmed this campaign, their depth leading the way with a 2-1 win at Barcelona on Matchday 2 and their stars returning in time for a 7-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Matchday 3. It is the type of showing that makes them not just a serious contender in this game, but in the tournament as a whole, so expect them to act accordingly. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet:. Draw (+290): This is a tough game to pick as Paris Saint-Germain have done well managing injuries while staying at their best, but Bayern Munich have also operated as one of the best teams in the world under Vincent Kompany. It's a match were the winner, if there is one, would be considered one of the top contenders to win the entire competition, but it's also a time where a draw isn't something that would disappoint either side involved. With only five teams having a perfect nine points through three matches, just sharing a point will go a long way. -- Chuck Booth Champions League matches on Wednesday Matchup\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    James Benge\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Francesco Porzio\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pardeep Cattry\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chuck Booth\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Roger Gonzalez\n                            \n            Qarabag vs. Chelsea0-20-40-30-20-4Pafos vs. Villarreal1-11-21-20-21-1Club Brugge vs. Barcelona1-31-20-31-30-3Benfica vs. Leverkusen2-01-11-10-11-1Ajax vs. Galatasaray1-22-21-21-31-1Newcastle vs. Athletic Club1-02-11-02-02-0Man City vs. Dortmund3-03-13-03-12-1Marseille vs. Atalanta2-13-12-11-12-2Inter vs. Kairat4-03-03-03-03-0 Game of the day: Man City vs. Dortmund, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Erling Haaland, Manchester City: It's giving running into an ex who has had the most almighty of glow ups. Not that Haaland was anything other than spectacular in a Borussia Dortmund shirt, but right now there might be no more devastating force in football than the Norwegian, scorer of 17 of City's 31 goals in all competitions so far this season. He's probably going to add to that. -- James BengeMan of the match: Phil Foden, Manchester City: While all the eyes of Wednesday's match will be on the former Borussia Dortmund striker, the real action will come from the English star who is still looking for to score his first Champions League goal of the season. His technique and style will be crucial in breaking through the German defense, and he can certainly help raise the tempo when the Citizens are in possession and pushing forward. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Manchester City 3, Borussia Dortmund 0: Erling Haaland is in high-flying form and might be able to topple Borussia Dortmund on his own, but the good news for Manchester City is that the Norway international has a talented cast of supporting players willing to pitch on the goalscoring front. City may not be at the peak of their powers as manager Pep Guardiola mounts another rebuild, but they are definitely trending in the right direction, with Wednesday's game a perfect chance to showcase just that. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Manchester City to win and Erling Haaland to score (-129): The fact that the odds are this low for picking a scorer and a victory shows just how dominant Haaland has been in a Manchester City shirt. With 17 goals in only 14 appearances in all competitions for City, Haaland is going to score in almost every game, the question is just will his team win the game. Facing Dortmund at home is a time that they should do just that. -- Chuck Booth Barcelona vs. Club Brugge, 3 p.m. ET  Player to watch: Lamine Yamal, Barcelona: It hasn't taken long for Yamal to get back in the groove after his injury earlier this season. His last six games have brought three assists and two goals and the 18-year-old was on sparkling form in the weekend's 3-1 win over Elche. -- James BengeMan of the match: Fermin Lopez, Barcelona: The Spanish striker has been one of the most prolific strikers in this first part of the season as he already scored six goals in the opening nine matches of the season, including the hat trick he scored in the last Barcelona home match against Olympiacos. With Robert Lewandowski still at not his best form and Raphinha's injury, he's the one to watch in the attack for the Blaugrana alongside Lamine Yamal. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Club Brugge 1, Barcelona 2: Club Brugge have done their best to climb up Europe's ranks, reaching the round of 16 in last season's edition of the Champions League along the way. They just might have the goods to get one past Barcelona's somewhat leaky back line, too, but this game is Barcelona's to lose. Even if Hansi Flick's side is not at full fitness, Lamine Yamal will still play a big part in the attacking operation and the likes of Fermin Lopez and Marcus Rashford have pitched in nicely in the absence of Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: First half over 1.5 goals (-116): This is almost an auto bet in Barcelona games. With how they play under Hansi Flick, not only will Barcelona go at the opposition with all that they have in attack, but they'll also give up chances on the counter. Brugge are a team with enough pace to take advantage of those chances which can lead to a high scoring affair. -- Chuck Booth\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL season is roughly halfway complete and that means it is time to reassess the Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year races. The offensive picture has not changed much since the quarter mark, but the defensive odds have shifted a bit as a result of no one running away with the award. Speaking to the draft class as a whole, there has been incredible depth. Sixty rookies have played at least 250 offensive or defensive snaps this season. That figure more than doubles when expanded to include 100+ snaps. The Browns, for example, have eight rookies who have played at least 100 offensive and/or defensive snaps. Here are my five favorites for both Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards, as well as a sleeper for each. Odds are from DraftKings Sportsbook as of Monday afternoon. New users are eligible for up to $200 in bonus bets.Offensive Rookie of the YearQB Jaxson Dart, Giants (-130)WR Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers (+175)TE Tyler Warren, Colts (+650)WR Tetairoa McMillan, Panthers (+1400)RB Quinshon Judkins, Browns (+2200)Over the past 10 years, Offensive Rookie of the Year has been awarded to five quarterbacks, three running backs and two wide receivers. Quarterbacks have won four of the past six seasons. A tight end has never won the award, which means Warren's odds are a bit ominous. He is aided by the Colts performing so well as a team. \nThe top two from the quarter mark are now flipped as Dart has become more entrenched and productive as the Giants starting quarterback. If Dart doesn't veer off course, he's a pretty clear choice for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Egbuka has cooled off a bit over the last three weeks and has been dealing with an injury. He is leading all rookies in receiving yards (562) and receiving touchdowns (5). McMillan has been a key component of Carolina's offense. The Panthers are performing better as a team, but McMillan may not produce a season-long stat line strong enough to overcome Dart. He is leading all rookies with 69 targets. \nThe fifth spot came down to Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty (+1800) and Judkins. Judkins has been more productive in a smaller sample size, but the margins are slim. Titans quarterback Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, was a consideration, but it was difficult to envision his supporting cast improving enough to rejoin the conversation. Sleeper: TE Oronde Gadsden, Chargers (+2500)Gadsden has not played as much as the others on this list, but no rookie has been more productive over the past month. He is averaging 94.25 yards receiving per game over that time period. If he continues on that path, +2500 will be good value. \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft: Saints still go QB, Arvell Reese first defensive player off the board\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefensive Rookie of the YearEDGE Abdul Carter, Giants (+135)LB Jihaad Campbell, Eagles (+250)S Nick Emmanwori, Seahawks (+250)EDGE Donovan Ezeiruaku, Cowboys (+2800)CB Will Johnson, Cardinals (+3000)Over the past 10 years, six pass rushers, three cornerbacks and one linebacker have won the award. Pass rushers have won five of the past six awards. Those players averaged 8.2 sacks as rookies. Most recently, Jared Verse won the award with 4.5 sacks. Shaq Leonard (2018) is the last pure linebacker to win the award since Luke Kuechly in 2012. Leonard stuffed the stat sheet with 163 total tackles, seven sacks, four forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and two interceptions.   \nCarter has been effective creating pressure for the Giants, but Brian Burns has had a monopoly on the sack production (11). No one else on the team has more than 2.5 sacks. Campbell may not have eye-popping numbers in any one category, but the stat sheet should be stuffed. He is a rangy linebacker making plays all over the field for an Eagles team that promises once again to be in title contention. Emmanwori has been limited to five games played, but his presence is felt when available. He landed in the perfect schematic opportunity with coach Mike Macdonald. As long as Carter leaves the door open, there is room for a rookie like Emmanwori to create a positive narrative for himself and earn consideration. \nEzeiruaku has flashed for a Cowboys team that desperately needs pressure created. It would not be a surprise if he had more inflated sack totals than Carter despite having a lesser impact on the game, as a whole. Johnson has consistently been a good player, but may not have the individual or team accolades to build his case. Sleeper: LB Carson Schwesinger, Browns (+3500)Schwesinger was the favorite at the quarter-season mark. He has more sacks (1) than Carter (0.5) to go along with an interception and more tackles per game than any other rookie. However, he is now dealing with a high ankle sprain that will cost him some time and the Browns aren't going to provide the team-success bump other rookies may receive. \n            ",

Across his parts of 15 seasons in Major League Baseball, Ottavino has pitched to a 128 ERA+ with 46 career saves. Earlier in his career, Ottavino pitched for the Rockies from 2012 through 2018. The Rockies, who are also in search of a new manager, have logged seven straight losing seasons, and in 2025 endured one of the worst seasons in MLB history with a record of 43-119. Along the way, they were outscored by more than 400 runs. Those depths prompted an ongoing effort to modernize the front office. In early October, general manager Bill Schmidt resigned his post after 26 years in the organization. The Rockies are now poised to hire a lead executive from outside the organization for the first time since 1999.While Ottavino would certainly qualify as an unconventional choice and an outside voice, he would come with no meaningful front-office experience given that was an active player for part of this past season. \nThe Rockies recently moved on from two finalists for the job, Diamondbacks assistant general manager Amiel Sawdaye and Guardians assistant general manager Matt Forman, The Athletic reported on Monday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys will host the Arizona Cardinals on Monday Night Football to close out Week 9, and kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET. Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray (foot) has already been ruled out, so Jacoby Brissett will make his third start for Arizona. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have the NFL's No. 2 scoring offense and have three players on their roster who have scored six touchdowns or more -- Javonte Williams, George Pickens and Jake Ferguson. The latest NFL anytime touchdown scorer odds list Pickens for as high as +130, and he's one of our top NFL anytime TD scorer picks for Monday. Pickens' over/under for total receiving yards is 64.5, and his over/under for total receptions is 4.5.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Monday Night Football in Week 9.

The former second-round pick had a great start to his career in Denver, but suffered a major knee injury in his second season and never looked the same after. Jones signed him for just $3 million this offseason, and he's been one of the best backs in the league, rushing for 633 yards over his first eight games and scoring nine total touchdowns. The model predicts that Williams scores 0.81 touchdowns on average while this price implies a 62.3% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.George Pickens, Cowboys (+130, bet365)Another solid offseason addition for Dallas, Pickens has given the Cowboys arguably the best one-two punch at wide receiver in the NFL, along with CeeDee Lamb. He's caught 43 passes for 685 yards and six touchdowns over his first eight games in Dallas, and also caught six touchdown passes during a five-week stretch where Lamb was out. He's still heavily involved in the Cowboys' passing attack with Lamb back in the lineup and could pose problems against an Arizona pass defense that ranks 25th in the league. The model predicts 0.58 touchdowns on average, while his odds imply a 43.5% chance to score. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Zonovan Knight, Cardinals (+165, DraftKings)Knight didn't have a touch until October, but was forced into the lineup by several injuries at running back in Arizona and he's now scored in two of his last three games. He piled up a season-high 17 touches prior to the bye week and figures to be a focal point of the Cardinals' offense again on Monday with Murray out and Brissett making another start. Meanwhile, the Cowboys rank second-to-last in the NFL in points allowed and yards allowed this season and have given up 30 touchdowns already in eight games. The model predicts that Knight scores 0.51 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 37.6% chance to score. Get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass:Want more Monday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Cowboys vs. Cardinals.

    "body": "\nThe Dallas Cowboys will look to get back to .500 when they host the struggling Arizona Cardinals on Monday night at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Cowboys (3-4-1) are coming off a 44-24 blowout loss last week at Denver. Meanwhile, the Cardinals (2-5) have lost five in a row but all of the losses have been by four points or fewer.Dallas is a 3-point favorite, while the Over/Under for total points is 53.5. Arizona will be playing its third straight game without quarterback Kyler Murray, who is officially questionable with a foot injury but will not start. Veteran Jacoby Brissett, who has 599 passing yards and a 4-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio over the last two games, will start for the third game in a row. He has a 19-36 career record as a starter and has lost six consecutive starts.The Cardinals have dominated the series against the Cowboys recently, having won three straight games and seven of the last eight. However, Arizona has dropped six of its last seven road games and nine of its last 11 primetime games.While Cardinals-Cowboys is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes and a nine-game NBA slate. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Nov. 3.

The Cowboys are the just the fourth team in NFL history to average 30-plus points per game on offense and allow 30-plus points per game on defense through eight games of a season. None of the previous three teams won a playoff game. Behind quarterback Dak Prescott, Dallas leads the league in passing offense (263.8 yards per game) and ranks second in total offense (384.1). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says the Cowboys have a 51% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to Dallas -3. Meanwhile, Vithlani notes the Cowboys have scored at least 40 points in each of their three home games this season. \"As bad as the Cowboys secondary has been, I don't think Arizona will be able to keep up in a shootout,\" he says.More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for Cardinals-CowboysModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's longshot player propsModel's Dak Prescott and Jacoby Brissett player propsModel's Marvin Harrison Jr. and CeeDee Lamb player propsWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchTimberwolves at NetsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Brooklyn | TV: Peacock| Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 226.5 -107 | Expert: Julius Randle Over 24.5 total points -117 (Mike Barner)\nThe Nets will look to win their first game of the season when they host the Timberwolves at the Barclays Center. On Sunday, the Nets were blown out by the 76ers 129-105 to drop to 0-6. The 0-6 start is the franchise's worst since the 2015-16 season when it went 0-7. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves will play without Anthony Edwards (hamstring) for a fourth straight game. With him out, Julius Randle has picked up the slack, averaging 29.0 points over that stretch. Barner likes Randle to continue his hot streak. \"With his leading role against a horrible defensive team, the Over is the way to go here,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 57.4% chance of the total staying Under 226.5 points and gives a \"B\" grade to Under 226.5 (-107).Lakers at Trail BlazersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Portland | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Blazers -3.5 | Expert: Blazers -147 (Matt Severance)\nThe Lakers hit the road to play the second half of a back-to-back when they face the Trail Blazers at the Moda Center. Last night, Luka Doncic had a triple-double (29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists) in a 130-120 win over the Heat in Los Angeles. The red-hot Austin Reaves added 26 points for the Lakers (5-2). Meanwhile, the Blazers (4-2) have won three in a row despite playing this season without head coach Chauncey Billups, who has been charged in the FBI's gambling sting operation. Portland beat Los Angeles by 14 points in L.A. on Oct. 27 though Doncic did not play that game. \"Los Angeles played last night and beat Miami, but I wonder if Doncic will be allowed to play the second of a back-to-back after going 38 minutes,\" Severance says. \"He just got back from injury, after all.\"College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 3 Florida vs. No. 13 ArizonaTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Las Vegas | TV: TNT/truTV | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arizona -3.5\nThe 2025-26 college basketball season tips off with a full slate of games, and the marquee matchup of the day pits the reigning national champions Florida Gators against the Arizona Wildcats at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Led by Alex Condon and Thomas Haugh, the Gators retain every important frontcourt contributor from last season's title team. However, they will have an all-transfer backcourt in Boogie Fland and Xaivian Lee. Meanwhile, the Wildcats will rely heavily on two five-star freshmen, Brayden Burries and Koa Peat, who form the nucleus of the team's No. 2-ranked recruiting class.

    "body": "\n        Week 11 of the college football season will be the first time teams at the top know exactly where they stand with the College Football Playoff committee. We'll get the first committee rankings on Tuesday night, and that'll set the tone for what should be a very fun weekend of games, headlined by six matchups involving top 10 teams that have something to prove. The most unique element of the College Football Playoff is the need for style points, as not all wins are created equal. And for teams that have already played their toughest competition, they have to keep the gas pedal down to keep the committee impressed. Then there are the conference championship game implications, with plenty still to be sorted out in the Big Ten, SEC, ACC and Big 12. Chaos reigns in the ACC, especially after Georgia Tech's loss last week, while the Big 12 once again has a million scenarios in play, as is a seemingly annual occurrence. The SEC has two undefeated teams in conference play in Texas A&M and Alabama, but both still have some big games to navigate on their schedule, including this week. The Big Ten title race is much simpler, as Ohio State and Indiana have cleared an apparent path to a showdown in Indianapolis, but they still need to take care of business to ensure that No. 1 vs. No. 2 battle happens. All of that sets the table for an exciting Week 11, and here are our predictions for the six biggest games on the schedule for Saturday. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Notre Dame crashes top 10 in college football rankings, resurgent Texas climbs\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 8 BYU at No. 9 Texas Tech\nThe only top-10 battle in the country will take place in Lubbock where undefeated BYU takes on its biggest test of the season against Texas Tech. This game figures to be decided in the trenches, where both teams have had the advantage on most opponents all season. BYU has leaned on teams with one of the nation's best rushing attacks, as it averages 5.4 yards per carry and 216 rushings yards per game. LJ Martin and Bear Bachmeier present a difficult problem for opposing defenses attacking downhill and challenge opponents' physicality and desire to hit for all 60 minutes, but they've yet to face a defense quite like Texas Tech. The Red Raiders lead the nation in rush defense, allowing just 74 yards per game and 2.4 yards per carry. Not having Skyler Gill-Howard in the middle anymore has weakened them a touch, and we saw last week Kansas State had the most success of any opponent all season (126 yards and two TDs on 4.2 yard per carry) with an offense that features a running QB. Still, they will make life difficult for BYU up front and whichever of the BYU offensive line and the Texas Tech defensive line win more consistently will likely determine this football game. \nTexas Tech's performance against K-State impressed me. I thought that could be an upset spot and while it took some time for the offense to get going, they opened things up late and the defense got big stops when they needed them to put the game on ice. I think this game might look a lot like that one, with BYU finding some success on the ground but struggling to hit the kinds of explosives in the run game. Over 60 minutes, I think the Red Raiders pull clear and move back on top of the Big 12 standings. PICK: Texas Tech 34-27 over BYUNo. 2 Indiana at Penn State\nPenn State comes home after giving everything it had in Columbus and it simply not being enough, and will be greeted by an Indiana team that's handing out beatdowns to the rest of the Big Ten like candy on Halloween. Credit to Terry Smith for getting the boys to battle as hard as they did against Ohio State and keeping it close for a half, but I'm concerned this Penn State squad might not have a whole lot in the tank for this game. The Hoosiers have won their last three games by an average of 40 points, as there are no signs that Curt Cignetti's group is satisfied with just getting through the weak points of their schedule. It is clear the message in that locker room is that the mentality each week has to be the same, especially after they almost got caught sleepwalking in Iowa City the week before going to Oregon. That message has been received, and there is no letup on either side of the ball for 60 minutes -- whether it's starters or backups in the game. \nNothing I saw from Penn State last week indicates there's a sleeping giant about to get woken up in Happy Valley, and I expect this game to look a lot like most every Indiana game we've seen this season. It might be close after a quarter, but by the time the final whistle blows, Beaver Stadium will be mostly emptied out except for the folks in red that made the trip from Bloomington. PICK: Indiana 38-13 over Penn StateNo. 5 Georgia at Mississippi State\nThe all-Bulldog battle in Starkville will be an interesting test for a Georgia team that has not looked dominant much at all this season. Georgia eked out a win over rival Florida last week and now faces a much-improved Mississippi State team on the road. Mississippi State finally picked up its first SEC win in two years in a thriller in Arkansas last week after coming up painfully short of upset wins over Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Now they'll get one more shot at taking down one of the SEC's big dogs (pun intended), and Georgia better be ready from the jump or it could find itself down quickly. \nSlow starts have been the M.O. for the Dawgs under Kirby Smart for some time, as they've had a propensity to play with their food early and then try to hit the gas in the second half after making adjustments. This season it's taken a little longer to get it in gear than they'd like when they do try to flip that switch, and the result has been some extremely stressful games.  So far, Alabama is the only team to punish them for it, but Tennessee, Auburn, Ole Miss and Florida have all had early leads on Georgia only to watch the Dawgs nose in front by the final whistle. It would not surprise me at all if the cowbells are ringing like crazy early in Davis Wade Stadium as Mississippi State jumps out in front, but everything about how this season's gone for both teams says in the fourth quarter Georgia is going to find a way to escape with a win. PICK: Georgia 37-31 over Mississippi StateNo. 6 Oregon at Iowa\nOregon's offense has not been as dynamic in Big Ten play as we've come to expect, and the Ducks will get quite the test on the road this week when they travel to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes. \nAs is always the case with Iowa teams under Kirk Ferentz, this year's Hawkeyes try to lean on defense and solid special teams. They're fourth in the country in points per game allowed (13.1), and for an Oregon offense that has had some struggles with consistently moving the ball, they're going to have to have one of their best performances of the season to avoid an upset loss on the road. This is an Iowa defense that held Indiana to its lowest scoring output of the season (20 points) and they are among the best in the country at limiting explosives. The Hawkeyes have allowed the second-fewest plays of 10+ yards (56) in the nation, tied with Ohio State and Oregon. With big plays at a premium in this game, it'll come down to sustaining drives and, perhaps, which defense can create a critical turnover or two. It's hard to know how much to take away from Oregon's 28-7 win against Wisconsin in terrible weather, but going on the road to Iowa City in November is no easy task. There's a reason this line is a short 5.5 and it certainly feels like the Ducks are going to have to prove their bonafides in their new conference by winning an old-school Big Ten kind of game where points are hard to come by. PICK: Oregon 20-16 over Iowa\nWatch Oregon vs. Iowa live Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports App and Paramount+ Premium.No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 19 Missouri\nBeau Pribula's injury put a bit of a damper on the excitement for this game, but Matt Zollers played pretty well after being thrust into action against Vanderbilt, and Eli Drinkwitz had a bye week to get him up to speed and adjust the offense to his strengths. That latter point will present the biggest challenge to Texas A&M, as they'll be flying a bit blind into this one. Based on what we saw in Nashville, Zollers won't be near the rushing threat Pribula was, but the Tigers might open things up more in the passing game. The Aggies won't have much in the way of tape to figure out exactly what Mizzou will want to do in key situations with Zollers under center, and they'll have to be nimble with their game plan and ready to make necessary adjustments if the Tigers look a bit different than what they prepared for. \nOn offense, the Aggies have been lighting opponents up all season, scoring 31+ in all but one game. Despite losing Le'Veon Moss against Florida, the rushing attack hasn't skipped a beat and Marcel Reed has been spectacular as both a passer and runner this season. They will present the biggest test for this Mizzou defense yet, as the Tigers have been excellent on defense this season but have also benefitted a bit from playing some teams that are happy to grind it out in a slugfest. The Aggies will want to push the tempo and if Mizzou opens up the passing game a bit more with Zollers, I could see this game being more of a shootout. I won't be surprised if there's some early success from the Mizzou offense coming off the bye with a new QB, but I do expect Texas A&M to be able to keep pace and eventually pull ahead to remain unbeaten. PICK: Texas A&M 34-27 over MissouriLSU at No. 4 Alabama\nHow much did LSU's players dislike Brian Kelly? That's what I'm excited to find out this week. The Tigers have looked flat on offense all year and the vibes in Baton Rouge finally got rotten enough that Kelly was ousted despite his massive buyout. Now the Tigers turn things over to Frank Wilson in the interim and his first task is to go into Tuscaloosa and face a Crimson Tide team that is undefeated in SEC play and fresh off a bye week. \nAside from the opening loss to Florida State that looks weirder and weirder each week, the Alabama offense has been able to score on everyone, and if the LSU defense can't get back to the form they showed early in the year, they'll be in trouble. I'm curious to know how much of that was a team that just didn't believe in what their coach was preaching and how much of it is just a team that maybe got figured out.They will need the offense to show something they haven't been able to all season, because Alabama is going to put 24+ points on the board, even if the Tigers play well on the defensive side of the ball. Garrett Nussmeier has taken a beating this year, and the LSU line is going to need to find a way to control the line of scrimmage to give them a chance. We haven't seen that this year, but a coaching change can sometimes light a fire and bring the best out of a group. If this game were in Baton Rouge, you could talk me into the Tide being on upset alert. They have been far more gettable on the road this year, with three one-score wins and the FSU loss. At home? It's been a very different story. Alabama's been a buzzsaw at Bryant-Denny, winning all four games by at least two touchdowns -- including visits from Vanderbilt and Tennessee. I think this will be tight at the half, but Ty Simpson and company will just be too much for LSU's offense to keep up with for four quarters. PICK: Alabama 33-24 over LSU\n            ",

Conte had announced in June that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.Conte founded BALCO, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, in 1984, after a career as a musician, which included time as the bassist for R&B group Tower of Power. BALCO offered supplements as well as blood and urine analysis to athletes. In 2000, Conte began working with several baseball players, including former San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds.A 2003 federal investigation found that BALCO had distributed banned performance-enhancing drugs to major athletes across a variety of sports. Bonds, as well as other superstar athletes such as world champion track and field athlete Marion Jones, world champion boxer Shane Mosley and many others were revealed to have been BALCO clients.  Conte pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute steroids and money laundering in 2005. The plea led to Conte serving four months in prison.  After being released, Conte created Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (SNAC), which worked with boxers on clean performance enhancement. Conte also became a vocal anti-doping advocate. In addition to SNAC, many boxers who worked with Conte pushed for the inclusion of testing by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, with drug testing standards that went well beyond those administered by state athletic commissions.Some of the boxers Conte worked with at SNAC, such as Andre Berto in 2012, failed drug tests during their time as clients, though Conte remained outspoken about the need for athletes to be clean and that any positive tests were not a result of work done by SNAC.\"We are heartbroken by the passing of our fearless leader, SNAC mastermind, CEO, anti-doping advocate, creator of ZMA, former Tower of Power and Herbie Hancock bassist, Victor Conte,\" a SNAC statement said. \"We will honor his wishes. SNAC and his legacy will carry forward, strong and forever. We love you, Conte!\"\n            \n    ",

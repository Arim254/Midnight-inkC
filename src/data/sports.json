Baltimore is coming off a 30-16 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday, while Miami rolled to a 34-10 win at Atlanta. The Ravens (2-5), third in the AFC North, are 0-2 on the road this season.

    "body": "\n        The Wednesday night Conference USA college football takeover continues this week when the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders host the Jacksonville State Gamecocks at 7:30 p.m. ET, and the Missouri State Bears host the Florida International Panthers at 8 p.m. ET, which will air on CBS Sports Network. Middle Tennessee is one of just two schools in the 12-team Conference USA without a conference victory this season, and the Blue Raiders will need to pull off an upset as 4.5-point underdogs to change that. The SportsLine model doesn't like Middle Tennessee's odds of doing that, making Jacksonville State to cover the 4.5-point spread one of its Wednesday college football best bets. Jacksonville State is coming off a bye after defeating Delaware, 38-25, on Oct. 15. The model is backing one underdog, though, picking Florida International as a 3.5-point underdog in its Wednesday college football best bets when online sports betting. Click here to bet on Wednesday's games with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and three months of NBA League Pass free:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

Jacksonville State improved to 3-0 in Conference USA with a 38-25 win over Delaware on October 15, while Middle Tennessee lost to that same Delaware team, 31-28, last week. Jacksonville State has the leading rusher in college football, with Cam Cook rushing for 949 yards and 10 touchdowns this season. He's rushed for more than 115 yards in five of his last six games, and the model expects Cook to break 130 rushing yards on Wednesday.

Kennesaw State is the only 4-0 team in Conference USA this season, while Missouri State is 2-1 in the conference with uninspiring victories. The Bears had a two-point victory over Middle Tennessee, which is winless in the conference, and needed overtime to get past New Mexico State, which is 1-3 in Conference USA. Meanwhile, FIU handed Western Kentucky its only loss in conference play in a 25-6 final this season.

    "body": "\n        Week 9 of the NFL schedule will give the shrinking number of remaining survivor pool players some solid options. Unless the Cincinnati Bengals were your pick, there wasn't a whole lot of carnage in Week 8 as most favorites pulled through. That included the Philadelphia Eagles with a 38-20 win over the New York Giants and the Indianapolis Colts with a 38-14 throttling of the Tennessee Titans. Four teams will be on their bye in Week 9, including Cleveland, the New York Jets, Philadelphia and Tampa Bay. A popular choice this week is the Los Angeles Rams (5-2), who are taking on the 1-7 New Orleans Saints. The Saints have lost three in a row since their 26-14 win over the New York Giants on Oct. 5. The Rams, meanwhile, have won two in a row, including a 35-7 win over Jacksonville on Oct. 19. Los Angeles enters as a 13.5-point favorite in what is one of the largest Week 9 NFL lines, and one of five NFL spreads of at least seven points. Another is the Los Angeles Chargers as 9.5-point favorites over the Tennessee Titans, who have now lost three straight by double digits.

Although Denver leads the AFC West and is riding a five-game winning streak, the Broncos are just 2-2 on the road this season.There are other reasons to fade Denver as well, however. Houston appears to be turning around their fortunes with three wins in their last four games. Quarterback C.J. Stroud played at a high level in the 26-15 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. In that game, he completed 30 of 39 passes (76.9%) for 318 yards and two touchdowns with one interception.Despite opening as a road favorite, the SportsLine's model projects Houston will win this one, making the Broncos a team to stay far away from in NFL survivor pools this week. See which team to pick instead here. You can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets instantly:How to make Week 9 NFL survivor pool picks Instead, the model is confidently backing a team many have not used in survivor pools to win outright in well over 80% of simulations.

    "description": "\nWeek 9 of the 2025 NFL season provides 14 games, headlined by the Kansas City Chiefs visiting the Buffalo Bills in a rematch of last year's AFC Champ",
    "body": "\nWeek 9 of the 2025 NFL season provides 14 games, headlined by the Kansas City Chiefs visiting the Buffalo Bills in a rematch of last year's AFC Championship Game. Should sports fans back the Chiefs or Bills in any of their wagers, or are there other options which offer more value in Week 9?If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 9 NFL games, be sure to see what SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has put together. He's going with two parlays for Week 9, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs.Week 9 NFL money line favorites parlay\nBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a 3-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.According to BetMGM data, NFL moneyline favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-2024, NFL moneyline favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.NFL favorites dominated the opening week, winning 13 of 16 games for an 81.2% success rate. The second Week saw more competitive results, with favorites winning 9 of 16 games for a 56.2% success rate. In Week 3 of the 2025 NFL season, 12 out of 16 favorites won outright, giving betting favorites a 75.0% success rate. In Week 4, favorites struggled on a relative basis, going 10-5-1. Three weeks ago, NFL betting favorites had their worst Week this season, going 8-5. In Week 6, NFL betting chalk bounced back by winning 11 of 15 games. Two Weeks ago, favorites had another excellent performance, going 12-3 after both chalk won on MNF. Favorites excelled in Week 8, achieving a remarkable 11-2 record with an average point differential of over 10 points.NFL betting favorites have won 86 out of 120 games in the first seven weeks of the 2025 season, achieving an overall success rate of 72.5%. This figure has exceeded last year's mark of 71.8%. What does this mean for Week 9? Will there be any upsets, or will the chalk continue to cash?Detroit Lions over Minnesota Vikings\nMinnesota faces a nightmare scenario with quarterback J.J. McCarthy returning from injury but having only two career regular-season starts under his belt. The Vikings' offensive line ranks 31st in sacks allowed per game (4.0) and just lost quarterback Carson Wentz to a season-ending shoulder injury.Detroit's pass rush will feast on Minnesota's 22nd-ranked pass blocking unit, and the Lions rank 31st in fantasy points allowed to opposing defenses—more than any other franchise. With running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery both healthy and the Vikings' defense ranking in the bottom 10 against the run, Detroit has multiple pathways to a dominant victory.The Lions have defeated the Vikings in five straight meetings, scoring at least 30 points in all five games. Detroit's offense performs at another level at home, and I expect another easy victory against a defense they know well. With a win projection of 79%, my model suggests taking the Lions as an easy parlay piece.Los Angeles Chargers over Tennessee Titans\nThe Chargers are riding momentum from a 37-10 demolition of Minnesota on Thursday Night Football, improving to 5-3 while enjoying extra rest before traveling to face the NFL's most dysfunctional franchise. Los Angeles ranks 17th in offensive EPA per play and features quarterback Justin Herbert at peak efficiency with the return of weapons like Ladd McConkey, who averaged 14.7 yards per catch last week. Getting a healthy Joe Alt back adds stability to the offensive line, enabling head coach Jim Harbaugh to implement his preferred game strategy.Tennessee sits at a dismal 1-7 with its only victory coming against the Arizona Cardinals in a wild fourth quarter comeback, and the Titans been outscored by 120 total points this season—a catastrophic point differential. They are 0-3 at home and have lost three consecutive games by double digits, while their defense ranks 28th in defensive EPA per play (0.10). The Chargers' defense has been stingy, allowing just 188 yards per game and creating advantageous field position that the offense has capitalized on. Tennessee lost four defensive starters in its Week 8 loss, creating even more mismatches for Herbert and company to exploit. The road team has a significant coaching advantage. Please suspend betting on the Titans until further notice.Indianapolis Colts over Pittsburgh Steelers\nI was very disappointed with the Steelers' performance against the Packers on Sunday Night Football. Something is definitely wrong with this Steelers team. Conversely, things could not be going any better in Indianapolis. The Colts own the NFL's best record at 7-1 and lead the league in total offensive yards (385.1 per game), establishing themselves as the AFC's top seed in the current playoff picture. Running back Jonathan Taylor has been unstoppable, recording multiple touchdowns in four of the Colts' last five games while the offense ranks third in quick passing and first in short passing efficiency.Pittsburgh enters on a two-game losing streak, with its defense suddenly vulnerable after allowing 68 points on 924 total yards in consecutive defeats. The Steelers rank 25th in defensive EPA per play (0.07), and their secondary ranks 30th and 24th, respectively, in defending quick and short passes—exactly where Indianapolis excels. Although Pittsburgh's run game ranks fourth in rushing DVOA and could challenge Indy's 24th-ranked total defense (which allows 345.1 yards per game), the Colts have excelled at limiting opponent success. The Steelers have many injuries on both sides of the ball. This is an excellent price on the Colts to improve to 8-1.Week 9 NFL money line underdogs parlay\nA popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.New York Giants over San Francisco 49ers\nThe New York Football Giants, at home getting plus-money against a struggling 49ers squad, present enormous value based on defensive matchups and efficiency metrics. New York's defense has been stout in converting yards into points, allowing just 14.9 yards per point—significantly better than San Francisco's offense, which requires 17.7 yards per point.I mentioned a few weeks ago that the Giants will be a team to \"play on\" once they make the switch off of Russell Wilson at quarterback. I have been mostly right. New York's new look offense features rookie dual-threat quarterback Jaxson Dart, who provides enough clock control to keep games close and limit possessions for San Francisco. The 49ers are just 1-1 against the spread as favorites of 2.5 points or greater this season, and computer simulations give them only a 55% win probability—hardly dominant enough to justify -155 moneyline odds.Let's fade the 49ers, who are playing back-to-back road games and their third in four weeks with a squad that's been missing many starters since the beginning of the season.Las Vegas Raiders over Jacksonville Jaguars\nBoth teams are coming off a Week 8 bye, but the Raiders should benefit more significantly from the extra rest. Las Vegas expects tight end Brock Bowers and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers to return from knee injuries. Their returns transform a struggling passing attack that ranks among the NFL's worst in passing yards (1,425 total) and touchdowns (seven).Even more importantly, Maxx Crosby, a star pass rusher, should be healthy. His Week 7 knee injury exit was described as precautionary, with NFL insider Ian Rapoport confirming it's \"not a major knee injury\" and Crosby is \"OK\". The Raiders essentially protected their best defensive player in a blowout loss, giving him two weeks to recover. He should feast on a Jaguars defense ranked 23rd in sacks allowed per game (2.9).The Raiders' defense excels precisely where the Jaguars' offense struggles most. Las Vegas has allowed at least five yards on just 36% of first-down plays this season—the best in the NFL (league average: 43%). Pete Carroll's track record suggests the Raiders will be more prepared. He's only started 2-5 or worse twice before (finishing 7-9 and 7-10 in those seasons). The veteran coach can rally teams during bye weeks for second-half surges.Jacksonville's road struggles are well-documented. The Jaguars are 2-12 in their last 14 road games and 1-1 on the road this season. Their two consecutive losses were against formidable NFC West opponents, and now they face a desperate Raiders team with everything to prove. Additionally, the Jaguars will be playing the Houston Texans in a look-ahead spot next week.Arizona Cardinals over Dallas Cowboys\nArizona represents the perfect buy-low candidate after losing five consecutive games—all by four points or fewer—indicating the Cardinals are significantly better than their 2-5 record suggests. The Cardinals' expected record is 3.5-4.5 wins per advanced metrics, meaning positive regression should arrive in close games.Dallas presents a catastrophic defensive situation, ranking 31st in defensive DVOA and allowing 31.3 points per game. The Cowboys' secondary is decimated by injuries, and six of their last seven games have featured 57+ total points, creating backdoor cover opportunities even when trailing. While Dallas averages 41.3 points per game at home, they rank just 28th in yards per play allowed and 22nd in offensive DVOA against strength of schedule.Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray returns from the bye week with extra preparation time, though he historically struggles in this spot (only one career win off the bye). However, the Cardinals rank 20th in defensive EPA per play, which should provide enough resistance to keep this game competitive in the high-scoring environment Vegas projects (54.5 total). At +130 for a team that's been competitive in every game, the value is clearly with the Cardinals.The Cardinals have a 1-6 SU record in post-bye week games, including 0-2 SU under head coach Jonathan Gannon. Facing the Cowboys' struggling defense and special teams coverage unit could be just what the road team needs to turn things around.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Son Heung-Min joined Los Angeles FC from Tottenham Hotspur during the summer transfer window, expectations were high for what he could deliver on the pitch. It's safe to say that in his short tenure he has exceeded them. With 10 goals and three assists since playing his first match for the black and gold in August, he led the team to the joint-best record in the league alongside Inter Miami. But that's not the only place where Sonny has made an impact.Off the pitch, bringing a South Korean superstar to a city that has the largest Korean population in the United States has also brought a level of representation to fans, energizing a passionate community. Before LAFC even kicked a ball in 2018, a Korean Supporters group, the Tigers Supporters group, formed, but little did they know that things would take off to this level as Son's arrival has kicked soccer into the stratosphere in Los Angeles.\"The first thing that changed is that all the Korean friends and family we were asking to come be part of supporting this club when it first started have finally started coming out,\" Tigers member Sam Ko said about the impact of Son's arrival. \"It's great to see the support that shows up every four years during the World Cup is at BMO whenever Sonny's in town. Koreans are a proud people, L.A. Koreans in particular, and having Sonny here makes us puff our chest out a little further.\"\"What's even more beautiful is the ripple effect,\" Tigers member Daniel \"Deech\" Chung said. \"I love seeing so many new Korean fans fill the stands, waving the Korean flag, it's beautiful. Even my dad, who never really cared about what I was doing with TSG, now acknowledges that LAFC is a team worth mentioning.\"\nAs Los Angeles prepares to host World Cup matches in 2026, this isn't something that's lost on the club either. While they want the club to represent the community, Son isn't the first South Korean to play for the team, as Kim Moon-Hwan holds that distinction, being a member of the club from 2021 to 2022. And identifying with the communities in their city isn't something new to the club either. When LAFC were founded, one of the first things that they did was sign Mexican international Carlos Vela, something that has prepared the club for properly handling the balance of embracing culture while still being authentic about how they do it.LAFC are no strangers to having global stars at the club. Giorgio Chiellini, Gareth Bale, and Oliver Giroud have all donned the Black and Gold, but none have brought the same mania that Son has in such a short time with the club. As co-president Larry Freedman said, Sonny is a perfect fit at the club.\"He fits the culture inside the club. He fits the culture in the community ... and then there's this wonderful connection with the Korean American community, which is just undeniable,\" Freedman said. \"And you know, you don't always have the luxury of getting that authentic fit on all counts. But, you know this, this feels like one of those rare times.\"\nIn the greater makeup of the 3252, LAFC's independent supporters union, there's a full partnership between LAFC's nine recognized supporters groups coming from different walks of life in Los Angeles to come together to cheer on their team as they look to win the MLS Cup for the first time since 2022, and the second time in their young history. If they can make the final, it would be the third time in the past four years that LAFC have been there, which is quite an impressive feat of ensuring that they're successful on the pitch while recognizing the community off of it.Even as their playoff run begins on Wednesday, the Black and Gold will kick off a first of it's kind partnership with HYBE to bring a fan celebration to BMO Stadium that brings a celebration of Korean Culture from K-pop to food and including local vendors as well. It's an embrace of culture that even fans didn't see coming.\"Sure, there is a growing appreciation for K-pop and Korean beauty products, food, etc., but to have this level of exposure on a national scale is incredible! I'm excited to see what comes from this, maybe a NEW JEANS halftime show?!,\" Deech said.\nIn a way, all of this is also preparation for the World Cup, where cultures from around the world will be on display. What LAFC is doing to highlight what makes them special is something that American soccer will be doing on a larger scale in the summer of 2026, and it should be taken notice of.\"We're now in our eighth season playing, and we've been, you know, we've been doing this for eight years. And this is convincing people who say things like, 'I don't like sports, I don't do sports,' or 'I don't understand soccer. I don't like soccer; offsides is an impossible thing to understand,' whatever the reason, and we like to say to people, come one time, just come one time. Experience, the 3252 experience, the brand of football we play, and how exciting that is, and the energy in the stadium when we play, \" Freedman said. \"And you know, you let us know if it was worth your time. And invariably, those first timers, sometimes it's before half time, but certainly before they're leaving at the end, they're already talking about wanting to come back.\"With more stars coming to MLS by the season, especially after the arrival of Lionel Messi in 2023, the league is in a great position to use the World Cup as a platform to reach new heights, so its important at the club level that things are moving in the right direction. Ko put it best, because while it's important to win with the players on the pitch, it's about how soccer can bring people together and create a community. \n\"I'm interested to see how the K-pop world and soccer world collide. K-pop fandom is a phenomenon, and it surprises me all the time,\" Ko said. \"I hope that some of that energy can be brought to LAFC and stays even when Sonny decides to hang it up, because players will always come and go, but the community is forever.\"\n            ",

Flacco suffered an AC joint sprain in his throwing shoulder, and his status for the Week 9 showdown against Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears is in doubt, per NFL Media. If Flacco cannot go, Jake Browning would likely return to the starting lineup. The Bengals also have Sean Clifford on their practice squad.The Bengals are coming off a tough, 39-38 loss to the New York Jets, in which they blew a 15-point fourth-quarter lead. The Cincinnati defense allowed one of the worst offenses in the NFL to rack up a total of 502 yards of total offense, and score 23 points in the final quarter.

Game 5 of the 2025 MLB World Series is on Wednesday, with Dodgers vs. Blue Jays slated for an 8 p.m. ET start. In the NBA, there are 10 games on the schedule, including Pistons vs. Magic at 7 p.m. ET and Jazz vs. Trail Blazers at 9 p.m. ET.Picks from all three of those games are among our MLB and NBA best bets at BetMGM Sportsbook today from the SportsLine Projection Model and our team of experts.

It enters the 2025 World Series a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. Anybody following its MLB betting or NBA betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Wednesday's best bets at BetMGMOver 8 runs in Dodgers vs. Blue Jays (-110) Pistons +1.5 vs. Magic (-110)Trail Blazers -3.5 vs. Jazz (-105)Combining these three picks into a Wedneday MLB and NBA parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +611 (risk $100 to win $611). Bet it at BetMGM here:\nOver 8 runs in Dodgers vs. Blue Jays (-110)\"The Blue Jays are not blinking in this World Series as the normal Dodger intimidation games don't seem to be working. Toronto could easily have won these last two games at Chavez Ravine as the Jays have blocked out he Dodger Stadium factor, and LA can't be quite as comfy with Blake Snell on the mound after he was roughed up in Game One,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, John Schneider is confident he can get five or so innings from Trey Yesevage, though the Blue Jays bullpen is again going to be asked to do some heavy lifting. Three of the four games already in this series have reached at least eight runs.\" Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Pistons +1.5 vs. Magic (-110)After a 30-win improvement last season, the Pistons have their sights set on contending in the East. Meanwhile, the Magic had a similarly transcendent 47-win season two years ago, but followed it up with a disappointing 41-win campaign last year. Both teams have underwhelmed a little bit early, with Detroit off to a 2-2 start and Orlando sitting at 1-3. However, the Pistons did win and cover as 2-point favorites at home in January and the model predicts that they cover in 59% of simulations on Wednesday. Back the Pistons at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Trail Blazers -3.5 vs. Jazz (-105)\"We're still figuring out how Phoenix was able to force OT at Utah on Monday. In the end all was well as the Jazz recovered for a 138-134 win helped greatly by 51 points from F Lauri Markkanen, who's had a blazing start to the season as Utah tries to build a fortress out of the Delta Center. Yet we've also been impressed by the Blazers, who don't look like they're missing suspended HC Chauncey Billups one bit,\" Marshall said. \"Portland getting All-Star like production from F Deni Avdija (23.5 ppg), while Jerami Grant (22.5 ppg) looks like Sixth Man of the Year candidate, and vet G Jrue Holiday (17.8 ppg) proving he's still got some petrol in his tank.\" Back the Trail Blazers at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks for this week?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

It was a matchup of two of the biggest stars in the welterweight division, with Mayweather claiming the WBC, WBA, WBO and Ring Magazine world welterweight titles with the victory in May 2015. The two never had a rematch, but that could change with both fighters now well into their 40s. Pacquiao confirmed negotiations with Mayweather were ongoing at a press conference in the Philippines on Wednesday, but noted he's in discussions with a number of fighters and isn't sure which bout will get made. \"Right now we have a lot of negotiations about my next fight; there's a possible rematch with Floyd Mayweather,\" Pacquiao said. \"There's a lot of ongoing negotiations right now, so it's hard to plan what fight I'm going to post. I'm waiting for the final negotiation.\"\nPacquiao, who dealt with a shoulder injury in the first fight, fought seven more times times before retiring in 2021, going 5-2. He recently came out of retirement at 46 years old against WBC welterweight champ Mario Barrios and fell just short of reclaiming the title in a majority draw earlier this year. Mayweather, meanwhile, only fought two more times as a pro after beating Pacquiao. He retired after his 50th career victory against Conor McGregor in 2017. Mayweather, now 48 years old, has since fought in a handful of exhibition bouts, but has not been in a real bout in nearly a decade. \nHow interested fans will be in a rematch of two fighters nearing 50 years old remains to be seen. The original fight in 2015 featured both past their primes and came after years of the two dancing around each other. It also produced the highest grossing gate of all time.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Three rookie running backs who have been Fantasy football start/sit decisions all year made huge impacts on Sunday. RJ Harvey scored three touchdowns, Woody Marks went over 100 scrimmage yards and TreVeyon Henderson had a career-high of 75 total yards. Their Week 9 Fantasy football rankings likely received a boost, compared to the week prior, but does that warrant any of them a spot in Week 9 Fantasy football lineups ahead of more established veterans like Alvin Kamara or Jaylen Warren?Speaking of rookie ball carriers, Cam Skattebo is no longer an option as a Fantasy football pick after dislocating his ankle. Tyrone Tracy Jr. is seemingly the next man up in New York, but what do the Week 9 Fantasy football projections forecast for veteran Devin Singletary? Before making your Week 9 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 9 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 9 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 9 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 9: The model is fading Bengals receiver Tee Higgins, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has touchdowns in three of his last four games. However, Higgins hasn't been quite as productive, as a whole, as he's been in previous years. He's averaging career lows in both yards per game (45) and receptions per game (3.1), thus making his reliance on touchdowns a risky proposition for his Fantasy owners.Higgins' touchdown reception in his last game was his lone catch of the game and now has to face a Chicago defense, whose strength is versus the pass. The Bears are allowing just 9.4 receptions per game to opposing wide receivers, which is the second-fewest in the league. Chicago hasn't allowed a single wideout to reach 100 yards since Week 2, and only one receiver has more than five catches over that span. Sitting outside the top 25 in Week 9 Fantasy football WR rankings, Higgins may not warrant a spot in Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The fifth-round rookie has made a name for himself over the last three weeks and ranks second amongst tight ends in Fantasy points over this stretch. He had a 5-77-1 stat line last Thursday, which followed seven receptions for 164 yards and a score in his previous outing. Gadsden has started just two games this year but still has as many redzone receptions (four) as Chargers wideouts Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.He now gets a dream matchup versus the Titans, who rank 29th in points allowed and 26th in yards allowed. Tennessee has given up at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown to tight ends in each of the last three weeks. Gadsden wasn't on the Fantasy radar a few weeks ago but now finds himself among the top five in positional rankings for this week, making him a must-start for Week 9 Fantasy football lineups.

    "body": "\n        Don't cheat: which two NFL teams currently have the longest active winning streaks headed into Week 9? Hint: both are led by second-year quarterbacks who both wear the number 10. Answer: the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, who are both 6-2 and atop their respective divisions. During New England's winning streak, they've held all five opponents to 20 points or less while averaging nearly 31 points per game.For the Broncos, it's been a different story having trailed at some point during all five wins. This week, the Patriots are 6.5-point favorites against the Falcons, while the Broncos are 1.5-point underdogs at Houston in a game where the over/under is just 39.5.

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point. While Indy is still a playoff team, I will be fading them as a road favorite in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Steelers 26, Colts 24\". See his other Week 9 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 9 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 9 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

    "body": "\n        The top two seeds from last year's Eastern Conference will meet on Wednesday's NBA schedule as the Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Boston Celtics. Cleveland (3-1) had the East's best record at 64-18 a year ago before bowing out in the second round of the playoffs. Boston (1-3) was the No. 2 seed and was also eliminated in the second round of the postseason. These teams have alternated wins and losses over their last six regular-season meetings, with the Cavs prevailing in the most recent matchup..Tipoff is at 7 p.m. ET from TD Garden in Boston, where the Celtics are 0-1 at this season. Cleveland is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cavaliers vs. Celtics odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 233.5.

Donovan Mitchell led the way with 35 points on just 18 field goal attempts as all five starters were in double digits. Reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Evan Mobley, had 15 points, 11 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 blocks, while fellow big man, Jarrett Allen, had 20 points.The Cavs had the league's No. 1 offensive rating a year ago, while this season the team ranks in the top seven on the other end of the court in both defensive rating and points allowed per game. The Cavaliers are jumping in passing lanes, ranking third in steals, and they've forced opponents into the second-most turnovers per game. Losing possessions to turnovers could be an issue for Boston as it struggles to score in the possessions it does have, as the Celtics rank 25th in 3-point percentage despite ranking second in 3-point attempts. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Celtics can coverLast season Boston was second in points allowed per game, and even with various departures and injuries, the team still ranks second in points allowed this year. The team is holding opponents to an NBA-low of 39.9% from the field, and it is also in the top five in terms of 3-point defense. In their first win of the year on Monday versus New Orleans, the Celtics kept the Pelicans to just 90 points after the team had scored at least 116 in each of its first two games.Boston had a well-balanced attack in that win over New Orleans, with the starters combining for 65 points and the reserves chipping in with 57 points. Anfernee Simons had 25 points off the bench, while Jaylen Brown (probable, hamstring) is embracing the role of being the team's go-to player. He's putting up 26 points per game on 50% shooting from the field and 48% from beyond the arc. Even though Boston remains without Jayson Tatum (Achilles), the Cavs are even more banged-up without Darius Garland (toe), Max Strus (foot) and Sam Merrill (hip). See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Cavaliers vs. Celtics picksSportsLine's model has simulated Celtics vs. Cavaliers and is leaning Under the total, projecting 229 combined points.

    "body": "\n        AFC squads coming off much-needed victories will kick off NFL Week 9 when the Miami Dolphins host the Baltimore Ravens on 'Thursday Night Football.' Baltimore (2-5) ended a four-game skid with a 30-16 win over Chicago on Sunday, while Miami (2-6) had lost three in a row before beating Atlanta, 34-10, in Week 8. Both teams currently sit in third place in their respective divisions, and the Ravens are 9-3 versus the Dolphins over their last 12 meetings. Lamar Jackson (hamstring) is expected to play after being sidelined since Week 4. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. Baltimore prevailed, 56-19, when the teams last met in 2023. The latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds have Baltimore as 7.5-point road favorites. The over/under for total points is 50.5.

The team played turnover-free ball, rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, and the defense allowed a season-low of 16 points. Baltimore kept Chicago out of the endzone through the air, marking the first time the Ravens have held an opponent without a passing touchdown in 2025, and the 96 rushing yards allowed by the Ravens were the second-fewest they've given up all year.Even with Jackson missing over half of the offensive snaps this year, Baltimore still ranks second in yards per rush (5.3). Derrick Henry moved into sole possession of fifth place on the all-time rushing touchdowns list versus Chicago, passing Bears legend Walter Payton, and he should find similar success versus Miami's defense, which allows the fourth-most yards per carry. The Dolphins passing defense is even more exploitable, as it's given up the highest completion percentage, has the fewest interceptions and has allowed the second-highest passer rating. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Dolphins can coverDespite being 2-4 straight up over their last six games, the Dolphins are 4-2 versus the spread during this span. They're coming off their best performance on both sides of the ball, scoring a season-high of 34 points and allowing a season-low of 10 points in a win over Atlanta. The team still has playmakers even without Tyreek Hill, as De'Von Achane has at least 91 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in nine straight games, while Jaylen Waddle has at least 95 receiving yards in three of his last four.Those playmakers can take advantage of a Baltimore defense which hasn't played up to the franchise's standards. The Ravens rank in the bottom five in points allowed, yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. Only one team has allowed more rushing scores than Baltimore, and opponents have scored in an NFL-high of 52.7% of possessions versus it. Tua Tagovailoa should have all day to pick apart Baltimore's secondary as the Ravens have the second-fewest sacks on the year. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Ravens vs. Dolphins picksFor the NFL Week 9 'Thursday Night Football' game of Dolphins vs. Ravens, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 61 total points.

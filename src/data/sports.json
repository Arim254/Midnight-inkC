    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James returned to a familiar place on Wednesday when his team faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 41-year-old, of course, is an Akron, Ohio, native and began his NBA career with the Cavaliers when the franchise drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft.With James playing his 23rd NBA season -- and the Lakers having only one scheduled trip to Cleveland this year -- the franchise gave him a proper welcome home tribute. Midway through the first quarter, the Cavaliers showed highlights of James scoring 25 consecutive points against the Detroit Pistons in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals. That series was ultimately won by the Cavs, helping the franchise secure a ticket to the NBA Finals.During the video tribute, James appeared to tear up. After the video played and before James returned to the court, he was shown wiping his eyes with a towel.\nAfter the game, a 129-99 loss, James said he was \"more present\" for this particular tribute than his past appearances as a visitor in Cleveland. \n\"I think it comes from just being present. I was more present today than the previous seven,\" James said. \"Definitely got to me a little bit. For sure. I was super thankful.\"\nWith the game out of hand in the second half, Bronny James -- LeBron's son and a deep reserve for the Lakers -- got some rare playing time down the stretch. He made the most of it in eight minutes, scoring eight points on a fastbreak dunk and a pair of 3-pointers. The elder James was appreciative of the moment and made note of the reception Bronny received from the Cleveland fans.\"It's a homecoming for him. Just to see him get that dunk, hit a couple shots, get the ovation from the fans -- pretty cool moment for him, for us as a family, for my wife and his siblings,\" James said. \"My mom is here watching her son and her grandson. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal. My mom gets to watch her son and her grandson play in the NBA at the same time.\"\nJames spent 11 seasons with the Cavaliers across two stints with the franchise. James helped Cleveland win the 2016 NBA Finals over the Golden State Warriors after battling back from a 3-1 deficit. James left Cleveland as a free agent in 2018 to join the Lakers.With James' retirement timeline unclear, this could mark his final time playing in Cleveland if he steps away after the 2025-26 season. However, ESPN reported in November that James is unsure if this will be his last season or if he will play at least one more.\nJames is averaging 22.4 points, 6.7 assists and 6.0 rebounds in 33.4 minutes per game. James has appeared in 28 games this season after missing the first month due to sciatica.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What a day, what a day. A topsy-turvy Champions League league phase wrapped up in epic fashion, as 61 goals were scored, teams went back and forth to push for winners, and we even got a goal from a goalkeeper. Matchday 8 had something for everyone, and while we'll mourn the loss of the Americans who won't be making it to the knockouts as well as Antonio Conte's Napoli and Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille, this was an ending for the ages, so let's take a look at some winners and losers from the final day of the league phase:Winner: Jose MourinhoFrom being confronted by Benfica supporters during the weekend because of them not being happy with the team's results lately, to taking down Real Madrid to push for an unlikely knockout stage berth. When Mourinho took over Benfica, they had already dropped two matches in the league phase, and it would take two more Champions League matches for Benfica to pick up their first points. They won three of their last four matches, but even then, it took a stoppage-time goal from keeper Anatoliy Trubin to make it happen. Not only is he the fifth keeper to score a goal in UCL play, but Mourinho didn't even realize that it was needed after going ahead 3-2 when chaos was ensuing. \"When I made the last changes, [Franjo] Ivanovic and Antonio Silva, I was told [that] is enough, so let's close the door. When I made the changes a few seconds later, they tell me we need one more goal, but I cannot make more changes, so that was the lucky point to get a free kick that allows us to go there with the big guy,\" Jose Mourinho said after the game. What a night under the lights in Europe.\"It's a wild moment in a game that had a bit of everything, and while it was a poor loss for Real Madrid, Champions League play always needs more Mourinho, and that's just what we're getting. \nLosers: NapoliWhile on one hand, you'd like to put Conte here, the Italian manager has been excellent at making it out of chaos unscathed. I mean, the man went from floundering at Tottenham to winning a Scudetto at Napoli. But they were unable to get the win they needed over Chelsea to move to the knockout stage. It has been the story of Napoli's season where they're so close to competing while also being so far from where they need to be. Some of this can be chalked up to not having a healthy Romelu Lukaku, who Conte was able to get a lot out of last season, but they're now nine points off Inter's pace for the Scudetto. It's hard to win a league title bin back to back campaigns, but a loss could see Napoli slip all the way to sixth behind Como. They are in the Coppa Italia for a chance at silverware this season but even that won't be enough to call the campaign a success. Watch out for the next poor result that Napoli have, because that could be when we get the biennial event of Conte walking away from a club.Winner: The league phase format\"This is unbelievable. Wow. We might never get another moment like this,\" CBS Sports Golazo analyst Jamie Carragher said after the matches wrapped with Benfica's crazy goal. And he's right.Genuinely, I can't count the number of changes that happened with teams shuffling during the final stages of the day. Three new teams, Bodo/Glimt, Club Brugge, and Benfica, all got into the top 24 on the final day of play, and half of the teams in the top eight also shifted. The new Champions League format has not only meant that there's drama for the final day, but it has also given the smaller sides around the world better chances to make it to the knockouts, which can lead to tremendous amounts of money to help these clubs come back and do it all again. Take Bodo/Glimt for example, last season they made a European knockout for the first time ever in Europa Leauge and now here they are taking out Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in Champions League play to one up themselves. While there are valid questions of whether the richest clubs are getting too far ahead of the pack -- and we'll get to those -- it's clear that this tournament does mean something to the bigger teams in smaller leagues. And with teams in some of the larger leagues around the world faltering, this could mean something for the UEFA club coefficients that determine how many clubs get into each European competition and who gets automatic qualification without needing to go through the playoffs. More of this, please.\nLosers: The Champions League contingent of the AmericansEight Americans made appearances in the league phase of the Champions League: Sergino Dest, Malik Tillman, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso, Ricardo Pepi, and Marvin Dills. But only four remain in the knockouts, with none gaining automatic berths to the round of 16. Tillman's Bayer Leverkusen, Cardoso's Atletico Madrid, McKennie's Juventus, and Balogun's Monaco will all keep moving on. 18-year-old Dills just made his Champions League debut for Eintracht Frankfurt on the final day of action against Tottenham; the others were heavily involved for their teams. While it's not their fault that they got knocked out, it is unfortunate that the contingent is halved in one day when it seemed like all of them could survive into the next round. Given how the bracket looks for the knockout phase, this is a number that could drop drastically as well.Winner: The Premier LeagueSix Premier League teams entered the Champions League, and five occupy the top eight of the league phase table, while the sixth finished 12th after a draw against the reigning champs in Paris Saint-Germain. Tottenham can't buy a win in the Premier League, but they navigated the league phase with ease after a season where they won the Europa League while finishing in 17th place. Newcastle United winger Anthony Gordon talked a bit about it while this may be the case in his pre-match availability ahead of facing PSG. \"I think in the Champions League, teams are much more open. They all try to play; it's less transitional. I think in the Premier League it's become more physical than I've ever known it to be,\" Gordon said. \"It's like a basketball game, sometimes it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's just a running game, and it's about duels. Who wins the duels wins the game or moments.\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game. It's a bit more football-based, where teams come and try to play proper football. I think in the Premier League, to see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces It's become a lot slower and set-piece based, I would say.\"It offers an interesting lens into play, and when you see players like Xavi Simons who have struggled in the Premier League but are doing well in Champions League play, Gordon's words have some merit. Of course, it's one of the best English teams at attacking and defending set plays, who sit atop the pile at this stage in Arsenal, but even they were able to mix it up to keep the squad fresh while competing on all fronts. English teams have won three of the last 10 Champions League finals, which is second to Real Madrid, carrying the LaLiga flag with five, while Germany and France have netted one a piece so maybe there is a shift in power in the water.Losers: Real Madrid Out of the Copa Del Rey and also out of the top eight of the Champions League, the Alvaro Arbeloa era isn't getting off to the greatest start for Real Madrid. He also won't have Raul Asencio and Rodrygo available for the first leg of the knockout phase after receiving red cards in stoppage time of their loss to Benfica. But not only did Real Madrid get knocked out, but they were dominated from start to finish, allowing 22 shots and an xG of 2.99 while holding 66% of the possession during the match. Sure, Los Blancos may need the extra games to get their defense into gear, but they could either face Benfica again in a two legged tie or a Bodo/Glimt side that just took it to Atletico Madrid and Manchester City and beat them. These are the kinds of runs that can lead to a third manager in a season, since getting knocked out before the round of 16 would be an unacceptable result for Real Madrid.  \n            ",

Kelvin Sampson prides himself on having strong defensive teams, so you can bet practices weren't fun for the Houston players the last few days. Texas Tech actually matches up well with the Cougars. TCU does not. Houston should eat the Horned Frogs alive on the offensive glass, while its ball pressure defense causes havoc against a TCU squad that can be sloppy with the basketball. The Cougars are 6-2 away from home this season and I expect them to bounce back with an emphatic win on Tuesday.\" Back Houston at bet365 here:\nUnder 229 in Heat vs. Magic (-110)Miami is in a good position to put up a strong defensive performance on Wednesday night, as it has not played since Sunday. The Heat held the Suns to just 102 points in that game, which flew Under the total of 226. These teams played in early December, combining for just 211 points in a game that had a total of 241.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The NFL world was shocked when news broke on Tuesday that former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick did not receive the required vote to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first attempt. CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones confirmed the news that the current North Carolina football coach did not receive the 40 out of 50 votes needed to reach the Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot.This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he had not coached in the NFL since 2023.Belichick, who won eight total Super Bowls (two as an assistant with the Giants, six as a head coach with the Patriots), is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins. That number only trails two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula, who has 347 career wins.\n        \n            \n                Legendary former Patriots coach Bill Belichick falls short of Pro Football Hall of Fame on first ballot\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was among the names who spoke out after the repot. Mahomes posted on social that the decision was \"insane\" and that he doesn't understand \"how this could be possible.\" Notably, Mahomes and the Chiefs faced the Patriots in the 2019 AFC Championship Game. New England went on to win that game in overtime, paving the way for Belichick to win his sixth title as a head coach weeks later.\nEven NBA superstar LeBron James was confused by the report, saying that it was \"disrespectful.\"\nLawrence Taylor, whom Belichick has called the greatest defensive player in NFL history, called his former coach's exclusion from the Hall of Fame \"total bulls---.\" Taylor and Belichick won two Super Bowls together during their time with the New York Giants. \nFormer NFL defensive back Darius Butler, who played for Belichick during the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, also spoke out, citing that if he isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, then \"who is?\"\nFormer NFL star JJ Watt, who will be a future Hall of Famer one day, said there shouldn't be a \"single world\" that Belichick is not a \"First-Ballot Hall of Famer.\"\nFormer NFL defensive back Ryan Clark posted on social media that if Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, \"no coach should be.\"\nFormer NFL defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said the voters need to be made public after the former Patriots coach did not receive 40 of the 50 votes needed.\nFormer NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III said that Belichick \"earned\" the right to be a first ballot Hall of Famer. \nOne of the members of the Hall's voting committee is former NFL general manager Bill Polian. A voter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ESPN that Polian told some voters he believed Belichick should \"wait a year\" before induction because of Spygate. The 2007 cheating scandal cost the Patriots a first-round pick and Belichick was fined $250,000. Former NFL star Terrell Owens appeared to react to the report on social media shortly after.\nFormer NFL star wide receiver Dez Bryant said he was \"lost for words.\"\nNew Orleans Saints star Cameron Jordan posted on social media that he is normally surprised when people get in the Hall of Fame, not the other way around.\nMore former Patriots players, including Julian Edelman and Jason McCourty, also reacted to the stunning news.\n            ",

The UFC bantamweight champion recently underwent back surgery as he prepares to embark on his second reign as champion.The bantamweight division is heating up in the aftermath of UFC 324. Top contenders Sean O'Malley and Umar Nurmagomedov got their hands raised, while former champion Merab Dvalishvili has angled for an immediate rematch. The division cannot move forward without its king. On Tuesday, Yan posted a video update on his Instagram story.\"Don't lose me. I'm in rehab for a few months,\" Yan said in the video, UFC's Russian interpreter Sergey Nargorny told CBS Sports.\nYan's post included a series of written messages further detailing his condition. Yan underwent lumbar surgery on Monday, requiring nine hours under anesthesia. He confirmed that his condition will improve in \"a few months.\" Most lumbar surgeries require at least four to six weeks of recovery before resuming light activities, according to various health authority websites. Yan reclaimed the bantamweight throne after upsetting Dvalishvili at UFC 323 in December. Dvalishvili had ascended to being the greatest bantamweight of all-time. Yan was largely labeled a live body for his opponent. Dvalishvili was on the cusp of becoming the first fighter to make four successful UFC title defenses in one year. The overlooked contender outclassed Dvalishvili in virtually every aspect of MMA, winning a clear unanimous decision nearly five years after losing the title.\nThe reigning champ has three worthwhile challengers awaiting him. An immediate trilogy fight with Dvalishvili is on the table, especially considering Dvalishvili's sustained dominance before losing the title. O'Malley has a controversial win over Petr Yan and kept his chances alive by beating Song Yadong at UFC 324. On that same card, Nurmagomedov coasted by former two-time flyweight titleholder Deiveson Figueiredo. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Pro Football Hall of Fame has issued a statement amid the backlash of Bill Belichick's reported omission from the 2026 induction class.Belichick, a winner of eight Super Bowls, including six during his time as head coach of the New England Patriots, fell short of the 40 votes needed from the 50-person selection committee to be inducted in his first year of eligibility. A coach finalist, Belichick was competing for votes with Patriots owner Robert Kraft (the lone contributor finalist) and senior finalists Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood. Voters could cast votes for three of the five finalists, and Belichick's snub has become a major source of controversy.Along with reinforcing the importance of the voting process, the Hall stressed that \"action will be taken\" if one or multiple voters committed a violation of the selection process.The Pro Football Hall of Fame understands and respects the passionate reaction of many fans, media members and enshrinees of the Hall itself in light of published reports regarding the voting results for the Class of 2026.It's that very passion that propels the game.The Hall also respects the members of the Selection Committee when they follow the selection process bylaws. It is an honor to serve as a selector.Each year, the Hall reviews the selection process and the composition of the 50-person Selection Committee. If it is determined that any member(s) violated the selection process bylaws, they understand action will be taken.That could include the possibility that such selector(s) would not remain a member of the committee moving forward.The selection of a new class is the most important duty the Hall of Fame oversees each year, and the integrity of that process cannot be in question.The Hall did not mention Belichick by name or identify which selection process bylaws may have been broken. One violation, for example, would be making a decision on a candidate based on non-football reasons. That does not, however, include Spygate, the Patriots' sign-stealing scandal that resulted in both Belichick and the Patriots receiving unprecedented fines by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in 2007. So while Spygate is considered a valid reason to not give Belichick a vote, not giving him one because of a personal vendetta would be considered a violation of the bylaws. Spygate has been pointed to as a potential reason Belichick did not earn enshrinement in his first year of eligibility. Bill Polian, a Hall of Fame general manager and member of the selection committee, reportedly told others that he believed that Belichick should \"wait a year\" before getting inducted as penance for Spygate. Polian has denied doing this. \"That's totally and categorically untrue,\" he said. \"I voted for him.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Tom Brady, Robert Kraft denounce Bill Belichick's first-ballot Hall of Fame snub: 'I don't understand it'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelichick's omission from this year's Hall of Fame class has triggered a slew of emotional responses from notable figures in both the NFL and in other sports, including one from his former quarterback, Tom Brady. \"I don't understand it,\" Brady said. \"I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Which is completely ridiculous, because people deserve it. He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm taking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"Kraft also spoke out in defense of Belichick. \"Whatever perceptions may exist about any personal differences between Bill and me, I strongly believe Bill Belichick's record and body of work speak for themselves,\" Kraft told the Associated Press. \"As head coach of the New England Patriots for more than two decades, he set the standard for on-field excellence, preparation, and sustained success in the free agency and salary cap era of the National Football League. He is the greatest coach of all time and he unequivocally deserves to be a unanimous first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer.\"\nBelichick, 73, set a head coaching record with six Super Bowl wins and added two more as an assistant, leads all coaches with 12 Super Bowl appearances, ranks second all time with 333 career wins and holds more playoff victories (31) than any coach in league history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wing players often live in the fantasy gray area — not quite stars, not quite streamers — yet many quietly deliver across multiple categories night after night. While the spotlight usually shines on high-usage guards and dominant bigs, dependable wings can be the glue that holds a roster together, providing scoring, defensive stats, and efficient minutes without much fanfare. In this article, we highlight 10 wings who are getting the job done without the hype, whether through expanded roles, career-best efficiency, or steady two-way production. If you're searching for undervalued contributors who can stabilize your fantasy lineup, these names deserve a closer look.Saddiq Bey, PelicansAfter being sidelined through the entirety of last season, Bey has been a welcome addition to the Pelicans' lineup, working his way into a starting role after the first couple of weeks of action. He is averaging 15.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and a career-high one steal per game. He also reached the 20-point mark 13 times, including a season high of 36 points, and he has six double-doubles with points and rebounds. Although his 44.5 percent shooting from the field represents a career high, there remains room for improvement in that department. Jaden McDaniels, TimberwolvesMcDaniels has been a steady factor in a solid start to the season for the Timberwolves, averaging career highs of 14.8 points, 2.9 assists, and one block, to go with 4.5 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. He is also shooting an impressive 50.8 percent from the field, including 42.3 percent from deep. He has topped the 20-point mark on 10 occasions, including a season high of 30. His ability to shine on both ends of the court makes him an ideal fit in just about any lineup, and he should continue to prosper by filling in the gaps among a highly talented starting five. Kelly Oubre Jr., 76ersOubre is averaging 17.2 points, 3.7 rebounds, two assists, and 1.5 steals over six straight starts, having played in 12 games since returning from a nearly seven-week absence. His presence on the wing is a major boost for his squad, as he brings agile defending and is delivering a career-best 49.4 percent shooting on the offensive end. He poses a notable threat from long range, where he is converting a career-best 36.8 percent. He also does well to ensure that he continues to earn big minutes by bringing intensity and energy to the floor, helping win 50/50 plays and driving momentum. \nBrice Sensabaugh, JazzAfter an eight-game stint as a starter, Sensabaugh has been back in a bench role for the last couple of weeks, averaging 20 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists over that stretch, including a season-high 43-point effort on January 14. He is averaging a career-high 11.8 points in 21 minutes per game on the season, as he did not see as much action through the first month of play.  At 22-years-old in his third season, he is showing that he can step in as a well-rounded and fearsome threat from the wing. Ideally, he will continue to see a good amount of playing time to expand on his game, as the Jazz potentially look to slow down the usage of their other top players going into the second half of the season. Jake LaRavia, LakersPlaying alongside LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and Austin Reaves, it is no surprise that LaRavia's contributions may fly under the radar. However, the fourth-year forward provides a well-rounded and reliable effort in his role, averaging 9.5 points and two assists, along with career highs of 4.3 rebounds and 1.4 steals in a career-high 27.4 minutes per game. He is also shooting 46.4 percent from the field, including 34.8 percent from deep, and he has topped the 20-point mark on four occasions. Although he is currently limited to a bench role, he continues to show that he is on the rise as a formidable talent. Naji Marshall, MavericksMarshall is on a roll, averaging 20 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.4 steals over 10 consecutive starts and has helped a significantly shorthanded Mavs squad scrap their way to 19 wins, good enough for 11th place in the West. He is averaging career highs of 14.7 points on 54.5 percent shooting in 29.2 minutes per game, and he has racked up at least five assists on eight occasions. Marshall is certainly making the most of the opportunity to prove that he is capable of producing very competitive numbers across the board and, as a result, will likely continue to build his profile as an upper-tier two-way contributor. \nPeyton Watson, NuggetsWhile his team has been decimated by injury trouble, Watson has taken the opportunity to show off a new level to his game, as he is averaging 1.2 blocks, along with career highs of 14.4 points, five rebounds, 1.9 assists, and one steal in 30.1 minutes per game. He is also shooting 49.9 percent from the field, including a blistering 41.1 percent from deep, and has reached the 20-point mark in 13 outings, with a season high of 35. He had done a solid job in his limited role through past seasons, but his recent breakout will likely result in a permanent boost to his profile, as well as a continued increase in responsibility. RJ Barrett, RaptorsBarrett's contribution may be easily overshadowed by teammates Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram, but his skillset remains critical in his team's success, as evidenced by some of their struggles when he was sidelined for most of December. He is averaging 19 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 0.8 steals per game and has reached the 20-point mark 12 times in 25 appearances. He does a great job of helping balance the floor and facilitate a healthy offense by acting as a long-range threat and player who can create off the dribble. However, he does not stand out as a notable defensive stopper. Julian Champagnie, SpursChampagnie has done an incredible job carving out a role for himself amidst a Spurs roster with plenty of competition for playing time at the wing positions. His 3-point shooting has been the driver of his success, as he averaged 2.2 made 3s last season and has upped that to 2.5 made 3s on 37.4 percent shooting from deep this season. He is averaging career highs of 11.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 0.9 steals in 28.7 minutes per game and should continue to stand as a go-to rotation piece for his up-and-coming squad. \nDillon Brooks, SunsBrooks is having perhaps the best year of his career since joining the Suns, as he is averaging a career-high 20.5 points per game on 44 percent shooting, including 34.6 percent from deep. His energy and intensity on the court are major components in the value he brings to his team, as it is clear that he lifts the competitive level of those around him. He averages 1.1 steals per game and often takes on the toughest defensive matchups, making his overall impact invaluable, ensuring that he continues to earn top-tier playing time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Princeton has been quietly taking care of business and climbing up the rankings, so it's about time to ask how far this team can really go. The Tigers are currently riding a 15-game winning streak, which is the third-longest active streak in women's basketball. This has helped Princeton move up to No. 19 in the AP Top 25, the Tigers' best ranking since being No. 13 in 2015.\"Our goals have remained our goals,\" coach Carla Berube told CBS Sports. \"And that's to be Ivy League champs, regular season and to be in the NCAA tournament and get some great games, hopefully. We've been successful in the past. The last couple of years we've lost in the first round and we are looking forward to more.\"It's still only January, but this week CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel has Princeton as a No. 6 seed, and the team was projected to be a No. 5 seed just last week. No Ivy League team has ever made it past the second round of the women's tournament, but could this be the year? Let's take a closer look at why Princeton has been gaining recognition.BackgroundPrinceton has reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament three times: 2015, 2022 and 2023. In 2015, the Tigers entered the Big Dance with a perfect 31-0 record but ultimately fell 85-70 to Maryland.\nLast year, three Ivy League teams made it into the NCAA tournament for the first time in league history, but only Columbia managed to win a game, a 63-60 victory over Washington in the First Four. None of the teams made it past the first round. The Tigers suffered a 68-65 loss to Iowa State in the First Four, but that close loss showed the potential of this program.This season tipped off with a win against Georgia Tech, a team that managed to upset Notre Dame in early January. Princeton's schedule hasn't had too many ranked teams, but the Tigers' only loss so far came at the hands of then-No. 9 Maryland on Nov. 16. The final score was 84-68, but the Tigers had a particularly impressive showing in the second quarter when they outscored the Terrapins 20-8, forced eight turnovers and made Maryland pay in transition. It was still a loss, but it was early in the season and that kind of experience could help the team later on.Madison St. Rose's comebackThe current roster has all five starters averaging double figures, which instantly makes it harder for opponents to know who the defense needs to focus on. The team is led by senior Madison St. Rose's 16.5 points per game. The 2023 Ivy League Rookie of the Year only played four games last season before tearing her ACL, but her return gives the team some invaluable leadership on the court and also in the locker room with her work ethic.\nThe Ivy League doesn't have official summer workouts, but St. Rose worked hard to make a comeback and spent every day of the offseason with the team trainer and conditioning coach. \"It just goes to show what kind of drive and work ethic she has,\" Berube said. \"And also just passion. She loves this game so much. It was really hard for her to just sit and watch last year. There was nothing more she wanted to do than get out there and play with her best friends.\"\nPrinceton has multiple optionsThe other four starters are juniors Fadima Tall, Skye Belker, Ashley Chea and Olivia Hutcherson. Berube describes St. Rose as a true three-level scorer, but also added that everyone brings different skills that are key for the team's success.\n\"I think what is good is that they compliment each other well,\" she said. \"They are not the same kind of players at all. The way Olivia Hutcherson scores is a very different way than Fadima Tall scores. Olivia gets a lot of offensive rebounds, putbacks or scores in transition really well. Whereas Fadima, she can shoot 3s but also can score on the block. Ashley Chea is scoring at the rim or 3s. Skye Belker is pull-up jumpers and midrange. She can also shoot the 3 well too.\"Hutcherson has probably made the biggest jump from her sophomore season as she went from scoring 4.2 points per game to 11.4 points per contest. She can also brag about winning the team's recent \"dip off\" at Burebe's house with an Artichoke dip she and Sarah Lessig made from scratch.\nMeanwhile, Chea is the kind of player who likes to have the ball in her hands when the team is under pressure. In the 82-79 overtime win against Harvard earlier this month, she hit the game-tying three-pointer with 0.4 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\"Ashley Chea, she's made for those moments,\" Berube said. \"She's done it several times for us. She just has ice in her veins and loves those moments.\"\nDon't sleep on Toby NwekeThe starters have been solid, but Berube said her bench is also impactful. She highlighted Toby Nweke as one of the most underrated players on her team.The 5-foot-8 sophomore guard is averaging 6.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. These stats don't exactly stand out on the stat sheet, but the coach talked about the impact she makes when she checks in.\n\"I think she just makes a great impact every time she steps on the floor,\" Berube said. \"She is a great defender. She is long, she is quick, but she also can knock down the 3. She is like our best corner 3-point shooter. I just think she makes a great impact. Not a lot is talked about her, but I think she makes us better every single day.\"\nThe outlook for MarchSo, what does this all mean for the Tigers' postseason hopes? The No. 8 seed that Princeton earned in the 2015 NCAA Tournament is still the highest seed in Ivy history, so even the current projected No. 6 seed would be a significant achievement. As Groel pointed out in his Jan. 20 bracketology, Princeton could lose a game or two down the stretch and still end up with a single-digit seed.But in women's hoops, the top four seeds in each bracket get to host first-round games, meaning if Princeton wants to be the first Ivy in the Sweet 16, a No. 4 seed would certainly help the Tigers, currently 40 in the NET rankings, have an easier path. However, this would be a very difficult feat to achieve.\nRemaining undefeated in conference play would be a must, and the team likely also needs to win the Ivy League tournament. The game against Columbia on Friday is a particularly important one because the Lions are the second highest Ivy League team in the NET rankings at 59, as is the rematch on the road against Columbia on Feb. 13. Even all of that might not be enough because the Tigers are done with non-conference games, so it will be hard for them to get a win big enough to really boost their resume. For them to continue moving up the rankings, they might need teams ranked higher than them not only to tumble, but to fail to rack up more Quad 1 and Quad 2 wins, something those teams will have more opportunities to notch given they play in tougher conferences.Of course, a top-four seed is not a requirement to make it to the Sweet 16 -- March is famous for its upsets, and Princeton has the type of veteran team that has been known to cause some madness.Regardless, Princeton has already established itself as one of the top mid-major programs in the country and it will be fun to see what else the Tigers can achieve this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Houston Rockets have been one of the best teams in the NBA at home this season. They've had no problem on their own court against the San Antonio Spurs for several campaigns.Houston (28-16) hopes both trends continue when it takes on San Antonio (31-15) at 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday at the Toyota Center. The Rockets have gone 16-3 at home in 2025-26 and have won four straight in their own building. They haven't lost there to the Spurs since Dec. 19, 2022, winning each of the last six meetings.The Rockets have won five of their last six overall contests, with the only loss being a 128-122 overtime setback on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers. One of the club's victories in that span was a 111-106 home triumph over the Spurs last Tuesday.San Antonio is coming off its second loss in three games, a 104-95 home defeat against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. The Spurs are 14-9 on the road this season but have dropped four of their last six away contests.There are eight other games on Wednesday's NBA schedule, one of which is a matchup between the Atlanta Hawks (23-25) and Boston Celtics (29-17) at 7:30 p.m. ET at TD Garden. The Hawks have won three straight following a four-game losing streak that included a 132-106 home setback against the Celtics.Only three games are on the NHL slate, with one being a Metropolitan Division clash that has the New York Rangers (22-25-6) visiting UBS Arena in Elmont, N.Y. to face the New York Islanders (28-19-5) at 7 p.m. ET in the opener of a home-and-home series. The Islanders have yet to allow the Rangers to score a goal against them this season, as they posted a 5-0 road victory in November and a 2-0 triumph at home last month. A bustling college basketball schedule includes a Big 12 Conference showdown between No. 10 Houston (17-2) and TCU (13-7) at 9 p.m. ET at Schollmaier Arena in Fort Worth, Texas. The Cougars will be eager to get back on the court after Saturday's 90-86 loss at Texas Tech, which ended their 11-game winning streak.The Rockets are 2.5-point favorites against the Spurs in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Celtics are 6.5-point favorites versus the Hawks. The Islanders are -129 on the money line against the Rangers and Houston is a 7.5-point favorite versus TCU.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Jan. 28. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchHawks at CelticsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Boston | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 231.5 (-110) | Expert: Derrick White Over 10.5 Rebounds + Assists (-115, Mike Barner)The Hawks are eighth in the NBA in scoring with an average of 117.8 points per game, and five of their last eight contests have gone Over the projected total for Wednesday's matchup. When these teams met in Atlanta earlier this month, they combined for 238 points. The SportsLine Projection Model see another high-scoring affair, as the Over hits in well over 61% of its simulations. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (18-5, +1206 on his last 23 NBA player prop picks) believes Derrick White will have another productive game, as he had five rebounds and 12 assists on Jan. 17 against a Hawks team that allows the fifth-most rebounds and sixth-most assists per game.Spurs at RocketsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Rockets -149The Toyota Center has been a house of horrors for visiting teams, as the Rockets have won 16 of their 19 home games this season, including 11 of the last 12. The Spurs haven't won there since December 2022 and just dropped a 111-106 decision in the building last week. Houston trailed by 10 points after three quarters in that contest but outscored San Antonio 29-14 in the fourth to extend its home winning streak against the Spurs to six games.

The Rangers have lost three straight and seven of eight on the road but still are much better away from home (16-12-2) than they are at Madison Square Garden (6-13-4), where the rivals will face off again on Thursday. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Rangers will get off to a good start in the home-and-home series as they win in 56% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchHouston at TCUTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Fort Worth, Texas | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 136.5 (-110) | Expert: Houston -5.5 (-110, Thomas Casale)The Cougars are first in the Big 12 with an average of only 61.6 points allowed, but they permitted Texas Tech to put up 90 on them last time out. The Horned Frogs are 11th in the conference in scoring at 80 points per game but are coming off a 97-90 triumph over Baylor. The SportsLine Projection Model feels the teams won't have much trouble offensively Wednesday, as its simulations have the Over hitting 67% of the time. SportsLine expert Thomas Casale (21-12, +643 on his last 33 college basketball against-the-spread picks) thinks Houston will bounce back from just its second loss of the season and dominate TCU on the offensive boards en route to a cover.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest on Giannis Antetokounmpo: The man who will never ask the Milwaukee Bucks for a trade is \"ready for a new home\" and \"has informed the Bucks for months that he believes the moment has come to part ways,\" per ESPN's Shams Charania. Several teams have reportedly made \"aggressive\" offers for Antetokounmpo, and Milwaukee is \"starting to listen.\"Discussions with the New York Knicks last August reportedly went nowhere, but the Knicks are among Antetokounmpo's suitors leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, per SNY's Ian Begley. So here's a question: Can they actually get him?What do the Bucks want?The Bucks are looking for \"blue-chip young talent and/or a surplus of draft picks\" in exchange for their franchise player, and they're willing to reassess the situation in the offseason if the offers aren't to their liking, per ESPN. Antetokounmpo is currently sidelined with a right calf strain, and Milwaukee is 18-27, the seventh-worst record in the league. In theory, the Bucks could wait to see how the lottery shakes out -- they will receive the less favorable of the New Orleans Pelicans' and its own picks -- and try to sell Antetokounmpo on playing with whomever they can acquire on draft night, at which point they will be able to trade three first-round picks. Waiting would give prospective Antetokounmpo suitors more flexibility, too.The Bucks don't control their own first-round draft pick until 2031. This season, they've been outscored by 11.4 points per 100 possessions without Antetokounmpo on the floor in non-garbage-time minutes. This iteration of the team has no future. The point of trading him is to give the team a future.\n\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo next team odds: Bucks forward looking for new destination, Heat and Knicks lurking\n                \n                    Chinmay Vaidya                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCan the Knicks offer them that?In a two-team trade, no. The Knicks' stars aren't young, their young players aren't blue chips and, as a result of the moves they made in the 2024 offseason -- they sent five first-round picks and a pick swap to the Brooklyn Nets in the Mikal Bridges deal and included a first-round pick in the Karl-Anthony Towns deal -- they can't offer Milwaukee any future picks right now.If New York wants to trade for Antetokounmpo before the deadline, it would almost certainly have to put together a multi-team trade, in which it sends some of its most valuable players elsewhere and the Bucks come away with the young talent and draft capital they're looking for. That is easier said than done.In theory, it is mechanically simple for the Knicks to acquire Antetokounmpo. They just need to match or exceed his $54.1 million salary. By himself, Towns gets them most of the way there, as he makes $53.1 million. Alternatively, they could aggregate smaller salaries: OG Anunoby is making $39.6 million this season, Bridges $24.9 million, Josh Hart $19.5 million, Mitchell Robinson $13 million.\nIn reality, it is a lot more complicated. Towns is an All-Star-caliber player, but his contract, which includes a $61 million player option in 2027-28, likely does not have positive value on the trade market. Bridges (trade eligible as of Feb. 1) and Anunoby are more tradable, but, assuming Jalen Brunson is off the table, it's not clear that any combination of Knicks players could return the sort of stuff that Milwaukee wants.One example: The Ringer's Zach Lowe made note of a rumor about the Portland Trail Blazers facilitating an Antetokounmpo-to-NY deal. In one hypothetical trade construction, the Knicks would get Jrue Holiday, who won a title with Antetokounmpo, and the Bucks would get some of their own draft capital back from Portland. There is logic in all of that, but it falls apart when it comes to the Blazers' side of the story -- they'd be getting Towns and his enormous contract.  It's hard to imagine them relinquishing those (extremely valuable) draft assets in such a deal. I tried to construct a fake trade involving those three teams without including Towns, and I'm not sure any of the front offices would be happy with the end result, which landed Antetokounmpo and Holiday in New York but sent both Bridges and Anunoby to Portland and Hart (plus Jerami Grant, Guerschon Yabusele and, of course, draft capital) to Milwaukee.\nWhat if the Knicks wait until the offseason?On draft night, New York will have more to offer, as it could offer its 2026 first-round pick and 2033 first-round pick to Milwaukee. The 2033 pick has real value; at that point, Brunson will be almost 37 and Antetokounmpo will be less than six months from his 39th birthday. This alone makes a potential Antetokounmpo-Knicks trade much simpler in the offseason ... as long they don't mind being hard-capped at the second apron again next year. (This is an automatic consequence of aggregating salaries in a trade.)The Cleveland Cavaliers are the only second-apron team in the NBA right now. Most teams have little interest in joining them, but, after an Antetokounmpo trade, the Knicks could be the exception, especially if they sacrifice depth in the deal. They'd be as all-in as a team can possibly be, and they'd want to avoid, say, losing Robinson for nothing in free agency.Two more issues with waiting for the offseason: Other potential suitors (including the Miami Heat) will also be able to include more draft capital in their offers, and the Bucks might have already traded him elsewhere by then.\nIt is no secret that, at least for some time last summer, Antetokounmpo had interest in playing in New York. If he makes that preference clear, and if the Knicks are willing to put just about everything that they can on the table, maybe there's a deal to be done. They're not particularly equipped to win a bidding war now, though, and there's no guarantee that they'll have a better shot at landing him in a few months.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eli Manning will have to wait at least one more year. The two-time Super Bowl MVP reportedly did not receive enough votes for election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility. His snub last year did not come as a complete surprise, after all, he had a .500 record in his career and rarely was near the top of the annual passing leaderboards. On the other hand, his two Super Bowl MVPs with game-winning drives over the Patriots and Tom Brady are the stuff of legend and something you figure Canton can't live without. It's what makes up one of the most complex Hall of Fame cases ever.Why Manning was snubbed againHall of Fame quarterbacks are naturally a very elite group. These are quarterbacks with a lot of hardware who were consistently among the best quarterbacks in the game. For the most part, Manning fell well below the bar of being one of the best passers on a year in, year out basis. I looked at Manning's yearly ranks among qualified quarterbacks in a variety of stats. The comparisons range from unflattering to shocking. \nHe is nowhere close to a Hall of Fame caliber quarterback when it comes to efficiency measures. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snub: Pro Football Hall of Fame issues statement, vows 'action' if voters violated bylaws\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFirst, I looked at EPA per play (expected points added per play). He ranked 18th on average when ranking every season of his 16-year career. That's below average play! It's worse than Derek Carr. Manning finished in the top 10 three times and none in the top five. Next up, Pro Football Reference's ANY/A+ (adjusted net yards per pass attempt index). It's a mouthful, but essentially a better version of passer rating that is era adjusted, perfect for comparing Manning to both his peers and quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame. His average annual rank was 17th, or worse than Andy Dalton. The average Hall of Fame QB ranked 10th on an annual basis. \nThere's also passer rating for the dinosaurs out there! His average rank was 19th. Worse than Carson Wentz. Ouch. He had zero top-five finishes and just one top-10 finish, in 2011. The average Hall of Fame QB (I looked at 14 to debut since 1969) ranked 10th on an annual basis. None had fewer than five top-10 finishes in their career. In other words, Manning never sniffed consistent greatness in terms of efficiency and that's very far below the bar for a HOFer.HOF QBs who debuted since 1969 - Top 10 passer rating finishes:Peyton Manning: 15Joe Montana: 13Dan Marino: 12Brett Favre: 11Steve Young: 8Dan Fouts: 8Roger Staubach: 7Kurt Warner: 6Terry Bradshaw: 6Jim Kelly: 6Troy Aikman: 6Warren Moon: 6Ken Stabler: 5John Elway: 5He ranked around 10th for the year-by-year leaderboards for touchdown passes and passing yards, which is closer to the Hall of Fame average.The table below summarizes the average year-by-year ranks for Manning vs. the 14 Hall of Fame QBs to debut since 1969. It's not pretty. \nEli Manning Avg Season QB Ranks in 16-Year CareerAvg RankHOF QB AvgWorse ThanTop 10 FinishesTop 5 FinishesEPA/Play18thN/ADerek Carr30ANY/A+17th10thAndy Dalton21Passer rating19th10thCarson Wentz10Pass TD11th9thAaron Brooks72Pass yards10th9thTrent Green73The longer it takes Eli to get in the tougher it could be with other quarterbacks coming on the ballot soon. Drew Brees is a lock for this year (even if Bill Belichick wasn't a first ballot Hall of Famer). Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger will also be locks. His resume is going to be compared with a group of borderline Hall of Fame quarterbacks that will be tough to judge in this passing era where everyone put up big volume numbers like Manning. Leaving Cam Newton off this comparison because his Hall of Fame resume comes down to his rushing numbers.Notable 2000s Quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame BubbleMVPTitlesPass TDPass YardsMatthew Stafford0142364,516Philip Rivers0042563,984Eli Manning0236657,023Russell Wilson0135346,966Matt Ryan1038162,792Here's a look at where each of these Hall of Fame bubble quarterbacks ranked on a yearly basis for passer rating, passing yards and passing touchdowns. Again, Eli's efficiency numbers don't even sniff what Stafford, Rivers, Wilson and Ryan did.Notable 2000s Quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame Bubble - Passer Rating ranksAvg Passer Rating RankTop 10sTop 5sMatthew Stafford1462Philip Rivers1075Eli Manning1910Russell Wilson9105Matt Ryan1362His volume numbers are more on par. Notable 2000s Quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame Bubble - Pass TD and yards ranksAvg Pass TD rankTop 10sAvg Pass yds rankTop 10sMatthew Stafford136119Philip Rivers811713Eli Manning117107Russell Wilson108154Matt Ryan118811When you factor in Manning's 117-117 career record and the fact that he only won a playoff game in two of the 16 seasons in his career (he won Super Bowl each of those years) you could imagine some heated debates taking place among Hall of Fame voters in future years.Why he could eventually get inOn the opposite side of the spectrum, Eli's trophy case, durability, longevity and overall mark on the game amounts to a first ballot case.He's one of six players all-time with multiple Super Bowl MVPs along with Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, Joe Montana, Bart Starr and Terry Bradshaw. You simply can't tell the story of the National Football League without Manning's legendary Super Bowl performances against the Patriots dynasty. He was the passer on perhaps the craziest play in Super Bowl history (David Tyree's helmet catch) and the best throw in Super Bowl history (sideline dime to Mario Manningham). He's one of four quarterbacks with multiple game-winning drives in the Super Bowl including Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and Terry Bradshaw.Manning was also an ironman. He started 210 straight regular-season games, the third-longest streak by a quarterback all-time behind Brett Favre and Philip Rivers. He also retired top 10 all-time in pass touchdowns and passing yards. That will carry less weight since he played in a passing era and he will continue to be pushed further outside the top 10.So what should happen?I'm glad I don't have to make this decision. He's a slam dunk Hall of Famer in some respects and not even close in others. Stats be damned, though. It's cliche, but you can't tell the story of the NFL without Manning. He may have only had two great playoff runs but they are enough to carry him to football immortality. Also, standing in and delivering pass after pass for 210 straight starts is a Hall of Fame worthy accomplishment. Manning won't completely break the Hall of Fame mold either. Joe Namath is the last quarterback inducted with a a losing record. His average rank in passer rating was 17th (Eli was 19th). His average rank in passing touchdowns was 12th (Eli was 11th) and he was ninth in pass  yards (Eli was 10th in average rank). He rode into the Hall of Fame off \"the guarantee\", the largest upset in Super Bowl history. I don't see why Eli wouldn't eventually get in with a very similar resume and two infamous Super Bowl moments to his name. \n            ",

    "body": "\nTeams streaking in opposite directions will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts. The Niners (10-4) have won four straight, all of them coming by multiple scores, including a 37-24 win over Tennessee in Week 15. The Colts (8-6), meanwhile, are riding a four-game losing streak and fell to Seattle, 18-16, last week. Quarterback Philip Rivers, who came out of retirement last week following Daniel Jones' Achilles injury, will start again for the Colts with rookie Riley Leonard backing him up. Cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) is out for Indianapolis. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The latest 49ers vs. Colts odds from DraftKings Sportsbook have San Francisco as the 5.5-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 46. Before making any Colts vs. 49ers     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Now, the model has zeroed in on San Francisco vs. Indianapolis.

San Fran also has a huge primetime advantage when it comes to the spread, as it has covered in all three such games this year, while Indy is 0-5 ATS over its last five under the bright lights of primetime. Despite batting major injuries all year, the Niners still rank among the top four in both third-down offense and passing offense. The Colts' offense should have difficulty keeping up with the 49ers as Indianapolis has scored 20 or fewer points in four straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Colts can coverThe Colts have owned this series recently, winning five straight overall matchups and going 9-3 over the last dozen home meetings. Indy controls the trenches, leading the NFL in rushing touchdowns while ranking second by allowing just 3.7 yards per rush. The ground game is already a struggle for the 49ers, who rank 31st with 3.5 yards per carry, and Rivers should find more success in his second week back. He's had a full week in the practice facility, is at home instead of a hostile environment like Seattle, and the Niners rank dead last in the NFL in defensive sacks. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Colts vs. 49ers           picksFor 49ers vs. Colts   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 54 combined points.

Meanwhile, no team in the NFL has a worse spread record than Baltimore at 5-9, and the Ravens have failed to cover in four of their last five contests. On the field, the Pats have incredible balance, ranking No. 7 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and the team is coming off a season-high of 246 rushing yards on Sunday. Baltimore's run defense is exploitable this year as after ranking No. 1 versus the run in 2024, the team is just 15th this season. In addition to New England's backs, QB Drake Maye could also take advantage of Baltimore's run defense after he had 43 yards and two TDs on the ground last week. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Ravens can coverThe elite Ravens defense which has always been associated with the franchise returned last week as Baltimore pitched its first shutout in over seven years. That came versus a Bengals offense which had scored 30-plus in three straight Joe Burrow starts, while the Patriots offense has issues scoring in the redzone. It ranks 24th in redzone scoring, while the Patriots are dead last in redzone defense as just about every team which gets inside their 20-yard-line ends up with a touchdown instead of a field goal. Baltimore leads the NFL with 5.2 yards per carry, and Lamar Jackson had four passing touchdowns, plus 100-plus yards and a score on the ground, the last time he faced the Pats, who will be shorthanded without leading tackler, Robert Spillane, on 'SNF'. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Ravens picksSportsLine's model has simulated Ravens vs. Patriots  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points.

The Patriots (11-3), who lead the AFC East, hold a one-game lead over the Buffalo Bills with three games remaining.

He also had one touchdown in a 27-14 win over the New York Jets on Nov. 13.

Over its first 31 plays, it had produced just 113 yards -- a paltry 3.6 yards per play.It's a good thing for the Steelers they got a 32nd play -- and that Kenneth Gainwell made arguably the best play of the season. With just 11 seconds left in the half and trailing the Detroit Lions 10-3, Aaron Rodgers lofted a deep ball to Kenneth Gainwell, who somehow fought through a pass interference by Alex Anzalone, got a hand under the ball while lying on his back, then secured the ball, got up untouched and scored. See for yourself:\nThe 45-yard score was the longest receiving touchdown by a Steelers running back since Dwight Stone went 78 yards in 1988, according to CBS Sports research.Gainwell, in his first season in Pittsburgh, is having a career year across the board, and this, his seventh touchdown of the season, also set a career high.\nBoth the Steelers and the Lions entered this game 8-6. Pittsburgh currently leads the AFC North by one game over the Baltimore Ravens; the Lions are just on the outside looking in on the NFC playoff picture. If Pittsburgh hangs on to make the playoff or Detroit ends up missing out, this play could be a huge reason why.\n            \n    ",

That's when the All-Pro wide receiver frantically whipped the football backward with the hopes a teammate would recover the football and run in for the game-winning touchdown. Funny enough, Goff did just that despite the Steelers defense appearing to stop playing because it seemed like St. Brown was held up long enough for the play to be blown dead because of forward progress. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: 49ers, Bears and Patriots punch their tickets; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, Goff's scoop and score off St. Brown's lateral was wiped away because St. Brown pushed off of Steelers All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey to make the initial catch at the start of the play. \nHead referee Carl Cheffers explained that because the penalty was on the offense that Goff's touchdown was nullified. By NFL rules, an offensive penalty when time has expired does not trigger a replay of the previous play, so the Steelers walked away with a crucial, late-season victory.\nThe Lions' playoff hopes are now slim to none as a result of their last-second loss. Detroit needs the Green Bay Packers, the current owner of the NFC's seventh and final playoff spot, to lose their last two games against the Baltimore Ravens (7-8) and the Minnesota Vikings (7-8), and the Lions also need to win their last two games at the Vikings and at the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (11-4). \n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        LONDON -- For Alexander Isak, this really might have been the moment where it all went click. Not that the 10 minutes leading up to his goal ",
    "body": "\n        LONDON -- For Alexander Isak, this really might have been the moment where it all went click. Not that the 10 minutes leading up to his goal had particularly suggested that British football's record signing was on the brink of something, but there is nothing to drag a player out of a prolonged funk like a goal. All the more so given that his goal dragged Liverpool ahead in a game that they resolutely failed to impose themselves on, no matter the difficulties of Tottenham.These were the moments that you pay $175 million. They have been altogether too infrequent for Liverpool, 2-1 winners at Tottenham.Cruelly for Isak, however, they might not be much more frequent for some time yet. It was the other click that threatens to define this day. Or perhaps it was a jar, a jam or something even more heavy-duty. Whatever the nature of the damage done to Isak as Micky van de Ven collided with him well after the shot was away, it was enough to rob Liverpool's No. 9 of what might otherwise have been a moment of ecstasy. There was to be no celebration from Isak nor from his teammates. Dark and worried faces soon surrounded the Swede, who squirmed on the floor in agony, one hand covering his eyes as the other clung onto his left knee. He seemed to fear the worst.A stretcher may not have been required, but the worst fears hardly seemed allayed as Isak hobbled along the touchline at agonizing pace, his weight placed on two Liverpool physios. Suddenly, all manner of fears came crashing into view. When might Isak be back to fire life into year one at his new club? The belief is a broken leg, putting him out potentially for the next handful of months, which is a small silver lining to what potentially could have been a season-ending injury. Isn't this what any buyer would always have feared from a player whose Newcastle career was pockmarked with runs of seven or eight games on the sidelines? What of the World Cup and, indeed, the qualifiers in March, where Sweden could really do with one of the best strikers in the world? \nFor Arne Slot, it was much too soon for such doomerism, though he admitted that his gut feeling was not a positive one. \"I don't have any news on him,\" he said on Saturday. \"If a player scores and gets injured and doesn't come on the pitch and also doesn't try ... That's usually not a good thing. I cannot say anything more than that. That is just gut feeling. Nothing medical.\"I haven't spoken to him about his feeling but it's a nice thing that he scored. A good goal, assisted by Florian Wirtz.\"Slot might be intent on finding the silver lining but the story of this season seems to be that, no matter how much they spend, Liverpool cannot have nice things. Not for the first time this season, a moment of triumph was swept away in an instant. So too departed a flicker of what Slot's team might have been given more time to build the automatisms they so clearly lack.\nIsak's goal had been the moment the rest of the Premier League had feared since Martin Edwards parked the Brink's truck outside St. James' Park and came up with an offer even Saudi Arabia couldn't refuse. One clumsy moment from Cristian Romero -- the first of many -- and the ball was ricocheting off Alexis Mac Allister and into Isak's path. Smart hold-up play with his back to goal and then the No. 9 slipped the ball to Hugo Ekitike, whose first-time pass found Wirtz in stride. That long-awaited first goal contribution betrayed no nerves, a pass played at just the right moment for Isak to bend one low and across Guglielmo Vicario.\"That's what we would like to see happening a lot,\" said Slot. \"Good finish, good pass. Let's not be too negative yet. We don't know. Let's hope he's back with us soon. Difficult to say.\"This may feel like an overhype of an attack that was as much to do with how little else Liverpool offered in an attacking sense. A header from Ekitike 10 minutes after the opener gave them enough of a cushion to hold off a late charge but against 11, 10 or nine men, Liverpool never got going. It was one thing to get outshot five to one by Spurs in the period before Xavi Simons' red card; Tottenham controlled the game rather well early on. The fact that it was 10 to seven in Tottenham's favor from then on speaks as much to Liverpool's inability to exploit possession and territory as it does the late charge brought about by Richarlison's scrappy finish seven minutes from time. \nLiverpool found themselves clinging on against nine men at the death partly because football is a deeply silly sport for how low-scoring it is, somewhat because the decisions of referee John Brooks stoked an indignation in Tottenham that was worth at least one extra man and predominantly because they could not do enough with the ball. This isn't the first time they've found themselves hanging on against 10 men -- against Newcastle, they roared back in more thrilling fashion -- and it seems there is something that Slot is aware of that is making it harder for Liverpool to impose themselves on teams.\"It's always difficult. If I try to explain why it is difficult then people tell me afterwards, 'you say too much to your future opponents.'\"When we had the ball, that was what hurt me the most. In the nine minutes of added time, I think they had 95% of the ball. Every time when we had the ball, we kicked it away or we threw it away. It was unbelievable that we couldn't keep the ball a bit longer.\"\nThat feels like another problem on top of the other one that has dogged Slot for most of this season: that his team are too easily run through by counterattacking opponents. There were flashes of that, a breakaway chance for 10-man Randal Kolo Muani, but until the late drama, this had more of the feel of the Inter game, a match where Liverpool filled the center to throttle some of the drama out of proceedings. The logic to that should be that when indiscipline from the opponents allows them to apply further control, they turn that into shots and goals.Instead, the quasi-diamond of recent games was more of a lump of coal, all rough edges as Mac Allister found himself pushed up alongside Ekitike, Wirtz roaming high and low in pursuit of the ball. For this system to be effective, the fullbacks need to be at the top of their game. Conor Bradley was struggling with his radar before his injury-enforced exit at the interval and too many of Milos Kerkez's crosses crashed into the first Tottenham shirt. The left flank in particular never got going and inverting into more central areas does not seem to be the best use of Kerkez, a flyer down the line who could offer the width this team lacks too often.Such are the problems Liverpool made for themselves with their half-billion dollar overhaul of the champions, one which seems to have left them light on wingers and center backs while overstuffed with players who would be happiest in the space between midfield and the frontline. This might be a squad that needs reorienting but when you have as much talent as Slot can call upon, there is always the prospect of something clicking. Not that, however.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- With the Philadelphia Eagles clinching the 2025 NFC East crown with a Saturday night win over the Washington Commanders, ",
    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- With the Philadelphia Eagles clinching the 2025 NFC East crown with a Saturday night win over the Washington Commanders, the Dallas Cowboys' postseason chances officially went up in smoke, dropping to zero percent before kickoff of their Week 16 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers.That result means the Cowboys' Super Bowl drought has officially reached 30 years, with Dallas' last Vince Lombardi Trophy coming in the 1995 season -- the bookend to the franchise's 1990s dynasty that produced three championships in four seasons. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones has presided over both the glory years and the prolonged dry spell that followed.Dallas is now the only NFC team that hasn't reached a conference championship game in the past 30 years. Every other NFC franchise has appeared in a conference title game at least once since 2010. That's why Jones took accountability following the Cowboys' 34-17 loss to the now 11-4 Chargers on Sunday afternoon, which dropped Dallas to 6-8-1.\"I'll admit that the Cowboys management has played a big role (in the 30-year Super Bowl drought),\" Jones said postgame. \"But seriously, I'm very disappointed that the way we're structured, and my role, puts us here tonight. I'm tremendously disappointed.\"\nDespite that frustration, Jones said he remains confident he can reverse course at age 83, citing Dallas' draft capital -- including two first-round picks in 2026 -- and an offense that has flourished in the first season under head coach Brian Schottenheimer, who also serves as the team's primary offensive play caller.The Cowboys are averaging 28.3 points per game, with quarterback Dak Prescott throwing for 4,175 yards, running back Javonte Williams rushing for 1,147 yards and wide receivers George Pickens (1,342) and CeeDee Lamb (1,027) both eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards.\"Really, I don't want to be trite, but the same way that I might have looked at the 30 years before I bought the Cowboys. That was then. This is now,\" Jones said. \"I've never looked at something because I haven't done it in the past as something that's not possible for us to do. We're qualified, and we've got as good a place to be as you'd probably like to have with where we are with our draft picks.\n\"I like the job Schottenheimer's done this year. I think he's been outstanding. He's a first-year coach, and he's covered a lot of ground -- not only his duties as head coach, but his duties on the offense and his duties over on the defense as well.\"So why should anyone believe Jones can change? He believes his willingness to alter his decision-making process is rooted in recognizing when past approaches haven't worked. While Jones didn't cite a specific example, one could point to the trade-deadline acquisition of Jets All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams as a shift toward a more aggressive approach.That move, however, came too late to save the Cowboys' season. Williams made his Dallas debut in Week 11, when the Cowboys were already 3-5-1.\n\"I can tell you right now one of the reasons I've enjoyed some of the things that worked for me is because I will change, and I do change,\" Jones said. \"I can make a decision ... that is different from the ones I've been making. ... I like what we've done with our cap. We'll be able to spend money. We'll be able to draft good, hopefully. ... I really am better when I'm getting my ass kicked than I am when I'm having success, and I will eat the cheese.\"Jones also explained why he continues to operate as the Cowboys' general manager -- a role no other NFL owner occupies.\"When I got involved with the Cowboys, it was for an occupation. It was for a job, not as some type of investment,\" Jones said. \"There was nothing to invest in in the Cowboys. There was too much work and too many things you had to do. ... Financially, there were a lot of challenges, but there's a lot of challenges everywhere. ... There are challenges today, and I welcome them. I'm proud I'm healthy enough and alert enough to address them.\" \nWhat to do with the defense?One of Jones' biggest challenges is fixing a defense that struggled mightily in its first season without All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons and under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. Dallas ranks second-worst in scoring defense (30.3 points allowed per game), third-worst in total defense (380.1 yards allowed per game) and eighth-worst in sack rate (5.5%).Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert entered Week 16 having been sacked 49 times -- tied for the most in the NFL -- and hit 116 times, the most in the league. The Cowboys, however, failed to sack him on Sunday, recording just five quarterback hits. Williams did not play due to a neck injury and concussion.\"I was disappointed -- very disappointed,\" Jones said. \"We came in really planning to get pressure and did not. It was obviously a disappointment not to have Quinnen out there, but we got some good play from 95 [Kenny Clark]. ... That was a shortcoming of us today. We couldn't get pressure.\"\nJones said evaluating Eberflus is \"not difficult\" and confirmed all options will be considered. Dallas previously dismissed defensive coordinator Mike Nolan after one season in 2020.\"You can imagine the data, the analytics, the information that's available today,\" Jones said. \"If I'm anything, I should have access to the greatest choices you could have regarding coaches. That doesn't mean you can get them all, because they may be committed in other ways. But one of the great things about where we are and what we got is we can get good coaches.\"That's not crossed my mind -- the inability to effectively do something different if that's what we decide. ... We've got a team that has a top future as far as next year's concerned, when you look at starting with the offense, starting with Dak [Prescott] as we stand here today. And I think we got the bones of a heck of a defense out there as well.\" \nAs with the Cowboys' 30-year Super Bowl drought, Jones was comfortable \"facing the music,\" answering questions for roughly 30 minutes following the team's home finale. Whether that scrutiny leads to significant offseason changes remains to be seen.\"Ultimately, you point your finger right back at you on who fired Matt Eberflus,\" Jones said. \"It's easy to say you could have done things differently, but that goes with the territory. Any time you make the ultimate decision, then you've got to look at that and weigh it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest international free agents on the market this offseason has signed … for a suspiciously small number. The White Sox landed Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami Sunday, for a deal that will pay him just $34 million over the next two seasons. Murakami has a proven track record of elite production in the second best baseball league in the world and is just 26 years old, so the assumption among most was that he would at least challenge Masataka Yoshida's record $90 million contract for a position player from Nippon Professional Baseball. Instead, he wound up signing a deal that will pay him $6 million less than what an older, injury-plagued Jorge Polanco just signed for.Given that we don't have access to the same type of robust, granular data from NPB as we do for MLB players in the public sphere, the contract Murakami just signed seems telling. We're talking about a 26-year-old with legit 70-grade power – he hit 56 homers in a season once and had a max exit velocity of 116.5 mph last season – the fact that Murakami ended up settling for a two-year deal worth less annual than what Ha-seong Kim and Polanco just got tells us that there are grave concerns about his ability to translate his skills to the majors. And I'm mostly inclined to just leave it at that. MLB teams aren't infallible, and when it comes to a player making the transition from NPB to the majors, there's an inherent uncertainty that makes it harder to say with confidence whether this will end up being a good deal or not. But there are no shortage of teams with the need for a potential 30-plus power hitter in the middle of the lineup, and the fact that Murakami ended up with a similar contract to the ones Jurickson Profar and Tyler O'Neill signed last season (while being significantly older and with pretty mediocre MLB track records) stands out as a pretty big red flag, one Fantasy player shouldn't just ignore. \nI'm not going to totally bury him in my rankings but given that the White Sox (and the other 29 teams, frankly) know a whole lot more about Murakami than we do, I am very much inclined to view him with a skeptical eye. We'll get to the scouting report for Murakami shortly, but the long and short of it is there are significant contact questions with his swing that make his likelihood of living up to the loftiest expectations pretty unlikely. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as a prospect if he signed for big money, but with the details in now, it seems like MLB teams just don't have a lot of faith in his swing. If MLB teams are telling us they don't have much more faith in him than they do in Polanco, we should probably listen. So, for Fantasy, I'm not going to rank Murakami as someone you need to draft for your starting lineup, even if he ends up listed as a 3B, a shallow position where power is at a premium. Projecting him as a 3B-eligible player – he may just end up playing 1B or even DH – I'm ranking him 14th at the position, in between two players with some similar skills and deficits in Royce Lewis and Lenyn Sosa. He could hit 30 homers with a manageable batting average, but Murakami's likeliest outcomes in your mental model should probably have shifted to the bad side of the scale with this contract. Here's what you need to know about Murakami: Let's start with the good**which is easier to make sense of with Murakami's profile The first thing to understand about Murakami is the context of the league he's playing in. Last season, the worst qualifying hitter in MLB was Ke'Bryan Hayes, who put together a .235/.290/.306 triple-slash line between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. The average hitter in the Central League of NPB put together a .242/.302/.350 slash line. Among six teams in the Central League, only five even got to 100 home runs. \nBy comparison, Murakami hit 22 homers in just 56 games, putting up a .286/.392/.659 slash line despite playing through injuries. That was good for a 211 wRC+; over the past decade in MLB, Aaron Judge (2024, 2022, and 2025) and Juan Soto (2020) are the only qualifiers to put up a wRC+ of at least 200 in a season. Murakami has actually managed that feat twice, when he posted a 225 wRC+ in his record-breaking 2022 season. There have been some ups and downs, but Murakami has probably been the best hitter in Japan over the past half-decade on the strength of world-class power. He had a max exit velocity of 116.5 mph last season and by all accounts was putting up average and 90th percentile exit velocities in the same range as some of the best power hitters in MLB. If Murakami isn't an 80-grade power hitter, it's probably not much worse than 70-grade, and he knows how to put it into play in games. 30 homers isn't the ceiling here. If he ends up being an impact player in MLB, it'll almost certainly because he is a well above average power hitter. \nSo, what's wrong with Murakami?Well, it should come as no surprise if you are moderately aware of how these things typically work: He strikes out too much. But in Murakami's case, this goes beyond merely just striking out too much. His strikeout rate has settled in around 29% over the past couple of seasons, and he simply swings and misses too often. Here's what I wrote in an earlier breakdown of Murakami this offseason in the Fantasy Baseball Today Newsletter: \"Per MLB.com, Murakami has had a whiff rate around 36% over the past two seasons, with his strikeout rate jumping to 29% in that stretch. That's a frightening statistic, and his in-zone contact rate is even more troubling, as he was at just 72.6% in 2025, down from 77.1% in 2022 and well below the MLB average of 82.5%. And he was doing that against less-than-MLB-level competition, meaning we might project even more regression there. And Murakami has also notably struggled against high-velocity fastballs, something he'll see a lot more of in the majors than he has in NPB so far.\"How bad is that 72.6% mark? Only Rafael Devers posted a worse mark in 2026 among MLB hitters at 71.4%. That's not a bad comp for Murakami – he shares Devers' elite quality of contact skills and his inability to really handle third base, though he's probably a smidge more selective than Devers – but a comp of one doesn't give you a lot to fall back on. Devers is an outlier even among whiff-prone sluggers, and expecting any hitter to be Rafael Devers is probably asking too much. \nBut it isn't impossible, and Murakami does have the power to make it all work. He'll just constantly be dancing on a knife's edge. Joey Gallo had a similar profile and made it work for a few years, but the ugly years were truly horrendous, and he fell off quickly. Murakami will need to either improve his contact rates to more tolerable levels or be an absolute outlier when it comes to the damage he does when he makes contact.Neither is out of the realm of possibility. He was a better contact hitter earlier in his career, and the fact that NPB and MLB literally use different balls – the NPB ball is a little bit smaller and tackier, leading to more movement – could mean that his specific shortcomings are magnified in Japan in a way that might be less true in MLB. Plus, Shohei Ohtani had some similar issues with in-zone contact when he came over, and obviously that hasn't held him back.Murakami has some legitimate MLB-caliber skills, and the upside here is enough that he should still be drafted in all Fantasy leagues in 2026. But there's no question that this contract gives his detractors ammo and should be a mark against him. Draft him as a cheap source of power in the later rounds and hope he manages to avoid the worst-case scenarios. If he's off the board around 200, you've probably managed the risk well enough that he's worth having around, even if the likeliest outcome might have shifted more toward the Matt Wallner edge of the spectrum. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 16 is one of the highest-leverage weeks of the 2025 NFL season, and there have already been results with huge playoff implications. Leading up to Sunday's action, there was plenty of jockeying, particularly in the NFC. The Seahawks beat the Rams to move atop the division and the NFC on Thursday night, and Saturday's action saw the Philadelphia Eagles clinch the NFC East with a win over the Commanders, while the Chicago Bears pulled off a comeback for the ages and took control of the NFC North with an overtime victory over the Green Bay Packers. That was quite the appetizer for the full Sunday slate, which has had its fair share of drama as well. In the early window, the Carolina Panthers notched a key win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to move into first place in the NFC South. Meanwhile, in the AFC, the Buffalo Bills escaped with a win in Cleveland to keep their hopes of winning the AFC East alive. As we migrated to the later afternoon slate, the playoff picture continued to get turned on its head. The Jacksonville Jaguars took down the Denver Broncos to keep the door to the No. 1 seed ajar as the Steelers held on against the Lions, dwindling Detroit's chances of sneaking in. And there's still more to go as Monday's matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts have plenty of playoff implications. As we continue to monitor the latest movements in the playoff standings, here is an up-to-date look at where things stand heading into \"Monday Night Football.\" \nAFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-3)x-New England Patriots (12-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Buffalo Bills (11-4)Houston Texans (10-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver's 11-game winning streak was snapped in Week 16 as the Jaguars rolled into Mile High and pulled off a convincing 34-20 win. While the Broncos are still the No. 1 seed in the conference and in first place in the AFC West, the door is now open slightly for them to fall from that perch if they aren't careful over these next two weeks. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots secured their spot in the playoffs after rallying for an 11-point deficit against the Ravens to move to 12-3 on the season. The victory not only clinched their spot in the postseason, but it continued to keep the Bills at arms length for first place in the AFC East. New England loses the tiebreaker to Denver for the No. 1 seed at the moment due to a subpar win percentage in common games. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars made a statement in Week 16 that they are a serious player in the AFC playoff race after beating the Broncos on the road. That extends Jacksonville's winning streak to six games, as the Jaguars seem to be peaking at the right time. The Jags will clinch a playoff berth if the Colts lose to the 49ers on Monday night. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers have won three straight and continue to give themselves breathing room in the AFC North playoff race, especially after taking down the Lions. On top of that, the Ravens fell to the Patriots, which means the only way Baltimore can leapfrog them is if they win out and Pittsburgh loses out. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers have now won four straight games after taking down the Cowboys in Dallas on Sunday. Currently, they are the top wild card in the AFC, but have some stiff competition behind them. That includes the Houston Texans, who they'll see next week at SoFi Stadium. The Chargers will clinch a playoff berth if the Colts lost to the 49ers on Monday night. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt was a bit closer than they may have liked, but the Bills came away with a win in Cleveland to push them to 11-4 on the season. That keeps them on the heels of the Patriots in the AFC East race and firmly in wild card position. Week 16 was the final time Buffalo will be on the road during the 2025 regular season, as they'll wrap up the year at Highmark Stadium. Meanwhile, if the Colts lose or tie on Monday night, Buffalo will have clinched a playoff berth. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won seven straight games to put themselves in a comfortable position inside the playoff picture. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Raiders at home that was much closer than anticipated, but they are knocking on the door of clinching. In the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward as they take on the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night. The Ravens (7-8) saw a massive dent get put into their playoff hopes with their loss to the Patriots in Week 16. Baltimore's only path to the playoffs is via the AFC North, which they can win if Pittsburgh loses out and they win out. \nNFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (12-3)x-Chicago Bears (11-4)z-Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Carolina Panthers (8-7)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-4)x-San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. If the Seahawks win out against the Panthers and Niners, they will clinch the top spot in the NFC and a bye in the first round of the playoffs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-4)Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears are coming off a stunning comeback win over the Packers in Week 16, and they remain in the hunt for the NFC's No. 1 seed. Thanks to the Pittsburgh Steelers taking down the Detroit Lions on Sunday, Chicago has officially clinched a playoff berth, but the division is still yet to be clinched.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket on Saturday night with a commanding victory over the Washington Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions become the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004.\nThe Eagles' win also eliminated the Cowboys from playoff contention, marking the second straight season they'll miss the postseason.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-7)Remaining schedule: vs. Seahawks, at BuccaneersCarolina has jumped up to the No. 4 seed after leaping over the Buccaneers for the NFC South lead thanks to a head-to-head victory in Week 16. While this does vault the Panthers atop the division for the moment, there's still plenty that can happen between now and the end of the regular season, especially with another matchup on deck for Week 18 in Tampa. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night. They need Seattle to lose at least one more game, but also can't have the 49ers win out. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race, and just clinched a playoff berth after the Lions fell to the Steelers. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if its division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. Following L.A.'s loss to Seattle on Thursday night, the Niners control their own destiny in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. If they win out, they get the top spot. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace entering Week 16. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and leading the NFC North, the Packers dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed following a loss to the Denver Broncos. That defeat allowed Chicago to jump ahead of Green Bay for first place in the division.\nThings got even worse Saturday night. Not only did Green Bay give up a double-digit lead in the final two minutes -- eventually falling in overtime to the Bears -- but it also lost Jordan Love to a concussion.Luckily for the Packers, they hold the tiebreaker over the Lions, their primary competition for a playoff spot, after sweeping Detroit earlier this season. Still, with games remaining against the Ravens and Vikings, it's far from a foregone conclusion that Green Bay will reach the postseason.In the huntThe Lions (8-7) have their backs against the wall after falling to the Steelers in Week 16. They already had an uphill climb coming into this slate, particularly as they are on the wrong end of the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Packers. To reach the postseason, the Lions need to win out and hope the Packers lose out. \nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8) have fallen out of first place in the NFC South after falling to the Panthers on Sunday. The only path for Baker Mayfield and Co. to make the playoffs at this point is to win the division, so there is zero margin for error over these final two weeks. They'll need to take care of business next week in Miami against the Dolphins before hosting the Panthers in what could be a win-and-in scenario in Week 18. \n            ",

There were several other close calls over the course of the day, as the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Browns were all involved in one-score games. With Las Vegas losing, it sets up a battle with the Giants for the No. 1 overall selection next weekend.There are seven teams with four wins or fewer in the NFL. The only two teams with just two wins meet next weekend. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. \nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:1. New York Giants (2-13)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTWith J.J. McCarthy injured, New York had an opportunity to beat undrafted rookie Max Brosmer and the Vikings, but a Darius Slayton drop on third-and-8 proved to be the final nail in the coffin. 2. Las Vegas Raiders (2-13)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTThe Raiders showed more life than their fans had seen in months, but the Texans pulled the plug with a clock-draining final drive that allowed Houston to kneel out the clock.\n3. Cleveland Browns (3-12)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLThe Browns were first on the scoreboard and stayed close throughout the game, but Shedeur Sanders couldn't deliver a win.4. New York Jets (3-12)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets and Saints were trading field goals in the first half, but the Saints, led by rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, ultimately pulled away. 5. Tennessee Titans (3-12)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEThere is no clarity on the future of the Titans' organization beyond Cam Ward's involvement. The team will have its third new head coach (not including interims) in four years. \n6. Arizona Cardinals (3-12)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona continued clawing its way back into the fight after Atlanta had delivered a few convincing blows. In the end, the Cardinals were unable to get one final stop for their offense to retake the field.7. Washington Commanders (4-11)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington held a lead early in the game, but Jayden Daniels' backup, Marcus Mariota, gave way to veteran Josh Johnson and Philadelphia ran away with the game.8. New Orleans Saints (5-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans has won its third consecutive game, and it has winnable games ahead against the Titans and Falcons.\n9. Cincinnati Bengals (5-10)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati expelled some of its frustrations on what had been a feisty Dolphins team on Sunday with a 45-21 victory.10. Miami Dolphins (6-9)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SAfter winning four consecutive games, Miami is now on a two-game losing streak. Mike McDaniel's seat is still hot with two games to play.  11. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (6-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta has won two consecutive games and put a damper on the outlook of the Rams' first-round pick.\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-9)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEChiefs fans got a glimpse of what it would be like to play without Patrick Mahomes on Sunday. The offensive issues persisted, but with Gardner Minshew and Chris Oladokun at quarterback.  13. Dallas Cowboys (6-8-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas is once again falling short of expectations. Will this be the season that sets course on an off-season of drastic changes?14. Baltimore Ravens (7-8)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBThe Ravens lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury and also lost to the Patriots on \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n15. Minnesota Vikings (7-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBMinnesota is teetering on .500, but there is a clear delineation between the top teams in the conference and how the Vikings are currently playing. Unfortunately, another injury to J.J. McCarthy will hamper the evaluation process of the young quarterback. 16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers have now lost six of their past seven games, but will still have an opportunity to win the division if they take care of business against Miami next weekend. 17. Detroit Lions (8-7)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit could not afford to lose this weekend, but Pittsburgh was in a must-win scenario of its own. The Lions fell short in front of the hometown crowd.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order after Week 16: Giants, Raiders losses set up a potential No. 1 pick showdown\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n18.

Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDespite Malik Willis' valiant effort in reserve, Green Bay fell short and lost ground in the NFC North race Saturday night. \n22. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLThe law firm of Bigsby and Barkley ran away from divisional foe Washington on Saturday, becoming the first team to win the NFC East in back-to-back years since 2004. 23. Houston Texans (10-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SIt was not pretty, but Houston took care of business for its seventh consecutive victory.24. Buffalo Bills (11-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRA Buffalo win over Cleveland keeps the AFC East race interesting for at least one more week. \n25. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco travels to Indianapolis for \"Monday Night Football,\" and significant stakes are on the line for both teams.  26. Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLLos Angeles used a 10-point fourth quarter to double up the Cowboys, 34-17, Sunday.   27. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville is playing as well as any other team in football right now. There is a trust that has developed between Trevor Lawrence and Liam Coen over the course of the season that has enabled the offense to flourish. 28. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLMatthew Stafford threw for nearly 500 yards and three touchdowns, but a two-point conversion pushed Seattle over the top in overtime. 29. Chicago Bears (11-4)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTAgainst all odds, Chicago has a python-like grip on the NFC North with just two games to play. 30. New England Patriots (12-3)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEThe Patriots knocked off the Ravens on \"Sunday Night Football\" to clinch a playoff berth.31. Denver Broncos (12-3)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTAn 11-game win streak was brought to an end by Jacksonville Sunday evening. The Broncos finish the season with divisional matchups against the Chargers and Chiefs. 32. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRIn a back-and-forth game totaling 75 points, the Seahawks outlasted the Rams in overtime. The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

That one result should move Iowa State to its highest ranking of the season, push UConn higher in the top five after a four-week stint at No. 5 and potentially make Texas Tech the biggest riser come Monday. How far voters drop Duke, whose loss to Texas Tech was its first of the season, could also play a big role in how the top 10 and beyond looks. Purdue is poised to potentially push its way back into the top five if Duke falls outside the top five, and both Gonzaga and Houston are hot right now and positioned to climb in the event of a precipitous Blue Devils drop.There's also some imminent movement coming in the rankings after a noisy CBS Sports Classic on Saturday in which North Carolina held off Ohio State and Kentucky downed St. John's in dominant fashion. Kentucky entering the rankings and St. John's falling out is very much in play, and UNC is on the cusp of pushing into the top 10, too.\n\n        \n            \n                Kentucky and UNC soar; Free-falling Memphis is down to one NCAA Tournament path\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMy projection for how voters will cast their ballots is below.

The absence of star guard Mikel Brown Jr. loomed large Tuesday in the 83-62 defeat at Tennessee. Last week: 1118\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    Tennessee and Texas Tech moving up in the poll this week could push Kansas, which has won three straight and was 1-0 this week, down in this week's poll.

John Calipari's team has had a terrific month otherwise with wins over Texas Tech and Louisville, among others. Last week: 1420\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    Illinois lost for a third time in its last seven outings Saturday in a home defeat to unbeaten Nebraska. Last week: 1821\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    The defending national champion Florida Gators nearly fell out of the rankings last week but should comfortably be in the 20-25 range Monday. They have won three-straight after losses to Duke and UConn to open the month. Last week: 2322\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    A weekend win over Maryland could get UVA moving up in the polls this week after climbing one spot each of the last two weeks. Last week: 2323\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Georgia\n                    \n    \n    The highest-scoring team in college basketball, the Georgia Bulldogs, appeared at No. 25 in the poll last week for the first time. They responded with a 30-point home win over Western Carolina and should remain inside the ranks Monday. Last week: 2524\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            USC\n                    \n    \n    USC was the first time OUT of the AP poll last week but could jump back into the mix this week with St. John's dropping another one. It is 12-1 on the season. Last week: NR25\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Auburn\n                    \n    \n    I don't think Auburn drops out of the rankings but it could be in play after a 28-point loss Saturday to Purdue. All four of the Tigers' losses this season are to teams likely to be in the top-10 on Monday. Last week: 21\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        We've reached Week 16, so some teams are clinching playoff spots, some are aiming to stave off elimination and others are just playing out the string while keeping one eye on the NFL Draft order. And, of course, at this stage of the season, injuries are piling up for some teams while others are getting healthier. For bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 16, here are the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Chargers at Cowboys (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, available)DAL CB DaRon Bland (foot, out)\nThe Chargers have Johnston for this matchup against Dallas' struggling secondary, which will likely be without cornerback DaRon Bland for the remainder of the year. The good news for the Cowboys is neither CeeDee Lamb or Javonte Williams carry injury designations for Week 16.The Cowboys are slight 1.5-point favorites at home. The total is 49.5.Vikings at Giants (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note \nBoth teams are just trying to get across the finish line here, with the Vikings taking a major step back from last season while the Giants are going to have a new head coach in 2026. The Giants have a handful of players out or questionable, but no real line-movers.Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite. The total is 43.5.Bengals at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, available)\nThis matchup is most noteworthy for Quinn Ewers starting at quarterback for Miami in place of the benched Tua Tagovailoa as the rookie from Texas is set to make his first NFL start against Cincinnati's league-worst defense. The Bengals do have Tee Higgins back on offense after he cleared concussion protocol.\nCincy is a 4.5-point favorite, and the total is 47.5.Buccaneers at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThis very important NFC South clash thankfully doesn't have major injuries impacting it, as the Bucs have no players listed while none of Carolina's stars, namely receiver Tetairoa McMillan, carry designations into the weekend. Both teams are 7-7, so the winner will hold the NFC South lead entering Week 17. These teams face off again in Week 18. Tampa Bay is favored by three points. The total sits at 45.5.Jets at Saints (1 p.m. ET)NYJ Tyrod Taylor (groin and knee, available)NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)NYJ WR Garrett Wilson (knee, out for season)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)\nUndrafted rookie Brady Cook will start for New York and Tyrod Taylor will be his backup. Fields is out. Cook won't have two of New York's top weapons with receiver Garrett Wilson shut down for the year while rookie tight end Mason Taylor remains sidelined with a neck injury. As for New Orleans, the Saints are again without top running back Alvin Kamara. The Saints are 6.5-point favorites. The total is 40.5.Bills at Browns (1 p.m. ET)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, out)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)\nThe biggest injuries here come with Cleveland's offense, as rookie No. 2 back Dylan Sampson remains sidelined with a hand injury and veteran tight end David Njoku, who has seen his role diminish with the emergence of rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is also out. \nBuffalo is a 10.5-point favorite, and the total is 41.5.Chiefs at Titans (1 p.m. ET)KC QB Patrick Mahomes (knee, out for season)KC WR Rashee Rice (concussion, out)\nThe Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention and will be without Patrick Mahomes for the rest of the year after he tore his ACL last week. Gardner Minshew will start in his place, but for this week, he won't have No. 1 receiver Rashee Rice as he is out with a concussion for this matchup with the Titans.Kansas City is favored by 3, and the total is 37.5.Jaguars at Broncos (4:05 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThis AFC clash between division leaders is a potential playoff preview. The Jags have won five in a row to move to 10-4, while Denver sits atop the conference at 12-2 amid an 11-game win streak. Denver has clinched a playoff spot already while Jacksonville can clinch with a win and a loss by either Indianapolis or Houston. Denver is favored by 3.5 while the total is 47.5.Falcons at Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)ATL WR Drake London (knee, available)AZ RB Zonovan Knight (ankle, injured reserve)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)\nAtlanta gets star receiver Drake London back after he's been sidelined for weeks with a knee injury. The Cardinals get a top receiver back in Marvin Harrison Jr., who is active after missing time of late after undergoing an appendectomy and more recently a nagging heel injury. The Cardinals' running back woes also continue, as Zonovan \"Bam\" Knight is now the third back the team has lost for the year due to injury, so Michael Carter will be Arizona's lead back on Sunday. \nThe Falcons are favored at -3. The total sits at 48.5.Raiders at Texans (4:25 p.m. ET)LV QB Geno Smith (shoulder, will play)HOU RB Woody Marks (ankle, out) HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, available)\nThe Raiders will get their starting quarterback back for this tough matchup with Houston as Geno Smith returns after missing last week's loss. The Texans' backfield will have a new leader, as Marks is out but Chubb is in. Jawhar Jordan is expected to have a big role after rushing for 101 yards on 15 carries against Arizona.Houston is a 14.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.Steelers at Lions (4:25 p.m. ET)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)DET OL Taylor Decker (available) and Graham Glasnow (out)\nThis is a big one for both sides, with the Steelers holding a slim one-game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North race while Detroit is trying to keep pace in the NFC wild card picture. The Steelers will again be without star edge rusher T.J. Watt after he had surgery to repair a collapsed lung last week. The Lions have listed two of their five starting offensive linemen as questionable. The Lions are favored by seven points. The total is 52.5.Patriots at Ravens (8:20 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nSunday Night Football is a big one for the AFC playoff picture with the Ravens hosting the Patriots. New England fell to Buffalo last week and at 11-3 leads the AFC East but is behind Denver in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Ravens are 7-7 and are a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North race and desperately need a win to keep pace. The Pats can clinch a postseason berth with a win or if either Houston or Indianapolis lose this week. \nThe Ravens are -3 on the spread with the total set at 49.5.49ers at Colts (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, TBD)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, TBD)IND WR Alec Pierce (Achilles, TBD)\nFinal reports for Monday Night Football will come out on Saturday, but the three injuries worth watching are all in the passing game. Ricky Pearsall remains banged up and could be in danger of missing Monday's game for the 49ers, while the Colts are hoping for good news on top cornerback Sauce Gardner and deep-threat receiver Alec Pierce. The 49ers are favored by 5.5. The total is 46.5.\n            ",

Heading into Monday, there have been 15 games played and NINE of them have been decided by six points or less. The Seahawks pulled off a wild overtime win on Thursday and that was followed by an equally crazy overtime win by the Bears on Saturday. And then on Sunday, we saw several games go down to the wire, including Carolina's huge 23-20 victory over the Buccaneers in an NFC South showdown. The Steelers also pulled off a huge upset on the road with a 29-24 win over the Lions. In the Sunday night game, the Patriots overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to top the Ravens, 28-24. \nWe've got grades for those five games and every other contest in Week 16, so let's get to them, starting with New England's impressive win. New England 28-24 over BaltimoreCarolina 23-20 over Tampa BayPittsburgh 29-24 over DetroitJacksonville 34-20 over DenverHouston 23-21 over Las VegasAtlanta 26-19 over ArizonaL.A.

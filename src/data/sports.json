Tigres enter with a 1-0 lead in the two-legged affair thanks to Angel Correa's solo goal as he looks to push Tigres to their first title since 2023, when they won the Clausura. Here's everything to know about the huge match which you can watch live on CBS Sports Network.How to watch Toluca vs. Tigres, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Nemesio Diez -- Toluca, MexicoTV: CBS Sports Network Odds: Toluca -105; Draw +280; Tigres +250Correa's arrival in Mexico during the summer from Atletico Madrid has pushed Tigres to new heights while also turning around his own career. After being a rotational player in Spain, Correa joined ahead of the Club World Cup and hasn't looked back, scoring 15 goals and assisting four more in all competitions for Tigres. His eight goals during the regular season helped the team cope with injuries to Andre-Pierre Gignac, and now Tigres seem well placed for when the 40-year-old eventually decides to hang up his boots. But there are titles to win first, as Gignac, Correa, and Juan Brunetta will look to give the Toluca defense fits. But that doesn't mean that Toluca will go down easily. They come in atop the pile after earning the top seed in the playoffs while also looking to defend their Clausura 2025 trophy, where they took down Club America. Behind the hot scoring of Paulinho, Antonio Mohamed's Toluca side have become a tough-to-break-down outfit, and hosting this second leg, this will be a back-and-forth affair at the Estadio Nemesio Diez. Attackers may take the headlines, but these are also the teams that allowed the fewest goals in league play, with Tigres allowing 16 and Toluca allowing 18 in their 17 matches played. Goals could be hard to come by, but with it being the second leg in a final, things could open up if one side has to chase the match late.\nIn four of the last five finals, the second leg has seen at least two goals scored, and three of those saw three or more goals scored, so going by form, there will be goals despite the strength of these defenses. Only one team can win, and with only one goal separating them, it's anyone's guess who will win the Apertura final. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It was a little over three years ago when Joe Burrow threw a game-winning touchdown pass that clinched the Bengals' third straight win over the Chiefs. It was a much different experience on Sunday as Cincinnati was blanked, 24-0, by the Ravens in a loss that clinched a third straight non-playoff season for Burrow and Co. Despite the loss and his recent comments that led to questions about his future in Cincinnati, Burrow stated that he \"has a lot of confidence\" with the Bengals' front office. \"I know how hard people work at it, and we have the right people,\" Burrow said via a team transcript. \"It starts with players playing better, and today it was me.\"Burrow was asked point-blank if he still enjoys playing for the Bengals, which was in reference to his comments leading up to Sunday's game. \n\"My comments had nothing to do with Cincinnati,\" he said. \"They had everything to do with me and my mindset, and football.\"Burrow's comments about having confidence in the Bengals will likely be met with skepticism given the fact that Cincinnati is in the midst of a third straight season that has fallen well short of expectation. Since reaching a second consecutive AFC title game in 2022, the Bengals are just 22-26 that includes a 5-11 record in games that Burrow didn't start. Cincinnati started 2-0 this season before winning just one of its nine games while Burrow was sidelined with turf toe. At 4-10, the Bengals have been assured of their worst season since 2020, Burrow's rookie season.  \nUnderwhelming drafts, questionable roster decisions, tumultuous contract situations with key players, injuries to Burrow and other star players, and an historically bad defense have all played some level of role in Cincinnati going from being one the NFL's best teams to one of its worst in three short years. Like the Bengals, Burrow also continues to have a high level of confidence in his own ability following what he acknowledged was one of the worst games of his career. He dismissed a question about whether or not his game has fallen off at all over the last few years.  \"No, I feel very confident in how I play,\" he said. \"Obviously today, in my opinion, is an outlier. I think I've been consistently great for years and years and years.\"\nBurrow is right. While his past few games haven't been at his usual level, the former Heisman Trophy winner has proven to be one of the NFL's best quarterbacks. Last year, for example, he led the NFL in both passing yards and touchdown passes en route to winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time. \nInjuries, however, have largely hindered Burrow during his first six seasons. Cincinnati's struggles in terms of building a competitive roster around him over the last few years hasn't helped, either. In many ways, Sunday's game was a microcosm of Burrow and the Bengals' season. While Burrow was off, he received no help from his receiving corps, who dropped a handful of catchable passes. Ja'Marr Chase, specifically, was the culprit of a few drops that contributed to the Bengals staying off the scoreboard despite having four drives that got inside Baltimore's 35-yard-line. \nBurrow was also hounded all day by a Ravens pass rush that entered the game with just 18 sacks. Pressure largely contributed to Burrow's second interception: a pick-six that made it a 24-0 game. \nIronically, the Bengals actually received a solid game from their defense that included notable efforts from 2023 first-round pick Myles Murphy, third-year defensive back Jordan Battle and rookie Demetrius Knight Jr. The Bengals' offense, however, was unable to capitalize on the defense's performance. The reason is quite simple, at least from Burrow's perspective. \n\"Because we haven't been a good football team,\" he said. \"Bad football teams do losing things. If you're wanting to compete for championships and be in the playoffs, then number one, your quarterback needs to play better than I did today.\"Burrow was asked if he carries too much of a burden on a team that didn't have much success before him and has struggled to maintain its early success with him under center.  \"I want everything on my plate,\" he said. \"That's the position I want to be in. I feel confident in all those guys in the locker room. Like I said, there's not a team in the NFL that would've won the game today if I was the quarterback.\"\nWhile Burrow reaffirmed his allegiance to Cincinnati, it's clear -- based on how the last three seasons have gone -- that the Bengals need to make changes moving forward if they are going to take advantage of Burrow's remaining years under contract. Burrow also made it clear that he expects more out of himself regardless of the situation he and the Bengals find themselves in.  \"This is a team effort at the end of the day,\" he said. \"Players have to play better on the field. Today, it was me. I have to be better.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Hawks big man Kristaps Porziņģis is expected to be sidelined for the next two weeks as he undergoes further evaluation stemming from an illness he's been dealing with, per ESPN. Porziņģis has already missed six of the team's last seven games due to the illness, and while he's going to miss some more time, the Hawks want to prioritize the long-term of this season, rather than a few more missed games in December.This isn't the first time Porziņģis has dealt with a mysterious illness. During the 2025 NBA playoffs when he was still a member of the Boston Celtics, the Latvian big man struggled with lethargy, saying, \"The breathing wasn't good. I did everything I could potentially to feel as good as I could, but my engine wasn't running the way I wanted.\" He played through the postseason, but mustered only 25 total points in Boston second-round loss to the Knicks. In four of the six games, he played fewer than 15 minutes a night.Porziņģis was later diagnosed in the offseason with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is an autonomic disorder causing rapid heart rate, and dizziness when standing as blood in the body doesn't evenly distribute across the body. After the diagnosis, Porziņģis and his doctors found ways to manage his POTS, which includes things like a high salt diet. He was able to play for the Latvian national team at EuroBasket this past summer, where he averaged 20.2 points and 8.7 rebounds over six games.\nHowever, Porziņģis, 30, said in early December, after returning from missing four consecutive games to drop 25 points, that he doesn't believe what he's dealing with currently is related to POTS.\"No, I wouldn't say it's the same thing,\" Porziņģis said after the Hawks' loss to the Nuggets on Dec. 5. \"I just wasn't feeling too good, honestly. Just not being healthy healthy, you know? But I wouldn't say it's the same stuff from last season, so that's good.  \"I think I kind of put that behind me even this summer playing for the national team, but anyway, just catching whatever it's frustrating, you know? I want to be healthy. And I will be healthy.\"\nThe hope is that a resolution will come of Porziņģis' illness, because when he's healthy he's capable of getting you a double-double one most nights as a two-way big who can space the floor out to the 3-point line and provide high-level rim protection on defense.\n            ",

Dart was able to return a few plays later, but it prompted more questions about how the Giants and interim coach Mike Kafka are protecting their franchise quarterback.On a first-and-goal play, Dart tried to run for a touchdown when he was met by Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman, who make up a combined 639 pounds of defensive lineman. Dart left the field and took the well-trodden path to the blue injury tent.\nFortunately for the Giants, Dart was able to return for the fourth-down play, but the rookie quarterback has taken too many hits like that throughout the season. In November, Dart missed two games due to a concussion. Despite that -- and today's scare -- Kafka said the team won't change much about its offensive game plan.   \"We're not gonna change much in terms of how we play the game,\" Kafka said. \"I think just having the thought process for how we scheme it up. We had a couple opportunities where he's protected and he's got somebody in front of him. On that one particular play where he got out, that was a pass. I think there's not much you can do there. Of course we have his health, and everyone's health, in mind when we call plays.\"\nKafka added that Dart's mobility is one of his \"great strengths, and there's no denying that. Dart ran six times for 63 yards against the Commanders. It's just a matter of Dart recognizing when to protect himself.\"He knows,\" Kafka said. \"He's a smart football player. He knows when he needs to protect himself and when he needs to go make a play. I trust him to do that. That's probably the most important thing. The guys on the field trust him to do that.\"\nThe 2-12 Giants have three games remaining, and the team has been out of playoff contention for a while now. (New York does, however, at the moment, still own the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.) Keeping Dart healthy down the stretch should be a priority for New York, but it sounds like the team won't be holding him back on the ground.\n            \n    ",

Making things more complicated at this stage of the year is injuries, and there are quite a few notable ones for bettors to know for Week 15. Here's a breakdown of the most important injuries of Week 15, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. All times Eastern.Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, out)\nStar Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins is out this week with his second concussion of 2025, both of which have occurred over the last month. The Ravens need a win to try and keep pace with Pittsburgh for the division lead after dropping two games in a row to fall to 6-7.The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, while the total is very high at 51.5.Raiders at Eagles (1 p.m. ET)LV QB Geno Smith (right shoulder and back, out)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)\nKenny Pickett will be under center for the Raiders against his old team,as the former first-round pick will start in place of the injured Geno Smith, who's dealing with shoulder and back injuries. The Eagles will again be without star tackle Lane Johnson, which is bad news against Maxx Crosby. Vegas is a 12.5-point underdog here, with the total at just 38.5.Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m. ET)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, out)HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, out)\nMarvin Harrison Jr. headlines another lengthy injury list for the Cardinals, who have lost five in a row and are just 3-10 on the year. The Texans are on the opposite end of the spectrum, having won five in a row, but they are without veteran running back Nick Chubb against a lackluster Arizona defense.Houston is a 9.5-point favorite, and the total sits at 42.5.Chargers at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, out)KC WR Hollywood Brown (personal, out)KC OL Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor (out)\nThe Chargers aren't the only AFC West team with issues on the offensive line, as two Kansas City starters are out for this matchup on Sunday. The Chiefs will also be without veteran receiver Hollywood Brown in this must-win matchup, while the Chargers will be without receiver Quentin Johnston as he's dealing with a groin issue.Kansas City is a 6-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.Bills at Patriots (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nArguably the game of the week sees the Bills visit the Patriots in an AFC East clash. New England has won 10 in a row after a 1-2 start and is aiming to spoil the Bills' bid to win the division for the sixth year in a row. Buffalo is favored by 1.5, and the total is 49.5.Jets at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)NYJ QB Tyrod Taylor (groin, out)NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)\nA weird season for the Jets will be made even weirder this weekend with undrafted rookie Brady Cook starting at quarterback with both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields out. Cook completed 14 of his 30 attempts last week in relief of an injured Taylor, and he won't have reliable tight end Mason Taylor to throw to in this matchup with the AFC South-leading Jaguars.Jacksonville is favored by 13.5. The total is 41.5.Commanders at Giants (1 p.m. ET)WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out) WASH WR Deebo Samuel (illness, available)WASH RB Chris Rodriguez (groin, out)\nThe Commanders' offense is beat up with Jayden Daniels ruled out after returning last week only to get knocked out once again. Marcus Mariota will start, and he'll have Deebo Samuel to throw to as the veteran receiver is good to go. Washington won't have Chris Rodriguez Jr. in its running back rotation as he's out with a groin injury.The Giants are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 46.5.Browns at Bears (1 p.m. ET)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (calf and hand, out)CLE CB Denzel Ward (calf, out)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)\nCleveland will be down two weapons on offense with veteran tight end David Njoku and rookie running back Dylan Sampson both ruled out. Top cornerback Denzel Ward is also out for the Browns' elite defense. For Chicago, the Bears are still without receiver Rome Odunze.Chicago is favored by 7.5, and the total is 38.5.Panthers at Saints (4:25 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)\nThe main injury here is that the Saints will be without top running back Alvin Kamara once again. The veteran is out with knee and ankle injuries in this divisional clash with the Panthers, who can take first place in the NFC South with a win thanks to Tampa Bay's loss on Thursday.Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.Lions at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)DET S Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph (out)LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, available)\nThis massive NFC clash sees the Lions again dealing with major injuries on defense, and that's especially true in the secondary as both of the team's starting safeties are out. The Rams expected Davante Adams to play, and he's officially been listed as active for the game.The Rams are 6-point favorites while the total is the highest of the Week 15 slate at 54.5.Colts at Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)IND QB Riley Leonard (knee, will be active)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)\nThe big story here is who will start at quarterback for the Colts. Daniel Jones tore his Achilles last week and is out for the year, so Indianapolis signed Philip Rivers, who last played in 2020, to the practice squad. Rookie Riley Leonard played in place of Jones last week and also suffered an injury, but he'll be active in Seattle. Whether he starts is another question altogether. Defensively, the Colts will be down star cornerback Sauce Gardner against the Seahawks' high-flying offense.The Seahawks are 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.Packers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee, available)\nThe Packers and Broncos square off in what very well could be a Super Bowl preview on Sunday, and Green Bay is going to have its top running back on the field as Josh Jacobs is good to go.Denver is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 42.5.Titans at 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)SF RB Christian McCaffrey (back, available)\nStar 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury ahead of Sunday's matchup with Tennessee. However, he was expected to play and has indeed been listed as active for the game.San Francisco is favored by 12.5 while the total sits at 44.5.Vikings at Cowboys (8:20 p.m. ET)DAL TE Jake Ferguson (calf, questionable)\nIt looks like Dallas' offense will be at full strength, which wasn't a certainty entering the week. Star receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol and will suit up this week, while tight end Jake Ferguson is expecting to play on Sunday despite being listed as questionable.Dallas is favored by 5.5 points. The total is 48.5.Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)\nStar Pittsburgh edge rusher T.J. Watt won't suit up this week after he suffered a collapsed lung that required surgery after a dry needling treatment. It's unclear if or when Watt will return this season for the AFC North-leading Steelers.The Steelers are 3-point favorites at home. The total is 42.5. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- As the Premier League approaches the turn, here was a win to typify Manchester City's title challenge so far. The scoreline alone would be enough to convince you that Pep Guardiola's side are motoring once more, hitting their best form when it matters most in customary fashion. For the sixth time in their last seven Premier League games, City ran in three goals. One of the hardest away assignments England might offer this season has been successfully navigated.The headline story of this game is encouraging in the extreme. And that is perhaps the most favorable way to assess City. For once, Guardiola has built a team that sneers at nuance, one that demands they are assessed in cliched fashion. They've got the best striker in the league, mate. They just win, and that's what matters most. They know what's required at this stage of the season. They will figure it out, they always do.Here's the thing, though. There might well be plenty of figuring out to do. It is hard to know for sure. After all, the table will attest that Crystal Palace are one of the toughest opponents the Premier League has to offer. You could tell. Until Phil Foden broke their resolve with 20 minutes to play, Oliver Glasner's FA Cup winners had by far the better of the chances. Better finishing by Yeremy Pino before Erling Haaland's opener and this might have been a rerun of that famous afternoon in Wembley. \"There are still many things we have to improve,\" acknowledged Guardiola. \"The Real Madrid win gave me a lot of signals that we are not ready, not in terms of mentality but how we approach certain games ... To make 3-0 here is a good statement for us.\"\nThe immediate statement is as impressive as it gets. It's when you interrogate it a bit further that the questions come. City ended this game with a Haaland penalty padding out the goals and shots statistics. Even so, they gave up 16 shots to the seven they took on Dean Henderson's goal. Include the penalty in the expected goals (xG) calculations, and you still end up with their chances as the inferior ones, 2.08 to 1.18. Scrub that third goal out of the equation, and in attacking terms, that is a yikes performance. So is the 33 penalty box touches they allowed to the 12 they registered. And yes, the only statistic that matters is the one at the top of the scoresheet. There are those cliches again, utterly disinterested in which of those numbers is more predictive of future results, in the fact that City are allowing nearly 70% more non-penalty xG per game than Arsenal, that there is a sizeable wedge in xG difference between the two.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            At least future points will not have to be gained against a side like Glasner's. A great deal of allowance has to be allowed for the excellence of Palace in the first 70 minutes. In all bar one moment, their defense dealt powerfully with Haaland, using their surfeit of center backs to ensure he could rarely receive the ball without two red and blue shirts crashing into him. This is a team that frequently looks able to transition with their eyes closed. Their sprayed passes from deep make the pitch as wide as possible, opening lines that Adam Wharton could easily slide the ball through.Palace understood how best to exploit Manchester City's possession, hitting swift, high balls into the space behind their backline, drawing fruit time and time again. Here again is where the challenge of really assessing Guardiola's team comes in. Did those difficulties stem from the fact there is maybe only one striker -- the one at the other end of the pitch -- more adept than Jean-Philippe Mateta at causing chaos chasing balls over the top? Would players other than Wharton be able to land those passes in just the right spot? City have always gambled with the space behind their backline and few opponents are as well and Palace are particularly well-placed to exploit that.\nMaybe the City of old were better placed to mitigate against those vulnerabilities. Certainly, their best midfields wouldn't have allowed Daichi Kamada to breeze through them as easily as he did at Selhurst Park. That is perhaps the most compelling counter to the argument that this team will get better in the months ahead. If prime Rodri is walking back through that door, it probably isn't this season.What can happen is that the younger players who aren't used to carrying the burden of a title charge grow into it, in much the same way as their predecessors did. Take Foden, who struggled to impact the game before a low drive of customary excellence that killed the game. Guardiola sees room for him to grow. In recent weeks, he has been at pains to point out the relative youth of this title contender, the churn off the field that goes some way to explaining why this team has gravitated towards a form of Haaland heliocentrism. His young stars are still learning and still improving.\"Phil today, I think differently [to others],\" Guardiola said. \"He was not at his best. He lost a lot of balls. He was so rushed in decisions, so anxious. He has to play, to keep the ball, to be associated with the other [players] and in the right moment make this explosion that only he has. Before then, he has to be more calm.\"\nAnd despite the fact that Foden and so many others aren't what his manager believes they might be, City are still there. Yes, it is that cliche that they're going to improve again, but this time with at least something substantial to back it up. The reason that rivals will fear City just going click is that it has before in seemingly trying positions, like when Guardiola dreamed up a defense of four center backs and locked down his side's status as Europe's finest.\"We've been playing without the best player in the world [Rodri] for a year and a half,\" said Guardiola. \"Despite that, we are there. We are close. This is what I like. \"I have the feeling that we are getting better. This is what we want to feel. Today was 3-0 but Sunderland, you know, the season they're doing, we won 3-0 [too]. We were good against Sunderland for 95 minutes. I cannot expect to come here and not [allow] chances, not lose the ball in transition. It's the FA Cup winners. It's a top four, top five team, an exceptional team. I cannot expect [the Sunderland game] from them.\n\"But how we approach, how aggressive we were in the high pressing, how good we were defending in the box, how good we were in many, many things we've done, that makes me so happy.\"Perhaps that is what matters most of all. The data can see signs of worry for City, at least in comparison to the aggregate iteration of league leaders Arsenal. Guardiola can see cause for optimism. Who are you backing?\n            ",

However, multiple reports indicated that the second-year pass-catcher was going to suit up. He is officially active, but will not play after re-injuring that foot in pregame warmups. The former No. 9 overall pick out of Washington leads the Bears with 661 yards receiving and six touchdowns on 44 catches in 12 games played. Odunze already doubled his touchdown total from his rookie campaign.\nWith Odunze out, more work could go to rookie wideout Luther Burden III. The second-round pick out of Missouri has been targeted a career-high six times in each of the last two games, and racked up 67 yards receiving during last week's loss to the Green Bay Packers. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday Night Football in Week 15 in a pivotal matchup for Dallas to keep its postseason hopes alive. The Cowboys are 6-6-1 on the season, but 3-1 over their last four games with victories over both Super Bowl qualifiers (Eagles and Chiefs) from last season. CeeDee Lamb suffered a scary-looking concussion last Thursday, but the additional time off between games allowed him time to recover and clear the concussion protocol. The elite Cowboys WR1 is a full-go for SNF, and with that, the SportsLine model views Lamb as a top option for Week 15 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown scorers bets when online sports betting.The model also has another Dallas wide receiver, George Pickens, featured in its Week 15 Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer bets, along with Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison showcasing value at Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer odds. Before making any Cowboys vs. Vikings picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at sportsbooks, be sure to see the Week 15 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest NFL odds. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 15 on a 50-35 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has revealed its top Vikings vs. Cowboys anytime TD scorer prop picks for Sunday Night Football: Best Week 15 Cowboys vs. Vikings anytime TD prop picks:CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (+115)George Pickens, Cowboys (+115)Jordan Addison, Vikings (+195)\nCeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (+115)Lamb had six receptions for 121 yards on eight targets despite playing just 46% of snaps last week, as he had to leave the game early with a concussion. But Lamb has cleared the concussion protocol and will be back for a Cowboys team that likely needs to win each of its final four games to have a chance at making the playoffs. Lamb has more than 110 receiving yards in back-to-back contests, including a touchdown two weeks ago, and he has scored in two of his last four games. Lamb continues to be the clear No. 1 option in the offense, averaging 9.5 targets per game over his last six games, and with that volume, he's always a threat for a touchdown.\nGeorge Pickens, Cowboys (+115)Pickens' name has been dragged through the mud a bit this week, with some questioning his dedication on certain routes last week, which played a role in Dallas' 44-30 loss to the Lions on Thursday Night Football. But Pickens has been one of the most reliable receivers in the league the majority of the season, ranking seventh in receptions (78), third in yards (1,179) and tied for fifth in receiving touchdowns (eight). He has at least nine targets in six straight games, as Dak Prescott has shown complete faith in him when Lamb is drawing double teams or additional defensive attention. The Cowboys could look to get Pickens back on track early to silence the noise around last week, and the model projects him to score in more than 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds for a Sunday Night Football touchdown.\nJordan Addison, Vikings (+195)The Vikings' offense has been a disaster for the majority of recent weeks, however, last week was not one of those games. Minnesota scored 31 points against the Commanders, including J.J. McCarthy throwing a career-high three touchdowns after passing for six scores in his first six games of the year. The Vikings are out of the postseason chase, so the team's main priority the remainder of the season should be evaluating if McCarthy is the quarterback of the future. The best way to figure that out is to allow him to throw -- and throw often. Justin Jefferson will receive the majority of Dallas' improved defense's attention, which should create TD opportunities for Addison. The model's simulations have Addison as the Vikings' most likely touchdown scorer on Sunday Night Football.\nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Vikings vs. Cowboys in Week 15 Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\n        Week 15 lived up to the hype. Leading up to the slate, it was poised to be one of, if not the, defining weekend of the 2025 regular season. As the action unfolded, we started to see the playoff picture come into focus, particularly with teams that will not be vying for a Lombardi Trophy this winter. Most notably, the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were officially eliminated from playoff contention, meaning neither Patrick Mahomes nor Joe Burrow will be a factor in the AFC. That's good news for Josh Allen, who helped the Buffalo Bills rally from a 21-point deficit against the New England Patriots to keep his team's hopes of leaping into first place in the AFC East alive. Naturally, there are numerous takeaways from the pandemonium that Week 15 produced. But which of those takeaways are something that will have legs for the final three weeks, and which are merely an overreaction? Below, we'll determine just that by taking a look at some of the notable storylines from Week 15 and figure out which we should take seriously and which we should chalk up as a mere overreaction. Josh Allen has played himself into the MVP conversationOverreaction vs. reality: RealityJosh Allen was sensational in Week 15. The Bills QB kept his team's hopes of winning the division alive by rallying from a 21-point deficit over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. Allen led a second-half rally that saw Buffalo outscore New England 28-7, and the defending NFL MVP led five straight touchdown drives in the process. Allen finished the day throwing for three touchdowns to go with his 193 yards through the air and a 123.1 passer rating. \nThis was the third time this season that the Bills rallied from a deficit of 10 or more points, and the second in as many weeks. Not only does this latest comeback win keep Buffalo in range of the AFC East crown, but it should also thrust him into the MVP conversation with Drake Maye (who he just defeated) and Matthew Stafford. Allen just notched his third season with at least 25 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns, which is the most in NFL history. If he gets Buffalo back atop the division, there's a strong case for a back-to-back MVP.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Bills alive in AFC East, Chiefs eliminated, Broncos and Rams clinch\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEagles have fixed their issues on offenseOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionPhiladelphia looked like a well-oiled machine during Sunday's 31-0 win over the Raiders. Jalen Hurts completed 12 of his 15 passes for 175 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 39 yards on the ground. This was Hurts' first game with three or more passing touchdowns since Week 8, and he had just four passing touchdowns over his last five games combined. Meanwhile, the Eagles averaged 5.9 yards per play and converted 10 of their 13 third-down situations in the win. While this was encouraging for the offense, I wouldn't exhale fully if I were Philly. The Las Vegas Raiders are arguably the worst team in the NFL, and have struggled mightily in the secondary. Had the Eagles not had their way with them through the air in Week 15, it would've been a five-alarm fire. Simply put, they did what they were supposed to do and snapped a three-game losing skid in the process. Lucky for them, they get another easy matchup next week against a poor Commanders pass defense, so the good times should continue to roll. Have they actually fixed their issues, though? That remains to be seen. \nZac Taylor coached his last meaningful game for BengalsOverreaction vs. reality: RealityJoe Burrow made headlines this week when he made ominous comments about his playing future. However, I think more eyes should be on his coach. After a shutout loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati is officially eliminated from playoff contention, which should make the seat under Zac Taylor hotter than the surface of the sun. While he may not get the boot in the immediate aftermath of this contest, I believe he coached his last meaningful game for Cincinnati in Week 15, with the club potentially looking for new leadership once the regular season officially concludes. When you pair Burrow's comments with the lackluster effort we saw unfold in Week 15, this feels like an organization that has no one to inspire, which falls on the shoulders of Taylor. Jaguars are the best team in the AFC SouthOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThe Jaguars just notched their fifth straight win and is 10-4 on the season, which keeps them in first place in the AFC South. While the Jags are the No. 3 seed in the conference, I still have a hard time thinking they are the best in their own division, let alone one of the top clubs in the AFC. Trevor Lawrence was spectacular in Week 15, throwing for five touchdowns and adding a rushing score.\nAs impressive as it was, we have to point out that it came against the lowly New York Jets, and this current winning streak hasn't seen them beat a ton of powerbrokers in the NFL (Chargers, Cardinals, Titans, Colts, Jets). Next week's game at Denver will be a better barometer as to who this team actually is, and how we should view it in the overall playoff picture in the AFC. I think if you gave every playoff team in the AFC some truth serum, each would confess rather playing Jacksonville than Houston at the moment.  Shedeur Sanders played his way out as Browns QB of the futureOverreaction vs. reality: RealityIt was a memorable day for Shedeur Sanders for all the wrong reasons. The Browns quarterback struggled mightily in a 31-3 loss to the Chicago Bears, completing just 51.4% of his passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. Those turnovers should be Cleveland's biggest concern as the Browns continue to evaluate the rookie as a potential franchise quarterback. \nSanders had just two interceptions over his first three career starts, so to see the floor fall out from under him here may be the first domino that takes him out of consideration as the QB of the future. Certainly, Sanders didn't do himself any favors in convincing the Browns to steer clear of drafting a young signal-caller.  \nSeattle is fools' gold after nearly losing to Philip RiversOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThe Seahawks were nearly the butt of the joke throughout the NFL, had they not pulled off a last-minute comeback to avoid being upset by the Colts. Specifically, it would've been a horrendous look for a team earmarked for the playoffs to lose to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hadn't played an NFL game for 1,800 days. Naturally, allowing Rivers to run somewhat efficiently has folks wondering if we're viewing Seattle all wrong. Are they really as big a threat as their 11-3 record indicates? Or are they merely fools' gold, and this outing against Rivers was a glimmer of their fraudulence? With a massive showdown with the Rams on deck for Thursday, I think Seattle was simply caught sleeping a bit in this game and looking ahead to that matchup. Its strong play defensively and an offense centered around Jaxson Smith-Njigba is enough to make them dangerous in the playoffs, even if it didn't quite look like it on Sunday. Micah Parsons' injury dashes Packers' Super Bowl hopesOverreaction vs. reality: RealityWeek 15 couldn't have gone worse for the Packers. Coming into the day, they were the No. 2 seed in the conference and in first place in the NFC North. However, after losing to the Broncos, they've fallen all the way to the No. 7 seed, with the Bears leaping back ahead of them. To make matters even more dire, star pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss with what is reportedly feared to be a torn ACL. \nIf/when that injury is confirmed, Parsons' absence this season could also result in the end of Green Bay's Super Bowl hopes. Parsons was the straw that stirred the drink of their defense and led the unit with 12.5 sacks on the season. With him out of the picture, it completely changes how opposing teams game plan against them and dramatically lowers the ceiling of the defense. With a pivotal game against the Bears next week, his absence will be felt almost instantly. \n            ",

However, Dak Prescott is pretty well-equipped to handle all the pressures that Brian Flores will be trying to throw at him in this game. The Dallas quarterback ranks first in the NFL in pressured completion percentage (62.5%) and fourth in blitzed completion percentage (70.3%). The model predicts that he throws a couple of touchdown passes on average and that the Cowboys cover in 61% of simulations.Over 47.5 pointsWith the No. 3 scoring offense and second-worst scoring defense in the NFL, Cowboys games have been a gold mine for Over bettors. The Over has hit in eight of the last 10 Dallas games and nine of its 13 contests overall. Meanwhile, J.J. McCarthy just had his first career three-touchdown game last week in the win over Washington and Minnesota posted its second-highest rushing total (162 yards) of the year. The model predicts 50 combined points on average and that the Over hits in 53% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        Week 15 is one of those weeks you long for in the summer months when football is still a ways away. The NFL has a jam-packed slate this weekend, filled to the brim with high-stakes matchups. On top of the sheer amount of fantastic games, playoff implications are on the line no matter which way you look. Some clinching scenarios for Week 15 include the New England Patriots potentially clinching the AFC East if they beat the Buffalo Bills, while both the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Broncos can secure their postseason spots with wins. All that makes it a wonderful weekend to sit back, relax and bet on the NFL. As we do every week throughout the season, we've collected all of the best picks and gambling content from CBS Sports and SportsLine and put them in one convenient place, so you can get picks against the spread from our CBS Sports experts as well as additional feature content for each game, including plays from top SportsLine experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, best bets from our staff, survivor picks and more.

The Saints beat the Panthers in Week 10, but this Panthers team has been playing much better football lately. Saints quarterback Tyler Shough is playing well and the New Orleans defense can keep them in this one. Saints win it in an upset.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has New Orleans upsetting Carolina at home.

What Denver does well is attacking the quarterback while protecting its own, ranking No. 1 in the league in sacks (55) this season, as well as being tied for the fewest sacks allowed (17). If Bo Nix has a clean pocket while Jordan Love is under constant pressure, that could open the door for an upset.

The passing game has seemingly gotten on track over the last few weeks, and we know what they can do defensively. The Broncos can reach as high a ceiling defensively as any team in the NFL, but they also have a low floor offensively, and I'm not as confident in Bo Nix against the Green Bay pass rush as I am in Jordan Love against Denver's.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jared Dubin on why he likes Green Bay to win on the road, 23-20.

Remember when the Vikings went and upset the Lions in Week 9? Everyone thought Minnesota had turned a corner. Then, the Vikings lost four straight with horrific quarterback play. While the Cowboys lost to the Lions in Week 14, they had a mini bye to rest, and are surely rejuvenated by the rival Eagles' overtime loss to the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football.\" To put it simply, Dak Prescott is going to out-score J.J. McCarthy. \" -- CBS Sports' Jordan Dajani on why the Cowboys will win and cover over the Vikings.

Let R.J. White be of assistance. The SportsLine expert has been on a tear when it comes to betting games involving the Pittsburgh Steelers, owning a 37-20-1 record over his last 58 picks. We can tell you White is leaning Under the 42-point total, but to see his official play for this game, head over to SportsLine.Dolphins +3: \"The Dolphins' high-powered rushing attack will now get to face a Steelers defense that has given up more than 200 yards rushing in two straight games. In Week 13, the Bills kept running the same play against the Steelers because it kept working. If Mike McDaniel can find a running play that works, I could see him running it 60 straight times. De'Von Achane is going to be the x-factor here. He got banged up with a rib injury against the Jets in Week 14 and if he can't play, that will be a huge hit for Miami, but for now, I'm going to say the Dolphins finally do the impossible and win a cold-weather game.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer John Breech on why he likes Miami to pull off the 19-16 upset over the Steelers.

Lake Mary trailed Vero Beach with just a few seconds left on the clock when it connected on a Hail Mary -- in a monsoon no less -- to win the title.With eight seconds left in the fourth quarter, Lake Mary trailed 27-12 when quarterback Noah Grubbs dropped back for one final heave. Grubbs, a three-star Notre Dame signee and the No. 31 quarterback in the 2026 recruiting cycle, connected with receiver Barrett Schulz downfield.The only problem was that Schulz, a three-star FIU signee playing in his future home stadium, was several yards short of the end zone. As he fought off several Vero Beach tacklers, Schulz turned and handed the ball off to teammate Tavarius Brundidge Jr., who found paydirt for the game-winning touchdown.\nThe exchange between Schulz and Brundidge looked close to being an illegal forward pass. Asked about that after the game, Vero Beach coach Lenny Jankowski said his team was the victim of a freak play.\"Yeah, there's a lot of things. I mean, the kid had gone out of bounds and came back in. Hats off. It was an incredible play to keep it alive. It's a freakish thing, and unfortunately we came up on the short end of it.\"\nThat play wasn't the only miraculous aspect of this win for Lake Mary, which captured its first state championship in school history. The Rams trailed 21-3 at halftime, and they were in position to win the game at the end because Vero Beach took an intentional safety with 12 seconds left.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe Houston Texans survived a slow start to the year offensively to finish the regular season 12-5 and make the postseason as the No. 5 seed in the AFC, thanks in large part to having the NFL's best defense. The Pittsburgh Steelers also survived the regular season, avoiding losing the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens thanks to a wild Week 18 finish to go 10-7 and host this NFL Super Wild Card Weekend matchup. Pittsburgh's offense has been an issue at times this year, but that unit gets an upgrade from previous weeks with star receiver DK Metcalf back after a two-game suspension.Kickoff from Acrisure Stadium is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 12.

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles will not be repeating as Super Bowl champions this year, as they suffered a 23-19 loss to Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in the wild card round of the NFL playoffs. Jalen Hurts had a chance to lead a game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, but couldn't move the chains on a fourth-and-11 at the 49ers' 21-yard line. Wide receiver A.J. Brown was a major storyline in this matchup, as he caught three of seven targets for just 25 yards and did not make a catch in the final three quarters. Brown also had a couple of uncharacteristic drops and had to be separated from coach Nick Sirianni late in the first half following one of those drops on a third down. Check out what happened:\nAt the halftime break, Sirianni told sideline reporter Erin Andrews, \"Emotions, they run high especially in the playoffs.\" After the game, Sirianni told reporters that he ran down the sideline towards Brown in an attempt to get him off the field since they were about to punt the ball away. This was also hypothesized by NFL Media's Mike Garafolo. \"I love A.J., I think he knows how I feel about him,\" Sirianni said after the game. \"I have a special relationship with him. We've probably went through every emotion you can possibly have together. We've laughed together, we've cried together, we've yelled at each other, we're both emotional.\"\nWhile Sirianni spoke to reporters following the conclusion of Philly's season, Brown did not. Brown hugged his teammates in the locker room and then left without taking questions, per the Philly Voice.What happened Sunday very well could have rubbed the Eagles' fan base the wrong way. Brown has been critical of Philly's offense multiple times this year, and then did not produce with the season on the line.\nIn November, Brown said on a live stream that he had been struggling and joked that fantasy football players should drop him. When streamer jankyrondo asked Brown how he was, he said this:\n\"No. Where have you been?\" Brown replied with a laugh. \"Family's good. Everything else? No. It's a shit show. You on some 'How you been?' I've been struggling, brother.\"  What's more, Brown did not back down from those comments when asked about them in the locker room the very next day.\"I think that's fair. I think if you've got eyes, you can see that,\" Brown said. \"The same things I've been saying all season. So me making light of my situation on Twitch with my friend, that's something I'm not apologizing for, you know? Because like I said, if you've got eyes, you can see that. Shoot, that's me trying to laugh through my situation.\"\nBrown maintained that the source of his frustration was not about targets, but about the efficiency of the unit at large.\"I think if we're really focused on winning and doing our job, we can't just keep slapping a Band-Aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble,\" Brown said. \"At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense? We're so great, and that's what I'm getting at. It's not about I don't care about winning or all I care about is stats. No. It's been week after week -- sometimes we're not doing our job on offense. So you can't just keep slapping a Band-Aid over that and expect to win late in the year -- it's not going to happen.\"Last year, what it was, thank you for the ring, but it's a new season. They adapted. We have to adapt and continue to get better and try to find new ways. That's where the frustration comes in. It's not about winning, you guys. I want to win, yes. I want to help contribute as well, do our thing on offense as well. I think that's fair.\"\nIn 15 regular-season games this year, Brown caught 78 passes for 1,003 yards and seven touchdowns. He has topped 1,000 receiving yards in all four of his seasons with the Eagles, but this year's 1,003 marked his lowest total in Philadelphia. Brown got his fair share of targets Sunday but did not capitalize.\n            ",

Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard touchdown pass with just 38 seconds left to lead the Rams to a 34-31 comeback win over the Panthers. In the second game, the Bears stormed back from an 18-point halftime deficit to stun the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard scoring pass with just under two minutes left to play for the game-winning score. The win for the Bears was the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. It was also the third-largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL playoff history. After a wild opening day, the drama continued on Sunday with the Bills pulling off a 27-24 win over the Jaguars in a game that saw four lead changes in the fourth quarter. The Bills will now head to the divisional round for the sixth straight year. In the second game on Sunday, there was more madness with the 49ers pulling off the biggest upset of the opening round with a 23-19 win over the Eagles. With San Francisco's win, that ends Philadelphia's bid to become the NFC's first repeat Super Bowl champ in more than 30 years. It also means that the NFC West is now just the second division over the past 25 years to send three teams to the divisional round. The 49ers will be joining the Rams and Seahawks. The nightcap on Sunday was the only game that didn't really have any drama with the Patriots rolling to a 16-3 win over the Chargers. With New England's win, seven of the eight spots in the divisional round have now been filled. The last spot will go to the winner of Monday's game between the Texans and Steelers. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule, including the dates for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) Packers\nPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more.

Aaron Rodgers will be making his 22nd career playoff start on Monday, and he'll have the experience advantage even though C.J. Stroud has quickly piled up postseason reps (this is his fifth start in only his third season). DK Metcalf is back from suspension and T.J. Watt is healthy at the right time, which are big reasons why the model says that the Steelers cover in 53% of simulations. Bet on the Steelers at FanDuel, where new users get $300 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Over 38.5 pointsThe Texans ranked second in the NFL in scoring defense and first in total defense this season, and Rodgers isn't as menacing at 42 as he was even four years ago when he ripped off back-to-back NFL MVPs. However, the Steelers have still managed to score 25 points or more in nine of their last 12 games, and the Houston offense has also produced 36 points or more on four occasions this season. If this game opens up even a little bit, this number could be in the rear-view in a hurry, and the model predicts that the Over hits in 55% of simulations. Bet the Over at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get your first bet up to $250 in bonus bets, whether it wins or loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\nThe penultimate game of Wild Card Weekend comes on 'Sunday Night Football' as the New England Patriots host the Los Angeles Chargers at 8:15 p.m. ET. The Patriots are 3.5-point favorites at DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under is 45.5, matching the second highest total on the board for the first round of the 2026 NFL playoffs. The kickoff temperature is expected to hover around freezing, so that'll be a factor when crafting NFL DFS strategy for any showdown slates on sites like DraftKings or FanDuel.Chargers running back Omarion Hampton (ankle) is active after missing Week 18 and being listed as questionable for 'SNF'.

His rushing production increased as well as he piled up 450 yards and four scores on the ground.

His season-long numbers are down compared to last year, but he's still shown big-play ability recently, making a catch of at least 25 yards in each of his past two games. He's also scored six times in the past 12 games, showing that he has around a coin flip's chance to find the end zone in this playoff matchup. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet McConkey to go Over 3.5 receptions at DraftKings:\nHow to set Chargers vs. Patriots DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        George Kittle was carted off the field during the second quarter of the San Francisco 49ers' NFC wild card playoff game win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Kittle was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game, and after the contest it was confirmed that he had torn his right Achilles after a catch. While an Achilles tear can sometimes take up to a year to recover from, future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers returned to the practice field less than four months after sustaining the injury during the first week of the 2023 regular season. Given the time of Kittle's injury, the likely expectation is that he will work towards being available for the 49ers' first regular season game of the 2026 season. The injury occurred after Kittle caught a six-yard pass with about six minutes to play before halftime. Cameras showed Kittle not putting any weight on his right leg after getting out of the cart and into the 49ers' locker room. He clapped as he was being carted off the field, perhaps in an effort to motivate his teammates. The Eagles had a 13-10 lead at the time of Kittle's injury. Despite his absence, the 49ers posted a 23-19 upset win over the defending Super Bowl champions. San Francisco will now face the division rival Seattle Seahawks next weekend in the NFC divisional round. \nKittle had just one reception prior to leaving Sunday's game. San Francisco's offense was led in the first half by wideout Demarcus Robinson, who caught three passes for 66 yards that included a two-yard touchdown pass. Wideout Jauan Jennings came up with a 45-yard catch that set up a field goal. \nRobinson finished the night with a game-high 111 yards receiving. The 49ers received a big second half from Pro Bowl running back Christian McCaffrey, who scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter that included the game-winning score with just under three minutes left. While the 49ers found a win to beat the Eagles, Kittle's absence will be a critical loss moving forward for a 49ers team that has been no stranger this season when it comes to significant injuries. San Francisco went into the playoffs without linebacker Fred Warner, pass rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, and wideouts Ricky Pearsall and Brandon Aiyuk. Now, they'll have to press on without one of the best tight ends of this era. \nDespite missing six games this season due to injuries, Kittle continued to play at a high level while being named to his seventh Pro Bowl. He caught 45 passes during his final seven regular-season games that included seven catches for 115 yards and a score during the 49ers' Week 16 win over the Colts. He caught eight passes for 88 yards and a score the previous week in a win over the Titans. \nAs alluded to above, the 49ers have overcome injuries all season. They'll have to do it again next week if they are going to upset the NFC's top-seeded team. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been a historical year for the NFC West and after an impressive regular season, the division is now making some serious noise in the playoffs. With the Rams and 49ers both winning on Wild Card Weekend, that means the NFC West will now be sending three teams to the divisional round this year. San Francisco and Los Angeles will be joined by the Seattle Seahawks, who earned a bye to the divisional round as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. This marks just the second time over the past 25 years, and fourth time ever, that one division has sent three teams to the divisional round. The last time it happened came back in 2022 when the NFC East sent the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles to the divisional. Before that, no team had sent three teams to the divisional round since 1997. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from wild card to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf the three previous divisions that have sent three teams to the divisional round, only one of them produced a Super Bowl champion. Let's take a look: \nDivisionTeamsWin Super Bowl?1992 NFC East(2) Cowboys, (5) Eagles, (6) WashingtonYes (Cowboys beat Bills in Super Bowl)1997 NFC Central(2) Packers, (4) Buccaneers, (6) VikingsNo (Packers lost in Super Bowl)2022 NFC East(1) Eagles, (5) Cowboys, (6) GiantsNo (Eagles lose in Super Bowl)As you can see, every division that has put three teams in the divisional round has ended up sending a team to the Super Bowl, but the 1992 NFC East was the only one to produce a Super Bowl winner. It's also worth noting that none of the three previous divisions even sent two teams to the conference title game, so if the NFC West can pull that off, the division will once again make history. The NFC West will definitely be sending at least one team to the NFC Championship game and that's because the 49ers and Seahawks will be playing each other in the divisional round. It will mark the third meeting this year between the division rivals: The 49ers won 17-13 back in Week 1, but the Seahawks won the big one in Week 18, clinching the No. 1 overall seed with a 13-3 win over San Francisco. The Seahawks opened as a 6.5-point favorite over the sixth-seeded 49ers. As for the Rams, they'll be traveling to Chicago to face the Bears with a trip to the NFC title game on the line. The fifth-seeded Rams were able to sneak out of the wild card round after beating the Panthers 34-31 thanks to a late touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford. The Rams have opened as a 4.5-point favorite, which is somewhat notable, because teams tend to struggle in that spot. This game will mark just the 11th time over the past 50 years that a road team has been favored by four points or more in a playoff game and the favored team has gone 0-10 against the spread and just 4-6 straight-up, according to Pro Football Reference. If the Rams win, we'll be guaranteed an all NFC West conference title game. \nThe NFC West has been making history all year. The Seahawks (14-3), Rams (12-5) and 49ers (12-5) all won at least 12 games, marking the first time in NFL history that a single division has produced three teams that won at least 12 games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Charlotte Hornets handed out a demoralizing 150-95 beatdown to the Utah Jazz Saturday night, which even if there weren't NFL playoff games going on still probably wouldn't garnered a ton of attention. Given both teams have losing records and likely will be headed back to the draft lottery again in the spring, there's not going to be a ton of interest in a matchup between these two squads.But the final score is enough to want to dig into things and ask, \"Wow, what happened?\" In short, the Hornets were just automatic on offense. They took 59 3s and and made 40% of them. They shot 52.5% from the floor over the entire game. It wasn't a case of a single player going off for a massive stat line, no every member of the Hornets who played -- which was literally every active player on the roster -- put up points. Nine players scored in double figures for the Hornets, with only one player, Tre Mann, eclipsing the 20-point mark. Meanwhile, the Jazz couldn't buy a bucket from beyond the arc, shooting an abysmal 22.6% from deep. And when you're trading 2s for 3s on the other end, things can get out of hand quickly.But the final score doesn't really do it justice for how jaw-dropping this win was for the Hornets. To give it even more context, second-year forward Cody Williams, who played 33 minutes for the Jazz, finished the game with a plus-minus of -60. For those unaware, plus-minus tells us how a team does when that specific player is on the floor. So a positive number signals that the team is outscoring their opponent by that much when that player is on the court, a negative number means their team is getting outscored by that amount. Williams played the most of any other player for Utah, so with him on the floor the Jazz were basically getting outscored by 60 points.With the final score being what it was, yep, that's pretty accurate. Williams' terrible feat makes it the worst single game plus-minus in NBA history, beating the previous record of -58, which was held by both Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Scoot Henderson. \nPlayerDate+/-Cody Williams (Utah Jazz)1/10/2026-60Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (New Orleans Pelicans)4/11/2025-58Scoot Henderson (Portland Trail Blazers)3/29/2024-58Manny Harris (Cleveland Cavaliers)1/11/2011-57Keion Brooks Jr. (New Orleans Pelicans)4/11/2025-56The NBA didn't start tracking play-by-play data until the 1996-97 season, so it certainly leaves room for there to be an even worse mark prior to that. But Williams now holds the new record in the play-by-play era, a record no player wants to hold.As bad as the Jazz played defensively, though, because there was no single player who took over on offense for the Hornets, there's no record setting plus-minus number on Charlotte's side. The highest plus-minus is from Moussa Diabate who had a +38 plus-minus. But that doesn't come close to the single game all-time record. That feat goes to Luc Mbah a Moute during the 2017-18 season, when he recorded a +57 plus-minus after playing 26 minutes and putting up 13 points, four rebounds and four steals. PlayerDate+/-Luc Mbah a Moute (Houston Rockets)11/22/2017+57Gary Trent Jr. (Toronto Raptors)4/2/2021+54Oso Ighodaro (Phoenix Suns)11/13/2025+52Santi Aldama (Memphis Grizzlies)12/2/2021+52Joe Smith (Minnesota Timberwolves)11/8/2001+52That may come as a surprise to many who might've expected someone like Nikola Jokic or another ultra efficient offensive engine to hold that record, but plus-minus goes far beyond just counting stats. It takes into account things that don't show up on a boxscore, like well-timed screens that lead to a bucket, making the right reads defensively or making the extra pass to set up a teammate on offense. It shows which players make the most impact on both ends of the floor beyond just scoring, grabbing rebounds or dishing out assists.\nUnfortunately for Williams, despite putting up 15 points in the loss, he wasn't helping the Jazz in other areas that translated to winning. But no one on Utah's team was, so while he will hold the record, every member of the Jazz should wear this badge of dishonor and let it motivate them to ensure a performance like this never happens again. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first weekend of the NFL playoffs isn't even over, and this year is already turning into one of the most dramatic postseasons in league history. Basically, Wild Card Weekend has lived up to its name so far, because things have gotten wild.The Bills, Bears and Rams all won their opening playoff games by scoring a touchdown in the final three minutes, marking the first time in NFL history that three different playoff games have ended with a game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes. There had been four instances (1982, 2002, 2011 and 2023) in which two playoff games in the same postseason ended with a game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes, but it had never happened three times.Matthew Stafford started the series of suspenseful finishes on Saturday when he hit Colby Parkinson from 19 yards out for a game-winning touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play to give the Rams a 34-31 win over the Panthers.\nThe drama continued Saturday night when the Bears overcame an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left for the game-winning score.\nWith their touchdowns, the Rams and Bears tied the record for the most game-winning touchdowns in the final two minutes in one postseason, and then Josh Allen set the record when he scored on a 1-yard run with 1:04 left to give Buffalo a 27-24 win over Jacksonville.\nThe Bills-Jaguars game featured four go-ahead touchdowns in the fourth quarter, matching the total from the Rams-Panthers game. In NFL history, there have been only four games with four go-ahead touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and two of them have come this year. \nThe 49ers also pulled off a dramatic win and although they didn't get a game-winning touchdown pass in the final two minutes, they did get one with 2:54 left to play when Brock Purdy hit Christian McCaffrey for a 4-yard score. Through four games, there have been 12 fourth-quarter lead changes, which is the most for any postseason in NFL history. Again, that isn't just a record for the wild card round -- it's the NFL record for an entire postseason and we're not even all the way through Wild Card Weekend. It's been a postseason unlike any other.The wild card round can sometimes lack drama. Just last year, five of the six games were decided by 12 points or more. However, the 2025 season has delivered one of the most dramatic opening rounds in recent NFL history. This marks the first time since 2013 that three wild card games have been decided by four points or less. Coincidentally, the two top seeds that year were the Seahawks and Broncos, who also happen to be the top seeds this year.\nThe NFL was unpredictable this year, and that unpredictability has led to one of the most exciting wild card rounds in league history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 12 LSU Tigers shook off all doubts with a statement 70-65 victory over No. 2 Texas on Sunday. This was the Longhorns' first loss of the season, and also LSU's first win over an AP top two team since 2008.\"I'm sure you've heard, but coach (Kim) Mulkey says she wants us to be tough,\" Mikaylah Williams said in her postgame broadcast interview. \"And I think that's something we've really taken pride in after those first two losses. Being tough, sticking together and playing hard. That's something that we've done and that's something we've been successful at so far.\"The sold-out crowd in Baton Rouge was electric all 40 minutes, but they exploded when Williams practically sealed the deal with a three-pointer that made it a three-possession game with just 1:18 remaining. This was just another example of the impact she had on Sunday. She had a complete performance that included 20 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 5 steals.\nHere is a closer look at how LSU upset Texas:A stifling defense that shut down Rori HarmonThe Tigers got off to a rough start offensively as they went just 7 of 26 from the field, but their defense made sure Texas didn't get hot either. \nLSU held the Longhorns to 25 points in the first two quarters, which is their lowest scoring half this season. Although Texas has one of the top assists/turnover ratios in the country, the team finished Sunday with a season-high 17 turnovers and just 9 assists.Jordan Lee has been one of the most consistent players for Texas, but she only made three field goals all day. Meanwhile, point guard Rori Harmon had just two points, going 1 of 7 from the field. Harmon sat out the entire fourth quarter after Vic Schaefer decided to go with Bryanna Preston.\nLimiting Madison Booker, especially in the first halfBooker was the spark for a Texas comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, but despite finishing the day with 24 points on 10 of 16 shooting, those stats don't tell the whole story. LSU's defense, with Williams being a key part of it, limited Booker to just four points and three turnovers in the first half. She also had two fouls in those first two quarters and was dangerously close to fouling out as she picked up her fourth early in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the loss, Booker is already thinking about how to lock in and bounce back when the Longhorns take on South Carolina.\"Coach said it, we are not ready for Thursday,\" Booker said postgame. \"We are still going to come no matter what, but we have to get ready. We have to prepare again and we have to try to fix our mistakes.\"Fighting for reboundsLSU no longer has Angel Reese or Aneesah Morrow to take over in the rebounding category. Kim Mulkey has been talking all season about how she wants the whole team to make a conscious effort in this area, and they did just that against Texas. LSU won the battle on the boards 44-35, which means the Tigers' grueling practices have paid off.\n\"We've had practices with a rebound bubble on, so the ball can't go in so you have to rebound,\" Williams said postgame. \"If you didn't get it, there was running involved. \"I'm proud of how we rebounded today.\"\nShowcasing depth, with five players scored in double digitsWilliams was the star of the show on Sunday, but there were multiple Tigers who stepped up during big moments. Four other LSU players joined her in the double-digit club with 10 points each, including Jada Richard, who hit a stunning buzzer-beater at the end of the second quarter following a steal and dime from Williams.\nFlau'jae Johnson was coming off her highest scoring game of the season in the win against Georgia. She only made four field goals against Texas but her impact was still felt throughout the game. When the Longhorns were working on a comeback, Johnson got an and-one with 7:15 remaining to keep injecting energy into her team and the crowd. The 5-foot-10 guard also got the crowd going with a block against 6-foot-6 center Kyla Oldacre later in the fourth quarter.\nMaLaysia Fulwiley is still cleaning up aspects of her games, but her moves also make the game exciting. Another key bench player is ZaKiyah Johnson, who Richard described her as a \"dog\" postgame.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As is often the case in January, weather may play a significant role in what happens during Sunday night's AFC wild-card showdown between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers in the first weekend of the NFL playoffs. While the temperature is slated to be at or slightly above freezing, strong gusts of wind are expected throughout Sunday night, which will be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The wind is expected to pick up significantly just about an hour before the 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff. Both teams could face winds ranging between 20-23 mph throughout the game. Obviously, strong gusts of wind could make kicking and throwing the ball a much tougher assignment. From a kicking standpoint, Sunday night's weather may benefit the Chargers, who have one of the NFL's best field goal kickers in Cameron Dicker. Dicker, whoever, is used to kicking under a roof in mild weather Southern California, so it'll be interesting to see how he does tonight if he is asked to kick against a strong wind. In terms of the offenses, it appears that the Patriots are more prepared to handle such conditions. New England was sixth in the league in rushing during the regular season and was fourth in touchdown runs. The Patriots' rushing attack has been led by the duo of rookie TreVeyon Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson, who rushed for a combined 1,514 yards and 16 touchdowns during the regular season. \nThe Chargers also aspire to run the ball, but injuries at the running back position have prevented Jim Harbaugh's team from being a dominant running team. The team lost Najee Harris to a season-ending injury back in Week 3 and was without rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton for half the season after he too sustained an injury. Hampton (ankle) has been labeled as questionable for Sunday night's game. If Hampton can't go, Los Angeles will once again have to rely on Kimani Vidal, who rushed for a team-high 643 yards during the regular season. The Chargers have also received solid contributions on the ground from quarterback Justin Herbert, whose 498 yards on the ground this year were a career high. Depending on how the wind is blowing, the winner of tonight's kickoff could play a key role in the outcome. If there is a strong wind blowing in one direction, the team that wins the opening kick may elect to kick with the wind at the back, similar to how the Giants famously took advantage of the strong winds during their NFC title game win over Washington 39 years ago. \nIronically, the Giants' defensive coordinator that night was Bill Belichick, who was the Patriots' coach the last time New England won a playoff game. The Patriots are looking to snap their seven-year drought without a playoff win on Sunday night. \n            ",

The Chicago Bears were down 21-3 against the Green Bay Packers at halftime and rallied from an 18-point deficit to advance to the divisional round.It seemed like the Packers were going to run away with it and defeat their divisional opponents on the road, up 21-6 through three quarters, but as Bears quarterback Caleb Williams reminded everyone after the victory, games are 60 minutes.The Bears were prepared to play hard until the final whistle, using another historic comeback as a reminder that games aren't over until the clock says 0:00. Bears coach Ben Johnson told reporters after the playoff win that during training camp he showed his players the New England Patriots' 25-point Super Bowl comeback over the Atlanta Falcons. He used it as a reminder to not give in, even with a large deficit.The Bears have two players on their current roster that were part of Super Bowl LI nine years ago. Guard Joe Thuney was on the Patriots and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett was on the Falcons. Back in 2017, the Patriots flipped a 28-3 deficit into a 34-28 overtime victory. Both players were asked to share their experiences from the game and Johnson believes the team found value in their stories.\"It was just great to get perspective from both of those players of how that game went down. I think it's just a good lesson to be learned that its 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game is still being played and there's a lot of time left,\" Johnson said on Saturday.\n\"That was my message to the group,\" Johnson continued. \"Was just reminding them that this has been done before. And rather than saying 'woe is me' and 'oh, crap, we're in a hole,' it's more of an opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we'll never forget. And that's what they did.\"The message clearly worked, because Chicago outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to win their first playoff game in 15 years.The comebacks by the Patriots and Bears do have one thing in common: Matt LaFleur was on the losing sideline in both games. LaFleur was a quarterbacks coach for the 2025 Falcons, and he, of course, is the current Packers coach. LaFleur is now part of the largest blown lead in Falcons history and the largest blown lead in Packers postseason history.\nThe 2026 season is set to be the final year of LaFleur's current deal and the team will benefit by making a decision on his future sooner than later.\n            ",

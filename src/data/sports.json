    "body": "\n        Saturday features one of the best college basketball slates of the season, creating plenty of games to utilize the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. The SportsLine Projection Model and team of experts have locked in Saturday college basketball best bets, including SportsLine expert Chip Patterson expecting plenty of points for Texas Tech vs. Arizona in a 6:30 p.m. ET Big 12 battle. Patterson is backing Over 157.5 total points as one of SportsLine's Saturday college basketball best bets at DraftKings. The Over is 8-5 across the last 13 Arizona games.One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a pick from LSU vs. Tennessee in an SEC battle at 6 p.m. ET. The model has chosen its best bet from the Saturday slate, backing Over 138.5 total points in No. 6 UConn vs. Georgetown at 8 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and it enters Week 15 on a sizzling 11-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and is on an 11-5 run on top-rated CBB side picks. Anyone following its college basketball betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Saturday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookTennessee (-14.5) vs. LSU (-112)Over 156.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-110)Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)Combining the three picks into a Saturday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +590 (risk $100 to win $590). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):Tennessee (-14.5) vs. LSU (-112)\n\"This feels like a smash spot for Tennessee,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"One thing I look for in the final months is teams likely to make a coaching change. Matt McMahon is probably out at LSU, and I have to wonder if the players are focused on the rest of the season or the transfer portal. The Tigers are just 2-9 in SEC play and coming off back-to-back home losses to Georgia and Arkansas by a combined 41 points. LSU could also be without leading scorer Dedan Thomas for the fourth straight game. I wish the Vols shot free throws a little better, but dominating the offensive glass and getting easy baskets off turnovers should be enough to cover.\" Back Tennessee to cover at DraftKings here:Over 156.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-110)\"Texas Tech has played seven games against power conference opponents that finished with 70 or more possessions. The totals in those games, all decided in regulation, were 155, 162, 182, 163, 140, 167 and 158,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"The thought here is that when the Red Raiders get sped up the totals creep up as well, and Arizona is the most up-tempo team in Big 12 play. Arizona's interior defense is really going to force Texas Tech to connect from outside, but the Red Raiders are currently leading the Big 12 with 41.2% three-point shooting in conference play. With Arizona looking to bounce back from the Kansas loss and Texas Tech desperate to improve its 3-3 road record, count on 70-plus possessions and a higher-scoring affair in Tucson.\" Back the Over at DraftKings here:Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)The Over has hit in six straight UConn games, with all six totals set at 136.5 points or greater, including five games set at more than 142 points. The Huskies cleared the Over by at least five points in five of those six games, in large part due to their own offensive domination. UConn has scored at least 85 points in three of its last five games. Meanwhile, Georgetown went Over in its last game, an 80-73 loss to Villanova on Feb. 7. Georgetown has the 128th-ranked scoring defense in the nation, allowing 73 points per game this season. The model projects the Over to hit in 78% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game. Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday against Sweden, who advanced by upsetting Czechia 2-0 on Friday.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's semifinal clash with Sweden, as well as how they got here.U.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalUSA vs. Sweden | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Goaltender Jeremy Swayman turned in a shaky performance, but the team in front of him got better as the game progressed and pulled away in the third period,Trailing 2-1 after the first period, the U.S. needed a spark, and Brady Tkachuk found one. He ripped home the tying goal off an offensive zone faceoff midway through the second period, and just 57 seconds later, Jack Eichel gave the Americans the lead on a similar play.\nTeam USA needed that boost because it started slowly for the second game in a row. Mistake-filled hockey from the Americans was magnified by Swayman, who got the start in goal while Connor Hellebuyck rested. Swayman allowed three goals, and the blame for two of them rested on his shoulders. The most egregious goal against came on a shot that was floated in from the center red line.Noah Hanifin scored what would ultimately become the game-winner when he followed up his own blocked shot and snuck the rebound through the legs of Sogaard. Jake Guentzel and Jack Hughers were able to provide some insurance in the third period.Team USA is now in position to take a top-two seed into the knockout round, and it can finish off a perfect 3-0-0-0 run in preliminary play with a win over Leon Draisaitl and Germany on Sunday afternoon.U.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3USA vs. Germany | Sunday, Feb. 15 | 3:10 p.m. | USA NetworkQuarterfinalTBD vs. TBD | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

One of the biggest rivalries in the world, El Super Clásico between Club America and Chivas Guadalajara, will take center stage on Saturday with both clubs in different positions than usual. With the squad returning to health, Club America are climbing up the table with two consecutive wins, but they're chasing a Chivas squad who are the lone Liga MX side with five wins from five matches played.How to watch Chivas Guadalajara vs. Club America, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 10:07 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio AKRON -- Zapopan, MexicoTV: TelemundoOdds: Chivas +120; Draw +240; Club America +220The creativity from Richy Ledezema has paced the attack with six assists, and being joined by former Chicago Fire man Brian Gutierrez in midfield, there has been enough firepower to push Chivas up the table. But with America returning to health, American Alex Zendejas and striker Henry Martin will look to change things in a heated rivalry match.On Sunday, you can also catch quite a clash on the CBS Sports Golazo Network with Cuz Azul hosting Tigres. Both sides had big midweek wins in Conacaf Champions Cup play and are also sitting level on 10 points in the table. The teams with the third most goals scored in the Clausura portion of the season.

    "body": "\n        The Unrivaled 1-on-1 tournament delivered again. Three nights of exciting action came to a close on Saturday in Miami, when Chelsea Gray outlasted Allisha Gray in a three-game war in the finals to claim the 2026 title and a $200,000 payday. As the runner-up, Allisha will take home $50,000. Chelsea Gray, a.k.a. the Point Gawd, is a serial winner, and it's little surprise that she was able to add another trophy to her collection, which also includes four WNBA titles, a WNBA Finals MVP, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup title, a WNBA Commissioner's Cup MVP and an Unrivaled Finals MVP. \"First I want to shout out Lish, man. A round of applause for Lish. Something about that last name, man, I swear. Man, we were exhausted,\" Chelsea Gray said. I was just telling [Jackie Young], I'm done with the sprints. But man, just a testament to the hard work that I put in all the time.\"The $200,000 payday is more than Gray made in the WNBA last season, when she earned $196,267 with the Las Vegas Aces. \n\"You just gotta take care of the moment and the rest will happen,\" Gray said. \"You dig deep when there's $200K on the line. We were both battling. We'll spend that money wisely.\"After the work she put in on Saturday night, Gray only had one thing on her mind. \"A vacation,\" she said, when asked how she'll spend the money. \"My wife said that she'll handle it.\"\nBreaking down the finalsGame 1There wasn't much drama in the first game. Allisha started with the ball and immediately hit a 3-pointer to jump in front, then got to the free throw line for a 2-point free throw, and finally closed the game with a tough fadeaway after an offensive rebound. \nGame 2Both players looked exhausted in the second game and traded a number of misses early on. Allisha hit a 3-pointer to go in front, but Chelsea responded with back-to-back 3s of her own to jump in front and earn game point. After a timeout, the former Finals MVP closed the show with a fadeaway jumper. Game 3Allisha started with the ball again in Game 3, and the long break after Game 2 seemed to give her a second wind. She got right to the rim at will and scored six quick points to put Chelsea on the brink. A miss gave Chelsea life, however, and she bounced back with four quick points of her own. At that point, the game turned into an extremely physical slog. Both players were pushing and holding, and neither could buy a bucket, while the refs were reluctant to decide the game with their whistles. After dozens of misses, Chelsea caught a break when Allisha lost her footing, which opened up the space for Chelsea to drain a tournament-winning 3. \nSemifinals deliverGray and Gray reached the finals in thrilling fashion. In the first semifinal, Chelsea Gray fell behind 8-0 to her former Las Vegas Aces teammate Kelsey Plum, then ripped off 12 consecutive points by using her size advantage to get into the paint and finish. It seemed as though the second contest would follow the same script, as Allisha Gray took a 9-0 lead on Aliyah Boston, who immediately responded by bullying the smaller Gray in the post to score 10 points of her own. Boston couldn't complete the comeback, however, and Gray drained a 3-pointer to advance. Boston and Plum, losers of the semifinals, will take home $25,000 each. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For over two months, Arizona has held the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 poll. The Wildcats have been the unanimous top-ranked team for the last four weeks. Notably, that unanimous distinction came after Michigan lost its first and only game of the season against Wisconsin last month.Since that loss to the Badgers, No. 2 Michigan has won 10 consecutive games, including an 86-56 victory over UCLA Saturday. Michigan is now 18-1 against Quad 1/2 opponents, which is the most wins among all Division I teams. Twelve of Michigan's 14 wins in Big Ten play have been by at least 10 points, and six of them have been by 20 or more.Even during its dominance this season against conference opponents, the Wolverines have had their share of upset scares. Earlier in the week, Michigan overcame a 16-point deficit against Northwestern in an eventual 12-point win. Before Michigan lost to Wisconsin, Penn State missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer that would've sealed one of the biggest upsets of the season. Penn State was a 24.5-point underdog, and that game represented Michigan's narrowest margin of victory this season.\nIn the first AP poll of the new year, Michigan and Arizona nearly tied for the top spot. The one-point difference between Michigan and Arizona kept the poll from becoming the second-ever tie for the No. 1 ranking. The only time that happened was in 1981.\nNext week's poll could be just as close, depending on what happens later in the day when Arizona faces No. 16 Texas Tech in a battle of Big 12 contenders. With the Wolverines' latest blowout win and Arizona's first loss against Kansas earlier this week, the voters are now in a position to make a change at the top.What does Michigan have to do to secure the No. 1 overall seed?After Arizona suffered its first loss against Kansas earlier this week, the door opened for a potential change at the top of the poll and in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections. Heading into the weekend, Michigan, not Arizona, was the projected No. 1 overall seed with Selection Sunday less than a month away.Michigan has a brutal schedule for the remainder of the regular season. And that's not even counting potential ranked opponents the Wolverines may face in the conference tournament. Three of Michigan's five remaining opponents in Big Ten play are ranked, with the matchup against No. 8 Illinois looming large later this month. Five of the remaining six regular-season games for Michigan are against Quad 1 opponents.\nMichigan holds a 2.5-game lead in the Big Ten standings over Illinois heading into the weekend. The other potential contenders for the Big Ten regular-season title include Nebraska and Purdue, both of which are 3.0 games back of first place. The Wolverines have a date with Purdue on Tuesday that could create even more separation at the top of the standings.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Michigan State slips in 2026 NCAA Tournament projection, Wisconsin poised to continue to rise\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile those games will matter for the Big Ten picture, there might not be a game in college basketball more consequential than Duke vs. Michigan next weekend in Washington, D.C. More on that later.If you thought Michigan had a tough close to the regular season, then check out Arizona's remaining schedule. The Wildcats face five opponents ranked in the Top 25 (Texas Tech, BYU, Houston, Kansas and Iowa State) before the Big 12 Tournament begins.\nArionza's matchup next weekend with No. 3 Houston -- which is the only scheduled meeting between the Big 12 foes -- could very well decide the Big 12 regular-season title. In short, Arizona has the tougher schedule, but Michigan has the resume to match up against anyone on Selection Sunday. Arizona has 15 wins against Quad 1/2 opponents, which is the second-most wins in the sport behind Michigan.A potential Final Four preview next weekend?Arguably, the top matchup of the regular season will take place next weekend when Duke faces Michigan. The Blue Devils entered last weekend with one loss before being upset by North Carolina on the road. Still, the Blue Devils remained a No. 1 seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections.Next weekend's game will have everything college basketball fans want and need. How will Michigan's bigs -- including star center Aday Mara -- match up against the physicality of National Player of the Year frontrunner Cameron Boozer? Which guards, on either side, will step up?\nAbove all else, this game will have major implications on Selection Sunday. A head-to-head win could be the difference in how the bracket is seeded on Selection Sunday. It could also be a preview of a game we see in Indianapolis at the Final Four.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas Tech roared back to stun No. 1 Arizona 78-75 in overtime on Saturday in a Big 12 thriller with wide-ranging ramifications. The loss caps an 0-2 week for the Wildcats, who were the last unbeaten high-major team until Monday night's loss at Kansas.Arizona led 64-57 with just over three minutes left in regulation before going cold down the stretch while playing shorthanded. Star freshman forward Koa Peat did not play in the second half due to a lower body injury, effectively leaving Arizona with a six-man rotation.The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) were also without freshman forward Dwayne Aristode due to illness. Texas Tech (19-6, 9-3 Big 12) is not a deep team, either, but the Red Raiders have grown accustomed to playing long minutes this season, and they rose to the occasion late.JT Toppin led the way with 31 points and 13 rebounds in 44 minutes for the Red Raiders and scored eight in the overtime period. His offensive rebound with six seconds left also helped cement the outcome.\nChristian Anderson added 19 points and eight assists. He played all 45 minutes.\nThe outcome solidifies the chances that No. 2 Michigan jumps to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll on Monday. It also means No. 3 Houston (23-2, 11-1 Big 12) is now alone atop the Big 12 standings.Texas Tech has now defeated three of the No. 1 seeds in CBS Sports Bracketology, as the Red Raiders also own wins over Duke and Houston.Why Arizona will remain a No. 1 seedIt's just Arizona's second loss, and it's not a bad loss. Therefore, the Wildcats are expected to remain on the No. 1 seed line in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. \nHowever, this will create some separation between Michigan and Arizona for the time being. The model already favored Michigan as the No. 1 overall seed due to its No. 1 ranking in WAB (Wins Above Bubble) and No. 1 ranking at KenPom. But it was harder to draw a distinction between the teams when they both had just one loss. The call for No. 1 overall is certainly more obvious now.What about Texas Tech?Texas Tech is projected by the CBS Sports Bracketology model to stay a No. 4 seed but to move up within the No. 4 seed hierarchy. Over the long run, a metric-moving result like beating the nation's No. 1 team on the road will help tremendously in making a push back toward the No. 3 line practical for the Red Raiders, who reached the Elite Eight as a No. 3 seed last season. Beating the NET's No. 2 team on the road is worth a whopping 0.93 in WAB, which could result in a 3-4 spot jump for the Red Raiders, who entered the day at No. 15 in the important resume metric. Texas Tech's six losses are all of the Quad 1 variety, and it now has six Quad 1 wins to match them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida's bid for a national title repeat is nearing full stride after Saturday's 92-83 win over No. 25 Kentucky, and the No. 14 Gators have a new piece of hardware firmly in their sights as well.A year after Auburn edged the Gators by a game for the SEC regular-season crown, Florida is in the driver's seat of the league standings with six games left. Since starting league play 0-1 with a 76-74 loss at Missouri on Jan. 3, the Gators are 10-1. In that span, they've rated as the second-most efficient team in college basketball behind only Houston, according to barttorvik.com.That efficiency was on display again against a Kentucky (17-7, 8-4) team that had won eight of its past nine games. Florida employed its typical crush of offensive rebounding to establish the tone and then used some perimeter marksmanship to keep the resilient Wildcats at arm's length.\nUrban Klavzar hit 5-of-11 attempts from beyond the arc, tying a season-high for makes and marking his eighth game of 3+ makes from 3-point range this season. The only thing standing between Kentucky and a potential 13-0 run late in the second half was a pair of Klavzar triples at 5:18 and 3:07 marks that subdued Kentucky's effort to rally from a 16-point deficit.\nKlavzar's perimeter acumen as the team's top guard option off the bench has rarely been in question. The Gators have simply needed more of that firepower from within their starting lineup.Xaivian Lee provided it against Kentucky. The Princeton transfer led all scorers with 22 points, shooting a refreshing 4 of 7 from deep in a demonstration of the potential the Gators saw when they recruited the former two-time all-Ivy League performer.\nFlorida's 3-point shooting is improvingFlorida entered ranked 354th nationally in 3-point percentage at 29.2% and making just 7.4 long-range shots per game. Last year, the Gators made 9.8 per game while shooting 35.6%, which was 87th nationally. That's a big difference.While some downtick in 3-point shooting was likely unavoidable amid the departures of star guards Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard, the slide has been more intense than expected.Lee entered shooting just 25.5% from deep on six attempts per game after shooting 36.6% from deep for Princeton last season. Florida's other starting guard, Boogie Fland, entered with one 3-point make in his last seven games and went 0 for 3 against Kentucky.\nHow a team this bad at shooting has managed to be so good anyway is a remarkable testament to Florida's convoy of quality bigs and the rising stardom of versatile forward Thomas Haugh, who has been flexed down to the small forward position this season. That move hasn't helped Florida's perimeter shooting, but it has only made them meaner defensively and tougher to handle on the glass.\nWhen the Gators do get hot from deep like they did against Kentucky? Watch out. That's when a great team starts to like an elite team that can win it all. Florida is now 9-0 when making nine or more 3-pointers after finishing 10 of 28 against Kentucky.Florida in good position in SEC raceThe Gators now have at least a two-game edge in the loss column on everyone in the SEC standings except for Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered their Saturday game with Auburn at 8-3 in the league. Florida will host Arkansas on Feb. 28 in a game that could have SEC title ramifications.\nIt's also possible that the Gators will have separated even further from the pack by then. Their next two games are against lower-tier foes South Carolina and Ole Miss before a manageable trip to Texas on Feb. 25.A return trip to face Kentucky inside Rupp Arena on March 7 also looms at the end of the schedule. But at this rate, Florida may have the league title locked up by the time it returns to the scene of last year's thrilling 106-100 loss to the Wildcats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 5 Iowa State staged a 20-2 run just before halftime Saturday vs. No. 9 Kansas and never looked back in a 74-56 blowout inside Hilton Coliseum, handing the Jayhawks their first loss in more than a month to shake up the Big 12 title race. The Cyclones' defense held KU to its second-lowest field goal percentage in a game all season while also forcing 13 turnovers, and their offense was equally as potent in a balanced beatdown.The win is Iowa State's largest by final margin vs. Kansas ever in a game played in Ames, Iowa, and tied for its second-largest over KU by final margin with a February 8, 1955 (!!) 18-point win. The only other bigger beatdown of the Jayhawks by the Cyclones was on March 10, 1973, when they defeated Kansas in Lawrence 89-65.Both teams entered the game as No. 3 seeds in the latest CBS Sports Bracketology with the model suggesting the Cyclones could move up to a No. 2 seed with the victory.Iowa State star Milan Momcilovic spearheaded the spectacular day on offense with 18 points and four made 3-pointers, and the quartet of Tamin Lipsey, Joshua Jefferson, Jamarion Batemon and Blake Buchanan each added 11 points of their own. Buchanan set the tone early with nine first-half points on a perfect 4-for-4 shooting, and Momcilovic closed it down with 14 of his final 18 points coming in the second half – including going 4 of 5 frame from beyond the arc.\nAt one point Momcilovic nailed a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner over KU defensive star Flory Bidunga and could do nothing but smile at his hot hand. \nPeterson plays just 24 minutes in lopsided lossDefensively was where Iowa State really shined as it held KU, averaging 78 points per game entering the day, to a meager 56 points in the losing effort. That tied for the fewest it has scored in a game all season, and was executed by holding Bidunga, the Big 12 field-goal percentage leader shooting 68.6% on the season, to a 5-of-13 (38.5%) outing – his second-worst shooting performance by percentage in a game he's taken five or more shots in all season. The Cyclones also held Darryn Peterson, KU's star freshman to10 points on 3-of-10 shooting with three turnovers and no assists. Peterson played just 24 minutes in the loss and was not part of its closing lineup, which Kansas coach Bill Self said was due in part to game flow but also in part because of his conditioning. Peterson missed KU's victory vs. Arizona on Monday with an illness, and Self said that illness lingered throughout the week, cutting into his ability to practice and prep for Saturday's game.\n\"I tried to sub him because he's been sick,\" Self said. \"So when he needed to come out there at the end, I was thinking, 'What do we do to give us to have the best chance to have success on Wednesday.' So that was me making that decision.\"It was a rough game for the projected No. 1 pick, but as Self noted, that was true of almost every KU player — not just Peterson.\"I didn't think he was great,\" he said. \"But he hadn't practiced much. I don't think he was bad, I just don't think anybody, except Elmarko [Jackson], was great today.\"\nBig 12 race tightens-upIowa State and Kansas had diametrically different weeks leading into Saturday, which made the outcome all the more stunning. ISU fell in an ugly 62-55 road loss at TCU on Tuesday despite being 7.5-point favorites, and Kansas knocked off No. 1 Arizona 82-78 on Monday. It says a lot about the Big 12 that Iowa State – even with Saturday's outcome – is even within one game of league-leading Arizona and Houston. The Cyclones and Jayhawks are both 1.5 games back in the standings behind the Wildcats and Cougars, though there are more than a half-dozen regular-season games remaining.We could and should learn a lot about that race soon as Houston makes its way to face Iowa State in Ames on Monday, and Arizona hosts ISU in Tucson on March 2 for its penultimate regular-season game. \n            ",

Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC. The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama. Sac State is also scheduled to face Fresno State in Week 2, as outlined in the Pac-12 schedule release. \n        \n            \n                Longtime FCS standard bearer North Dakota State seeks fresh challenge with leap to FBS\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSac State moved all non-football sports to from the Big Sky to the Big West last summer and applied for a waiver to join the FBS as an independent. After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. \nThe school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. Carter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"\nThe Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            \n    ",

The Friars' Duncan Powell sparked the scuffle between Big East rivals when he committed a hard foul early in the second half   on St. John's forward Bryce Hopkins, who played at Providence from 2022-25 before transferring to the Red Storm. \nPowell, who was assessed a Flagrant-2 for the foul, and Hopkins immediately went after each other, which caused players from both benches to spill out onto the court. It took officials and security guards almost a minute to break up the ensuing scrum. Officials also paused play for 19 minutes so that they could review footage and issue appropriate punishment. St. John's coach Rick Pitino, who coached at Providence from 1985-87, also entered the play area in an attempt to remove his players from the situation. Powell was one of two Providence players ejected alongside leading scorer Jaylin Sellers, who immediately joined Powell in shoving St. John's players. Officials ejected St. John's forward Dillon Mitchell for his initial involvement in the scrap. Red Storm bench players Kelvin Odih, Ruben Prey and Lefteris Liotopoulos were all tossed for leaving the St. John's bench area. Hopkins shot two free throws for the initial foul and St. John's guard Oziyah Sellers shot free throws for the technical foul assessed on Providence's Sellers. Oziyah Sellers then scored to expand the St. John's lead to 44-40 with just over 14 minutes to play in the second half. \nPowell will also be suspended for Providence's next game against DePaul since he was ejected for fighting after the Flagrant-2.   The end of the fight caused further tempers to flare. Later in the second half, Providence forward Jameir Jones was immediately ejected after he pushed Hopkins while Hopkins was driving to the basket. Jones did not attempt to play the ball. Players from both sides jawed at each other following Jones' shove and subsequent ejection, but another scuffle was avoided. \nAfter the game Pitino avoided comment on the incident.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Caleb Wilson is North Carolina's best player and emotional leader; big man Henri Veesaar is North Carolina's second-best player by every metric. UNC knew it was not going to have Wilson a fracture in his left hand was discovered earlier this week, but Veesaar was under the weather and was held out of Saturday's home tilt against Pitt.And yet, the 11th-ranked Tar Heels comfortably held off Jeff Capel's Panthers 79-65 in a game that was not as close as the final score indicated without a starting front line that had been as dominant as any frontcourt in college basketball outside of Michigan, Florida and Arizona.Pitt is one of the ACC bottom-feeders, but UNC played well and showed glimpses of the new way it's going to have to win ballgames with Wilson sidelined indefinitely.\n        \n            \n                Michigan makes case to jump Arizona for the No. 1 spot in next AP Top 25 poll after dominant win over UCLA\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's dive into key observations.Talented options shine in new rolesIt's time for Luka Bogavac to get it rolling. The international veteran had been shifted to a second-unit role, but he got re-inserted into the starting lineup and balled out with 15 points and four assists in 33 minutes. His individual creation is something this UNC offense needs to create some semblance of a jolt. \nAlabama transfer Jarin Stevenson also shined in an expanded role. Stevenson didn't shot-hunt at all. He just took what the defense gave him, and that resulted in 19 points on just seven shots. Stevenson drilled three triples and all four of his free throws. He played 36 turnover-free minutes. That's exactly what the doctor ordered.One guy can't replace Wilson's production, but Stevenson and Bogavac have to raise their level.They did just that on Saturday. Can they do it again?Don't expect much on the offensive glassUNC averages over 12 second-chance points, which ranks in the 77th percentile nationally, per CBB Analytics, thanks to the relentless effort from Wilson and Veesaar. \nUnsurprisingly, UNC was not able to be an impactful offensive-rebounding team against the Panthers. UNC totaled just six offensive rebounds on its 32 missed shots. That 18.8 offensive rebound rate is the second-lowest mark of the season for UNC.The Tar Heels' shot selection is going to have to be even better moving forward because those second-chance points that have fueled the Heels for long stretches this season is not going to be a strength while Wilson is on the mend. Dixon's steady hand steers the shipBall control will be even more paramount for UNC without the offensive rebounding to serve as a buffer. That means a freshman like Derek Dixon just has to play clean basketball.\nHe was great against Pitt. He had seven assists and just one turnover. He got the ball where it needed to go and was super unselfish in setting the table for this group and getting the ball where it needed to go. Backup big man Zayden High delivered a career-high 15 points, but it was Dixon who expertly set up High left and right.More of that, por favor.Interior defense pros and consPitt got whatever it wanted in the paint against UNC. The Panthers shot 13 for 20 at the rim and totaled 34 paint points. Pitt big man Cam Corhen got rolling early with some pick-and-pop treys and then started eating inside the arc on his way to a 23-point showing. He was terrific. UNC also struggled to contain versatile forward Roman Siulepa (14 points on 10 shots) for stretches.It just is what it is with High as the primary shot-blocker. There's just very little resistance when High and Stevenson are the primary interior defenders. \nBut Saturday was the worst it could be. Veesaar's return is imminent — he's expected to suit up for Tuesday's road tilt against rival N.C. State — and UNC's defense needs its 7-footer on the floor as soon as possible. Wilson will be unquestionably missed, but Veesaar can keep UNC's defense afloat with his interior rim protection and mobility on the perimeter. Thankfully for UNC, none of its next three opponents (NC State, Syracuse and Louisville) has that bruising center that you're terrified of.\n            ",

Kevin Durant was asked about the new USA vs. the World format on Saturday during media day at the Intuit Dome and whether it would solve the league's perceived problems with the event. He mostly shrugged it off. Durant said he felt like \"fans and the media need something to complain about.\" KD wasn't the only player who was pressed on the topic. Luka Dončić. Nikola Jokić. Anthony Edwards. They all got asked various versions of the question. Adam Silver wasn't so lucky.The commissioner spoke for roughly half an hour and didn't get a single question about the All-Star festivities and having to tweak the proceedings yet again to try to juice fan interest and compel the players to actually compete. Most years, that would have been top of mind for the media and the commissioner. This is not most years for Silver or the NBA. As Silver's annual press conference predictably revealed, the league is facing any number of pressing issues that come complete with significant PR problems. Tanking. A star player partnering with a prediction market. The investigation into the alleged cap circumvention by the Clippers (who are hosting this weekend's events in an all-time well this is awkward everyone just act normal situation.) When those are the main subjects things have gone sideways. \nThis is Silver's 12th full season as commissioner. It is shaping up to be his most challenging, which is saying an awful lot considering one of the very first issues he was tasked with handling was hitting the eject button on former Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught on tape making racist remarks. Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Jazz $500,000 and the Pacers $100,000 for tanking measures that the league took umbrage with. On Saturday, Silver conceded that tanking has been part of the league for a long time and even allowed that it can create a certain amount of interest at times because \"fans are rooting for their teams to be bad\" in order to potentially improve their draft position. But he also said that it's clear \"the incentives are misaligned.\"\"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\nThe problem with figuring out how to punish or discourage tanking, as Silver admitted, is that \"there's a bit of a know it when you see it quality to this.\" In other words, it's subjective and the league has essentially announced that it will be operating in a gray area with regard to disciplinary measures on that front. \"That,\" Silver said, \"is not necessarily a position we want to be in.\"There is no shortage of positions they would rather not be in these days. Holding All-Star weekend at the Inuit Dome while also looking at the Clippers for potential cap circumvention and tampering violations can't be comfortable for anyone. Silver reminded the assembly that the league office is not directly leading the investigation and instead that responsibility has been taken over by an outside law firm. He said from everything he's been told \"the Clippers have been fully cooperative, but as I said I'm not involved in the day to day.\" He called the matter \"enormously complex\" and added that he's reached no conclusions yet. The whole thing came off like Silver's version of the This is Fine meme. He employed the same approach when asked about Giannis Antetokounmpo announcing he had joined the prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder. The commish said \"it's an issue that I'm paying enormous amount of attention to.\" But he also downplayed Antetokounmpo's involvement, noting that the league has a rule for sports betting where players can make small investments in gambling companies. That same rule now applies to prediction markets. \n\"That means their investment cannot amount to over one percent,\" Silver explained. \"In the case of Giannis, from what I understand, it's a minuscule investment, much smaller than one percent. So that does not violate the rules.\"And yet, while not violating the rules, it's obviously not a great look for the league -- which is something Silver seemed to grasp as he tried to spin that topic into something closer to a net neutral for the NBA. \"It concerns me,\" Silver continued, \"in the totality of all this betting that we need a better handle, no pun intended, on all the different activity that's happening out there.\"Concerns over tanking. Concerns about the Clippers. Concerns about sports gambling and prediction markets. But they're looking into all of it -- or a law firm is in the case of the Clippers. And hey as far as prediction market investments and Giannis go, it's a small thing. Nothing to worry about.\nAs damage control goes, I'm not sure how effective any of Silver's efforts were. I sat through the entire press conference and read the transcript several times and mostly it came off as attempted deflection. As one reporter said to me afterward, Silver is really good at saying a lot of things without saying much at all. Maybe that's because all these issues swirling around the league don't come with quick or clear fixes. I don't envy him. But then no one said being in charge would be easy, either.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is going to finish his career having won pretty much everything a player can. He's already done most of it. Ohtani is a four-time MVP, a four-time Silver Slugger, the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year, a two-time World Series champ and the NLCS MVP. One item that remains absent in Ohtani's trophy case is the Cy Young award. His best finish was fourth in AL Cy Young voting in 2022. Heading into the 2026 season, Ohtani was asked in Dodgers camp about winning the Cy Young. He was diplomatic, as usual. \"If at the end, the result is getting a Cy Young, that's great,\" Ohtani said, according to an interpreter (via ESPN). \"Getting a Cy Young means being able to throw more innings and being able to pitch throughout the whole season, so if that's the end result, that's a good sign for me. What I'm more focused on is just being healthy the whole year.\"Could Ohtani pull that off this season? It seems highly unlikely. To be clear, Ohtani was basically saying he just hopes to have the type of workload that could get a pitcher in consideration, not that he definitely thinks he can take it this year. We're going to head down that path on our own, though. \nFirst off, here are the betting favorites for NL Cy Young, per DraftKings2026 NL Cy Young favoritesPaul Skenes, Pirates: +225Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers: +500Cristopher Sánchez, Phillies: +1000Hunter Greene, Reds: +1400Chris Sale, Braves: +1400Ohtani sits at +3000, trailing three others and having the same odds as five fellow starters -- so he's more in \"dark horse\" range than \"longshot,\" but he's not toward the top of the field. There's a reason for that and it's something we already mentioned. It's the workload. Ohtani returned to the mound last season after having undergone major elbow surgery late in the 2023 season. He made 14 starts in the regular season, but it was such a slow build that this only yielded 47 innings. He was basically a normal starter in the playoffs, working 20 ⅓ innings in four starts. He went six innings each in his first three starts, respectively, before getting pulled due to being hit hard in his World Series outing.\nThe Dodgers plan the season out in advance, all the way through the World Series. That's how good they are and where their expectations should remain. The Cy Young is a regular-season award. The lowest innings output we've seen from a Cy Young-winning starter in the last several decades is 167 from Corbin Burnes in 2021. Last season, both Cy Young winners were over 185 innings. In 2024, both topped 175. In 2023, both topped 180. \nThis is to say that even in this era, it would be pretty surprising to see a starter win a Cy Young with less than 165 innings. Are the Dodgers really going to push Ohtani from 67 ⅓ innings in his first season post-surgery recovery to 150-plus in the regular season, before we even discuss the playoffs? Keep in mind, he's an everyday designated hitter. I'm just not seeing it. Ohtani is a special case, of course, and he's likely capable of grabbing subconscious -- or even conscious -- \"bonus points\" with voters due to him being a two-way player. Then again, in looking at this fourth-place finish in 2022, he was probably slotted just about right and maybe even could have finished in third there. \nHe worked 166 innings that year. I'm very dubious that the Dodgers will use him that many regular-season innings this season, but let's put his 2022 season next to the 2025 season of NL Cy Young winner Skenes, just to see what they look like: Skenes 2025: 10-10, 1.97 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, 216 K, 42 BB, 187 ⅔ IP, 7.7 WAROhtani 2022: 15-9, 2.33 ERA, 1.01 WHIP, 219 K, 44 BB, 166 IP, 6.2 WARIf they both post those numbers in 2026, Skenes is going to beat Ohtani. And, again, I think Ohtani's innings are capped much lower than that. Let's say he works 150 innings (I'd take the under, by the way). Ohtani would, in that case, probably need to strikeout at least 200 while posting a sub-2.00 ERA in order to gain serious consideration.It could happen, absolutely. I'm just not betting on it. Not this year. He needs to work back up into the 150 innings range this season before hoping to get up closer to 175 the following season. \n            ",

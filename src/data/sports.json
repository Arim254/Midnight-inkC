    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed), Logan Paul, Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, TBA and TBA vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and TBA: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

The San Antonio Spurs will take the court without the phenom Victor Wembanyama, who is expected to miss multiple weeks with a calf injury, and he's been integral to San Antonio's winning start to the season. The Spurs are favored by 5.5 in the latest Tuesday NBA odds at DraftKings against the Grizzlies, but without Wemby on the floor, the SportsLine Projection Model views this as too many points to lay. Instead, the model is including the Grizzlies to cover as 5.5-point underdogs as one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Grizzlies are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against San Antonio, and Memphis' over/under for total points scored on Tuesday is 114.5.The model also sees value in MACtion, backing UMass to cover as massive 33.5-point underdogs against Ohio in a 7 p.m. ET college football matchup as one of its Tuesday best bets.

The reason this is kinda low, I'm guessing, is that BGSU is the only FBS program to start four different QBs this season (due to injuries, etc.). I don't care. It's Akron. On the road.\" Back Bowling Green at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:UMass (+33.5) vs. Ohio (-112)You could make the argument that UMass is the worst team in the FBS, but 33.5 points is a huge number to give against a fellow MAC opponent. This is the most points the Minutemen have been underdogs by since playing Missouri, of the SEC, and UMass covered that 44.5-point spread in a 42-6 loss. Ohio is the defending MAC champions and has a 4-2 record in the conference this season, but the Bobcats aren't anywhere near the level of an SEC program such as Missouri. The model views 33.5 points as simply too many points in a conference matchup, despite UMass being 0-10 this season. Ohio hasn't won a game by more than 27 points this season, and it is 0-3 against the spread when favored by 11 points or greater this year. The model projects the Minutemen to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this matchup airing on CBS Sports Network. Back UMass at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Grizzlies (+5.5) vs. Spurs (-105)Both teams are without their superstar, with Victor Wembanyama out for the Spurs and Ja Morant out for the Grizzlies as both players deal with calf injuries. Wemby was off to an MVP-caliber start, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game, so although both players' absences significantly affect their teams' outlooks, the Spurs playing without their superstar could be the harder of the two to overcome. The Grizzlies will rely more on their size with players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Cedric Coward and Zach Edey, and without Wemby in the paint, that could be a significant Memphis advantage on Tuesday. The Spurs are 3-6-2 ATS as the favorite this year, and the model projects the Grizzlies to cover the spread in 61% of simulations. Back the Grizzlies at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        There's a new team in the top four of the College Football Playoff Rankings. After a big win against Texas in Week 12, Georgia joined the list of projected first-round byes at No. 4 in Tuesday night's CFP bracket. The Bulldogs are still behind No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Indiana and No. 3 Texas A&M as the top three remains unchanged after three weeks. Georgia benefitted from Alabama's loss to Oklahoma, which vaulted three spots to No. 8 -- firmly in the field as an at-large -- after downing the Crimson Tide. Alabama, meanwhile, dropped all the way to No. 10, putting the Tide firmly on the bubble as the 2025 regular season winds down. The rest of the 12-team bracket remains largely unchanged, with one major exception: Tulane now makes the cut as a Group of Six representative. Fresh off of a 35-24 win against Florida Atlantic that saw them improve to 5-1 in conference play, the Green Wave landed at No. 24 in the rankings. \nThis bracket is a projection heading into Week 13. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the third CFP Rankings release. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            Alabama plummets Alabama's fall is something to keep an eye on. The Crimson Tide are currently situated as the last at-large in the field, a stark difference from the Week 12 rankings that saw them snag a projected first-round bye. Their early season loss to Florida State likely plays a big role in this. It's easily the worst loss among at-large teams, since the Seminoles are 2-5 in a relatively weak ACC. Losing at home as the favorite against Oklahoma also hurts Alabama. The Crimson Tide still have the inside track to the SEC Championship Game, but they're going to have to be flawless to close the regular season. \nIt will also be interesting to see how the selection committee treats a potential SEC Championship Game loss, especially with a one-loss team like BYU and a glut of two-loss power conference teams right behind the Crimson Tide. SMU, Penn State and Texas were able to make it in last season after losses in their respective championship games, so there is some precedent on Alabama's side.  \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Miami's rise complicates Notre Dame's picture-perfect CFP case\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKeep an eye on Utah The selection committee seems to hold Utah in high regard. The Utes are hanging around as the second team out, right behind in-state rival BYU.  Utah doesn't have a realistic path to the Big 12 Championship Game -- though it hasn't been entirely eliminated from contention -- thanks to losses against conference frontrunners BYU and Texas Tech. But it does have an easy close to the regular season. \nThe Utes have to get past Kansas and Kansas State, who boast a combined conference record of 7-7. If they can do that, and if a couple other projected at-large teams stumble over the next couple of weeks, then they could find their way into the final 12-team field. Confidence in the American Conference This is the third week in a row that an American Conference team has ranked first among Group of Six programs, as Tulane follows in the footsteps of Memphis and South Florida. It's becoming quite apparent that, barring some unforeseen meltdown, the selection committee will give an advantage to the winner of the American Conference Championship Game over any equivalent competitors. That's bad news for a team like James Madison, which has a better record than Tulane at 9-1 -- with its only loss coming on the road against Louisville -- and remains undefeated against Sun Belt opponents. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        Three-time Pro Bowl receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was officially reinstated by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday and is free to sign wit",
    "body": "\n        Three-time Pro Bowl receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was officially reinstated by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday and is free to sign with any team, per NFL Media. Beckham just finished serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's policies on performance-enhancing drugs. A while his suspension did not prohibit him from signing with a team, he is now allowed to take the field at any time. Beckham, who turned 33 earlier this month, last played for the Miami Dolphins in 2024. In nine games, he caught just nine passes for 55 yards. While he is no longer the dynamic perimeter threat that can stretch the field and carry an offense, Beckham could still contribute for a contender and was adamant in August about his desire to continue playing. Beckham took the league by storm as a rookie with the New York Giants in 2014, catching 91 passes for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns. He crossed 1,300 yards receiving in each of his first three seasons, and caught double-digit touchdowns as well. After 59 games played for the Giants, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns. In 29 games with Cleveland, Beckham caught 114 passes for 1,586 yards and seven touchdowns before being released in 2021. Beckham then signed with the Los Angeles Rams in the middle of the season and helped the team win Super Bowl LVI. Beckham caught 21 of 26 targets for 288 yards and two touchdowns for the Rams during that playoff run, including a touchdown in the Super Bowl before tearing his ACL. Beckham sat out the 2022 season, and then spent 2023 with Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. \nAs the playoff race heats up in the NFL, which teams could show interest in Beckham? Let's take a look at five potential landing spots, in no particular order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are still all-in for a Super Bowl despite their 5-5 start. Kansas City has a tough matchup this week with the Indianapolis Colts coming off their bye. With a loss, the Chiefs' chances to make the playoffs would drop to 36.3%, according to SportsLine. Patrick Mahomes' arsenal includes Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Marquise Brown and Tyquan Thornton, but could Andy Reid be interested in adding a veteran wideout to help for this playoff push?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver BroncosSpeaking of the AFC West, the Denver Broncos could use some help at receiver. Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant had great games against the Chiefs this past Sunday, combining for 166 yards, but Denver's inconsistencies on offense this season are well documented. Beckham isn't an addition that automatically makes the Broncos a top 10 passing offense, but he could be a reliable target for Bo Nix. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers' front office has likely been keeping tabs on the receiver market all season, as DK Metcalf is the only wideout on the team that has surpassed 250 yards receiving this year. With Baltimore, one of OBJ's former teams, closing in on Pittsburgh in the division, the Steelers could look to add some help offensively. It would certainly be interesting to see Beckham play for his third different AFC North team.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersBrandon Aiyuk has yet to return after tearing his ACL last year, plus Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings have missed time this season due to injuries. Still, the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers have their eyes set on competing for a Super Bowl. The 49ers reside in the toughest division in the NFL, so why not take a flier on a player that helped your rival win a Super Bowl a few years ago?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsThis is my favorite potential landing spot. Beckham helped Matthew Stafford and Co. win Super Bowl LVI with his contributions late in the regular season and in the playoffs that year, and he could do the same in 2025. The Rams' passing game is headlined by the talented duo of Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, but with Tutu Atwell on injured reserve and Xavier Smith currently in the concussion protocol, the door could be open for OBJ to return for another Super Bowl run. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Deion Sanders' third season at Colorado has seen the Buffaloes take a considerable step back. After going 4-8 in his first season at the helm, Colorado went 9-4 in 2024 with two-way star Travis Hunter winning the Heisman Trophy, helping build some real excitement about the direction of the program in Boulder. This year, with Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders gone to the NFL, the Buffaloes have fallen back to the bottom of the Big 12 standings at 3-7 (just 1-6 in conference play). That means Colorado will not go to a bowl game this winter. And with Sanders being paid like a top-10 coach at $10 million per year, many have wondered how long he'll remain in Boulder. On Tuesday, athletic director Rick George (who will step down and move into an advisory role next year) issued a clear statement to shut down rumblings of Sanders being on the hot seat.\"The seat is not hot,\" George wrote. \"We believe in what is ahead for this program.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Colorado AD Rick George to step down in 2026: What it means for Deion Sanders' future as Buffaloes coach\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGeorge's statement came in response to a social media comment that Sanders' seat was getting hot after Sanders implored fans for a little patience and vowed to turn things around at Colorado. \"I want you to understand. If anybody is built for adversity, I am. If anybody is built to change, I am. If anybody's built to overcome situations and trials and tribulations, I am,\" Sanders said Tuesday. \"You got the right man. I promise you, you do. And I'm going to prove that to you. Just give me an opportunity and give me a little more time and I'm going to prove that to you. I will.\" This year has seen one of the most active and aggressive coaching carousels in recent memory with a number of big programs firing coaches. However, Sanders and Colorado are a fairly unique situation. Though this season has taken away some of the shine away from Coach Prime, the Buffaloes have plenty of reasons to stick with Sanders for a bit longer. \nGeorge will be in charge of the athletic department through the end of the school year and appears committed to Sanders. The question will be whether that remains the case when a new athletic director steps in next summer. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA has made a new collective bargaining agreement offer to the Women's National Basketball Players Association that would raise the minimum salary above the 2025 maximum, according to the Associated Press. Furthermore, the offer would include a max salary above $1 million for the first time in league history. The current CBA was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension that made Nov. 30 the new deadline. This note from the AP suggests that the league does not want another extension or the risk of a work stoppage:\"People familiar with the WNBA's latest proposal described the plan to the AP as a highly lucrative package providing substantial increases over prior years and designed to bring negotiations to a quick conclusion.\"As the negotiations between the sides continue ahead of Sunday's 2026 WNBA Draft Lottery, here's a look at how the WNBA's reported offer could alter the current stalemate. How would the WNBA's reported offer change the salary structure?Minimum SalaryMaximum SalaryAverage Salary2025$66,079 (0-2 years) / 78,831 (3+ years)$214,466 $102,249WNBA's reported offer$220,000+$1,100,000+$460,000+Here are a few more key notes from the AP's report:The $1.1 million maximum salary would be available to multiple players per teamThe reported salary numbers would begin with the 2026 season and increase over the length of the CBAWhat have the players asked for?The players have outlined a number of key demands over the past year, including improved benefits and codifying charter flights. They've also discussed roster sizes, the schedule, officiating and the prioritization rule, though it's unclear where each item ranks on the priority list. Ultimately, though, the players want more money, not just in the form of higher salaries, but via a new revenue sharing model. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share (and) salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: Everything to know after two sides agree to extension\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWould the players be willing to accept the league's proposal?The players have thus far stood firm on their demand for a new revenue sharing model and, based on the AP's reporting, this offer would not satisfy that requirement. Instead, it appears that it would maintain the current system, where salaries increase at a fixed rate each year. This proposal is going to test their resolve, however. The minimum salary would more than triple for players with 0-2 years of service and nearly triple for players with 3+ years of service. The regular maximum salary would more than quintuple and the average salary would more than quadruple. That's going to be hard to pass up, especially for the rank-and-file players who aren't making significant money off the court.There's also the fact that no one wants to risk a work stoppage or, worse, missed games. It behooves both sides to come to an agreement so the offseason can go ahead unimpeded and the 2026 season can start on time. Without a new CBA, the expansion draft, free agency and the 2026 WNBA Draft cannot be conducted. The league is more popular than ever and a protracted labor fight could halt that momentum. None of that is to say the players should accept an unfair deal, but this is a serious offer that will require real consideration. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will miss one to two weeks with a low-grade left groin strain, ESPN reports. Antetokounmpo is averaging 31.2 points this season, fourth in the NBA, and 10.8 rebounds per game, seventh in the NBA. He is the only player averaging 30 points and 10 rebounds.Antetokounmpo left the Bucks' eventual 118-106 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday in the second quarter -- though coach Doc Rivers said Antetokounmpo was favoring the groin in the first quarter as well -- and did not return. Antetokounmpo had 14 points on 6-for-10 shooting with five rebounds and four assists before exiting.Antetokounmpo, 30, has been tremendous this season; his 31.2 points per game average is on pace for a career high, as are his 63% field goal percentage and 6.8 assists per game. The Bucks are 8-7 this season and 1-1 without Antetokounmpo in the lineup. Monday represented their second straight loss.\n        \n            \n                10 of the craziest, weirdest and most significant early season NBA stats from Nikola Jokić, Giannis and more\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAntetokounmpo's absence will prove a difficult obstacle for Milwaukee to overcome; the Bucks have a +7.1 net rating with him on the court this season, which would be the fourth-best in the NBA. When Antetokounmpo is not playing, the Bucks have a -11.9 net rating, which equates to the NBA's fourth-worst team.\nIndividually, Antetokounmpo missing time could jeopardize his chances for awards. Ahead of last season, the NBA instituted a 65-game minimum for players to be eligible for MVP, an All-NBA team, Defensive Player of the Year, an All-Defensive team or Most Improved Player. Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP, is currently +1500 to win the award at FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (+135), Nikola Jokic (+175) and Luka Doncic (+400) on the odds board.\nAntetokounmpo, who has already missed two games, would miss three games with a one-week absence and seven games in the event of a two-week absence.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        College football's coaching carousel is spinning wildly in the SEC and elsewhere this season and Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz has been linked to various openings. Rumored to be a candidate for Florida and LSU (behind Lane Kiffin), as well as schools like Penn State and Auburn, Drinkwitz addressed the job noise Tuesday ahead of Saturday's game at Oklahoma.Missouri started 5-0 this season but has lost three of its last five games to drop to 7-3. The Tigers' season took a turn when starting quarterback Beau Pribula was injured in the loss to Vanderbilt. Without Pribula, Missouri lost at home to Texas A&M before rebounding over the weekend with a decisive victory over 49-27. With the Sooners visiting Columbia, Drinkwitz tried to deflect the attention away from the coaching carousel and toward Saturday's game.\"You know, I'm not going to comment on message board chatter, tweets, sources. I've maintained with you and our team that my complete focus is on the task at hand,\" Drinkwitz said. \"You know, last week, people were tired of me because I couldn't win the big game. People had me meeting with my team and telling them that I was going to another school, none of which were true. \n\"Now, this week, it's a different story, because we scored the second most points in the SEC this year at 49 (against Missisippi State). So you know, all of this stuff is just a distraction. You know, I would like to remind everybody, including our fans, we absolutely love Mizzou. We love what we're building. We've been to six straight bowl games. We got the sellout streak going. Our administration has been nothing but phenomenal to me.\"\n        \n            \n                Latest coaching intel: Lane Kiffin's decision a true soap opera, Auburn search focuses on four names\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDrinkwitz won 11 games at Missouri in 2023 and beat Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl prior to last season's 10-3 finish. He's 45-27 overall in six years, including a 25-23 mark in SEC play.The SEC's 2023 Coach of the Year, Drinkwitz is signed through the 2029 season and trails only Kirby Smart, Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian for most overall wins in the conference over the last three years.\n\"Since I've been here, I've signed multiple extensions. In fact, I signed one this past summer. So all the speculation is really a tribute to [the administration], and it's a tribute to our team success and their commitment to our team,\" Drinkwitz said. \"And that's where my focus is going to remain, on our team and our current situation. And I'm not going to get into all that stuff, because, again, it's just a distraction.\"The book on Drinkwitz is impressive -- he's consistently been one of the SEC's best at his job who does more with less and has a penchant for finding gems in the transfer portal. Missouri signed 22 players out of the portal in the 2025 cycle and landed the seventh-best transfer class nationally per 247Sports.Former Louisiana-Monroe ballcarrier Ahmad Hardy leads the SEC in rushing this season with 1,346 yards and 15 touchdowns while former Division II Truman State running back Cody Schrader became the program's single-season rushing record holder in 2023 after registering 1,627 yards on the ground. Last season, former Appalachian State star Nate Noel rushed for 818 yards with the Tigers.\nWhile the NIL situation has improved at Missouri in recent years, including the signings of five-stars Luther Burden III and Williams Nwaneri, Drinkwitz has acknowledged his program falls behind the SEC's elite in terms of resources and funding.\"There's teams that we're playing with larger NIL budgets than we have,\" Drinkwitz said this week. \"Doesn't mean we're not doing the absolute best we can. Doesn't mean that we haven't put together a really, really good football team, and there's a lot of people helping us, but more is still more, and until there's a cap on it, we want every advantage that we can possibly get.\"During the broadcast of Missouri's win over Mississippi State in Week 12, commentator Tom Hart mentioned Drinkwitz's yearning for help from the eight Fortune 500 companies in Missouri. Any way the Tigers can find more pieces of the pie, they're going to do it, Drinkwitz said.\n\"If we want to get more and more opportunities for our student-athletes, then that's something that we need to lean into,\" Drinkwitz said. \"I'm always going to be pushing and trying to create whatever advantages we can for the University of Missouri in the NIL space.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is underway, and that means the rumor mill is in full operation. Below, CBS Sports has gathered Tuesday's most interesting moves and rumors in one convenient spot.Blue Jays considered favorites to land TuckerThe Blue Jays, fresh off an American League pennant, are considered by other front offices to be the favorites to land Kyle Tucker, per ESPN. Naturally, given that Tucker is the best available free agent, there are plenty of other teams in the running here in the early going.\nThe Dodgers, the club that defeated the Blue Jays in the World Series, are expected to have interest if Tucker is open to a short-term arrangement. The Phillies, Giants, Orioles, Yankees, and Mets are also potential landing spots, depending on how the market develops over the coming weeks.One team not expected to be involved in the Tucker sweepstakes: the Cubs. Chicago acquired Tucker in a trade last winter with the Astros, but does not appear to have serious interest in retaining him.\n\n        \n            \n                Kyle Tucker free agency: Pros and cons, contract prediction, landing spots and more for star outfielder\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYankees still want Bellinger backIn Yankees outfield news, center fielder Trent Grisham accepted the qualifying offer at Tuesday's deadline. With him back in the fold, it might look like the Yankees don't need free-agent Cody Bellinger back. There's Aaron Judge in right field, obviously, Grisham in center, Jasson Domínguez in left, Giancarlo Stanton at DH and Ben Rice at first. Still, the Yankees \"plan to continue to pursue\" Bellinger, per MLB.com. Bellinger, 30, hit .272/.334/.480 (125 OPS+) with 25 doubles, five triples, 29 home runs, 98 RBI, 89 runs and 5.1 WAR last season. There's certainly room for him on the Yankees. Domínguez still isn't a sure thing and Stanton is injury-prone. Domínguez could be the fourth outfielder in this case.Imai postedRight-hander Tatsuya Imai's negotiating window will open on Wednesday after he was posted by the Saitama Seibu Lions of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league, according to multiple reports. Imai will then have until Jan. 2 to reach an agreement.\nCBS Sports recently ranked Imai as the 12th-best free agent available this winter:Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.The Lions will receive a fee based on Imai's total contract worth. Pirates intend to spendThe Pirates will attempt to buttress a roster built around ace Paul Skenes this winter, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Passan reports that the Pirates were willing to sign first baseman Josh Naylor for more than twice the franchise's previous record free-agent deal (currently $39 million) before he opted to return to the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million contract. Pittsburgh is known to have interest in DH Kyle Schwarber, among others. Passan also notes that the Pirates are toying with the idea of allowing top prospect Konnor Griffin to compete for the starting shortstop job next spring. There are complicating matters at play however, including another looming work stoppage ahead of the 2027 season. Here's more on Pittsburgh's thinking: \nThe decision is complicated. The last teenage position player to debut in the big leagues was Juan Soto in 2018. A talent of Griffin's caliber shouldn't be rushed because a team wants to win now. And the concerns over the new basic agreement are particularly acute for a team such as Pittsburgh: If the doomsday scenario occurs and 2027 is lost, players will recoup lost service time, and with the potential for players to negotiate a shorter window to reach free agency, the Pirates don't want to start Griffin's clock early only for the rules to whipsaw and punish them for it.Griffin, 19, hit .333/.415/.527 across three levels, finishing the year with a 21-game stint in Double-A. Phillies facing steep competition on SchwarberThe Phillies would like to reunite with DH Kyle Schwarber, one of the top five free agents in the class, but accomplishing that objective will mean outmaneuvering a slew of other interested parties. There's an immense demand for Schwarber in part because of his production at the plate and in part because his age and positional concerns will limit his contractual term, according to ESPN.\nESPN lists a slew of teams as having some degree of interest, ranging from the expected highrollers -- Phillies, Red Sox, Mets, and Blue Jays -- to the Pirates, who, as noted above, pursued Naylor before he re-upped with the Mariners.\nSchwarber, 33 come March, has hit .228/.358/.508 (135 OPS+) with 47 home runs on average over the last three seasons. Rangers have discussed Garcia, Heim in tradesThe Rangers have engaged in trade talks concerning outfielder Adolis García and catcher Jonah Heim, according to MLB Network's Jon Morosi. That should come as no surprise: García is coming off a down year and is embarking on his final season of team control. Heim, meanwhile, appears to be a potential non-tender candidate. As CBS Sports wrote earlier this week:Heim's inclusion seems silly only if you haven't updated your priors since the Rangers won the World Series. In the two seasons since, he's been a well-below-average hitter offering diminishing defensive returns. The Rangers have publicly asserted they intend to trim payroll. Heim's price tag wouldn't stand out otherwise, but the Rangers can surely find Kyle Higashioka a new dance partner for less than $6 million. Morosi notes that no deal is believed to be close. \nMets shopping Nimmo, other position playersThe Mets are willing to deal from their surplus of hitters, and that includes being open to moving either utility player Jeff McNeil or outfielder Brandon Nimmo, per ESPN. Youngsters Luisangel Acuña, Mark Vientos, and Brett Baty -- all perpetually on the trade block -- are out there, too.\nNimmo, 33 come March, is a relatively new addition to the rumor mill. It's unclear if the Mets will be able to find a suitor, however, given his advanced age and contract. Not only is Nimmo signed for five more years (at more than $20 million per pop), but he also has a no-trade clause. In other words, he would have to consent to any trade, making the Mets' quest for a deal all the trickier. Last week, the New York Post reported the Mets have internally contemplated how much money they'd need to include to facilitate a Nimmo trade.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        TAMPA, Fla. – To borrow a line from Bill Hader's fictional Saturday Night Live character Stefon, the U.S. men's national team's year has had everything – routine wins, uninspiring defeats, fresh faces and a new tactical vision. Even if USMNT onlookers have been trained to expect the unexpected, their final match of 2025 threw something completely new at the masses – a 5-1 obliteration of Uruguay, delivered by a completely rotated side full of cuspy players eager to make their case for a World Cup roster spot.The match started in routine fashion and then the goals felt like they came all at once. Sebastian Berhalter put the USMNT up by the 17th minute with an impressive strike but by the time Alex Freeman completed a brace in the 31st minute, habits had set in. The U.S. were essentially scoring whenever they felt like it, Uruguay's defense crumbling time and time again. Freeman's second goal is perhaps the trademark example – the Orlando City defender torched Barcelona center back Ronald Araujo, perfectly encapsulating the vibe of the night.\nDiego Luna had a goal of his own before the half and even on a tough evening for Uruguay, delivered a moment of brilliance with Giorgian de Arrascaeta's bicycle kick. A calmer start to the second half did not mean the eventful portion of the evening was complete – Rodrigo Bentancur's second yellow card in the 65th minute and Tanner Tessman's strike four minutes later kept the party going, another banger on a night full of them. Raymond James Stadium was far from full but for all those in attendance, it was time well spent. That was especially true for an unfamiliar version of the USMNT, who notched the first statement win since head coach Mauricio Pochettino took over as the head coach little more than a year ago.\nPochettino said on Monday that he would rotate through his team, in part to account for the quick turnaround from Saturday's 2-1 win over Paraguay, but rare are the occasions where the head coach wholeheartedly embraces a spirit of experimentation quite like he did on Tuesday. He made nine changes to his starting lineup, the group almost exclusively made up of players who needed to make their World Cup cases. Those players wasted little time doing so – Freeman has been on the inside track for a World Cup roster spot for months now but bolstered his argument, as did Luna.\nLuna and Freeman are perhaps the poster children of the Pochettino experience – neither was truly on the USMNT's radar before the head coach's arrival but continue to earn invites back to the national team and minutes on the field. Luna ends 2025 as the national team's cap leader while Freeman was the surprise star of the show in his home state, a classic example of why the head coach has called upon fresh faces to shake things up.\"That is our job, our duty to see the projection of the player and for that, we need to give the chance and to see how they perform, how they act, the character, the mentality,\" Pochettino said post-match about Freeman. \"[At] some point, it is to recognize some talent, but in the same way, it's to be brave to give the possibility to play. … For me, it's not our credit. We [only] create the platform for him to show the quality, but the credit is [for] him.\"But I'm so happy, so happy that he scored twice,\"  Pochettino continued. \"You need to analyze in the way that he plays – he can play like a third center back, he can play forward on the side, go inside. In the time that he took the ball, how difficult it is for the opponent to stop him, go inside and play. When he has the ball, the team is like – it's like a relief. It's how easy [he] plays.\"\nFreeman and Luna's teammates followed their lead on Tuesday, rising to the occasion in more ways than one. It was a declarative night for Berhalter, who had a goal and an assist by the 20th minute. The Vancouver Whitecaps player thrust himself into a crowded midfield conversation in the process, pestering Uruguay to the point that Bentancur was sent off for going for his ankle. He deputized in midfield alongside Aidan Morris, the pair holding down the fort just fine while veterans like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie missed out on this month's camp for varied reasons.\"We know we have the quality to have performances like that, but I think it was about the DNA and the mentality going into games,\" Luna said. \"That was the biggest shift there and I think finding that and I think with whatever player we have on the field, we have the quality. I think it's just making sure we bring that mentality and that hard work mindset to every game.\"Those two, though, merely scratch the surface on how well Pochettino's insistence on experimentation has gone, nor is it the first time. Results have been inconsistent in the year-plus since Pochettino took charge but the one constant has been an unwavering commitment to ripping it all up and starting from scratch. The team may have looked aimless at times along the way, forcing questions about whether or not Pochettino has cast his net far too wide and sacrificed chemistry during a truncated run-up to the World Cup. Next summer's tournament may still be seven months away but Pochettino just might be in as good a position as he's ever been to take a victory lap. His team is unquestionably unfamiliar to the one that lost 1-0 to Uruguay in the final game of Gregg Berhalter's time in charge of the team, better for just about all the changes that he has made.\n\"We never doubted because we saw the quality of the players,\" Pochettino said. \"[It] was only to trust them and to give the possibility to find a way, to perform, to behave, to be in the way that we feel what [it] means to be professional.\"Now on a three-game winning streak and unbeaten in their last five, the USMNT keep finding different ways to collect victories. Saturday's gritty performance against Paraguay gave way for remarkable success on set pieces on Tuesday. Pochettino's side scored four of their five goals during those chances, several players' special skillsets coming to the forefront. Berhalter was a bright spot on those dead ball opportunities during the Concacaf Gold Cup and was impactful again against Uruguay, while left wingback John Tolkin called back upon his New York Red Bulls heritage and whipped in the corner that led to Freeman's first goal.\"I feel like we do work on it,\" Freeman said. \"It's a chance to score, so I think for us, it's just to be able to know that it's an opportunity to score and we need to be 100 percent at it. We can't take a set piece half-assed or be halfhearted. We want to be 100 percent at it. … For us, it's very good to be able to score that way.\"\nThe performance, both collectively and individually, provides Pochettino with a good set of problems with just one international break left to go until his World Cup roster is set. It may have created an unpredictable race to the finish in the process – which is exactly what Pochettino has hoped for all along.\"Honestly it makes it very difficult for Pochettino, knowing that a lot of these guys are coming in and making a big impact on the team,\" Freeman said. \"They're going to come in and give 100 percent and … [try] to turn heads, which one to pick. I think it just gives our pool a big showcase to different people and I feel like it just makes us a good nation to play with because you know that other people are going to come in at 100 percent and we have so many talented players in the pool so it's just be about being able to try to pick the best ones, come in 100 percent and be able to perform and I think it just brings good trainings and good international breaks.\"\n            ",

Only 19 wide receivers are projected to score more than 13 Fantasy points. It's even worse in three wide receiver leagues as only 31 receivers are projected to score double digits in full PPR this week. A big part of the reason is that 15 of the top 36 wide receivers based on preseason ADP are either hurt, suspended, or on bye this week. It also doesn't help that the Commanders are on bye, they have given up the second-most points to the position.One reason to bring this up is to put your mind at ease when you are setting your lineups this week. The vast majority of managers in 12 teams leagues are going to be starting someone at wide receiver that they would rather not start. The second reason to bring it up is to set you free. If there is no one available with a good projection, feel free to aim high and go for the upside. Guys like Xavier Worthy, who hasn't done anything start worthy in a month, should be started in three receiver leagues. Even someone like Luther Burden, who has shown us the ability to make a Fantasy day with one play, or Ricky Pearsall, who gave us a goose egg in Week 11.At the bottom of the wide receiver rankings projection just doesn't matter as much when it's this bad. Be willing to leave eight points on your bench for the chance to score 20.Here is the rest of the Week 12 WR Preview:\n\n        Week 12 WR Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            74.5% -- Ricky Pearsall played nearly three-quarters of the snaps in his first game back. He was open more than once as well.31% -- Wan'Dale Robinson led the Giants with a 31% target share in Week 11. I am going tight back to him in Week 12, no matter who starts at quarterback.37.5 -- The Raiders are giving up 37.5 PPR Fantasy points per game to receivers, the second most in the league. Maybe it's Jerry Jeudy week?40.7% -- A.J. Brown led the league with a 40.7% target share in Week 11. It seems the Eagles are at least attempting to appease him.38.8 -- Since he became a full time player in Week 6, Tez Johnson is averaging 38.8 receiving yards per game. He is a touchdown or bust flex.33 -- Luther Burden has played 33 offensive snaps, a season high, in each of the Bears last two games. The breakout could be right around the corner.185 -- Michael Wilson's 185 receiving yards was the most by a player in the NFL this week. He's a start if Marvin Harrison misses another week.20% -- Jakobi Meyers and Parker Washington both have a 20% target share since Meyers joined the Jaguars. They could both be WR3s this week unless Brian Thomas Jr. comes back.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n

week in that the best waiver wire add is dependent on someone missing time. Marvin Harrison Jr. hasn't been ruled out for Week 12, but as of Tuesday we are not projecting him to play. That means are projecting Wilson as a top 20 wide receiver this week. As bad as wide receiver is in Week 12, Wilson may be a top 40 guy even if Harrison is back.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -6.5\n                                    O/U 41\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                65%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    234\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    11.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Watson's 20 point outburst in Week 11 could be a sign of things to come.

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make a Week 16 NFL SGP comes on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts (4.5, 46.5) at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both teams are on streaks, as San Fran has won four straight, while Indy has lost four straight. That would make NFL picks on the money line in favor of the Niners attractive for a 'Monday Night Football' SGP, but the recent history of this matchup may suggest otherwise. The Colts have won five straight games versus the Niners, so your MNF same-game parlay may want to consider NFL props, spread picks and the over/under.While this game features the likes of Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor and George Kittle, many will target 44-year-old Philip Rivers with prop bets for their MNF SGP. After 120 passing yards last week, Rivers' O/U for passing yards is 158.5 for Monday. San Fran's defense isn't the same caliber as the one in Seattle that Rivers saw last Sunday, so the Over could be appealing for your NFL same-game parlay. Before locking in any Colts vs. 49ers picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the 49ers vs. Colts prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Jonathan Taylor as an anytime touchdown scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Colts vs. 49ers on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of well over 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for San Francisco vs. Indianapolis here.Top Monday Night Football SGP picksAfter simulating 49ers vs. Colts, SportsLine AI says Niners running back Christian McCaffrey goes Under 17.5 carries (+102). With the postseason in their sights, the Niners are giving backup, Brian Robinson Jr., more touches in order to keep McCaffrey fresh for the playoffs. The former Commander has at least seven carries in each of his last five games, after reaching that number just twice over his first nine contests. Additionally, Indy's defensive strengths and weaknesses may have San Francisco lean on McCaffrey more thru the air than on the ground.The Colts have the No. 6 run defense and have allowed the second-fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025. On the other hand, the Colts have the second-worst pass defense, and San Fran will need more out of McCaffrey through the air with Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) out. McCaffrey is projected to have 14.4 carries on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here.Bet McCaffrey to go Under 17.5 carries at DraftKings:\nHow to make Colts vs. 49ers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has six other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your 49ers vs. Colts SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Colts vs. 49ers predictions?

Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44 has become one of the most-discussed sports topics of 2025, and on Monday, he'll take the field in front of a national audience when the Indianapolis Colts host the San Francisco 49ers. SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Rivers and Colts to keep the game competitive, playing the Colts as 5.5-point underdogs as a part of its Monday NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Colts vs. 49ers is 46 points, down a half-point from the opening line.The model also has one of its Monday best bets coming from NBA action, backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 15.5-point favorites against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Colts kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the entire game, resulting in six Seattle field goals and culminating with Jason Myers needing to convert a 56-yard kick with 18 seconds left for the win. Rivers completed 66.7 percent of his passes (18 of 27) for 120 yards, but commanded the offense enough to have the Colts in the game late. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 87 yards, and the model expects Rivers and the offense to make enough plays to keep this contest close as well. The model projects the Colts to cover in 53% of simulations. Back the Colts at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Thunder (-15.5) vs. Grizzlies (-115)The Thunder have dropped two of their last three games, but that shouldn't create a cause for concern for Monday or the remainder of the season. Oklahoma City still has a chance at a historic season after winning 24 of its first 25 games and opening the season at 25-3 after winning last year's NBA championship. The Grizzlies are without Ja Morant (ankle), and they are coming off a 130-122 home loss on Saturday to the Wizards, which resulted in just Washington's fifth win of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is having another MVP-caliber season at 32.5 points per game, which ranks second in the league, for OKC. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Magic (+5.5) vs. Warriors (-105)\"Some injuries to note both ways here (Franz Wagner out and Jalen Suggs doubtful for Orlando; Steph Curry out for Golden State), but the Magic won't be lacking for confidence after beating the Warriors with Curry by a 121-113 count on November 18 when Desmond Bane scored 23,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Note that Orlando was also minus Paolo Banchero for the first meeting, and he has since returned, after Jamahl Mosley's Magic kept things close vs. the Dubs in both meetings during an injury-filled 2024-25 campaign. Steve Kerr has even admitted frustration lately with his Warriors, who had lost three straight before nipping the Suns by 2 in Phoenix on Saturday after losing three of the previous four at Chase Center.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Louisville -7.5 vs. ToledoBoth of these programs are coming off 8-4 seasons, but Louisville did so in the ACC while Toledo did it in the MAC. The Rockets will also be guided by interim head coach Robert Weiner after Jason Candle accepted the UConn job this month. A handful of Louisville players are opting out of the Boca Raton Bowl, but in addition to losing Candle, Toledo will also be without edge rusher Malachi Davis, who chose to enter the transfer portal after recording 5.5 sacks. The model predicts that the Cardinals cover the spread in 57% of simulations. Bet on college football at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets:Western Kentucky money line vs. Southern Miss Tyson Helton led the Hilltoppers to an 8-4 season in Conference USA, while Southern Miss went 7-5 in the Sun Belt and then lost head coach Charles Huff to Memphis. Western Kentucky did lose running back La'Vell Wright (10 rushing touchdowns) and cornerback Dylan Flowers (four passes defensed) to the transfer portal, but should have better overall continuity with Helton staying put. The model predicts that the Hilltoppers win in 67% of simulations. Bet on college football at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:UNLV -6.5 vs. Ohio The Rebels went 10-3 this season under Dan Mullen, and he remains with UNLV despite rumors of Michigan interest swirling.

    "body": "\n        The Italian Serie A has announced that AC Milan vs. Como won't take place in Perth, Australia, at the beginning of February. Despite league president Ezio Simonelli's earlier announcement, made ahead of the Supercoppa Italiana semifinal between Napoli and the Rossoneri, that the match would go ahead, the Italian league issued a joint statement on Monday confirming that it will not take place in Perth.\"Plans for Perth to host the first ever official European league match for points outside its national borders are off, following the mutual agreement of Lega Calcio Serie A and the Western Australian Government. Both parties have come to this decision due to financial risks that could not be mitigated, onerous approval conditions, and last-minute complications beyond their control,\" they said. The decision is quite surprising especially after the quotes of Simonelli last week but it also followed what happened in Spain. LaLiga was planning to play the fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona that took place over the past weekend in Miami, but after the players and the other teams decided to protest against this idea, the game scheduled in the United States was called off. The Italian Serie A was working to play the match between AC Milan and Como abroad in part because the Rossoneri won't be able to host the match against the team coached by Cesc Fabregas on February 8, as San Siro will host the opening ceremony of the 2026 Olympics in Milan. The fixture secured the approval of all 20 Lega Calcio Serie A clubs, the Italian FA and the UEFA. \"The onerous conditions from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to sanction the fixture could not be implemented without financial risks to the Western Australian Government and Serie A that could not be mitigated. The Government and Lega Calcio Serie A exhausted every viable option to bring the historic fixture to Western Australia. Analysis of Perth's bid shows it has already generated more than $280 million in global media exposure since April, with Perth discussed widely across major international outlets in USA, UK, Italy, Indonesia, and France. The proposed match would have been the first time a top-tier European league game for points was played outside its national borders, presenting a unique opportunity for Western Australia to make international football history,\" the statement said. \nEzio Simonelli, Serie A president, said, \"While expressing disappointment at the outcome of this project, we remain firmly convinced that this conclusion is a missed opportunity in the growth of Italian football at an international level, which also deprives the many Serie A fans abroad of the dream of attending a match of their favourite team in person\".\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of Nick Saban's forgotten coaching disciples prior to his magical two-year run at Indiana, Curt Cignetti credits the Alabama legend with helping him set up his own process behind the scenes as the leader of a program while instituting principles that have led to sizable wins.As the anchor of the top-seeded and unbeaten Hoosiers entering next week's College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup with the Crimson Tide at the Rose Bowl, Cignetti has not forgotten his early roots in the coaching ranks.\"[He's a] real important part of my journey,\" Cignetti said Monday. \"[I] learned a lot from Coach Saban in terms of organization and standards. I wouldn't be where I am today without my time under Nick. My family really enjoyed Tuscaloosa.\"Cut from the same no BS cloth as Saban, Cignetti reportedly flourished in a \"sink-or-swim environment\" as an assistant coach and recruiting advisor at Alabama in 2007 and it was there he saw what turned out to be the makings of an eventual college football dynasty.\nIn fact, it was Cignetti who was the lead recruiter for future Alabama Heisman winner Mark Ingram, the running back who helped the Crimson Tide to the first of six national titles under Saban in 2009.\"He was knowledgeable about recruiting and knew everybody on the board because he was sending us out,\" former Alabama running backs coach Burton Burns told CBS Sports' John Talty last year. \"He was built for the job, it was in his DNA. He knew how to do all those things. He was really good on the road. I went on the road a few times with him, and he was really good with coaches and the family of those kids.\"Alabama was Cignetti's third coaching stop in the Power conference ranks and he spent five years on Saban's offensive staff before becoming a head coach for the first time at IUP in 2011. After turning that program around and finding success at Elon and James Madison, Indiana took a chance of Cignetti ahead of the 2024 campaign and he's done the rest.\nCignetti's won 24 of his first 26 games with the Hoosiers entering the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl and pushed Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945 this season. Cignetti has another Heisman winner to boot in quarterback Fernando Mendoza, whom he plucked out of the transfer portal from California last cycle and has watched the 6-foot-5 junior throw for 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns this fall.The transfer portal has been Cignetti's primary strength at Indiana, according to Saban.\"I think when you're having that many changes on your roster every year, you have to do a fantastic job of evaluation, which Curt Cignetti has done that so far,\" Saban said earlier this season on College GameDay. \"I don't think you could change a program as quickly as he has Indiana, especially one that doesn't have a tradition of success and culture as a football program without transfer portal.\n\"We need new players, quick players. We need to be able to do this quickly. And he brought a bunch of players from his old school that knew his culture and how he wanted to do it. And got a quarterback in there that could make some plays. Now he has an even better quarterback, in my opinion.\"On the heels of consecutive top-30 portal signing classes where player evaluation was paramount, Cignetti says his sales pitch at Indiana is unique -- and awfully blunt.\"I used to tell them everybody can't play for the Yankees, man,\" Cignetti said earlier this season. \"I mean, that's the way it is. So don't come here if this is not what you want to do, because the standard is high. The commitment has got to be high.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Red Sox have acquired veteran slugger Willson Contreras in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, the team announced Monday. The Cardinals will receive righty Hunter Dobbins and minor-league pitchers Yhoiker Fajardo and Blake Aita in return. This is the second significant Cardinals/Red Sox trade this offseason; Boston sent two young pitchers to St. Louis for Sonny Gray last month.Similar to Gray, Contreras will receive an additional $1 million in guaranteed money in exchange for waiving his no-trade clause, according to the Boston Globe. He is signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028, and now has $42.5 million coming his way. The Cardinals will pay $8 million of the $42.5 million, reports MassLive. While Contreras initially showed no interest in leaving St. Louis, even in the face of the ongoing rebuild, he eventually reconsidered and waived it to approve the deal to a Red Sox club that, unlike the Cardinals, figures to contend in 2026.\n        \n            \n                Willson Contreras trade grades: Red Sox finally get their big bat, Cardinals continue clearing out veterans\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe trade pushes Boston's payroll into the same range as last year, meaning the the Red Sox will either have to raise payroll or shed a contract(s) to bring back third baseman Alex Bregman.Contreras, who's going into his age-34 season, is a former catcher who will likely man first base and DH for the Red Sox, as he did for the Cardinals in 2025. He gives Boston a needed middle-of-the-order righty bat and fits Fenway Park well given his above-average pulled fly ball rate. Contreras is coming off another productive season: \nThose 2025 outputs were good for a 123 OPS+ and a 2.5 WAR in 135 games. Contreras continues to back up his strong offensive production with similarly imposing batted-ball indicators. All of that suggests he's likely to continue producing at a high level for the time being. For his career, the three-time All-Star has an OPS+ of 118 and a WAR of 29.2 across parts of 10 MLB seasons. Over that same span, he's averaged 26 home runs and 31 doubles per 162 games played. Defensively, Contreras put up strong numbers last season, his first as a primary first baseman.Dobbins, 26, had a 4.13 ERA with 45 strikeouts in 61 innings in 2025, his first season in the majors. A knee injury ended his season in July, though he is expected to be ready in time for spring training. MLB Pipeline ranked Fajardo as the No. 23 prospect in Boston's system, calling him a \"potential mid-rotation starter.\" Aita was unranked. He and Fajardo both pitched in Single-A in 2025.\nBoston went 87-73 in 2025 and reached the postseason for the first time since 2021. They were eliminated by the rival New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series.\n            ",

Duke led by as many as 17 points before Texas Tech stormed back in the second half to record one of the most impressive wins of any team so far this season.

Michigan, Arizona and Iowa State were the lone teams to receive a first-place vote.\nDuke received three first-place votes last week but didn't get one this week after the loss to Texas Tech. It appears that Arizona will not get jumped in the poll by No. 1 by Michigan, Iowa State, or another team until it suffers a loss.

The Tar Heels stayed at No. 12 despite recording a dramatic win over Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic. UNC big man Henri Veesaar scored a go-ahead bucket with 7.2 seconds remaining, and his team was able to get a stop on the defensive end to preserve a 71-70 win. North Carolina won its third game this season against a Quad 1 opponent after going 1-13 against those teams last season.Although North Carolina didn't move up this week, there will be ample opportunities to do so once conference play gets going around the country.\nAuburn drops out of the pollSince Jan. 1, 2024, Auburn has been a staple in the AP Top 25 ... until now. The Tigers dropped out of the poll for the first time in nearly two years after suffering a blowout loss to Purdue last weekend. Last season's No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament is 8-4 with losses to Purdue, Houston, Michigan and Arizona.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While the brief return of Philip Rivers is clearly about more than a paycheck, he is nonetheless being financially compensated during his NFL comeback with the Indianapolis Colts. Rivers, who made $244 million during his first 17 seasons in the NFL, is making a prorated veteran minimum of $278,889 for the final weeks of the 2025 season. Rivers' return also restarted his five-year NFL heath insurance coverage. Not a bad deal for a 44-year-old father of 10 and grandfather of one who had not played a down of professional football in nearly five years. Rivers has a chance to further cash in on his comeback if he can lead the Colts to the playoffs. Players on wildcard teams receive $49,500, while players on division championship teams will earn an additional $54,500, which is the same amount players receive if their teams advance to the divisional round of the playoffs. Players whose teams reach the conference championship receive an additional $77,000. The Super Bowl runner-up earns $96,000, and players on the team that wins Super Bowl LX will rake in $171,000. \nAs noted above, Rivers' return to the gridiron is not financially motivated. A high school football coach since his initial retirement from the NFL, Rivers hopes that his comeback can serve as inspiration. \"There is doubt, and it's real,\" Rivers said following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle. \"The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, 'Shoot, let's see what happens.' I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.\"Given the circumstances, Rivers' season debut was largely a success. He went 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Colts nearly upset the Seahawks in Seattle. Rivers also came away from the game largely unscathed. \nRivers hopes to push the ball downfield more on on Monday night against a San Francisco 49ers team that -- like the Colts -- is fighting for playoff spot. \"I don't feel any really limitations pushing the ball down the field,\" he said. \"Am I gonna throw it 60 yards? No, but I can't name many times I ever did that anyway. But if you get it out on time in the things that we can do, I don't think that there's like, 'Oh, we can't call this, or we can't call that.' It'll be a solid plan that the staff puts together and and we'll have a great week of practice and go out and execute.\"LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Colts battle the 49ers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n            ",

That trend continued during their Week 16 loss to the Tennessee Titans as quarterback Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him missing the majority of the game. While it was initially feared that he had suffered a torn ACL, Minshew's ACL is reportedly still intact. However, Minshew is still expected to miss the rest of the season, which led to the Chiefs signing fellow quarterback Shane Buechele off the Buffalo Bills' practice squad for the season's final two weeks. A former undrafted rookie, Buechele won a Super Bowl in 2023 while serving as Mahomes' backup. Minshew was replaced on Sunday by backup Chris Oladokun, who went 11 of 16 for 111 yards and was sacked four times after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned a Pro Bowl nod in 2023 after throwing for a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14 that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \nThe Chiefs fell to 6-9 with Sunday's loss and will round out the season with a home game against the Denver Broncos on Christmas and a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Sherrone Moore's firing at Michigan in the wake of an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a staff member was the latest in a string of scandals to shake the Wolverines football program. Interim coach Biff Poggi did not shy away from calling out Michigan for its lengthy list of recent issues, calling it a \"malfunctioning organization\" when meeting with reporters Monday.The latest troubles from inside Schembechler Hall came after Michigan fell under the NCAA's watchful eye for recruiting violations and the sign-stealing operation that occurred under former coach Jim Harbaugh. While Moore's scandal was an individual case rather than a systemic bending of the rules, it added to the already tarnished reputation of a program that has been in the news for all the wrong reasons since its 2023 national championship.\"It has been five years of -- let's just call it what it is -- a malfunctioning organization where there's something every year,\" Poggi said. \"The athletic director has made it very clear he doesn't want any more of that. If I am named the coach, which I don't know if I am, there will be a massive self-examination of what's happened in this building. And you can expect a lot of changes.\"Michigan authorized an investigation into its athletic department's handling of the Moore situation. Chicago-based law firm Jenner & Block will conduct a comprehensive review of the entire department, and CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello reports that the investigation is \"open-ended\" to the point that Michigan is unsure what it might uncover.\nInterim university president Domenico Grasso said Michigan is willing to \"act swiftly\" if findings from the investigation warrant more terminations.\"We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that conduct like this does not happen again,\" Grasso said. \"Make no mistake. We will leave no stone unturned, and any further action we take will be based on credible evidence and findings, developed through a rigorous investigation.\"Not only did Moore's two-year tenure come to a close because of his impermissible conduct with a staffer, but he also faces an active show-cause penalty for his involvement in the Wolverines' sign-stealing operation. A separate case implicated former co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss for illegally accessing private information on campus. Another involved Harbaugh, who was investigated for making contact with recruits during a dead period amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Everything that happens in this building has to be reevaluated, quite frankly, because it is not up to standard,\" Poggi said. \"The staff has to be reevaluated. I mean the coaches, I mean the analysts, I mean everybody in the building has to be evaluated.\"Biff Poggi seeks full-time job, vows to make changesThe Wolverines are in the midst of a coaching search, and one of the factors they will undoubtedly consider in identifying a new leader is his ability to stabilize a program that has been in hot water for the better part of this decade. Poggi made his case for the full-time job and emphasized his desire to do just that.\"This place is magical,\" Poggi said. \"The program means a lot to me. It's one of the things I want to fix before I go smoke myself to death with cigars. It's one of the things I want to fix. I want to fix this program.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Biff Poggi emerges as realistic -- but risky -- option for Michigan as administration appears in flux\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPoggi last held a head coaching role at Charlotte during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. In his lone tenure as an FBS headman, he went 6-16 with the 49ers and never won more than three games in a campaign. He did fare better this year when he handled the duties during Moore's two-game suspension, though, and received credit for the Wolverines' victories over Central Michigan and Nebraska.Serving as Michigan's leader in an interim capacity sparked Poggi's interest in manning the duties in a permanent capacity. That interest appears to be mutual.\"I'm being considered,\" Poggi said. \"I've had multiple interviews, multiple conversations. Nobody knows what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen. I just appreciate being considered, and we'll see what happens.\"\nPoggi will coach Michigan against Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        DK Metcalf has been suspended two games without pay by the NFL stemming from his altercation with a fan during the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week ",
    "body": "\n        DK Metcalf has been suspended two games without pay by the NFL stemming from his altercation with a fan during the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week 16 win over the Detroit Lions, per CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Metcalf reportedly plans to appeal the suspension. Jones reports Metcalf's suspension triggers what could be up to $40 million in voided contract guarantees. Pittsburgh's veteran receiver is slated to miss the Steelers' Week 17 road game against the Cleveland Browns and their Week 18 home game with the Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh (9-6) can clinch the AFC North division title with either a win over the Browns or a Ravens loss at Green Bay on Saturday night. Metcalf, who signed a four-year, $132 million deal with Pittsburgh this past offseason, is slated to lose $555,556 in salary over the next two weeks. \nThe NFL determined that Metcalf's actions violated league policy, which specifies that \"players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.\"Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at a Lions fan during the first half of Pittsburgh's eventual 29-24 win. Metcalf reportedly had prior history with the fan when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. \nBecause this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by officials, it could not be penalized or result in an ejection, according to CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore. \n\"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in on from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said. The fan, who identified himself as Ryan Kennedy, told The Detroit Free Press that the altercation stemmed from him calling Metcalf by his full name. A source close to Metcalf, however, told NFL Media that Kennedy called Metcalf's mom a derogatory word and also called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said afterward that he had yet to address the situation with Metcalf, who didn't speak to reporters after the game. Metcalf, who played the entire game, caught four passes for 42 yards and delivered a key block on Jaylen Warren's second 45-yard touchdown run that proved to be the game-winning score. \nHow does this impact the Steelers?\nMetcalf's suspension won't matter if the Packers defeat the Ravens on Saturday night. If that happens, it would make Pittsburgh's final two regular-season games meaningless from a playoff standpoint.If the Ravens beat the Packers, however, Metcalf's absence could become a significant factor for a Steelers team that would then need to win one of their remaining two games in order to capture the North and the playoff berth that comes with it. In addition to being the Steelers' leading receiver (in terms of receiving yards), Metcalf is also a physical presence in the running game, as evidenced on Warren's game-winning touchdown run against the Lions. Metcalf's physicality was one of the things that compelled the Steelers to acquire him this offseason. \nIf the Steelers need to win one of their remaining two games, Metcalf's absence will undoubtedly put more pressure on Pittsburgh's other skill players. Fortunately for the Steelers, they've received a recent uptick in production from their pass-catchers after acquiring veteran Adam Thielen and signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling off the practice squad. The Steelers have also continued to receive sizable contributions in the passing game from Warren and fellow running back Kenneth Gainwell. The duo has combined to catch 95 passes for 710 yards and five touchdowns that include Gainwell's unbelievable 45-yard touchdown catch during Sunday's win over the Lions. Gainwell is actually the Steelers' leading pass-catcher with 62 catches through 15 games. Pittsburgh is also coming off of its best rushing performance of the season, which included 230 yards on 27 carries. Warren, who had two touchdown runs of 45 yards, is averaging 4.5 yards per carry and is 172 yards away from his first 1,000-yard rushing season. Gainwell has complemented Warren with 501 yards on the ground and a team-high 4.9 yards per carry. \nMetcalf's suspension will only impact the Steelers if the Ravens win on Saturday night. But even if that happens, it appears Pittsburgh has several players capable of stepping into the void.  \n            ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        Ohio State coach Ryan Day said Monday he'll assume the play-calling role offensively for the No. 2 Buckeyes in the College Football Playoff. Outgoing offensive coordinator Brian Hartline will focus on the wide receivers after accepting the head coaching position at South Florida earlier this month.Day has extensive play-calling experience as the program's former OC under Urban Meyer and last handled calling plays in a playoff setting as Ohio State's head coach during the Buckeyes' 42-41 loss to Georgia in the 2022 Peach Bowl semifinal.\"It's such a strange calendar and the timing is brutal, but he's handled it really well,\" Day said. \"As we move forward, he's coaching the receivers. It's a lot on his plate to manage. We're kind of taking it day to day. Going into the game, it'll be a group effort. (Tight ends coach) Keenan (Bailey) will be very much involved. Everybody will be involved with the play-calling ... ultimately it'll be my decision on the calls that go into this game. Kind of wanted to take that off Brian's plate going into the playoffs.\"Day's aggressive style led to 348 yards passing and four touchdowns from future first-round pick C.J. Stroud during that monster effort a couple years ago against one of the nations' top-rated defenses. The Buckeyes toned down the tempo and explosiveness a bit in 2023 with Hartline's hand in the play-calling under a more collaborative plan. In his one season as the play-caller last year, Chip Kelly helped the program win a national championship with his offensive acumen.\nDespite not calling plays in two years for the Buckeyes, Day has always accepted responsibility for his team's offensive production -- or lack thereof in certain spots. Following last season's loss to Michigan, Day pointed to schematic issues, coaching and game-planning for the Buckeyes' struggles in the red zone.Under the direction of Hartline in 2025, Ohio State ranked 17th nationally in scoring offense (34.9 points per game) while redshirt freshman quarterback Julian Sayin finished fourth in Heisman voting. Entering the Cotton Bowl quarterfinals against Miami, Sayin has thrown for 3,323 yards and 31 touchdowns as one of the nation's most efficient passers.Ohio State's offense was predicated this season on getting the ball out quickly to the perimeter thanks to a bevy of future first-round talent at the wideout position along with tight end Max Klare.\nLast season's offensive attack was considerably more balanced considering the Buckeyes were graced with a pair of 1,000-yard rushers (TreVeyon Henderson, Quinshon Judkins) and hadn't yet unleashed Jeremiah Smith heading into the postseason.Previously when Day has handled Ohio State's play-calling, the Buckeyes were more pass-centric. From 2017 through the 2022 season, Ohio State's starting quarterback ranked among the national leaders in passing and touchdowns. Day has helped develop several high-end prospects at the position, including Dwayne Haskins, Justin Fields, Stroud and Kyle McCord prior to stepping away from exclusive play-calling.Day called plays his first five seasons as coach before dividing up that responsibility following the Buckeyes' 14-3 Cotton Bowl loss to Missouri to end the 2023 campaign, which was Hartline's first as OC. Numbers trailed off that season and Ohio State's produced program-lows under Day in scoring, total offense, passing offense and rushing offense.\nOhio State's offense with Ryan Day as play-callerScoring offenseTotal offensePassing offenseRushing offense 201842.4 PPG (8th nationally)535.6 YPG (2nd)364.3 YPG (2nd)171.3 YPG (63rd)2019*46.9 PPG (3rd)529.9 YPG (4th)263.1 YPG (36th)266.8 YPG (5th)2020*41 PPG (11th)519.4 YPG (7th)262.5 YPG (37th)256.9 YPG (8th)2021*45.7 PPG (1st)561.2 YPG (1st)380.9 YPG (3rd)180.3 YPG (47th)2022*44.2 PPG (2nd)490.7 YPG (9th)298.2 YPG (14th)193.4 YPG (32nd)Day said this offseason that Ohio State's offense has never changed, despite varying play-callers over the last couple of seasons. He said he took Nick Saban's adaptive approach, but wanted to ensure annual continuity no matter who was directing that unit from the sideline.\"You know, Chip brought in his own ideas, but we tried to keep the offense the offense,\" Day said in July. \"And that was one of the things that he and I sat down and talked about on the front end, that this is going to be the Ohio State offense. There's certain things that you like to do that we're going to embrace.\"I knew that, you know, Chip may not be here for very long, and that was part of the understanding when he came in. But when he left, we can't just all of a sudden, you know, have a whole new offense.\"Now, Day can get back to the basics that made him one of the game's best previously in his tenure with the Buckeyes. And that's pressuring opposing defenses through the air while trying to control tempo.Given Ohio State's next opponent following Miami's dominant performance at Texas A&M, Day's got his work cut out for him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL Thanksgiving Day games are often as anticipated as the food and family time which accompany the holiday, and the 2025 Thanksgiving NFL slate is among the best ever. Lions vs. Packers (+3) kicks things off at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Cowboys vs. Chiefs (-3.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Ravens vs. Bengals (+7) the 8:20 p.m. ET nightcap. Joe Burrow (toe) has been cleared to return in that one, with Ja'Marr Chase also back from suspension, though receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) has been ruled out. One could make an NFL parlay using those spreads, or incorporate NFL picks on the total, with the money line, or by inserting NFL props. Baltimore enters in on a five-game winning, and it's won four straight versus Cincinnati, making the Ravens an attractive option with your Thanksgiving NFL parlay.As for those prop bets you could include, there is no shortage of stars to target, including Burrow, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Derrick Henry. Prescott has multiple touchdown passes in five straight Thanksgiving Day games, but Kansas City has given up just 11 passing scores across 11 games this year. He has an over/under of 1.5 passing TDs versus the Chiefs, with NFL prop odds of -138 for the Over and an intriguing plus-money payout of +108 for the Under.

Not only has Baltimore won four straight versus Cincy, but the Ravens sport a 4-1 ATS record over their last five meetings. This season, Baltimore's defense is back to being elite as it has kept six straight opponents under 20 points, including a pair of top-10 scoring offenses in the Rams and Bears. Even with Burrow's expected return, the Bengals offense isn't on that level, especially with Tee Higgins (concussion), expected to be out. Cincinnati's defense, meanwhile, is the worst in the NFL.The Bengals rank dead last in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense, while working second-to-last in run defense and third-down defense. A lack of taking the ball away plays a big part in those rankings as Cincy has forced only one turnover, total, over its last four games, while Baltimore has nine takeaways over its last four. With these discrepancies, Baltimore is projected to win by double-digits and cover in well over 50% of simulations. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Ravens to cover here:How to make Thanksgiving NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Thanksgiving NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Thanksgiving Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 11-1 payout?

    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet in the nightcap of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. However, Tee Higgins (concussion) will miss this contest.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 51.5.

Jackson (toe) missed practice on Monday, but was a full participant on Tuesday. They're 3-2 against the spread during that five-game span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but have ruled out Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverHaving Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

NFL expert Adam Silverstein, who is 40-25-2 (+1260) over his last 67 picks in Eagles games, is backing Philadelphia to cover, saying, \"The Eagles will be fuming off the Cowboys loss and back at home where it has covered three of the last four. The offensive issues are a legitimate concern, but Chicago is not stout enough defensively to stop Jalen Hurts & Co., especially with the team at its peak motivation coming off the terrible Dallas loss.\" See Silverstein's full analysis here.SportsLine's self-learning AI, which has hit more than 2,000 4.5- and 5-star prop picks since the start of the 2023 NFL season, projects Bears WR Rome Odunze to go Under 3.5 receptions (+110). SportsLine AI forecasts Odunze to have 2.2 receptions in a prop pick rated 5 stars. Get more picks from SportsLine AI here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule is arguably the most anticipated to date and not just because of the three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday contest. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) doubtful to suit up. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-3) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6.5, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Packers liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -2.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings SportsbookBet Packers vs. Lions and other NFL Week 13 games at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\n        \n            \n                Why the NFL made a Thanksgiving scheduling change that broke 42 years of tradition for the Lions\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey storylinesRevenge game. The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        If you're making plans to watch football on Thanksgiving, you're going to have some extra time to burn this year before the first game kicks off. For the first time in 43 years, the early Thanksgiving game won't be kicking off at 12:30 p.m. ET. Instead, it's being pushed back 30 minutes. When the NFL schedule came out in May, one of the most notable changes came with the league's decision to push the early game to 1 p.m. ET and that's when Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers will be kicking off Thursday on Fox. The Lions have hosted the early game for decades, and the last time it didn't kick off at 12:30 p.m. ET came all the way back in 1982. During a strike-shortened season that saw each team play just nine games, the Lions hosted the Giants in a game that kicked off at 12 p.m. ET. In 1983, the game was moved to the 12:30 p.m. ET window and that's where it's been ever since. If you're wondering why the league decided to change a tradition that had stood for 42 years, Roger Goodell gave an explanation for that just before the schedule came out. \n\"We're probably going to move from a 12:30 p.m. ET start to 1,\" Goodell said. \"We'll go back to the traditional windows.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL on Thanksgiving schedule: Cowboys host Chiefs to headline huge holiday triple-header\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBasically, the NFL wanted to align the Thanksgiving kickoff windows with the \"traditional\" kickoff windows that the league uses on Sundays. NFL fans in the pacific time zone are probably thrilled with the move since that means the game will now kickoff at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday instead of 9:30 a.m. like it did in the past. This is the first big change the NFL has made to the Thanksgiving schedule in 19 years. The last major change came in 2006 when the league decided to give us a Turkey Day tripleheader by adding a prime time game that kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET. This year, the prime time game will feature Joe Burrow making his return to the field for the Bengals in a game against the Ravens. \nBefore the late game was added, the league only played a doubleheader on Thanksgiving with the Lions always hosting the early game and the Dallas Cowboys hosting the late afternoon game. The Cowboys, of course, will once again be hosting this year in a showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs that kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS. \n        \n            \n                Chiefs vs. Cowboys prediction: Can Patrick Mahomes keep pace with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for the Lions, they've been playing on Thanksgiving since 1934, but the tradition of a Lions-Cowboys doubleheader didn't start until 1966. After that, it took 40 years before the NFL added a primetime game and 19 more years before the league made any other changes, so as you can tell, the NFL doesn't like to mess with its Thanksgiving traditions. The NFL loves playing on Thanksgiving and that's mostly because everyone in the country always seems to be watching. \nThe Thanksgiving games usually end up being the highest rated regular season games of the year. As a matter of fact, the most-watched regular season game in NFL history came on Thanksgiving in 2022 when 42.1 million people watched the Cowboys beat the Giants, 28-20. There's a very real chance that record could fall on Thursday with the Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. The most watched early game came last year when 37.5 million people watched the Lions beat the Bears 23-20 in a game on CBS. With the Lions kicking off 30 minutes later this year, that record could also end up falling on Thursday. \n            ",

The Bengals didn't get to their hotel in Baltimore until after midnight thanks to a flight delay that lasted more than five hours. The Bengals' flight was scheduled to take off from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but the team didn't get in the air until 10:32 p.m. ET, according to Flight Aware. The flight only takes about 90 minutes, but due to the late exit from Cincinnati, the Bengals didn't arrive in Baltimore until after midnight. The team was originally supposed to land in Baltimore at 6:19 p.m. ET, but due to the delay, the flight didn't get to Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) until 12:03 a.m. ET on Thursday, which made for an unfortunate start to their Thanksgiving Day. According to Charlie Clifford of WLWT in Cincinnati, who first reported the delay, the Bengals were forced to switch planes, although it's not known what the exact issue was with the first plane. In the end, the Bengals didn't end up arriving to their team hotel until after 12:30 a.m. ET. \nIt's an unfortunate situation for the Bengals, and that's because most players are locked into a specific routine on the night before a game, and those routines likely don't involve staying up way past midnight. \n        \n            \n                NFL Thanksgiving bold predictions: Jahmyr Gibbs shut down, Patrick Mahomes rattled, Joe Burrow beats Ravens\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis is a huge game for the Bengals, who will be welcoming back Joe Burrow. The team's franchise quarterback is returning to the field after missing nine games due to a turf-toe injury he suffered in Week 2. Although the Bengals are 7-point underdogs, per FanDuel Sportsbook, the return of Burrow will certainly give them some hope in this game: Their star quarterback hasn't lost a regular season start in almost a year. Since Dec. 2, 2024, Burrow has made seven starts, and he's gone 7-0 in those games. The fact that Burrow is returning for this game is almost fitting, because he actually had a small complaint about the fact that Cincinnati was being forced to play a Thursday night game in Baltimore this year. The Bengals are one of only three teams in NFL history that have had to play a Thursday road game against a divisional opponent in three straight seasons. The Bengals also played a Sunday night game at Baltimore in 2021, so this will actually be Cincinnati's fourth straight road prime-time game against the Ravens. \n\"Playing in Baltimore for the fourth straight year [in prime time] isn't ideal,\" Burrow said back in May. \"Maybe we can get one of those in Cincinnati next year, please.\" One of the key NFL executives in charge of creating the league's schedule, Mike North, admitted in May that Burrow had a legitimate gripe. \"It's fair,\" North said. \"When trends like that emerge, we probably have to adjust at some point.\"If the Bengals were playing in the early game on Thanksgiving, this would be a nightmare for the league, but they won't be kicking off until 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC, so there will be plenty of time for the team to get some rest before they kick off against the Ravens. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Emmett Johnson knew his offensive linemen deserved a moment in the spotlight. So before a run play on the goal line at UCLA, the Nebraska running back directed his big men paving the way to join him in the end zone if he scored.\"Let's hit it in the end zone,\" he told them.\"It,\" of course, was the Heisman pose.\"Nebraska football just needs more love,\" Johnson told CBS Sports. \"I feel like I've been disrespected on a couple of platforms, but honestly, it just comes down to me having belief in my teammates. The reason why I'm able to do that is because of them. That's why I did it with my whole lineup there.\"Johnson isn't anywhere near the top of today's Heisman rankings, but he could very well be sitting near the top this time next year. That's quite the rise for a former three-star prospect, whose only scholarship offer from a power conference was from Nebraska.\nIt's hard to find a player more indispensable. Johnson accounts for 37.9% of Nebraska's total yardage -- the highest share of any player in college football. He's produced 1,582 yards from scrimmage, second-most nationally, and his 1,234 rushing yards lead the Big Ten and rank No. 4 in the country at 112.2 yards per game.\"I personally believe Emmett Johnson should be in New York. I think he should be a Heisman candidate,\" Huskers coach Matt Rhule said after the breakout performance against UCLA. \"I think he should be a Doak Walker finalist if not winner. What he's doing is fantastic. I hope people appreciate seeing him. He's a first-team All-American.\"He's also the only FBS player with 1,200 rushing yards and 300 receiving yards.\"Most of our game plan was to stop 21...\" UCLA interim coach Tim Skipper said after the game. \"I think he is a very special talent. Nationally, they should be talking about him a lot more.\"\nIf Nebraska (7-4) had stacked a couple more wins, the compact, punishing runner might already be in the thick of the Heisman race. But being underestimated is nothing new.\n        \n            \n                'I'm sure Penn State's a great place': Matt Rhule's homecoming shows where his future really is\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA childhood built on proving people wrongJohnson grew up in Minnesota, where his senior season at the Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield turned into a weekly reminder of his competitive streak. Before a much-hyped showdown with St. Thomas, local media compared him to the opposing star, Camden Royal. It struck a nerve. He called his brother, Charles Jr., repeatedly the night before the game.\"Man, tomorrow, I'm going to go for 10 touchdowns,\" Charles Johnson Jr. recalled. \"And he meant it.\"\nHe didn't hit 10, but he scored six -- five on the ground plus an 85-yard kickoff return.\"Every time he scored he just looked at us like, 'I told you guys, I'm going to destroy these dudes,'\" Charles said. \"He's a really nice dude, but he has that competitive edge to him that if you push him to the limit, he's going to respond in a manner that is a complete 180 (degrees) from who he is off the football field. If you put pads on him, he turns into somebody different.\"Indeed, Johnson was a terror for opposing defenses. Johnson rushed for 2,484 yards and had 42 total touchdowns in 2021 while playing multiple defensive positions and amassing 71 tackles, 10 TFLs and two interceptions. He became Minnesota's Mr. Football without ever being treated like a budding star.\n\"He was my fieriest kid at home,\" said Precious Johnson, the family's matriarch. \"He would not walk down he stairs, he would slide down the stairs. He's the toughest, the most fearless one of the three. He also the quietest kid, just like his dad.\"Precious and Charles Johnson Sr. are Liberian immigrants, but they didn't know each other in Liberia. Both fled the country during the brutal First Liberian Civil War in the early 1990s.\"When it came to the war, we just fled. We didn't know where we were going,\" Precious said. \"There were children on the street, no food, nothing, just fleeing for your life. They're bombing homes. You never knew where to go or where to be safe. You just kept on walking.\"\nPrecious Johnson escaped Monrovia, Liberia and boarded a ship to Ghana. She arrived in Minnesota on April 7, 1993. A few years later, she met Charles Johnson Sr. in a church choir. She sang soprano; he was a tenor. They were friends first, then began dating. Soon, they were married and raised a family. Today, they still work and provide for their family. Dad works in a retirement home, and Precious is a nurse at Fairview Hospital's emergency room in Minneapolis.It wasn't until the Brothers Johnson were older that their parents took the family to Liberia and shared stories about the struggles they faced during the war. Just a decade earlier, bombs were falling from the sky. Food was scarce. Children were hungry on the streets. About 200,000 people died. \n\"You never knew where to go or where to be safe. You just kept on walking,\" said Precious.\"They experienced crazy trauma,\" Emmett said.  \"I'm blessed they could reunite here, because obviously, I wouldn't be here if they weren't here. I wanna be able to retire my mom from work and tell her she never has to work again, so she can just live a normal life.\"Nebraska offensive linemen join running back Emmett Johnson (21) for a Heisman pose during the Huskers' win over UCLA on Nov. 8. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            They call him E-MoneyTeammates call him \"E-Money,\" a nickname Nebraska amplified with a playful \"HEJ$SMAN\" campaign earlier this month. And he's earned it. Nebraska's offense has been battered all year -- especially after superstar quarterback Dylan Raiola suffered a season-ending injury Nov. 1 -- yet Johnson has been the steadying force.\n\"The kid just gets stronger every quarter and every series,\" offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen said. \"He's turned himself into a complete back that in reality can handle 90% of the snaps and that workload. A lot happens to kids with confidence.\"Holgorsen's Air Raid roots led many to believe the Huskers would transform into a pass-first, high-flying offense when he arrived in Lincoln late last season. But he retooled his offense during the season as Raiola kept taking punishment, and the offensive line struggled to protect the quarterback.\"Turns out all I do is run the ball now,\" Holgorsen laughed.Nebraska may be grateful he did. Johnson briefly entered the transfer portal last December, prompting a frank conversation with Holgorsen, who had just committed to stay.\n\"Look, dude, man, I just committed to sign on here for the next couple of years. I kinda need you,\" Holgorsen said. \"You're one of the guys I feel like can turn this place around. \"We both committed to it, went to the bowl game and won. Everything just kept improving for him. We started feeding him. This is a whole other Emmett this year.\"Johnson enters the Huskers' season finale against Iowa (12 p.m. ET Friday, CBS, Paramount+ Premium) as the first Husker with four straight 100-yard performances since 2013.\n\"I've been overlooked my whole life,\" Emmett said. \"I just use it as fuel every day in practice. I remember what it felt like when I wasn't getting any offers. I remember what it felt like to be overlooked in conversations and at camps that I attended in the summer. Those things are in my brain when I'm out there playing. It makes me want to go harder. That's what's helped me get to this point, and that's what's going to keep me going.\"As for the Heisman Trophy? He said he \"100%\" believes he should be a finalist. What the future holds for Johnson beyond this season could define whether Nebraska is a Big Ten contender in 2026.\"Obviously, he'll be a preseason All-American, Heisman Trophy, he'd be on all the watch lists,\" Rhule said. \"I'm not so sure he shouldn't go play in the NFL, right? I think he's going to be a great pro player.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For many, Thanksgiving is a day spent eating, spending time with family and, of course, watching football. The NFL has three games scheduled for Turkey Day and will have popular musical acts during halftime of all three matchups.The Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys always play on Thanksgiving and this year is no different. To kick off the action on Thursday, the 7-4 Lions will host the 7-3-1 Green Bay Packers in a huge divisional matchup at Ford Field at 1 p.m. ET. (Do note the change on the time from the Lions' traditional 12:30 p.m. kickoff.)The defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs, who sit at 6-5 and are currently fighting to get back in the playoff race, will head to AT&T Stadium to face the 5-5-1 Cowboys. The game will be broadcasted on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ at 4:30 p.m.\nTo end the night, we have a second divisional matchup at M&T Bank Stadium between the 6-5 Baltimore Ravens and 3-8 Cincinnati Bengals at 8:20 p.m. The Ravens struggled with quarterback Lamar Jackson sidelined, but have been climbing their way back up the standings in recent weeks. And the Bengals should get a boost since it was announced that quarterback Joe Burrow is expected to be available for the game. He has be out since Week 2 with a turf toe injury.\nHere's a look at who will be performing at each game.Jack White in DetroitDetroit-native Jack White will be the halftime performer at Ford Field when the Packers visit the Lions. White is a singer, songwriter and producer, who was a member of multiple bands, including The White Stripes. He plays multiple instruments and has hits like \"Seven Nation Army,\" \"We're Going to Be Friends,\" \"Blue Orchid\" and \"That's How I'm Feeling.\"His album \"No Name\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album in 2025. He's won multiple Grammys, including for Best Rock Performance for \"Lazaretto.\"Another Detroit-native and Lions superfan, rapper Eminem, will be one of the executive producers of the show. Eminem's longtime manager and president of Shady Records, Paul Rosenberg, and Jesse Collins Entertainment will also serve as co-EPs. Eminem and Rosenberg will consult the team on their halftime production through 2027.\nGospel musician CeCe Winans will perform the national anthem before kickoff.Post Malone in DallasLifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will be taking the stage at Jerry World. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,\" Post Malone said. \"It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.\"Post Malone has 18 Grammy nominations, 11 Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards and six MTV Video Music Awards. The \"Sunflower\" singer has explored many genres in his career, from rap to country to rock.\nPost Malone joins some elite company as Cowboys Thanksgiving Day performers, dating back to Reba McEntire taking the stage in 1997. Randy Travis, Destiny's Child, Sheryl Crow, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Enrique Inglesias, Selena Gomez and the Jonas Brothers are some other performers in the exclusive group.Lil Jon in BaltimoreRapper, producer and DJ Lil Jon will be hyping up the crowd during halftime of the night game. Some of Lil Jon's hits include \"Yeah!,\" \"Turn Down for What,\" \"Get Low\" and \"Snap Yo Fingers.\" We will likely hear lots of \"WHATs,\" \"YEAHs\" and \"OKAYs\" during the performance, all being signatures of the rapper.Lil Jon has multiple Grammy nominations and won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\" with Usher and Ludacris. He also has hardware from the MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards.\nBefore kickoff, Renée Elise Goldsberry, who won a Tony award for her role as Angelica Schuyler in the Broadway musical \"Hamilton,\" will sing the national anthem.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Lane Kiffin will-he-or-won't-he saga adds another layer of intrigue to an Egg Bowl rivalry that frankly doesn't need one.Sure, it might not get the national attention of The Game, Iron Bowl or Army-Navy. But those who have lived it know just how intense, sometimes frighteningly so, the Magnolia State rivalry between Ole Miss and Mississippi State can be. And that's before you add in the subplot of Kiffin's impending decision -- expected on Saturday -- on whether he will stay at Ole Miss or leave for either LSU or Florida. As CBS Sports has previously reported, Ole Miss is not expected to let Kiffin coach the Rebels in the College Football Playoff (should they make it) if he intends to leave. No. 7 Ole Miss (10-1) is in great shape to make the playoff and even host a first-round game if it beats Mississippi State on Friday, but a loss could be catastrophic. \n        \n            \n                Where will Lane Kiffin land post-Egg Bowl? Momentum for LSU, Florida falls back in race for Ole Miss coach\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn honor of what should be an especially weird Egg Bowl this year in Starkville, in what could be Kiffin's last as Ole Miss head coach, we decided to take a stroll down memory lane and give you five other particularly notable Egg Bowl games or moments. I've covered a few Egg Bowl games during my time at The Clarion-Ledger in Mississippi, but I still consulted with two of the foremost Egg Bowl experts I know -- radio host Brian Hadad and writer Alex McDaniel -- on what should make the cut. \nThe Fake Dog Pee Game (2019)An all-time Egg Bowl moment that led to two coaching changes (one of which led to Lane Kiffin coming to Oxford) and memes that will forever live on the internet. After scoring what should have been the game-tying touchdown, Ole Miss receiver Elijah Moore pretended to be a dog and pee as his celebration. It was an homage to former Ole Miss receiver DK Metcalf who had done a similar celebration against the Bulldogs two years prior. The issue for Moore this time was the officials hit him with a 15-year unsportsmanlike penalty. That led to a missed extra point kick, a loss for Ole Miss and ultimately Matt Luke's firing a few days later. It became known as \"the Piss and Miss.\" The win made Mississippi State bowl eligible. During bowl preparations, starting quarterback Garrett Shrader reportedly got into a fight with a teammate and missed the bowl game because of an eye injury. After a Music City Bowl loss to Louisville, Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead was fired after only two seasons. \nSo, in totality, one fake dog pee celebration directly or indirectly led to Luke and Moorhead losing their jobs and Kiffin and Mike Leach coming to Mississippi. Ole Miss wide receiver Elijah Moore (8) mimicked a dog peeing in the Mississippi State end zone after a touchdown in the 2019 Egg Bowl. \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The rare road field storming (1926)After finally ending a 13-year losing streak against their in-state rivals with a 7-6 win, Ole Miss fans were overcome with a need to celebrate on the field. Of course, those fans were in rival territory at Scott Field. As Ole Miss fans tried to tear down the goalposts, they were met with fierce resistance from the home fans. That included State fans grabbing wooden chairs and smashing them over the heads of Ole Miss fans. \nIt was such a wild scene that a Golden Egg trophy -- hence the Egg Bowl name -- was created to try to create a sense of brotherhood.The Immaculate Deflection (1983)Mississippi State was down 24-23 when Artie Crosby lined up for a 27-yard field goal to win the game. The Bulldogs had coughed up a previous 23-7 lead late in the third quarter, but still had a chance to win it behind Crosby's leg. The Mississippi State kicker had already successfully made three field goals that day, including a 51-yard one, and was more than ready to hit a fourth to win.\nCrosby looked like he hit it perfectly, the ball soaring higher and higher and then…it just stopped and fell to the ground. On a windy day with gusts as high as 40 miles per hour, Crosby's kick got caught in the wind, stopped mid-air and fell to the end zone. It's an unbelievable play that you have to see to believe. After the game Mississippi State coach Emory Ballard told long-time Mississippi sports columnist Rick Cleveland, \"God just decided that Mississippi State wasn't going to win that game.\"\nThe Brawl (1997)The 1997 Egg Bowl featured a dramatic finish but it is what happened before the game even started that people remember most. A wild pregame brawl broke out involving tens of players and had to be broken up by Mississippi Highway Patrolmen. And because the game officials weren't out on the field at the time of the brawl, no involved players were even ejected for their role in it.\nOnce the pregame extracurriculars subsided, fans were in for a back-and-forth affair. Mississippi State held a 14-7 lead late in the fourth quarter as Ole Miss attempted one last drive to tie the game. The Rebels got it when quarterback Stewart Patridge connected with Andre Rone for a 10-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left. Ole Miss head coach Tommy Tuberville got bold and opted for a two-point try rather than just kicking the extra point to go to overtime. This time, Corey Peterson made a diving catch for a successful two-point conversion to give Ole Miss a stunning 15-14 win. The win sent Ole Miss to its first bowl game since 1992. \nThe Whiskey Game (1907)On a cold, rainy Thanksgiving day in Jackson, Ole Miss coach Frank Mason reportedly gave his team coffee spiked with whiskey to keep them warm at halftime. The whiskey didn't help the Rebels, who drank it throughout the game on the sidelines, as Mississippi State went on to win 15-0. After the game Mason famously said his team would be returning to Oxford that night but he wouldn't be joining them.\"I'm going in another direction, and hope I never see them again!\" Mason said. Mason never coached another college football game after the booze-filled loss to the Bulldogs. Ole Miss finished the season 0-6. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas traveled to Las Vegas for the Players Era Festival with a 3-2 record featuring two double-digit losses, no good wins and lots of questions considering the Jayhawks were about to play three games in three days without their best player, Darryn Peterson.None of this was ideal.There were reasons for KU fans to be concerned -- and there still are on some level, I guess. But what could've been a really rough week that, worst-case scenario, would've sent Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame coach Bill Self into December with a losing record for the first time since he started 0-2 at Oral Roberts in 1994 actually went really well.KU went 3-0 in the Players Era Festival.So the Jayhawks won it?No, silly.\nI realize it's confusing and nonsensical. But the Players Era Festival was an 18-team tournament in which it was possible to go undefeated but still not win the trophy. Kansas and Iowa State both did it -- with the Jayhawks finishing third and the Cyclones finishing fifth. Why the event's organizers didn't anticipate that their goofy format would overshadow the fun matchups they produced is a mystery to me -- but they clearly didn't. So, hopefully, in advance of next year, they'll remember that no American sport is more closely associated with brackets than college basketball, and that any college basketball \"tournament\" without a bracket isn't really a tournament. And, even if they claim it is, college basketball fans will never embrace it the way they're conditioned to embrace tournaments with brackets -- some as big as 68 teams, some as small as four.Anyway ...Kansas went 3-0 in Las Vegas with wins over Notre Dame, Syracuse and Tennessee. Obviously, the last of those three was the best. It was an 81-76 victory over a UT team that entered with a 7-0 record highlighted by a neutral-court win over Houston. So, yeah, the worst-case scenario for the Jayhawks when they entered Las Vegas was that they'd exit with a 3-5 record. Instead, they're exiting with a 6-2 record featuring a victory over Tennessee. As a result, the Jayhawks are up to No. 14 in Thursday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings.Tennessee is down to No. 15.And if you're looking for an explanation for the movement in the middle of the Top 25 And 1, here it is: I jumped North Carolina from No. 19 to No. 13, even though the Tar Heels didn't play Wednesday, and that's because UNC is 6-0 with a win over the previously mentioned Kansas team that just beat Tennessee. So I wanted to keep UNC ahead of the Kansas team it beat, but also get Kansas ahead of the Tennessee team it just beat, while also keeping Tennessee ahead of the Houston team it defeated a day earlier, and the best way to do all of that was to just jump North Carolina ahead of all of them, which caused Houston, Michigan State, Texas Tech and Arkansas to be pushed down one spot each, no fault of their own.\nAs you'll see if you keep scrolling, Arizona remains No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1 for the eighth consecutive day. The Wildcats are 6-0 with three wins over teams that were ranked in the top 15 of the preseason AP poll -- specifically Florida, UConn and UCLA. That's the best resume in the sport. Tommy Lloyd's team will return to the court Saturday, when they play Norfolk State inside the McKale Center.

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest nonconference games of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place on Thanksgiving when No. 4 Duke faces No. 22 Arkansas in the CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic. This will mark the second consecutive year that the Razorbacks play on Thanksgiving on CBS. Illinois defeated Arkansas 90-77 last year in a holiday showdown.This matchup will feature some of the best freshmen in the country on the same court. The headliner of this game is Duke forward Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. On the other side, Arkansas has two potential lottery picks in Meleek Thomas and Darius Acuff Jr.Duke is off to a 7-0 start for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign. The Blue Devils are looking to start a season 8-0 for the first time since the 2017-18 season, a year in which Duke reached the Elite Eight.\n        \n            \n                John Calipari, Arkansas preparing for physical 'battle' vs. Duke in CBS Thanksgiving Classic\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nArkansas is off to a 5-1 start in Year 2 of the John Calipari era, with the lone loss coming to Michigan State earlier this month. The Razorbacks are 4-9 against ACC competition since the start of the 2014-15 season.\nHere is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup. Where to watch Duke vs. Arkansas live  Date: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: United Center -- ChicagoTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium  Duke vs. Arkansas: Need to knowDuke could have the No. 1 pick, again: The race for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft will likely be between three players: Boozer, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and BYU's AJ Dybansta. While Boozer will be drafted behind those players this summer, he is off to an incredible start to the season and is on track to become the latest member of the Duke program to be drafted in the top three. Last season, Cooper Flagg won National Player of the Year as a freshman and became the No. 1 overall pick. Through three weeks, Boozer should be in the conversation for both.Coach Cal has two elite freshmen: When Calipari was the coach at Kentucky for 15 years, he routinely produced first-round picks. That streak ended last summer, as Arkansas/Calipari didn't have a player selected in the first round. If the early returns are any indication, it's that the drought won't last long. Acuff and Thomas are both playing at an elite level. Both should be drafted high this summer. Acuff and Thomas are both in the top 10 of CBS Sports' latest freshmen rankings.\nDuke has a gauntlet upcoming: Duke's matchup against Arkansas will mark the second team Scheyer's program has faced this season. The upcoming stretch of games will be more of where that came from. The Blue Devils face reigning national champion Florida next week at home in the ACC/SEC Men's Challenge and also have nonconference games against Michigan State and Texas Tech before ACC play begins.Duke vs. Arkansas prediction, picks\nThis game is going to come down to the play of the freshman on both sides. Can Arkansas slow Boozer down? That's the biggest key in this game. Boozer has looked like a force during the first few weeks of the season. He is a walking double-double capable of taking over a game. Look for Boozer to have a big performance and Duke to cover the spread. Pick: Duke -10.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            DUKE -10.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's nothing more American on Thanksgiving than spending time with family, going back and forth from the table or couch with multiple plates of food and watching three games of NFL action.The first course will be the 23rd Turkey Day meeting between the NFC North's Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions, the most-played matchup in NFL Thanksgiving Day history. The league's midday action will feature two of the biggest brands in football -- the Kansas City Chiefs and the Dallas Cowboys. A fun day of football will then be wrapped up with an AFC North rivalry showdown between Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens. What thrilling, unforeseen events could occur in each of the three games? Here's one bold prediction for all three courses on the Thanksgiving slate.   All odds via FanDuel Sportsbook. Bet NFL games on Thanksgiving at FanDuel and get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.\nPackers hold Lions' Jahmyr Gibbs to under 60 yards rushing\nDetroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs enters Week 13 as the reigning NFC Offensive Player of the Week -- and for good reason. He totaled 219 yards and two rushing touchdowns on only 15 carries (14.6 yards per carry), plus 45 receiving yards and a touchdown on 11 catches, in Detroit's 34-27 overtime win over the New York Giants. The game-winning score was his 69-yard touchdown run on the first play of overtime.Gibbs enters Turkey Day on fire. However, the Green Bay Packers will extinguish that and hold him under 60 rushing yards -- something that has happened only four times this season, including his 19-yard performance on nine carries in Detroit's 27-13 Week 1 loss at Green Bay, his worst game as an NFL starter.Despite Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones' insistence that All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons lacks the ability to defend the run, Parsons' Packers defense ranks sixth against it in 2025, allowing just 96.5 rushing yards per game. Green Bay also benefits from facing a banged-up Lions offensive line that will be without starting center Graham Glasgow (knee). Left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder), right tackle Penei Sewell (ankle) and right guard Tate Ratledge (knee) were all limited in practice and are listed as questionable for Thursday.\nParsons, explosive linebacker Edgerrin Cooper and company should have what it takes to significantly limit Gibbs in a season sweep of the back-to-back NFC North champions.\n        \n            \n                Thanksgiving and Black Friday NFL expert picks: Can the Packers, Cowboys or Bengals pull off holiday upsets?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCowboys defense intercepts Patrick Mahomes multiple times\nYes, Kansas City Chiefs three-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes is the best quarterback in football today, but the Dallas Cowboys defense -- yes, the Dallas Cowboys defense -- will make Mahomes look very mortal.Dallas does enter Thanksgiving as the NFL's second-worst scoring defense (28.5 points allowed per game), but a closer look at the past two weeks reveals a different unit. The Cowboys' defensive personnel has changed dramatically following trades for Jets All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and Bengals veteran linebacker Logan Wilson, as well as the returns to health of electric linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and rookie third-round cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. \nSince Week 11, when all four made their 2025 Cowboys season debuts, Dallas has been the best run defense in football (45.0 rushing yards allowed per game), even while facing two standout running backs: 2025 sixth overall pick Ashton Jeanty of the Raiders and 2024 Offensive Player of the Year Saquon Barkley of the Eagles.Cowboys With/Without DT Quinnen Williams This Season (NFL Ranks)Without (Weeks 1-9)With (Weeks 11-12)W-L3-5-1 (19th)2-0  (T-1st)PPG allowed30.8  (31st)18.5 (12th)Total YPG allowed397.4  (31st)287.5  (7th)Rush YPG allowed143.0  (29th)45.0 (1st)QB pressures135 (3rd)38 (3rd)QB pressure rate39.8% (9th)41.3% (6th)Sacks20 (T-17th)5 (T-7th)Takeaways7 (T-23rd)3 (T-10th)* On bye week in Week 10Forcing the Chiefs to become one-dimensional will allow Williams, three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa to pin their ears back against Mahomes, who will be without Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith (ankle). The pressure Dallas generates should result in turnovers, with 2023 NFL interceptions leader DaRon Bland -- along with another Cowboys defender -- each coming away with an interception against the two-time league MVP on Thursday. Bengals' Joe Burrow throws for at least 300 yards and 3 TDs in return to snap Ravens' five-game winning streak\nThe Ravens went from being left for dead at 1–5 to now sitting at 6–5 and tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers atop the AFC North. The reason? Since Week 8, they've fielded the best defense in football, ranking either first or tied for first in scoring defense (13.4 points allowed per game), third-down defense (26.6% conversion rate), red-zone defense (30.8% touchdown rate) and takeaways (10).Only two quarterbacks have thrown for three or more touchdowns against Baltimore this season -- Patrick Mahomes (four in Week 4) and C.J. Stroud (four in Week 5). Josh Allen is the only quarterback to surpass 300 passing yards against the Ravens this season, doing so all the way back in Week 1.However, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow will throw for at least 300 yards and three passing touchdowns in his return from a turf toe injury that has kept him sidelined since Week 3.Ravens defense during 5-game winning streak (since Week 8)NFL RankW-L 5-0T-1stPPG allowed13.41stThird-down conversion rate allowed26.6%1stRed zone TD rate allowed30.8%T-1stTakeaways10T-1stCincinnati wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, Burrow's top target, returns from a one-game suspension for spitting on Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey, and he'll be playing with extra edge -- fueled by the layoff and Burrow's return. Bengals running back Chase Brown enters on a five-game streak of at least 100 scrimmage yards, tied for the longest in franchise history since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. With those two weapons, and even with No. 2 receiver Tee Higgins sidelined by a concussion, Burrow is primed to light up the Ravens for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns to close out the NFL action on Thanksgiving. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The thing about the truth is that no matter how far you try to run from it, eventually you have to face it. And the truth is this: the 2025 season has been an unmitigated disaster for The Six Pack. After a 1-5 showing last week, this column sits at 34-44 on the season and down 14.66 units.It's easily the worst year in the history of the column, and I've been writing it on CBSSports.com for 16 seasons. I've had losing years before, but the worst of them finished down roughly four units (that was before I started applying actual juice from sportsbooks, so it's an estimate). Even that is 10 units better than where things stand now. So even if I go 6-0 this week, this will still go down as our worst season.So why keep going? A couple of reasons. One is that my editors are exacting revenge for having to deal with me all these years and are reveling in my weekly embarrassment. I don't blame them. The other is that you can still make money off this column by fading every pick I make.And also, there's still time. Yes, this is the final week of the regular season, but we still have conference championships, bowl season and the College Football Playoff. There's a chance to save ourselves yet. That's right -- I've run from the truth once again. It won't catch me this time. I can feel it.\nGames of the Week\nNo. 1 Ohio State at No. 15 Michigan: I know the recent history between these two. I also know what's on the line. If Michigan wins, it can knock Ohio State out of the Big Ten Championship and play its way into the CFP. There's also the pure satisfaction of beating the Buckeyes again. But none of that changes how I feel. It's not as if Ohio State wants this game any less than Michigan, and the fact is, I think the Buckeyes are simply better. Yes, that was true last year, too, but that Michigan defense was loaded with NFL talent. There are still a few pros on this year's unit, but not to the same level. I'm far less confident in its ability to get stops against this version of Ohio State's offense.Ohio State spent the last two years trying to be TOUGH and PHYSICAL against Michigan to prove some point. This year's team hasn't run the ball particularly well, but it doesn't need to. It has one of the best passing quarterbacks and some of the best receivers in the country -- and I expect all of them to play.As for Michigan's offense, there's no question the Wolverines have upgraded at quarterback and have the makings of an alpha receiver in Andrew Marsh. What they may not have -- and what they need far more than Ohio State -- is a reliable run game. Justice Haynes has missed four of the last five games with no sign of returning. His replacement Jordan Marshall is banged up and didn't play last week against Maryland. His outlook is more optimistic this week, but Michigan could still be without fullback Max Bredeson, who left the Maryland game on crutches.\nMichigan has faced three defenses in the same universe as Ohio State's -- Oklahoma, USC and Wisconsin -- and the latter two aren't nearly as good as Oklahoma or Ohio State. The Wolverines scored 36 total points in those three games. Ohio State has allowed more than 10 points only twice this season (14 to Penn State, 16 to Illinois). I'm not saying Michigan isn't capable of breaking through. It's a rivalry game, and rivalry games get weird. But the more likely outcome is Ohio State winning by double digits. The Pick: Ohio State -10.5 (-104) at Fanduel\nNo. 3 Texas A&M at No. 16 Texas (Friday): This is a tricky spot for Texas A&M. The Aggies are on the road, facing an old rival, and they have far more to lose. At 11-0, they're one win away from the SEC Championship Game and a shot at both the conference title and possibly the No. 1 overall seed. But if they slip, they won't make it to Atlanta even if Georgia and Alabama win. A&M lacks tiebreaker advantages over either program thanks to a far easier SEC schedule -- yes, every SEC slate is tough, but some are undeniably softer than others.Texas, meanwhile, has to win just to keep a puncher's chance at the playoff -- and to ruin its rival's perfect season. The Longhorns clearly haven't lived up to preseason expectations after opening at No. 1 and falling three times. It's hard to argue that qualifies as a good season. Still, the early hype has exaggerated the reaction to those losses. The Florida loss was brutal, but falling to Ohio State and Georgia is hardly disqualifying. That happens to just about everyone.\nI genuinely believe Texas is capable of pulling the upset. The offense has found real rhythm over the last month and should have some success against the Aggies' defense. The concern is the other side of the ball. As Texas' offense has surged, its defense has faded. The Longhorns have allowed at least 31 points in four straight games and now face one of the most balanced, efficient offenses in the nation. That's a tough matchup.Which is why I'm staying away from the spread. My instinct says the total is a touch low. It'll take at least 30 points to win, and neither team figures to pull too far away from the other. The Pick: Over 51.5 (-110) at FanduelLock of the Week\nUCF at BYU: There are plenty of Big 12 Championship Game scenarios for BYU, but there's also an extremely simple one: win and you're in. Even if BYU were to reach the title game and lose, that defeat would seriously damage its playoff hopes. If the Cougars win here and then fall to Texas Tech again, they could still slip in as an at-large.\nSo BYU has to win this game -- and it probably will. Have you seen UCF's offense on the road this season? It's horrific. Honestly, it hasn't been good anywhere. The Knights rank 96th nationally at 1.91 points per possession and 113th in success rate at 38.9%. But away from the Bounce House, things get downright bleak. In four road games, they've averaged just 0.91 points per possession and 10.8 points per game.BYU doesn't have an elite defense, but it's a good one -- and it's a headache to deal with in Provo. The Pick: UCF Team Total Under 14.5 (-125) at DraftkingsHat Game of the Week\nNorthwestern at Illinois: The most important rivalry game of the week -- if not of all time. There's a hat on the line here, people. Northwestern found itself in an unexpected shootout last week, beating Minnesota 38-35 to clinch bowl eligibility. Illinois, meanwhile, suffered a shocking 27-10 loss at Wisconsin. But that loss might actually work to our advantage here.\nFalling to Wisconsin should serve as a bucket of cold water for the Illini, and this is a better matchup for them, even if Northwestern has the better record. Illinois' offensive line has struggled against the better defensive fronts it has faced, and for all of Wisconsin's problems, that defensive front is still solid. Northwestern, meanwhile, has struggled to stop competent passing offenses, and Illinois is far more effective through the air than on the ground.And while Illinois' overall defensive numbers don't look great, a lot of that comes from games against Indiana, Ohio State and Washington. Against teams in Northwestern's tier, the Illini defense has been much stronger. The Pick: Illinois -7 (-108) at DraftkingsOver of the WeekArmy at UTSA: UTSA's games at the Alamodome are a different animal than their road contests. The Roadrunners are averaging 50.2 points per game at home compared to just 21.7 on the road. Home games have also averaged 75.4 points total, helping the over go 5-0 and finish an average of 17.3 points above the final listed total.\nBased on how UTSA has fared offensively against teams like East Carolina, Tulane, Rice, and even Texas A&M (on the road), they should move the ball effectively against Army. And Army, in turn, should have some success against the Roadrunners' defense. The Pick: Over 51.5 (-115) at FanduelUpset of the Week\nKentucky at Louisville: I'm 1-11 on these picks this year, so I get if Louisville fans are feeling suddenly confident about this weekend. I doubt it, though. They've been paying attention to their team and know things haven't gone well since the upset win over Miami in October. After following it with two wins, they've dropped three straight. Following a 20-19 loss to Clemson, QB Miller Moss spoke about cultural issues on the team that couldn't be fixed. He then suffered a weight-room injury that caused him to miss last week's 38-6 loss at SMU.Now, Louisville coach Jeff Brohm says that if Moss is healthy this week, the Cards may still play two quarterbacks. That's not exactly a vote of confidence in Moss, but it could force Kentucky to prepare for two different styles. How much it matters is unclear. The vibes in Louisville are extremely low. Kentucky lost last week but had won three straight entering that game. The Wildcats have won six of the last eight meetings, and there's a good chance they make it seven of nine. The Pick: Kentucky (+124) at Drafkings\nBetsLast WeekSeasonUnitsGames of the Week1-113-13-2.34Lock of the Week0-15-8-3.71Upset of the Week0-11-12-10.07Overall1-534-44-14.66\n            ",

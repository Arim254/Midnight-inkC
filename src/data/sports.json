    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler on Sunday earned his 20th victory on the PGA Tour in just his 151st career start. The world No. 1 looked the part in his season debut, overcoming a one-stroke deficit to Si Woo Kim at the 54-hole mark to enter the winner's circle at the 2026 American Express.Scheffler signed for a final-round 66 at Pete Dye's Stadium Course, running away from the field. Reaching 27 under for the tournament, Scheffler's margin of victory stood at four strokes over Jason Day, Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, the latter of whom posed as his closest pursuer for much of the back nine on Sunday.The win represents plenty in the context of Scheffler's career. It is the earliest in the calendar year that he has won on the PGA Tour. It is also his seven win in his last 13 starts as he won six of the last 12 tournaments he played on the PGA Tour in 2025.With the victory, Scheffler becomes the first player since Rory McIlroy at the 2021 CJ CUP to win 20 times on the PGA Tour; he's the 40th in history to accomplish the feat.\nWinning 20 times in 151 starts, Scheffler trails only Tiger Woods (95) and Jack Nicklaus (127) as the third-quickest ever to the key number. Scheffler also joins Woods and Nicklaus as the only players to emerge victorious in 20 PGA Tour events and four major championships before the age of 30. Despite a nine-win campaign in 2024 that included seven PGA Tour victories, an Olympic gold medal and a successful defense at the Hero World Challenge -- and a 2025 in which he won two major championships despite not raising a trophy until May amid an offseason hand injury -- Scheffler appears primed to challenge if not surpass those efforts just 72 holes into his 2026 season.One day after Scheffler struggled with his scoring clubs, he let the field know that he had righted those wrongs on the opening hole. Throwing a dart to 4 feet on the par-4 1st, he caught Kim immediately and never looked back. Scheffler kicked in four birdies from inside 5 feet across his first seven holes and added another from 10 feet before making the turn.\nThe same story continued to unravel on the inward half as Scheffler imposed his will. A birdie from 2 feet came on No. 11, another from 2 feet on the next and a driven wedge to a back pin location on No. 14 led to another conversion from 4 feet. As the back nine progressed, it was no longer a question of whether Scheffler would win but rather how deep his margin would grow. As the year progresses, the question may turn from wondering which tournaments Scheffler will win to which he will not. Grade: A+\nT2. Ryan Gerard (-23): Fresh off a runner-up finish at the Sony Open, Gerard kept his foot on the gas on the mainland. Stretching back to his start in Mauritius last fall on the DP World Tour, he now has three straight runner-up results. The confidence is continuing to snowball as the game makes one leap after another. While the bread and butter of his game is typically his ball striking, Gerard found success this week on and around the greens. He will win again this season, and it will likely come sooner than later. Grade: A\nT6. Si Woo Kim (-22): The four-time PGA Tour winner looked up to the task in the early stages of the final round; Kim gave himself birdie chance after birdie chance on his front nine. He was well within range of Scheffler before disaster struck on the par-5 8th, where he made a mess around the green and made a double bogey without losing a golf ball. Some interesting decisions and the inability to cash in early chances proved to be Kim's downfall, but this week proved that, when he putts well, he will position his name on the first page of the leaderboard given his current ball-striking acumen. Grade: B+T18. Blades Brown (-19): Facing an opportunity to become the second-youngest winner on the PGA Tour, Brown acquitted himself nicely in the final group alongside Scheffler and Kim. He made an early birdie and appeared comfortable but made a fatal mistake when he found the water off the tee on the par-5 5th, leading to a double bogey. The 18-year-old was never able to recover from there, but the experience will prove beneficial as he continues to progress in his career. He battled tough but was unable to remain inside the top 10 and earn a spot in next week's Farmers Insurance Open. Grade: A+T18. Will Zalatoris (-19): In his first PGA Tour start since last spring's PGA Championship, Zalatoris jumped out of the gate with a 7-under 65. The wiry right-hander continued to show promise in ball-striking areas, but in a tournament that requires piling up birdies, he was ultimately left in the dust ahead of his sizzling 64 on Sunday. There are a lot of positive signs to take from the week, as he was among the leaders in greens in regulation and strokes gained tee to green. That's a recipe for success and one which Zalatoris has mastered throughout his career. \n\"Really good besides a couple holes on the Nicklaus Course,\" Zalatoris said. \"I putted really well, been working with Blair Phillips at home. It's been a massive change taking ownership on the putting green, and I think, this year, you're going to see a massive difference in my putting this year in general. Yeah, it's nice to, any 64 on Sunday feels pretty good, especially after the last three years I've been through.\" Grade: BT18. Rickie Fowler (-19): Fowler quietly entered 2026 with a ton of momentum following his run in last season's FedEx Cup Playoffs. Despite tinkering with his bag configuration and putting a new putter in place, the fan favorite did not miss a beat. After carding three bogeys at La Quinta Country Club on Thursday, Fowler played his final 54 holes in bogey-free fashion, including no squares on his scorecard across his two rounds at the more difficult Stadium Course. He may have some work to convert more scoring chances, but any time clean cards stack up, that's a good thing. Grade: B-\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As players were being introduced ahead of Unrivaled action on Sunday, three-time WNBA champion Breanna Stewart held up a sign that said \"Abolish ICE,\" when her name was called. Stewart's action comes in the wake of federal immigration officers killing a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the city, and other across the country, calling for ICE to be abolished.After the game on Sunday, Stewart expanded on her decision to hold up the sign.\"Really all day yesterday, I was just disgusted from everything that you see on Instagram and in the news,\" Stewart said. \"Everyone here [at Unrivaled] is feeling that way, one way or another. We're so fueled by hate right now instead of love, so I wanted to have a simple message of 'Abolish ICE,' which means having policies to uplift families and communities instead of fueling fear and violence.\"Stewart also shared her personal connection to this specific issue, as her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, is not a U.S. citizen as she's from Spain.\n\"It's scary,\" Stewart said. \"You see it on social media, you see it splitting up families and dissecting communities and kids are being involved. It's the worst in all ways. And to be married to Marta ... we're working to get her citizenship, and she is a legal permanent resident and all of that. But it seems like it doesn't matter. And I think that that's why these policies need to be put in place, that reform needs to happen, because it doesn't seem to be affecting the right people. It's not helping anybody.\"Unrivaled held a moment of silence before Saturday's games, with the public address announcer saying, \"Our thoughts and support are with everyone affected, and we send our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a loved one.\"While Stewart has made the most public statement on ICE and the recent tragedies happening in Minneapolis, she isn't the only member of Unrivaled or the WNBA to share the same sentiments. Minnesota native and 2025 No. 1 overall pick Paige Bueckers pledged to match the $50,000 she won in Unrivaled's free-throw challenge to donate to the Hopkins Strong Relief Fund, which aids with food security in Minnesota.\nWNBPA executive committee member Brianna Turner took to social media to share similar sentiments about ICE.\"My thoughts are constantly with the [Minnesota] residents who are suffering through a politically motivated ICE invasion,\" Turner wrote on social media. \"There is nothing positive about improperly trained federal agents profiling individuals & antagonizing communities. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.\"WNBA players are no stranger to speaking up on matters like these. In 2020, they were at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement amongst athletes. This has been no different.\n\"I think doing whatever you can to help your community [is important],\" Stewart said. \"Obviously, Minnesota is the place that everyone's seeing is in crisis, but it's happening in many more cities than just one, and knowing the right people to reach out to -- your local council person, your mayor, your governor -- and really advocating to change the policies and advocating for reform, knowing that it's not going to happen overnight.Stewart continued.\"But how many times do we have to see it happen over and over and over again and using our platform to make sure that we're trying to make a change and a difference and hopefully save a life.\"\n            ",

There were plenty of surprises in this matchup, whether it was the 17 total points scored or how the weather went from beautiful to a nightmarish blizzard in the second half. It was actually a surprise that secured the game for the Patriots, as quarterback Drake Maye went rogue on a third-and-5 to move the chains and run out the clock late in the fourth quarter. According to The Boston Herald, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called an outside zone run for Rhamondre Stevenson on third down with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots held a three-point lead, and their defense was playing well -- holding Denver scoreless since the first quarter. Instead of handing the ball to Stevenson, Maye kept it and ran out to the left -- beating the Broncos defense for a first down. \"I hit my block, and all the defenders started running the other way,\" Patriots center Garrett Bradbury said. \"I'm like, 'What? Oh my God.'\"\nMaye told his teammates after the game that he debated telling them he was going to keep the ball. He decided against it. \n\"After the game, Drake's like, 'I debated telling you guys if I was gonna (keep) it or not. But I just decided not to,\" Bradbury said.Maye completed 10 of 21 passes for 86 yards on Sunday, becoming just the second quarterback since 1990 to win a conference championship game while throwing for under 100 yards, the other being Jimmy Garoppolo in 2019. However, Maye made an impact with his legs, rushing 10 times for 65 yards and the Patriots' lone touchdown of the game.\nThanks to Maye's gamble, the Patriots find themselves in the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019.\n            \n    ",

For the second time in NFL history, the big game will feature the New England Patriots facing the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots punched their ticket to Super Bowl LX with a 10-7 win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship. The two teams combined for the second-lowest point total in AFC title game history (Dolphins 14-0 over Jets in 1982).The Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl for an NFL-record 12th time, and to get there, Drake Maye did something that Tom Brady never did: He won a playoff game in Denver. Brady went 0-3 in his career in the Mile High city with two of those losses coming in an AFC title game. On Seattle's end, the Seahawks earned their way to the Super Bowl by beating the Rams in a 31-27 thriller. Sam Darnold threw for 332 yards and three touchdowns in the win. The Seahawks are now headed to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in franchise history and the first time since the 2014 season when they faced the Patriots. In that game, Russell Wilson was famously picked off by Malcolm Butler at the 1-yard line with under 30 seconds left to play in a game that the Patriots ended up winning 28-24. Super Bowl LX will feature the AFC's highest-scoring offense going up against a Seahawks defense that gave up the fewest points in the NFL this year. Not only that, but the matchup on the other side of the ball should also be solid with the NFL's third-highest scoring offense in Seattle going up against a Patriots defense that surrendered the fourth-fewest points in the league this year. A great AFC offense vs. a great NFC defense? A great AFC defense vs. a great NFC offense? We could be in for another classic, just like the two teams gave us in Super Bowl XLIX. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25AFC Championship(2) Patriots 10-7 over (1) Broncos. This was a dominant performance by a New England defense that has now played three straight dominant games in the playoffs. The Broncos scored on their second possession of the game, but after that, the Patriots' defense shut Denver down. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter when the Patriots forced a Jarrett Stidham fumble that New England recovered at Denver's 12-yard line. Drake Maye scored on a 6-yard run just two plays later to provide the Patriots' only touchdown of the game. Maye didn't put up huge numbers, but he came up big with his legs: Not only did he score, but he also iced the win with a 7-yard run on third-and-5 with under two minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. NFC Championship\n(1) Seahawks 31-27 over (5) Rams. With a trip to the Super Bowl on the line Sam Darnold came up big for the Seahawks. Darnold threw for a season-high 346 yards along with three touchdowns to propel Seattle to the win. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who has been Darnold's favorite weapon all season, had another huge game. JSN caught 10 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks defense struggled some against Matthew Stafford, but the unit also came up with a huge stop on a fourth-down play from Seattle's 6-yard line in the fourth quarter that essentially sealed the win. Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8Patriots vs. Seahawks -- Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Divisional Round resultsSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Vine and UAE Team Emirates XRG teammate Mikkel Bjerg crashed into one of the animals after it hopped into the peloton. Bjerg and three other cyclists -- Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese -- were knocked out of the race because of the crash. The kangaroo was also injured and visibly struggled to make its way out of the road.Vine exchanged bikes with a teammate and rejoined the peloton multiple kilometers down the road. The incident occurred during a high-speed stretch of an eight-lap circuit outside of Adelaide.\nVine entered Stage 5 with a 1:03 lead over Switzerland's Mauro Schmid and won the tour by that exact margin despite the crash. He lost four of his six teammates throughout the tour because of multiple crashes, including the one with the kangaroos. His team announced that Jhonatan Narváez sustained several stable thoracic vertebrae compression fractures in one of those other accidents.\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" Vine said after the race. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.\n\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"\n            \n    ",

The team coached by Cristian Chivu, despite suffering and conceding two goals in the first half to Pisa, in the end managed to win 6-2 at San Siro on Friday, while both Napoli and AC Milan failed to win on Sunday. Antonio Conte's side faced another challenging match and lost 3-0 to Juventus in Turin, basically saying goodbye to their chances of winning the back-to-back Scudettos while AC Milan drew 1-1 against AS Roma. Despite avoiding defeat in their away match in Rome, AC Milan remain five points behind the Nerazzurri, but they could benefit in the coming weeks from the fact that Chivu's side are facing a crucial and demanding month in their Champions League campaign.Here's what to know:\nInter atop the standingsInter came out of the weekend as the leading candidates for the Scudetto and increased their gap on both AC Milan and Napoli. The side coached by Conte are now probably excluded from the chance of winning the Serie A title for the second season in a row, while Inter are now in the best position possible but will also likely have to face the Champions League playoffs next month, increasing the matches they will have to play in a key month for both Serie A and European campaigns. Chivu was able to rotate his team in the past weeks and some new faces emerged as crucial, starting with Italian young star Francesco Pio Esposito, who scored a key goal against Pisa and showed again to be an important player for Inter and potentially for Italy in the near future. The 18-year old was able to find his space in this team despite playing with some world-class stars such as Marcus Thuram, Lautaro Martinez and Yoan Bonny. Watch out for him. Napoli facing issuesConte is facing a difficult moment at Napoli, especially due to injuries. The Azzurri were not able to rotate as much as the Italian coach was hoping to and now Napoli are nine points behind Inter in the Serie A standings. That's a gap that will be difficult to overcome. The Italian manager was unhappy with the performance of the Azzurri that lost 3-0 in Turin against Juventus but also underlined once again how difficult the season is going. Conte was forced to play with new signing Giovane in the second half after the club decided to loan Noa Lang to Galatasaray and sold Lorenzo Lucca to Nottingham Forest. Speaking to DAZN after the match, Conte said, \"For the first time in my career, I had to play a player I had never even seen before. Now this has happened to me as well. I haven't trained him for even a single minute.\" Napoli will face Chelsea on Wednesday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona live on Paramount+ in a key match that might also affect the future of the Italian coach as the Azzurri are at risk of being eliminated in the league phase.\nAS Roma help Chivu \nThe AS Roma draw against AC Milan helped Inter to increase their gap with the city rivals but also meant Gian Piero Gasperini's team are now in third place, tied on points with Napoli behind Inter and the Rossoneri. Week by week, AS Roma are improving, and new signing Robinio Vaz showed Gasperini's vision for this team in the long term -- young players who can adapt to his attacking style, something his team probably lacked during the opening months of his stint in Rome. It's too early to understand the impact of the new signing, but even if he only played a few minutes, he looks way more tactically involved than other attacking players that are set to leave the team in the summer, such as Artem Dovbyk or Evan Ferguson. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The NBA announced two Sunday games have been postponed: Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks at the Milwaukee Bucks.The Grizzlies game was originally scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET, but was rescheduled due to inclement weather in Memphis. The Memphis Police Department asked residents to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary, as the city deals with a combination of snow, sleet and ice. The latest updates have Memphis seeing up to three inches of snow, as well as below freezing temperatures across the city. A make-up date for the game has yet to be announced.The Mavericks never even made it Milwaukee for their Sunday night game against the Bucks. Dallas was stuck on the tarmac at the airport for over four hours due to snow and ice in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The Mavericks were scheduled to leave late Saturday night after a 116-110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, the team's flight had been rescheduled to Sunday because of the weather. The make-up game between Dallas and Milwaukee could reportedly take place either Monday, which would cause a back-to-back for Milwaukee, or after the All-Star break on Feb. 19, per the Dallas Morning News. The decision of when the game takes place will be dependent on if the Mavericks can get to Milwaukee later on Sunday or Monday morning. \nThough it wasn't a postponement, the Charlotte Hornets' game against the Washington Wizards on Saturday was moved up six hours because of inclement weather. The same has happened across college basketball.The start time of three ACC men's basketball games were moved up due to the weather on Saturday, including Wake Forest at Duke, North Carolina at Virginia, and Virginia Tech at Louisville. Xavier also moved up its start time against St. John's. No. 21 Georgia has also moved its game against Tennessee from Tuesday to Wednesday.\nOn the women's basketball side, No. 1 ranked UConn moved its matchup against Seton Hall from Sunday to Saturday. No. 14 Baylor's home game against Houston was pushed from Sunday to Tuesday. That's just a couple from an ever-growing list of games being pushed up, or altogether rescheduled due to this storm.\n            \n    ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough.

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- It has been apparent for some time that the club best placed to stop Arsenal winning the Premier League is Arsenal. Here was the blueprint for how they would do it. The performance was bad, the decision-making was questionable, the tension was overwhelming. Throw that into the mix with some incredible finishing from Manchester United, and you have the sort of strange brew that can convince the league leaders that they cannot achieve what is so comfortably within their capabilities.This was a team that, Sunday at least, seemed to have internalized that meme, the Arsenal-labelled figure holding an Arsenal-balled metal pipe, ready to slam it down on an Arsenal-labelled head. They had been plain-sailing before a clumsy pass by Martin Zubimendi handed Bryan Mbeumo an equaliser, but, you know what, that really wasn't any reason for the headloss that follows. Teams give away sloppy goals all the time, most of them a lot more frequently than Arsenal.All that was required from then on was to get back to the team they had been beforehand. They were controlling the game with and without the ball, manufacturing transition moments for themselves on the rare occasions United advanced the ball upfield and baiting Senne Lammens to hoof the ball straight back to them through their press. A flick by Patrick Dorgu when a cross went into the box muddied the statistical waters, but effectively Arsenal's first goal came from a 26-pass sequence in which they pulled their opposition one way and another before applying the killer blow.At their peak, Arsenal proved they had the quality of champions. That has never been in question. What doubts there have been are over their temperament and those were only vindicated when they let the leash off their inner saboteur. \nArteta was not quite sure how to explain the clumsy run of misplaced passes that ended with United's equalizer. He said of it, \"The fact that you want to be more protective probably doesn't help to make those mistakes because there were three or four, to be fair, that were very unusual today in the game, and they are part of football. \"Sometimes you get punished and sometimes not, and today we got punished, and apart from that, we have to give credit to the opponent for what they've done and in the manner that they managed to win the game.\"\n        \n            \n                Mikel Arteta urges Arsenal fans to 'create more energy' at Emirates ahead of Manchester United clash\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDon't take anything away from Manchester United, whose three goals were uniformly excellent, even the one provided for them by Zubimendi. They opened the door to a glass cage of emotions. It was Arsenal, though, that threw away the key.\nOne mistake after the opener begat another begat another. Dorgu's thunderbolt was enough to momentarily discombobulate any team but there were still what proved to be 47 minutes left to play. You would not have known it by the way Arsenal went about their task.Too much haste, too little control. Declan Rice can bend them in from almost anywhere, but with 25 minutes to go and Arsenal setting up court on the edge of the United box, a low probability swing like that just gave Lammens a chance to let the clock run and the nerves build. That was typical of the second half. If there was bait left out for the Gunners, they'd foul it. At a time when Michael Carrick was perfectly happy for his side to drop deep and defend, Arsenal somehow managed to rapidly increase the speed of their attacking sequences and cut the average number of passes. In the desperate late charge, such an approach is totally understandable, perhaps even optimal. With nearly half a game to go, though, the league leaders shouldn't be in Hail Mary mode just because they're a goal down.Within minutes of United's second, Arteta had made four substitutions that he would insist afterwards brought control to the game. It is fair to acknowledge that none of Zubimendi, Piero Hincapie, Martin Odegaard nor Gabriel Jesus were setting the occasion alight. However, the latter two in particular would have enabled Arsenal to play a better version of the possession-dominant approach that had them on top early on. Though Mikel Merino's introduction proved valuable -- his bundling home of a corner late on raised hopes of a mentality-affirming comeback -- both the players and the message sent from a quadruple change seemed to heighten the sense of desperation in the air. Arteta's geeing up of supporters only added to that.\nOne of Arteta's great triumphs has been to change the energy of the Emirates Stadium, a ground that until recently seemed to believe it could will goals without any need for Arsenal players to get involved. Now this seems a crowd crushed by the unbearable weight of being on the cusp of greatness. Once Mbeumo equalized, almost every misplaced pass or move that wasn't brought audible despair. The players are responsible for their performance, but it cannot be denied that it is a harder environment for them to excel when there are so many nerves being transmitted in their direction.Whether it was more than that at halftime and at the final whistle might depend on where you sat. There were suggestions of a smattering of boos for a team that is still four points clear at the top of the Premier League. Though they weren't audible in the West Stand, there were still visible incidents of fans berating each other amid the exodus that followed Matheus Cunha's goal. In that moment, it was as if north London had travelled back to 2016 and the internecine wars of Arsene Wenger's final days. \"We have to understand that we all want to win,\" said Arteta, \"and the crowd is trying to be behind the team to make the best decisions and to win the game.\" None of that is untrue. The frustrations and fears are valid. It doesn't mean they are helpful. \nThe counterpoint is that Arsenal have been here for years now. Their fans know what it feels like to fall short because it feels like that is what has been happening right the way through. It hasn't really though, has it? Last season, injuries turned a title challenge from likelihood to impossibility by Christmas. No one wants to hear how the underlying data pointed to a team due a slowdown for most of 2022-23, but it did suggest that a young side would never be able to hold out against prime Manchester City. Only in 2023-24 did Arsenal really have a chance down the stretch. This is hardly the work of serial bottlers. Sometimes you go 16-1-1 and City still do enough.No one seems to believe this to be true, though, and right now, facts really are being eclipsed by feelings. The critique offered by Patrick Vieira was not that this team lacked quality or depth but that they might not have the mental strength of champions, something he knows only too well as the captain of sides who both went unbeaten in 2003-04 and who had collapsed down the stretch a year earlier.\"We accept every opinion, where it comes and where it's coming from, and they will have the right reason to say it,\" said Arteta of Vieira. \"At the end, we have to show the mental strength that we have on the pitch when it comes to a match day.\n\"We were absolutely brilliant in Milan, and today we weren't that good. I don't know if it was mental, because of how much they played, but because we were poor, especially technically in certain aspects of the game, against a team that when you make those mistakes, they can punish you big time. That was the difference.\"Arsenal were poor, United impressive but this was still a game decided by two wonder goals and one rare error from Zubimendi. The foundations are solid and though there is work to do on the attack -- isn't there always? -- the opposition have to do quite remarkable things to get two or more goals against Arteta's men.Arsenal could do with remembering that. It's how they got themselves a sizeable lead over rivals who don't look like they can consistently eat into it. Arsenal may be the best placed club to stop Arsenal winning the Premier League, but they're also the club who might only need to shut out the voices if they are to win the greatest prize.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fans attending today's AFC Championship between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots will need to bundle up. The weather in Denver is expected to be a high of 26 degrees and a low of 7 degrees, per weather.com.The game starts at 3 p.m. ET, 1 p.m. local time, so the temperatures will be closer to the high. At kickoff, the temperature will be 25 degrees, with a real feel of 16 degrees, and a 2% chance of precipitation. The temperature will drop one degree for the next two hours, then go down to 20 degrees, with a real feel of 6 degrees, and a 43% chance of precipitation at 4 p.m. local time, which would be towards the end of the game.There is an 80% chance of snow, with one inch expected, and winds up to 20 miles per hour. Sunset will take place at 5:11 p.m., so players and fans should get sun for the entirety of the game, helping those cold temperatures feel a little less brutal.There will be partly cloudy skies in the morning with occasional snow showers in the afternoon. The day is described as \"very cold\" by weather.com. \nFollow live updates of Broncos vs. Patriots in AFC Championship.But how the weather will affect the game will be the bigger question for fans, as well as for other interested parties. A 12 mph wind may have a slight impact the passing or kicking game, however, that calculus changes if that's combined with an active snow fall. Science tells us that as it gets colder the resistance increases, making it harder to have longer kicks. At the same time, Denver's mile-high elevation does enable a kicked ball to travel a few yards further than one at sea level, assuming all other conditions are constant.Former Patriots kicker and four-time Super Bowl champion Adam Vinatieri will serve as New England's honorary captain today, and certainly has experience with kicking in the cold. He has talked about the feeling of the ball changing due to cold weather, saying it was like \"kicking a brick.\"Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has struggled with fumbles in the last two playoff games, with six in the wins. His ability to maintain control of the ball could be a big factor in which team makes it to Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday, Feb. 8.\nThe cold weather makes reaction times slower and changes the density of the air, which can impact the passing game.In a 2024 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins, the -4 temperature had visible impact. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a chunk of his helmet come off after a hit and the leading theory is it happened due to the cold weather. In the same game, coach Andy Reid's mustache froze and water froze instantly.Sometimes, cold weather can be an advantage for the home team, if they are playing a team from warm weather, but in this case, both squads are used to frigid temps. \nWeather aide, the Patriots are 0-4 against the Broncos in the playoffs when the game is played in Denver. Then again, that last postseason meeting between these two teams was 10 years ago and so all of the key players are different.The weather in the NFC Championship between the Seahawks and Rams in Seattle will be balmy by comparison. Sunday's forecast at kickoff is expected to be sunny and 44 degrees with virtually no wind. It'll will likely dip into the upper 30s during the second half, and the chance of rain is extremely low. The AFC Championship will be broadcast on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ at 3 p.m. ET and the NFC Championship can be seen on Fox at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The matchup is set. It'll be the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots duking it out for the right to lift the Lombardi Trophy and call themselves Super Bowl LX champions. These clubs find themselves en route to Santa Clara for the big game after eking out wins on Championship Sunday, albeit in different fashions. Seattle had to throw its way to a Super Bowl appearance as Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship. Meanwhile, New England churned out a 10-7 win during a snowy AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos at Mile High. The Patriots leaned on defense and Drake Maye's rushing ability to punch their ticket. While these are widely different versions of these clubs, this is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back during the 2014 season. That game is remembered most for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception to give Tom Brady and the Patriots their then-fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history, and spoil Russell Wilson and the Seahawks bid at back-to-back championships. That's the history. But what does the future have in store for us in this upcoming Super Bowl? What do the oddsmakers think of this matchup? Below, we'll comb over the initial lines for Super Bowl LX and also highlight some of the notable favorites for Super Bowl MVP. NFL odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\nGameEarly LineEarly TotalEarly MoneylineSeahawks vs. PatriotsSeahawks -4.546.5Seahawks -230, Patriots +190While Lumen Field and Gillette Stadium are two of the better home-field advantages that the NFL has to offer, both Seattle and New England were superb on the road this season, which could help them on this neutral site at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl LX. With their win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship, New England became the first team in NFL history to go 9-0 on the road. Mike Vrabel's team was also 7-2 ATS in those nine road matchups. As for Seattle, they did not go undefeated on the road like the Patriots, but were an equally impressive 8-1 on the road. They also come into this Super Bowl with an NFL-best 8-1 ATS road record. \nPlayerSuper Bowl MVP oddsSam Darnold+130Drake Maye+235Jaxon Smith-Njigba+550Kenneth Walker III+600Rhamondre Stevenson+2500Rashid Shaheed+2800Marcus Jones+5500Stefon Diggs+6000Naturally, both quarterbacks are going to be No. 1 and No. 2 in the odds to win Super Bowl MVP. With the Seahawks favored, it makes sense to see Darnold as the odds-on favorite for the award. Seven of the last 10 Super Bowl MVPs were quarterbacks. Two of the remaining three were wide receivers (Cooper Kupp in Super Bowl LVI and Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII), while Von Miller (Super Bowl 50) was the other non-QB MVP and lone defensive player to earn the distinction over the last decade. \nInterestingly, both Kenneth Walker III and Rhamondre Stevenson have favorable odds out of the gate. If either of them is named Super Bowl MVP, they'd become the first running back to earn the award since Terrell Davis after Super Bowl XXXII. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seahawks enter conference championship weekend as the Super Bowl favorites looking to win their second championship in franchise history. The first one came thanks to a stunning 43-8 thrashing of Peyton Manning and the Broncos' record-setting offense in Super Bowl XLVIII.If the Seahawks are going to repeat what they did a dozen years ago, it will be with the same formula: the occasional explosive pass with a punishing ground game backed by the NFL's top scoring defense. It worked for Russell Wilson (in his second season), Marshawn Lynch and the \"Legion of Boom\" and it could work with Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the \"Dark Side,\" which is Seattle's new self-ordained defensive nickname. The moniker could be a Nirvana track, but the defensive players chose the name because of the Pacific Northwest's gloomy weather during the fall and winter months of the season. Its defense was indeed so suffocating it earned Seattle the NFL's top scoring defense crown for the first time since the \"Legion of Boom\" did it a decade ago. Nasty defense has gotten Seattle this far. The Seahawks have allowed one touchdown in the last month. Their next challenge is the toughest: stop Sean McVay's No. 1 scoring offense and the possible MVP quarterback, Matthew Stafford, five weeks after they scored 37 on you in your building. If anyone can make the necessary adjustments to counter what happened in Week 16, it's Mike Macdonald's defense.To understand where this new defense can take them, you have to understand where it came from and how Seattle is looking to ride a new No. 1 group to a Super Bowl while evolving from the \"Legion of Boom\" glory days to the \"Dark Side\".\n\"Legion of Boom\" fall paved way for the \"Dark Side\"Richard Sherman, left, and Earl Thomas were two of the best defensive backs of their generation.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It's hard to talk about an elite defense in Seattle without waxing poetic about another Seahawks defense that used to give teams nightmares. The \"Legion of Boom\" went on one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history over a decade ago. They became the first team to lead the NFL in scoring defense for four straight seasons since the Cleveland Browns in the 1950s. They were debated as one of the best championship defenses of all-time alongside the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2002 Buccaneers for good reason. They pulled off one of the most incredible defensive feats in league history by holding the Broncos to eight points in the Super Bowl after Denver had scored an NFL-record 606 points during the regular season and Peyton Manning threw for 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns. All three records still stand today, even with a 17th game. One memory from this defense lives on. Richard Sherman's interview with Erin Andrews after making a deflection that was intercepted by future Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith to win the 2013 NFC Championship vs. the 49ers is immortal and stamped the Legion of Boom as the the defining force of their generation of football. \nThe \"LOB\" was a brand of big personalities, big hits (jumbo safety Kam Chancellor used to rock people) and playmaking (Earl Thomas' chase-down forced fumbles) that took over the NFL in a flash and it went away in the blink of an eye. Injuries, old age and contracts (they had to pay Russell Wilson) all caught up the league's most feared defense too fast. Sherman (torn Achilles), Thomas (broken leg) and Chancellor (neck) all suffered season-ending (or career ending in Chancellor's case) injuries that more or less ended their time in Seattle by 2018. It's a crime none of the trio played with the Seahawks into their thirties. Michael Bennett was also traded, Cliff Avril suffered a career-ending neck injury and poof, it was over.Mike Macdonald hired to be McVay and Shanahan's kryptoniteThe downfall of the LOB and the lessons learned led us to the next generation of defensive brilliance. \nAfter all, the Seahawks had one of the worst defenses in the NFL in the post-LOB days where Pete Carroll and Wilson won enough track meets to stay relevant but only managed one playoff win. A new wave of offensive gurus came into the division between Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay around the same time Seattle's defense began fading in 2017. Motion, jet sweeps, misdirection and deception became common NFL vernacular as Shanahan, McVay and Matt LaFleur's teams combined to score 99 points while eliminating the Seahawks in three playoff runs in 2019, 2020 and 2022. That made things crystal clear. A reset was needed. The counter move was to make then 36-year old Mike Macdonald the youngest head coach in the NFL after he led the 2023 Ravens to the title of top scoring defense as coordinator. Macdonald has proved to be exactly what the Seahawks needed as a great leader and communicator to usher in another winning culture while figuring out how to stop the NFC's best offenses. Seahawks general manager John Schneider said it best when he introduced Macdonald in 2024. \"This is the future right here, this is where it's going … I think you're going to learn in getting to know Mike that he's a special dude.\" \nHe was right. Macdonald's reputation from Baltimore has followed him to Seattle. The 2023 Ravens became the first team in NFL history to lead the league in scoring defense, takeaways and sacks in the same season, which was Macdonald's last with the club. Fast forward just two years and he's already rebuilt the Seahawks from the No. 25 unit in 2023 to the top defense in 2025.He's only the third coach since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger to be the defensive coordinator and head coach of a top scoring defense after pulling it off with the Ravens and Seahawks. The other two were Rex Ryan and Bill Belichick. Macdonald's own innovative thinking has already helped neutralize two of the best thinkers on the other side of the ball. The Rams and 49ers are averaging under 21 points per game in nine games vs. the Seahawks under Macdonald. Fittingly, Macdonald has a chance to get Seattle to the Super Bowl by going through the two coaches he was hired to beat. What a flex that would be.\nSchneider rebuilt the entire defense in four yearsThe Seahawks slowly pieced together the talent to fit Macdonald's scheme predicated on a dominant front four backed by a physical and versatile group of linebackers and defensive backs. Schneider built the unit through equal parts draft, free agency and trade. There's not a single defender in the group with an active tenure on the team longer than four years. It's been a complete rebuild that has this new core standing shoulder to shoulder with the LOB.Seahawks defense then and nowSuper Bowl XLVIII vs BroncosWeek 18, 2025 vs 49ersDECliff AvrilDemarcus LawrenceDTMichael BennettByron Murphy IIDTClint McDonaldLeonard WilliamsDEChris ClemonsUchenna NwosuLBKJ WrightDrake ThomasLBBobby WagnerErnest Jones IVCBRichard ShermanDevon WitherspoonCBByron MaxwellJosh JobeCBWalter ThurmondNick EmmanworiSEarl ThomasJulian LoveSKam ChancellorCoby BryantThe Seahawks have had an absurd hit rate in the draft in the last four years. 2022: It started with a masterclass in 2022. Boye Mafe, Coby Bryant and Riq Woolen -- all key players in this defense. 2023: Schneider hit the jackpot with All-Pro corner Devon Witherspoon in the first round in 2023. He's since become the third defensive back in the past 40 years to make a Pro Bowl in each of his first three years along with Charles Woodson and Patrick Peterson. Macdonald credits Witherspoon's development for freeing him up as a defensive play caller. 2024: Seattle drafted defensive tackle Byron Murphy in the first round the following year and he's been a game-wrecker on the inside. 2025: The final piece to bring the top defense together was 2025 first-round pick Nick Emmanwori, a swiss-army knife who has done everything from defending the run to blitzing and excelling in coverage.  So the top defensive player Seattle took in each of the last four drafts was Mafe, Witherspoon, Murphy and Emmanwori. Holy crap. The Seahawks have also signed or traded for four players that got a Pro Bowl or All-Pro selection in the last few seasons2023: Seattle signed former Giants safety Julian Love to an affordable three-year deal worth $33 million. He's one of many versatile, hard-hitting defensive backs on the team. Seattle traded a second and fifth-round pick for Leonard Williams, who has lined up (and dominated) everywhere on the front four2024: The Seahawks got another steal when they traded Jerome Baker and a fourth-round pick for linebacker Ernest Jones IV, who was a second-team All-Pro selection this season. He became the first linebacker with 125+ tackles and at least five interceptions in a season since LaVonte David in 2013. Macdonald praised him during before last week's win, \"to really man the middle of the defense, especially with how much split safety we play, that's a tall task, but he's nailed it.\"2025: The final piece on the Seahawks dominant front four was Demarcus Lawrence, signed to a three-year deal after an injury-plagued final year in DallasThey may not have a treasure trove of superstars or future Hall of Famers like the \"Legion of Boom\" just yet, but don't be surprised if a couple of them leave their mark and have a significant playoff moment on their way to a Super Bowl.How quickly Seattle built its new elite defenseAcquiredWhenDE Demarcus LawrenceFree agent2025DT Byron MurphyDraft2024DT Leonard WilliamsTrade2023DE Uchenna NwosuFree agent2022LB Drake ThomasFree agent2023LB Ernest Jones IVTrade2024CB Devon WitherspoonDraft2023CB Josh JobeFree agent2024CB Nick EmmanworiDraft2025FS Coby BryantDraft2022SS Julian LoveFree agent2023Fear the Seahawks' \"Dark Side\"Seattle's defense hasn't been together long, but it quickly has merged into the NFL's best.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Now you know the names, but you might not have caught on with the name. This isn't the \"Legion of Boom 2.0.\" This is a phoenix rising from the ashes of the \"LOB\" with a new identity. The old was one of the best secondaries in NFL history. The new is a ferocious front four with studs at all three levels. Leonard Williams explained the origin recently. \"We always hear of Legion of Boom,\" he said. \"We were starting to get to a point like. 'Hey, maybe we deserve our own name, you know?' I think guys started coming up with names and stuff like that and I think Dark Side kind of stuck with us.\"But what does it mean?\"The Dark Side is our defense. DLaw (Demarcus Lawrence) said it good at one point, he wants to turn the offense's lights off. We've shut offenses down with no touchdowns, no points at times, I think that's what it feels like when the \"Dark Side\" is playing against you, it's hard to get the ball moving, it feels like cutting your lights off, it feels like you're playing against 12 people.\"12 as 112 as 1 is one of Macdonald's core defensive principles that goes beyond just playing in front of the \"12\", as in Seattle's 12th Man, which the Seahawks will be doing on Sunday.\"A lot of times we see the ball carrier on the ground and pause the film to see how many blue helmets are in the picture,\" Williams said. \"A majority of the time it's nine players standing over the ball carrier ... over time that's overwhelming and intimidating to offenses. When the offensive guy is getting off the ground and seeing 10 Seahawks around him, after a while and getting hit by so many of us, getting swarmed by so many of us, it starts to feel like there's more than 11 of us on the field.\"A rewatch of the Seahawks demolition of the 49ers in their last two games underscored that assessment. The 49ers were seemingly immediately on their backs as soon as they caught the ball. They had just eight missed tackles across those two games. In Week 18, the 49ers managed their third-worst yards after catch average (2.6) in nine years under Shanahan. \"All 11 guys make it feel like 12 to the football,\" Witherspoon said. \"We play with relentless energy and swag.\" Seattle's defensive ranks this seasonNFL RankPPG17.21stDef EPA/gm7.81stPts/drive1.481stYards/rush3.71stYards/att5.52ndThird down conv pct32%1stFront fourPersonnel-wise, the foundation of this special group is the front four. \"We wouldn't be here without how our defensive line has played,\" Macdonald said before the playoffs opened. Everything starts with them.The Seahawks allowed the fewest yards per rush in the NFL this year (3.7). They also got pressure at the sixth-highest rate in the league while blitzing at the seventh-lowest rate in the NFL. It's a similar formula that won Philadelphia the Super Bowl last year. You can put these four on an island and they can stop the run and create enough pressure without blitzing to help the secondary. Williams explained it like this, \"When we can play with two high safety and stop the run with just four down lineman, knowing at least two or three of us are getting double teams, that's mean we're not only stopping the double teams, we're beating the double teams, (Byron) Murphy is one of the best in the league that I've seen do it in my career.\"Williams and Murphy bring so much pressure and throw enough weight around to start a Beastquake 2.0. They have the most pressures (108), quarterback hits (35) and sacks (14.0) among any 300-pound duo this season.Versatility and controlled aggressionThe front four sets the tone and the versatility on all three levels brings it all together. Williams (defensive end, defensive tackle), Witherspoon (outside corner, slot corner) and Emmanwori (slot corner, linebacker) almost all split their playing time 50/50 at two positions. Rookie playmaker Nick Emmanwori is a Kyle Hamilton clone. The numbers between Hamilton and Emmanwori on Macdonald's top-scoring defenses are almost identical. 2023 Hamilton (BAL)2025 EmmanworiTackles8181Tackles for loss109QB hits44Passes defended1311Hamilton wears a ton of hats in Baltimore from box safety, to slot corner and deep safety and Emmanwori has been a major disruptor on Seattle's defense in a similar way. He has the fifth-most snaps played in the box among DBs (364). He's the chess piece that marries together an elite run defense with blanket coverage. The Seahawks are the first team since the 2015 Super Bowl-champion Broncos to rank top two in both yards per rush and yards per pass attempt allowed.It's an incredible feat, especially on the ground, considering since they play the least amount of base defense in the NFL and play among the most shell coverage.\"Some of the things you're going to ask Nick to do are a little different than what you'd ask a linebacker to do. But, in terms of how you manage your roster, he's basically playing the linebacker position,\" Macdonald said this week. \"We've essentially turned into a base 43 team with a crazy athletic SAM (linebacker), is what we are.\"The rookie was making highlights all over the field in Week 18 at San Francisco. \nHis presence was not lost on 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, who gave him his flowers the week leading up to their playoff matchup.  \"That's their personnel, that's what they want to do, and they have the people to do it, I mean you look No. 3 (Emmanwori), he's this nickel body for them, but he's so big and long, he has the ability to play the run at a very elite level, like a good linebacker,\" Kubiak said. \"But he's also really athletic and he can cover. He's really a jack of all trades.\"49ers quarterback Brock Purdy took note of Emmanwori's presence leading up to the game.\"He's a young, talented player that flies around, he's got length, he's gonna bring it for four quarters, he can cover, drop back in zone, he can do it all,\" Purdy said. Opposing coordinators and QBs always know where Emmanwori is on the field.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The former South Carolina Gamecock is having a similar impact to Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie, one of Steve Spagnuolo's key pieces during back-to-back Super Bowl runs. The Seahawks play almost exclusive zone coverage (80%, third highest in NFL) and rarely send extra pressure but when they do Macdonald comes from the Rex Ryan school of exotic blitzes. The Seahawks sent a defensive back pass rusher the fifth-most times in the NFL this year (109) and Emmanwori led all defensive backs in pressures (18).  When you can stop the run with a dominant front four and nickel or dime defense behind it, all without blitzing, all with two-high coverage, it's an incredible luxury in the passing game. No defense faces shorter passes on average than Seattle this year. They keep everything in front of them. This defense has not allowed a play to gain more than 20 yards in over a month. They are the only team since 2000 to go three straight games without allowing a play of more than 20 yards. That is why the 'Dark Side' is terrifying. Toughest challenge ahead vs. Rams on SundayIs it possible Los Angeles is the one team who doesn't fold vs. Seattle? The Seahawks have allowed six touchdowns in their last seven games, and four were against the Rams in Week 16. Sunday's rematch vs. the Rams No. 1 scoring offense is an opportunity to settle a score and for their biggest triumph yet. This is the ninth game between the No. 1 scoring offense and No. 1 scoring defense in the conference championship round or later since 1970. The top defense is 7-1 in the previous eight matchups, including wins by the \"Legion of Boom\" against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers in the 2014 NFC title game and the Broncos in the Super Bowl. The only offense to come out on top was the 49ers against the Broncos in the Super Bowl of the 1989 season. \nNo. 1 Scoring Offense vs. No. 1 Scoring Defense (Conf Champ or Later Since 1970)OffenseDefense2025 NFC ChampRamsSeahawks2016 Super BowlFalconsPatriots (won game)2014 NFC ChampPackersSeahawks (won game)2013 Super BowlBroncosSeahawks (won game)1990 Super BowlBillsGiants (won game)1989 Super Bowl49ers (won game)Broncos1984 Super BowlDolphins49ers (won game)1980 NFC ChampCowboysEagles (won game)1978 Super BowlCowboysSteelers (won game)The Rams will be joining them if they repeat what they did on offense last month when they dropped 37 points at Lumen Field. Matthew Stafford (457 yards, three touchdowns, no picks) and Puka Nacua (12 receptions, 225 yards, two scores) torched Seattle's secondary in historic fashion without the benefit of Davante Adams in the lineup. Stafford is the only QB in NFL history with 400-plus pass yards, at least three touchdown passes and no interceptions vs a team that finished with the NFL's top-scoring defense.A lot of his production in the pass game (15/24, 221 yards, three touchdowns) came with the Rams' patented 13 personnel vs. the Seahawks' patented nickel defense. Somehow, the Rams couldn't run the ball vs. Seattle's light defense, even with three tight ends on the field, but they had no problem passing it. Go figure. Nacua did a lot of the damage and he caught a pass on seven different defenders. The obvious solution would be to rotate more safety help and double team Nacua. Make someone else beat you. It'll be fascinating to watch the chess match on Sunday and see how Macdonald counters the success McVay had in their last matchup. The Seahawks may have gotten away with a win thanks to the luckiest two-point conversion of all-time (not to mention a bad illegal man downfield penalty that cost the Rams four points in the first quarter), but it will need answers on Sunday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SPOKANE, Wash. -- Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler scored 46 points. BYU freshman AJ Dybantsa had 43. Houston freshman Kingston Flemings finished with 42.Saturday was an incredible day of college basketball -- a reminder that I really do think we're watching the best freshman class in the sport's history. If you want a full recap, Matt Norlander and I discussed it for 83 minutes on the Eye On College Basketball podcast.And now I'm stuck at Gonzaga.A winter storm disrupting much of the country has made it impossible for me to get home to Memphis or back to work in New York. So here I am, stranded in Spokane after serving as the sideline reporter for CBS Sports Network during Gonzaga's 68-66 win over San Francisco on Saturday -- a result that pushed the Zags to 21-1 and up to No. 6 in Sunday morning's CBS Sports Top 25 And 1.Which brings me to a story.As I was sitting inside the McCarthey Athletic Center -- The Kennel -- on Saturday watching a future Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame coach guide one of the best college basketball programs in the country to another win that will eventually lead to a 27th straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament, I couldn't help but think about the first time I watched the Zags play. I remember it clearly. I was a senior at the University of Memphis, the sports editor of The Daily Helmsman. Like Saturday, I was sitting courtside -- but it was November 1998, inside The Pyramid in downtown Memphis.The Tigers were hosting Gonzaga.I'd never heard of Gonzaga.At the time, the small private school from the Pacific Northwest had made exactly one NCAA Tournament appearance and never won a game in the event. That all I knew. Then Richie Frahm scored 37 points, Gonzaga beat Memphis 88-73 and nobody quite knew what to make of it.\nWas Memphis bad? Was Gonzaga great?Turns out, the answer to both questions was yes. Roughly three months later, Gonzaga won its first NCAA Tournament game. Then another. Then another -- advancing all the way to the Elite Eight of the 1999 NCAA Tournament. The rest, as they say, is history.I told this story to Mark Few late Saturday.He smiled.It's crazy, any way you tell it. But think of it like this: Imagine somebody from the future floated into The Pyramid just before tip-off on Nov. 16, 1998, and said, \"You know this Gonzaga program from the West Coast Conference that's never won a game in the NCAA Tournament? It's about to make 26 straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament and advance far enough in two of them to play in the national championship game.\"What? How?It would've sounded impossible.And yet that's exactly what's happened over the past 27 seasons, which is a reminder that the streak would already be at 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances if not for the 2020 event being canceled. It's absurd. It's remarkable. It's one of the greatest stories in college sports history. So it was super-cool to be here Saturday and really fun to tell that story on \"The Mark Few Show\" after the Zags improved to 9-0 in the WCC.\nIt's one of the best stories in college sports history -- a basketball power with unlikely roots. Man, I didn't plan on getting stuck here this weekend. Getting stuck is never ideal. But, yeah, it was awesome to see the Zags up close again on Saturday, just like it was the first time, even if, the first time, back in 1998, none of us really had any idea what we were watching -- or a clue about the greatness coming next.\n        \n            \n                College basketball winners, losers, scores: Upsets by Auburn, Illinois, Texas Tech shake up conference races\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n Top 25 And 1 rankings \n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                4\n            \n                Vanderbilt\n            \n                7\n            \n                Purdue\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Arizona\n                                \n                            Brayden Burries finished with 22 points and seven assists in Saturday's 88-53 win over West Virginia.

    "body": "\n        Jarrett Stidham, step right up. The Broncos quarterback is now in line to start in the AFC Championship against the Patriots on Sunday after starter Bo Nix suffered a fracture in his right ankle during Denver's overtime win against the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Nix's injury will require surgery and sideline him for the rest of the season, meaning it'll be up to Stidham to help Denver advance to Super Bowl LX and possibly hoist its first Lombardi Trophy in a decade. That's a mighty tall order for the 29-year-old, who has just four career starts under his belt. Stidham's last regular-season pass in the NFL came all the way back in Week 18 of the 2023 campaign. Now, he'll be entrusted with a team that earned the No. 1 seed in the conference and boasts one of the top defenses in the league. However, that won't mean anything if Stidham can't answer the bell, but there does appear to be internal confidence in the veteran quarterback. \n        \n            \n                Broncos vs. Patriots prediction: Can Denver advance without Bo Nix or does New England return to Super Bowl?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I would say this, in fairness to what you've seen, which is very limited: He's ready,\" head coach Sean Payton told reporters of Stidham, via the official team website. \"He's ready. I said this at the beginning of the season, I feel like I've got a [No. 2 quarterback] that's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. Watch out. Just watch. He's experienced, he's played in games. They're different type players to some degree.\"\nAs Payton references, we've had a limited view of Stidham throughout his career and tenure with the Broncos, so let's get familiar with the signal caller who is set to lead Denver into the AFC Championship. \n⭐️ Five-star recruit entering collegeStidham was a highly regarded prospect coming out of high school (Stephenville, Texas), with 247Sports ranking him as a five-star recruit and the No. 1-ranked dual-threat quarterback in 2015 -- ahead of Kyler Murray (No. 2), Sam Darnold (No. 6), Joe Burrow (No. 7), and Lamar Jackson (No. 9). Stidham was an early Texas Tech commit, but decommitted from the Red Raiders following Patrick Mahomes' freshman season in Lubbock, in which it was clear Mahomes would be a start QB for then-coach Kliff Kinsburgy. Stidham flipped his commitment to Baylor, which had emerged as as Texas powerhouse during the early part of the decade, and got his feet wet. After beginning the year as the backup, an injury atop the depth chart saw Stidham ascend as the Bears' starter. In his first start against Kansas State, he tossed for 419 yards and had four total touchdowns. After the dismissal of head coach Art Briles, Stidham transferred to McClellan Junior College, where he sat out the season and maintained eligibility, then transferred to Auburn. where he went on to be named second-team All-SEC in 2017. That year, he led the Tigers to wins against No. 1-ranked Georgia and No. 1-ranked Alabama. Stidham's second season at Auburn was not as productive as the first, and he decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to declare for the 2019 NFL Draft. \nDrafted by Patriots, eyed as potential Tom Brady successorWith the 133rd overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, New England selected Stidham, who then found himself as the No. 2 on the depth chart behind Tom Brady. His first taste of NFL action was a forgettable experience, however. In Week 3, he came in for Brady in the fourth quarter of a blowout win over the New York Jets. After coming in, Stidham threw a pick-6 to Jamal Adams, which led to Brady coming back into the contest to finish the game. \nThat was the most action Stidham saw over his rookie season. His sophomore campaign, however, did provide some intrigue, particularly in the aftermath of Brady leaving the Patriots after the 2019 season for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \nStidham was looked at as a possible in-house option to succeed Brady, as New England did not add a clear-cut option at quarterback in the early stages of free agency (outside of a reunion with veteran Brian Hoyer) or at the 2020 NFL Draft. While it momentarily appeared Stidham could be an option for the Patriots as the franchise began the post-Brady era, those plans changed later that summer when the club signed Cam Newton. The former NFL MVP won the starting job, and Stidham lost out on the second-string job to Hoyer, demoting him to QB3. Stidham came in at various points throughout the year, including a Week 4 matchup with the Chiefs after Newton was sidelined due to COVID-19 protocol, and Hoyer struggled during the contest. He threw his first career touchdown in the losing effort, but also had two interceptions. \nDespite New England's struggles throughout the year, Bill Belichick never gave Stidham a look as a starter. \nThe following year, the Patriots drafted Mac Jones, and Hoyer remained as the backup, with Stidham not seeing the field at all during the 2021 season. Pats trade Stidham to Las VegasNew England ended up trading Stidham to the Las Vegas Raiders in May of 2022 in what was essentially a swap of Day 3 draft picks in 2023. That deal saw Stidham reunite with Josh McDaniels, who was hired as the Raiders head coach that offseason after serving as the Patriots offensive coordinator when he entered the league. Stidham began the year as a backup to Derek Carr, but he did get a look as the club's starter at the end of the season, starting both Week 17 and Week 18 for Las Vegas. \nThe club went 0-2, but Stidham's numbers weren't terrible, completing 64.3% of his passes, tossing four touchdowns and three interceptions, registering a 91.6 passer rating, and averaging 292 yards through the air. \nJoins Broncos, starts after Russell Wilson benchingIn 2023, Stidham signed a two-year, $10 million deal with the Broncos, who had just acquired head coach Sean Payton in a trade with the New Orleans Saints. In a similar situation to the one he found himself in the year prior with the Raiders, Stidham became Denver's starter at the end of the season after the Broncos benched Russell Wilson. Stidham went 1-1 over those starts in Week 17 and Week 18 of the 2023 campaign, and again put up serviceable numbers. He completed 60.6% of his passes, averaged 248 passing yards per game, had two touchdowns and one interception, and registered an 87.7 passer rating. That Week 18 game against the Raiders was the last time Stidham had thrown a meaningful pass in the NFL, until he drops back next Sunday in the AFC Championship. In that game specifically, he was 20 of 34 for 272 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He was also sacked five times in that contest. Is Stidham capable of leading Denver to Super Bowl LX?In a season as upside-down as the 2025 campaign, where quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, and Lamar Jackson were nowhere to be found this postseason, and a 44-year-old Philip Rivers came out of retirement to join the Colts, anything's possible, right? That said, this does feel like almost too big a hurdle to overcome for Stidham and the Broncos.\nBefore we highlight how things could go wrong, however, let's bullet some key factors that do fall in Denver's favor as they prepare for Stidham to start in the AFC Championship.The AFC Championship is at home at Mile High. Stidham won't have to add playing in a road environment to his plate. Meanwhile, their opponent will have the elevation as another adversary, and that did seem to impact the Bills. Stidham is familiar with the system. Stidham has been with the Broncos since 2023, which should make him well-versed in what Sean Payton asks of quarterbacks, albeit without a ton of starting experience.Stidham has started before. As we noted, Stidham doesn't have a lot of starting experience (four starts), but it's not zero, and that includes two starts with Payton's Broncos. He's not a rookie coming into this game 100% cold, which has to count for something. Stidham has also flashed a bit when given those opportunities.Broncos OL has protected well. During the regular season with Nix under center, the Broncos' offensive line allowed just 23 sacks, which was tied for the fewest in the NFL. Their 32.6% pressure rate allowed was also the fifth-lowest in the league, so Stidham should have some time to throw the football. Denver's defense, in theory, could carry Stidham. In an ideal world, the Broncos take a page out of the Seahawks' book from their divisional round win over the 49ers. In that win, they didn't ask Sam Darnold (who was dealing with an oblique injury) to do much, and attempted just 17 passes in the win. Denver would love a game script where the defense -- which ranked top three in points per game (18.3), yards per game (278.2), and third down percentage (33.8%) this season -- controls the game, and only needs Stidham to make a couple of necessary throws. Okay, that's the glass-half-full side of the equation. The other -- possibly more realistic -- side of things paints a grim picture. First off, turnovers could prove to be a problem for Stidham in the AFC Championship. He's tossed at least one interception in all but one of his four starts, and his teams are 1-3 in those contests.While there have already been some parallels drawn to Nick Foles leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl LII title after Carson Wentz got hurt in 2017 by those trying to hold onto a sliver of hope, it's hard to make that connection. Foles had 36 starts before joining the Eagles during that 2017 season, which included a Pro Bowl campaign in 2013. Stidham doesn't have anywhere near that same pedigree. \nStidham will be the seventh quarterback to make his first career start of the season in the playoffs. Frank Reich is the only one of the prior six to lead his team to a win. He's also the first quarterback to make his first start in the conference championship since Roger Staubach in 1972. First start of the season in playoffs -- QBs all-timePlayerResult2025Jarrett Stidham???2020Taylor HeinickeLost2016Connor CookLost2012Joe WebbLost1992Frank ReichWon two starts1983Gary DanielsonLost1972Roger StaubachLostWhat Stidham is attempting to do is essentially unprecedented, and will need to defy history if he wants to get Denver over the hump with an AFC Championship win and a trip to Super Bowl LX. \n            ",

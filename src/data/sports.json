Larry Hartstein, who is 25-15 (+835) over his last 40 Vikings ATS picks, is backing Washington (-1.5) to cover at home versus Minnesota on Sunday.\"The Commanders gave a spirited performance coming off their bye, losing by one in overtime to Denver. It was Washington's second solid effort in a row. Terry McLaurin's return made a huge difference, as did the presence of Daron Payne and Will Harris on defense. Now Washington visits a reeling Vikings team dealing with internal turmoil. It is unclear at the moment whether J.J. McCarthy and Jayden Daniels will return.

    "body": "\n        Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray will not play again this season, coach Jonathan Gannon announced on Friday. Murray hasn't taken a snap since Oct. 5 due to a mid-foot sprain, and he hasn't made sufficient progress in his recovery, Gannon told reporters.Gannon said Murray sought a second opinion regarding his injury, and the foot isn't healing fast enough for him to get back on the field in 2025.\"Kyler will not play again this year,\" Gannon said. \"He had some more tests done this week. Went out of state and got another opinion on it. It's not progressing where it's gonna make sense that he can go. He's gonna be done for the year.\"Even before the injury, there was already speculation that Murray may be playing his last season with the Cardinals. Now, it seems like a possibility that Murray has played his last game with the franchise that selected him at No. 1 overall in 2019.\nAsked whether Murray would be the Cardinals' starting quarterback in 2026, Gannon deflected focus to the team's Week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams.\"I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly,\" Gannon said.\n        \n            \n                Kyler Murray shut down for rest of 2025: Potential landing spots if Cardinals trade veteran QB\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray was initially injured in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans and was put on injured reserve Nov. 5. When Murray was put on IR, Gannon said he hoped Murray would be able to return this season. Without Murray behind center, the Cardinals have gone 1-6 with Jacoby Brissett as the starter and have fallen to 3-9 on the year. However, that record conceals the fact that Arizona's offense has been better in a number of areas with Brissett at the helm.\nPrior to his injury, Murray was completing 68.3 of his passes while averaging 192.4 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and three interceptions. He was also rushing for 34.6 yards per game with one touchdown.Meanwhile, Brissett is averaging 243.1 passing yards per game with 13 touchdowns to four interceptions while connecting on 67.5% of his throws.There hasn't been much of a drop-off at quarterback with Murray out, and that has created big questions about his future in Arizona. It may be tough for the Cardinals to find a trade partner next offseason, thanks to Murray's massive contract, but they still have some options at their disposal.\nAs for possible landing spots for Murray, could he reunite with former coach Kliff Kingsbury if the Washington Commanders offensive coordinator gets a new job after the 2025 season?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys saw their three-game winning streak end in primetime with a 44-30 loss to the Detroit Lions on Thursday night. The loss was a significant hit to their playoff chances, as Dallas (6-6-1) now sits in 10th place in the NFC standings and is down to a 19% chance to make the playoffs, per SportsLine's projections. Where do the Cowboys turn from here? After the loss, quarterback Dak Prescott said the locker room isn't happy with the performance and plans to use Thursday night's setback as fuel down the stretch.\"I think guys are pissed off right now. I don't think this is any deflated moment like, 'Oh, hands are up, we're done.' No, no, absolutely not. I think you're going to get a team that's pissed, especially as we talk about a team that's kind of changed since the bye week,\" Prescott said, via the Cowboys official website.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: What Texans-Chiefs means for AFC seeding, wild-card chaos and teams on the bubble\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Cowboys were 3-5-1 heading into their bye week but rebounded with wins over the Las Vegas Raiders, Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. The Cowboys overcame a 21-0 deficit to beat the Eagles 24-21 in a win that seemed like it could be a turning point for the season. Another close win over the Chiefs on Thanksgiving followed, but Dallas' defense was gashed Thursday night in Detroit. It was the third time the team allowed 40-plus points this year, tying a franchise single-season record. Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who joined the team from the New York Jets at the trade deadline, said the defense is better than what was on display.\n\"Man, we are way better than [allowing] 44 points,\" Williams said. \"Man, we've got a great defense. We've got a great defensive line, and we've gotta do our job to the best of our ability, and execute, to the best of our ability, and just make more plays -- especially in this D-line room. We've got the ability to do it.\"Three turnovers -- a lost fumble and two Prescott interceptions -- did not help the Cowboys' cause, creating short fields for Detroit's offense. \"You can't win a game losing that, not in the NFL, and not against a team like that, being minus three in the turnover battle, simple as that…\" Prescott said. \"We've got to stop that. I know I've had an interception the last three games or so, then obviously two tonight, who cares whose fault it is?\"\nThe Cowboys will look to get back in the win column and keep their playoff chances alive next week against the Minnesota Vikings on \"Sunday Night Football.\" From there, they'll host the Los Angeles Rams before closing out the season with divisional road games against the Washington Commanders and New York Giants. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Injuries, injuries, and more injuries. That continues to be the common theme across the NBA. In their wake, fantasy managers are left to pick up the pieces. Let's try to help fortify your rosters to keep your squad in contention. Here are some players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Royce O'Neale, Phoenix Suns (48% rostered)Already without Jalen Green (hamstring), the Suns received more bad news on the injury front when Devin Booker suffered a groin injury. The team said he would be re-evaluated in one week, so it's possible that he could be out even longer than that. Booker has been the driving force behind the team's good start, averaging 25 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 6.7 assists.O'Neale doesn't generate a ton of headlines, but he is a valuable veteran piece on a good team. Since the Suns have been so shorthanded, he is logging 30 minutes per game. He has made his additional opportunities count, averaging 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, three assists, 1.2 steals, and 3.1 3-pointers. When Booker is out, O'Neale could receive increased scoring opportunities. Even when Booker does return, O'Neale has proven to have fantasy value.Ryan Nembhard, Dallas Mavericks (44% rostered)The point guard position has been a sore spot for the Mavericks out of the gate. Kyrie Irving (knee) still has no timetable for a return, and the Mavericks are likely to take a cautious approach with the veteran. D'Angelo Russell and Brandon Williams have provided mixed results, which prompted the team to take a chance on Nembhard. While starting their last four games, Nembhard has averaged 17 points, 2.8 rebounds, 7.5 assists, and three 3-pointers.\nA key to Nembhard's recent success is that he has shot 65.1% from the field and 66.7% from behind the arc as a starter. Neither of those numbers are sustainable. Still, he has played so well that he has likely locked himself into the starting lineup for at least the next couple of weeks. Those who need assists and 3-pointers off the waiver wire should target Nembhard. He's already a hot waiver wire option, so this might be the last week that he qualifies for this column.Jay Huff, Indiana Pacers (41% rostered)As the Pacers try to figure out the center position following the departure of Myles Turner, Huff is the most recent player to get a boost in playing time. Over their last eight games, Huff has averaged 24 minutes. That's up from his season average of 18 minutes a night. With the added playing time, Huff averaged 11.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.1 blocks, and 2.3 3-pointers over that eight-game stretch.In just 12 minutes per game with the Grizzlies last season, Huff averaged 0.9 blocks and 1.3 3-pointers. He's not afraid to shoot, and the Pacers like his ability to help stretch the floor. Isaiah Jackson has not played particularly well, so Huff could get an extended look in his new role. While he still probably won't rack up many rebounds, it's his combination of 3s and blocks that makes him a viable fantasy option.\nA.J. Green, Milwaukee Bucks (29% rostered)Just when the Bucks got Kevin Porter Jr. back from injury, they lost Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). Giannis is expected to miss two-to-four weeks with his injury, and there is speculation of trade rumors. Moving a player of his magnitude during a season is difficult, but suitors will certainly be lined up out the door if Giannis is indeed available.Porter will soak up a lot of the shot attempts that Giannis had on his plate. Bobby Portis should also play more. Then there is Green, who could see more looks. He has already been a viable fantasy option lately, averaging 13.4 points and four 3-pointers over the last 11 games. He is shooting 49.7% from deep this season and has never finished a season shooting worse than 40.8% from 3. For fantasy managers who need 3-pointers, there may be no better option on the waiver wire than Green.Danny Wolf, Brooklyn Nets (14% rostered)Michael Porter Jr. has been a fantasy star since being dealt to the Nets, but much of their roster has provided inconsistent production. With a lot of young, unproven players in the fold, the team will likely try multiple players in different roles as the season moves along. A good example of that is Wolf, who only played a total of 21 minutes over the Nets' first 18 games of the season. However, he has averaged 26 minutes over their last four matchups.\nWolf has flashed fantasy upside with more playing time, averaging 14.3 points, six rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 2.8 3-pointers over the last four games. The rookie did benefit from some favorable matchups that included playing the Hornets, Bulls, and Jazz. However, he may have earned himself more minutes moving forward. Those who play in 14-team or deeper leagues should consider adding Wolf.\n            ",

That could change, however, if Chicago losses to Green Bay, who currently sitting at No. 6 in the NFC standings. A half-game behind Chicago, the Packers will leapfrog the Bears in both the NFC North and NFC standings if they can defend their home turf on Sunday. After an 0-2 start, Ben Johnson's Bears have won nine of their last 10 games that includes five straight wins. Green Bay has won three straight games after suffering consecutive losses that led to Packers coach Matt LaFleur fielding questions about his job security. Here's how you can follow the action on Sunday along with our breakdown and prediction of this NFC North showdown. \nWhere to watch Bears vs. Packers liveWhen: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Lambeau Field -- Green Bay, Wisconsin TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -6.5, O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Bears vs. Packers: Need to know First of two. Green Bay and Chicago will face off twice during the season's final five weeks. After playing this Sunday, they'll meet up again in Week 18 in a game that will also likely have major playoff implications. Hungry Bears. Chicago's defense has forced a league-high 26 turnovers this season. They've forced at least one turnover in all but two of their 12 games this season that includes 10 turnovers during their current five-game winning streak. Of those 26 turnovers, 17 have come via interceptions that includes Kevin Byard's league-high six picks. Feast or famine. Chicago's ability to forced turnovers has helped mask some of its deficiencies on defense. The unit is just 25th in the NFL in points allowed, 22nd in passing yards allowed, 28th in rushing yards allowed, and 26th in red zone efficiency. The Bears are seventh in the NFL on third down, though. Captain comeback. Caleb Williams' five fourth-quarter comebacks this season is tied with Bo Nix for the most among quarterbacks. Chicago is 6-1 in one-possession games this season. Two-headed monster. An underrated element of the Bears' success this season has been the production of running backs D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai. Combined, the duo has rushed for 1,365 yards and 10 touchdowns with a 4.9 yards per carry average. All you need is Love. While he's not in the MVP conversation, Jordan Love is playing at an elite level. He's thrown 19 touchdowns this season (against just three interceptions) that includes his four touchdown performance in Green Bay's Thanksgiving Day win over the Lions. He's a big reason why Green Bay's offense is tops in the NFL on third down. Don't mess with Micah. Micah Parsons is still the same dominant player that he was with the Cowboys. Against the Lions, Parsons had 2.5 sacks while becoming the first player in history with 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons. He has six sacks in the Packers' last three games. Bears vs. Packers prediction, pick \nWhile both teams are pretty evenly matched, the Packers have a sizable advantage on offense with Josh Jacobs, who will look to take advantage of a Bears' subpar run defense. If Jacobs can get going early, that should help open things up for Love and the Packers' passing attack.

Among those teams in a tight divisional race are the Seattle Seahawks, who at 9-3 are trying to keep pace with the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC West crown.This week, the Seahawks have a very winnable game ahead of them -- a road matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, who sit at 4-8. Seattle is still very much in the race for the NFC's No. 1 seed but have some difficult games remaining on their schedule, including against the Indianapolis Colts, Rams and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks are coming off a 26-0 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Winners of six of their last seven, the Seahawks need to take care of business against a struggling Falcons team, especially with that difficult slate ahead.Atlanta is coming off a 27-24 loss to the New York Jets, who had just two wins heading into that matchup and secured the victory on a walk-off 56-yard field goal. The Falcons lost starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. for the season to an ACL injury, so their offense is led by veteran Kirk Cousins.\nThis season, the Falcons have struggled in close games, going just 1-5. Last week was their second overtime loss and they have lost two other games in the final minute.Below, we outline how to watch Seahawks vs. Falcons with keys to the game, betting information and a prediction.Where to watch Seahawks vs. Falcons liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ET Location: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV Channel: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow along: CBS Sports App Odds: Seahawks -7, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings)\nSeahawks vs. Falcons: Need to knowSeahawks defense vs. Falcons offense: Atlanta's offense ranks in the middle of the pack in passing yards (2,665), ranks among the lowest in completion percentage (61.2) and their 12 passing touchdowns is third-worst in the league. Seattle's 40 sacks are fourth-best in the league and could mean a long day for the 37-year-old Cousins.Jaxon Smith-Njigba chasing history: With a league-leading 1,336 receiving yards, the Seahawks receiver is chasing records this season and could break Pro Football Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson's single-season record in receiving yards of 1,964 yards in 2012. Smith-Njigba is 629 yards away from the mark and while he had a slow week last time out (two catches, 26 yards), he's been a force this year with eight 100-yard outings. Another losing season for the Falcons: If the Falcons lose on Sunday, it will mark their eighth consecutive losing season, tying the franchise record. Raheem Morris has only been at the helm for the last two seasons, but he could soon find himself on the hot seat. Seahawks vs. Falcons prediction, pick\nThe Seahawks are the more complete team and have been on a strong run this season. I expect that run to continue against the Falcons. Pick: Seahawks -7, Over 44.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Last Sunday night, the Broncos captured their ninth straight win after recording a 27-26 win over the Commanders in overtime. Denver received another gritty performance from quarterback Bo Nix, who threw for 321 yards that included a touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton. One of five teams that have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Raiders have dropped six straight games with the last three being in double-digit fashion. Last Sunday, Las Vegas was on the wrong side of a 31-14 score after it allowed the Chargers to rumble for 192 yards on 43 carries. Here's how you can follow the action on Sunday along with our breakdown and prediction of this AFC West showdown. \nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Raiders liveWhen: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, Nevada TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -7.5, O/U 40.5 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Broncos vs. Raiders: Need to know Week 10 rematch. It was a defensive duel the last time these two teams met a month ago. The score was tied at 7 for the majority of the second half before Broncos kicker Wil Lutz drilled a game-winning, 32-yard field goal with five seconds left. Denver's 10 points that day is its lowest scoring output of the season. A big reason for the Raiders' defensive success that day was their ability to rattle Nix, who went 16 of 28 passing with 150 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. Going streaking. Denver's nine-game winning streak is the franchise's longest since Peyton Manning led the 2012 team to 11 straight wins. The Broncos' single-season record for consecutive wins is held by the 1998 team that started 13-0. That team finished the regular season with a 14-2 record before successfully defending its Super Bowl title. Orange crush. Denver's defense has been northing short of dominant this season. Led by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II and pass rusher Nik Bonitto, the unit is currently tops in the league in both third down and red zone efficiency. Weakness exploited? While they came up short, the Commanders may have found the Broncos' Achilles heel on defense. Washington quarterback Marcus Mariota threw for nearly 300 yards by making quick throws that negated Denver's formidable pass rush. He also found soft spots in Denver's defense that led to him running for 55 yards on 10 carries. Poor Geno. It's been a rough season for the Raiders' offense and specifically quarterback Geno Smith, whose 14 interceptions leads the NFL. Sunday will be Joe Philbin's second game as interim offensive coordinator after Chip Kelly was fired following the Raiders' 2-9 start. Broncos vs. Raiders prediction, pick \nHonestly, I'm surprised the Broncos aren't favored by more points. There's nothing that would suggest that this game will be close, except for the fact that this is the NFL, and crazier things have happened. It's also a rivalry game between two teams that frankly don't like each other. While all of that is true, I just don't see an upset happening, now with the glaring talent disparity between the two teams. Pick: Broncos -7.5, Under 40.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Washington has lost seven straight -- tied for the longest active losing streak in the NFL -- and Minnesota has lost four straight.Marcus Mariota is in line to get yet another start for Washington as Jayden Daniels continues to recover from a dislocated elbow suffered late in a Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. Daniels has been practicing with the team since last week, but has not been cleared for contact. The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year has started in just six games this season, and Washington's offense has fallen from one of the league's best in 2024 to the middle of the pack in 2025.Minnesota, of course, would just to just be in the middle of the pack. J.J. McCarthy, picked eight selections after Daniels in the 2024 NFL Draft, has struggled mightily this season. After missing all of his rookie year with a knee injury, McCarthy has also appeared in just six games this year, and in those six games, he is completing just 54% of his passes with six touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Over 15% of his throws have been deemed off-target, and he has the league's highest negative play rate by far.\n\n        \n            \n                The harsh truth about J.J. McCarthy's first six starts -- and whether the Vikings can still fix him\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt this point, McCarthy, who missed Week 13 with a concussion, is looking to get any positive momentum to build upon in the offseason.Below is how to watch the game, as well as betting information, keys to the matchup and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Vikings vs. Commanders liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Vikings -2.5, O/U 41.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Vikings vs. Commanders: Need to knowCan J.J. McCarthy turn things around? McCarthy has been one of the NFL's worst quarterbacks this season, but his return will be a welcome one considering Max Brosmer threw four interceptions -- and Minnesota got shut out for the first time since 2007 -- in his first career start. McCarthy returns in about as good of a spot as one could expect: The Commanders are allowing 8.2 net yards per attempt, on pace to be the fifth-highest figure since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. That's in part due to poor linebacker and secondary coverage and in part due to a poor pass rush; Washington's eight sacks since Week 7 are tied for second-fewest in the league.Minnesota's defense is finally rounding into form. After an uncharacteristically slow start to the season, the Vikings' defense is starting to look more like its normal self under defensive coordinator Brian Flores. Since Week 9, the Vikings are allowing just 4.4 yards per play (fourth in the NFL) and are in the top 10 in several other categories, including sacks (13), pressure rate and red zone touchdown rate allowed. The Vikings are blitzing at the highest rate in the NFL, though Mariota has done well against the blitz this season; his 8.6 yards per attempt in that scenario ranks fifth in the NFL.Star wide receivers come into focus. Justin Jefferson had just two catches for four yards in Minnesota's dismal loss in Seattle, and he has been under 75 yards in six straight games. He had never been under 75 in more than two consecutive games played prior to this stretch. On the other side, Terry McLaurin had seven catches for 96 yards and a score in Week 13, his first game since Week 9 due to a quad injury.Vikings vs. Commanders pick, prediction\nThere is significant pressure on McCarthy to show something encouraging as a brutal year comes to a close, and if he can't do it against Washington's historically poor defense, it's hard to imagine him being able to do it against anyone. It won't be pretty, but Minnesota's defense will get the job done in this one. Pick: Vikings -2.5, Under 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Instead, this matchup will go a long way toward determining how the top of the 2026 NFL Draft looks.The Browns are coming off a 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in which nothing went right, especially on offense. It was tough to truly evaluate Shedeur Sanders in his second career start because Cleveland put the ball on the ground twice, and the weather was abysmal. This matchup against the Titans defense will offer a better look at Sanders' development. One thing that's not in question is that the Browns defense should be able to tee off against a sputtering Titans offense.Entering the weekend, the Titans have lost seven straight games, and the team probably needs something to feel good about. That's especially the case given the fact that Tennessee just got shellacked by the Jacksonville Jaguars, 25-3. It was another long day for the offense, which mustered just 188 total yards. Things won't get any easier against Myles Garrett and the Browns on Sunday.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC clash.\nWhere to watch Browns vs. Titans liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Huntington Bank Field -- Cleveland, OhioTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Browns -3.5, O/U 33.5 (via FanDuel)Browns vs. Titans: Need to knowWard vs. Sanders. This game will be the first time this season that two rookie quarterbacks will go head-to-head, so it's only fitting that it pits the two most talked about quarterbacks in the 2025 draft. Ward is the No. 1 overall pick who has struggled to find his footing in the NFL, and Sanders is the mid-round pick who was buried on the depth chart until a trade and injuries opened the door for him to start. There will be no shortage of opinions about these two around 4 p.m. ET on Sunday.Myles Garrett chasing history. The best player in this game, Garrett has been getting to the quarterback early and often this season. His 19.0 sacks are the most through 12 games in NFL history, and he is chasing the NFL record of 22.5, which is owned by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. Garrett has a golden opportunity to inch closer as he faces a Titans offensive line that has allowed a league-high 48 sacks.Defensive slugfest incoming. If you need to step away from the TV to refill your plate, use the restroom or run some errands, you should be okay. Neither of these teams has gotten much traction on offense in 2025. The Titans are dead last in points per game and total yards per game, and they rank 30th in passing yards per games. The Browns rank 29th, 31st and 31st in those same categories, respectively.Browns vs. Titans prediction, pick\nAs has been established, both of these offenses are abhorrent. Having said that, we could easily get some turnovers and/or defensive scores, which scares me away from the low total of 33.5. Ultimately, the unit I trust the most in this game is the Browns defense, and it's not particularly close. Cleveland should be able to stifle Tennessee's last-place offense and cover the spread at home. Pick: Browns -3.5, Over 33.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Jaguars are coming off a 25-3 beatdown of the 1-11 Tennessee Titans, while the Colts fell to the Houston Texans on their home field, 20-16.The importance of this matchup cannot be overstated. The Colts and Jaguars are both atop the AFC South at 8-4, although Jacksonville owns the tiebreaker in the division due to its higher win percentage in common games. Indy appears to be trending downwards. Once 7-1 and looking like the favorites in the AFC, Shane Steichen's squad has now lost three out of their last four games.We could look back at this matchup as the moment we learned who was going to win the AFC South. Let's break down this divisional showdown, but first, here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Colts vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: EverBank Stadium -- Jacksonville, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Colts -1.5, O/U 47.5 (via FanDuel)Colts vs. Jaguars: Need to knowHow's Daniel Jones' mobility? As you know by now, the Colts quarterback is playing through a fracture in his fibula. Last week against the Texans, Jones made some nice throws, but noticeably was not as mobile as usual. He registered zero scrambles, according to PFF, making it the first game since Week 5 Jones did not scramble. Pressure Jones and contain Jonathan Taylor. That's how the Jaguars can win this game. Sauce Gardner's will not dress. The Colts' trade-deadline addition is week-to-week with a calf strain suffered last Sunday, and will not suit up this week. It's concerning long-term, because calf strains can linger. Which Colts squad will show? You're going to have to score points if you want to beat the Colts. Indianapolis is the NFL leader in points per game entering Week 14 with 29.8. However, the Colts are averaging 21.8 points per contest over the last four games. Jaguars have the momentum. While the Colts are trending downwards, you could make the argument the Jaguars are trending upwards. They have won three games in a row following the largest blown lead in team history (19 points), which came against the Texans in Houston. Jacksonville dominated Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 11, found a way to win against the Arizona Cardinals in overtime then destroyed the Titans last Sunday. Jacksonville needs to mind their dirty laundry. Don't put the game in the ref's hands! Did you know the Jaguars lead the NFL in penalties with 104? That's something to watch on Sunday. Colts vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nI find it fascinating that the Colts have not won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- going 0-9 during this stretch. The Colts have not looked fantastic as of late, and you have to wonder how much Jones' fibula injury is affecting him. The Jaguars defense is not the Texans defense, but this same unit destroyed Herbert and the Chargers in Jacksonville, 35-6, a couple weeks ago. You never know what you're going to get with Lawrence, but I'll take Jacksonville in an upset. Pick: Jaguars +1.5, Over 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Understanding No. 10 Notre Dame's case for inclusion in the College Football Playoff doesn't require an advanced analytics degree or an in-depth comparison of at-large candidates all boasting comparable resumes. The Fighting Irish's case is pretty simple.They have demonstrated a distinct level of dominance while winning 10 straight games that no one in their neighborhood of the rankings can match. Outside of No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana, no team in college football has been as systematically ruthless in acing the eye test as Notre Dame.If the CFP is about determining college football's best team, and it should be, Notre Dame should be in without much debate. Among the cluster of five teams slotted between No. 8 and and No. 12 in the CFP Rankings after the regular season, the Fighting Irish are the only one with a top-15 scoring offense and scoring defense.Over the course of the 10-game winning streak, which includes five victories over bowl teams, the Fighting Irish have outscored the opposition by an average margin of 29.7 points. That margin would be even greater had their last three opponents not tacked on garbage time scores.\nNotre Dame's two losses came in its first two games by a combined four points against No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 12 Miami. Both are ranked in the top 12 and are a combined 21-3.Had Notre Dame been blown out in those two games and then narrowly won its next 10 contests, this would be a different discussion. But even in those close losses against quality competition, Notre Dame showed flashes of the dominant team it would soon become.ESPN's FPI, which is a predictive rating system, ranks Notre Dame No. 3 behind only Ohio State and Indiana. Sports Reference's simple rating system, which takes average point differential and strength of schedule into account, slots the Irish at No. 4.\nIf you look at Sagarin ratings, which are a long-established tool for judging team strength, Notre Dame registers at No. 2.Metrics aside, the thesis of Notre Dame's argument can be summarized like so: the Fighting look far more capable of winning a national championship than the teams around it in the rankings.No. 8 Oklahoma is an offensively lifeless team surviving off turnover luck. No. 9 Alabama has regressed offensively in the season's second half (and has an ugly loss at Florida State on its ledger). No. 11 BYU looked totally inept in its only regular-season game against a team projected to make the CFP field. \nNo. 12 Miami owns a head-to-head win against the Fighting Irish from Week 1 but then suffered two losses against teams currently unranked. While No. 13 Texas has a strong resume as a 3-loss team, it also lost to a bad Florida team and hasn't been nearly as dominant as Notre Dame.The Fighting Irish did this last year, too. They suffered an unimaginable Week 2 loss against Northern Illinois that dropped them, for a time, from the national discussion. They roared back with 11 straight wins to reach the College Football Playoff and then won three CFP games before losing to Ohio State in the title game.This year's squad isn't weighed down by an ugly loss. It also boasts a more dynamic offense than last year's team and a similarly strong defense.\nThat team was good enough to reach the national championship game, and this team is good enough to finish the job.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sure, No. 9 Alabama would love to win Saturday's SEC Championship Game and potentially lock in a top-four seed in the College Football Playoff with another victory over Georgia. But the Crimson Tide's résumé already speaks for itself, and barring a blowout loss to the Bulldogs, Alabama should already be making plans for its first trip to the bracket under second-year coach Kalen DeBoer.When you secure a title game spot in the nation's toughest conference, it usually means something in the playoff picture. Alabama's lone loss against SEC competition came in early November at Oklahoma, a 23-21 result in which the Crimson Tide gave it away with three turnovers after outgaining the Sooners by 194 yards and dominating time of possession.The selection committee's decision to bump Alabama to No. 9 ahead of Notre Dame on Tuesday was a positive development and, according to chair Hunter Yurachek, stemmed from the Crimson Tide leading by 17 points in the first half at Auburn before prevailing with precise execution late.See? Not all quality wins come against ranked competition in the eyes of the committee, and that was revealing this week. There was some concern around Alabama that a loss to Georgia in Atlanta could put the committee in a difficult spot late Saturday and into Sunday morning when final rankings are made had the Tide remained No. 10 -- the \"last team in\" designation.\nThese metrics heading into the SEC Championship Game, along with Alabama's updated ranking, should offer the Crimson Tide faithful a sigh of relief.Alabama by the numbersStrength of scheduleEfficiency among top 25 teamsStrength of recordGame controlTop 25 winsWins over bowl teams11th84.3 (10th)8th7th25Peep the metrics. Do you see any bad numbers that stick out? By comparison, the only programs ahead of Alabama in every category -- outside of strength of schedule -- are Oregon, Ohio State and Indiana, the latter two are unbeaten ahead of a showdown in the Big Ten Championship.Alabama ranks No. 1 in game control among SEC teams in playoff contention, No. 1 in strength of schedule and No. 2 in overall efficiency (Vanderbilt leads at 85.8). There's a lot to like about the Crimson Tide. The only real drawback is the \"bad\" loss to Florida State -- something the committee referenced in early November but hasn't emphasized since.The committee has also mentioned Alabama's lack of a rushing attack, which became noticeable during the second half of the season as the Crimson Tide struggled to control the line of scrimmage. Ironically, Alabama made it a point to establish the run in the Iron Bowl, finishing with 158 yards on 38 attempts. It wasn't eye-popping, but it was considerably better than the team's season average entering the game (13th in the SEC).Alabama snapped Georgia's nation-leading 33-game home winning streak in September, handed Missouri its first loss of the season with a healthy Beau Pribula and is one of the few teams in the country to quiet Heisman frontrunner Diego Pavia and Vanderbilt, holding the Commodores to just 14 points in Tuscaloosa on Oct. 4.The committee grades teams from start to finish, with data points stacking as the weeks pass. Outside of the loss to Oklahoma, no SEC team has been more consistent since Week 2 than Alabama, and the Crimson Tide will have a chance to reinforce that this weekend.However, even if Kirby Smart beats Alabama for only the second time in nine tries with the Bulldogs, the Crimson Tide should still be a playoff lock.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 11 BYU can play its way into the College Football Playoff with a win against No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. But it shouldn't have to come to that. The Cougars deserve a postseason spot, and it's absurd that it remains in question.In the history of the College Football Playoff Rankings, 61 power-conference teams have finished the regular season 11-1 or better. Every one of them entered championship weekend ranked in the top 10. All but two were seventh or higher.And then, inexplicably, there's BYU.The Cougars put together a sensational season, reaching 11-1 and earning a spot in the Big 12 title game. They beat No. 15 Utah and went on the road to shock No. 18 Arizona. Yet they sit at No. 11, looking up at several two-loss teams.In an era of bloated megaconferences, it would at least make sense if BYU's record came with an unusually soft draw. Instead, they rank No. 35 in strength of schedule, ahead of Ole Miss, Notre Dame and Miami. For comparison, Virginia is No. 82. BYU played six of the nine other teams that finished league play with a winning record, and their strength of record sits at No. 6.\nEven last season, Boise State reached the Mountain West Championship Game and was ranked No. 10. Somehow, the Cougars are receiving less credit than a Group of Five program.The early-season nitpicks have also been overstated. A tight road win against Arizona looked shaky at the time, but the Wildcats proved to be a top-25 team. A slow start against Colorado ended with BYU outgaining the Buffaloes by nearly 100 yards. Since then, the Cougars' last four wins have come by an average of 19.3 points, including road routs of previously ranked Iowa State and Cincinnati.Last year, BYU's profile leaned more on steadiness than star power. This year, there are All-America candidates at every level: running back LJ Martin, safety Faletau Satuala and linebacker Jack Kelly could play anywhere. This roster has real NFL-caliber talent.\nThen there's the rise of quarterback Bear Bachmeier, who has transformed the offense. The true freshman has topped 3,000 total yards with 25 touchdowns and has improved steadily throughout the year. If Notre Dame is forgiven for two losses while breaking in first-year quarterback CJ Carr, it's baffling that BYU doesn't get similar credit for developing alongside Bachmeier.Now the Cougars rank top 20 nationally in both FEI offense and defense, one of only 10 programs to hit that mark. They're also one of only nine to do so in SP+.At every turn, CFP Committee chair Hunter Yurachek points to BYU's 29-7 loss to Texas Tech as the disqualifier. It's difficult to recall another instance where one performance is so heavily cited. And that's because it's the only real knock.\nMeanwhile, a two-touchdown loss by No. 10 Alabama to Florida State is essentially ignored. The Tide trailed 24-7 late in the third quarter against a 5-7 team. Losing big to bad teams apparently doesn't count. Oklahoma was thoroughly outclassed by No. 6 Texas in a 23-6 loss, but beating No. 10 Alabama wiped that away.Yes, BYU is worse than Texas Tech, and the Red Raiders dominated the Cougars in Lubbock. There's a real chance they'll do it again Saturday. Texas Tech is legitimately elite; SP+ would make them nearly a touchdown favorite on a neutral field against any SEC team. The committee assigns far too much blame to BYU and not nearly enough credit to Texas Tech.Notre Dame can pound Boston College and Syracuse all it wants. Why should that matter more than handling a tougher schedule? How can the mythical eye test and selective use of analytics outweigh actually playing and winning high-level games?\nThe committee loves talking about the eye test when making confounding decisions. Somehow, the gaze always drifts toward golden helmets or crimson uniforms, resume be damned.Last year, for example, BYU finished 10-2 and beat SMU on the road. The Cougars still ended up No. 17 in the final rankings, seven spots behind 11-2 SMU. According to an analysis by Stassen, BYU is on pace to become the most underranked team in the AP Top 25 since 1989 when comparing preseason to postseason position. Too often, it's Cougar Blue left out in the cold.The case is clear. BYU is 11-1 with quality wins, real star power and a strong schedule. If a team like that can't play for a national championship, what exactly is the point of expanding the playoff?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of college football's great modern rivalries will take center stage on Saturday afternoon as No. 3 Georgia squares off against No. 9 Alabama in the SEC Championship Game. This will be the fifth time the Bulldogs and Crimson Tide have met in the SEC Championship Game (2012, 2018, 2021, 2023, 2025), and also the third time these two have played since the start of the 2024 season. Heading into the matchup, Alabama is 4-0 against Georgia in SEC Championship Games and 7-1 overall against the Bulldogs since Kirby Smart left Nick Saban's staff to take over as the new head coach in Athens.Kalen DeBoer has already notched two victories against Georgia in his short time as Alabama's coach, winning a 41-34 thriller last season in Tuscaloosa and then backing it up with a hot start in a 24-21 win in Athens back in September. Alabama won a 27-20 nail-biter in the Iron Bowl on Saturday to clinch its spot in the SEC Championship Game, emerging along with Georgia from a four-way tie for first place that also included Ole Miss and Texas A&M. The Bulldogs concluded their conference schedule with an emphatic 35-10 win against Texas back on Nov. 15, then closed the regular season with wins against Charlotte and Georgia Tech. Getting this matchup for the third time in five seasons does not lessen the passion at play between two proud programs who still value holding the crown in one of college football's toughest conferences. Let's get into some of the things to know about this top-10 bout and what to expect on Saturday in Atlanta.  \n        \n            \n                College football schedule, games 2025: What to watch in Week 15, TV channels, Saturday kickoff times\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlabama vs. Georgia: Need to knowComeback kings: Georgia trailed in seven of its eight SEC games this season yet finished with a 7-1 record thanks to clutch play and great second-half adjustments. The Bulldogs were down on the road in wins at Tennessee and Auburn, and threw haymakers back and forth with Ole Miss in a 43-35 win in Athens. Even the one SEC loss this season, against Alabama in September, included a second-half shutout by the Georgia defense and multiple possessions where the Bulldogs had a chance to tie or take the lead. The only SEC game where Georgia went wire-to-wire was a 35-14 home win against Kentucky. Kalen DeBoer shines against the best: Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer is 19-4 in 23 games against AP Top 25 teams as a head coach, including a 6-1 record against top-10 opponents. Since arriving at Alabama, DeBoer is 7-1 against top 25 teams with the lone loss being the 23-21 defeat against Oklahoma on Nov. 8. At one point during his tenures at Fresno State and Washington, DeBoer had a 12-game winning streak against ranked opponents that only came to an end in the national championship game against Michigan. \nNew starters have succeeded at QB: Alabama and Georgia both started 2025 with new full-time starters at quarterback, and since both have arrived here in the SEC Championship Game with top-10 rankings and national title aspirations it's fair to say both campaigns have been a success. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the SEC with 25 touchdowns and just four interceptions, while also ranking third in the conference with 3,056 passing yards on the season. Gunner Stockton has been effective for Georgia as well, though in different ways. Heading into the SEC Championship Game, Stockton ranks second only to Diego Pavia in the SEC for completion percentage (70.2%) and has racked up 28 total touchdowns (20 passing, eight rushing) on the season.

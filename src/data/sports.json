    "body": "\n        Texas quarterback Arch Manning is trending in the right direction ahead of the No. 20 Longhorns' Week 10 matchup with No. 9 Vanderbilt. Manning was removed from the Longhorns' player availability report on Friday, indicating that the redshirt sophomore is good to go against the Commodores.Texas coach Steve Sarkisian told ESPN's Molly McGrath that Manning has not experienced any setbacks or symptoms this week, and is expected to meet with doctors Saturday morning for a final evaluation before kickoff. Texas listed him as questionable on its official injury report after he returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.Sarkisian said Monday that Manning was in concussion protocol after exiting Saturday's 45-38 win over Mississippi State after his helmet made contact with the turf at the end of a 13-yard scramble.Manning knifed his way through the heart of Mississippi State's defense in overtime with the score tied at 38 before he was tackled by Bulldogs safety Isaac Smith and defensive lineman Kedrick Bingley-Jones, who hit him from behind.\nManning tried to get up with the help of Texas offensive tackle Brandon Baker before motioning for trainers from a seated position on the turf. Matthew Caldwell, Manning's backup, threw a 10-yard touchdown pass on the possession to Emmett Mosley V that was the eventual game-winning score.\n        \n            \n                Who is Texas QB Matthew Caldwell? How the Longhorns' offense will look if Arch Manning is unavailable\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning had previously led a 17-point comeback in the fourth quarter to force overtime on the road after the Longhorns trailed 38-21. Texas is the first SEC team to overcome a 17-point deficit in the final frame to win since 2013.Manning finished with his best game as a collegian, completing 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a score on the ground.\nHow does concussion protocol work?According to the university's concussion management plan, post-concussion management is directed by the team physician and the need for initial physical and cognitive rest will be determined based on individual serial assessments, concussion history, modifying factors and specific needs of the student-athlete.Final authority for \"return to play\" resides with the Longhorns' team physician. The NCAA's concussion safety protocol management mandates Manning would need to be cleared by medical personnel before returning to play. At 6-2 overall and 3-1 in conference play, Texas enters a pivotal final stretch beginning with next weekend's tilt against the 10th-ranked Commodores at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium. Sarkisian's team is off the following week before traveling to fifth-ranked Georgia, hosting Arkansas and then entertaining the SEC's lone unbeaten, Texas A&M, in the regular-season finale on Nov. 28.\nWinning out from here would not only guarantee a third consecutive playoff appearance for the Longhorns, but would but a ticket to Atlanta in the SEC Championship Game.\n            ",

Davis finished with four points, four rebounds and a steal and did not return after being ruled out for the remainder of the game at halftime.\n\"He tried to return -- didn't want to take any chances,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd told reporters after the game against the Pacers. \"We'll see how he feels moving forward.\"Coming into the game against the Pacers, Davis was listed as probable on the injury report because of bilateral Achilles tendinopathy. Davis, the centerpiece of the trade that sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, appeared in just nine games with his new team after being traded.\nDavis is averaging 20.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 29.8 minutes per game. \n            \n    ",

I want to use Rice in as many lineups as possible.He's $7,600 on DraftKings and $8,200 on FanDuel, and Rice will hopefully stay hot against the Bills. He has now played two games following his six-game suspension to open the season, and he has 16 catches for 135 yards and three touchdowns on 19 targets over that span. Rice has faced the Bills twice in his career, and he scored 18.2 PPR points in one of those outings. And Buffalo has struggled with No. 1 receivers this season as Zay Flowers, Tyreek Hill, Stefon Diggs, Drake London, and Tetairoa McMillan all scored at least 15.9 PPR points.Patrick Mahomes should continue to lean on Rice at Buffalo. And I'm expecting him to deliver another solid stat line in the game of the week.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 9, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The Week 9 NFL schedule features a compelling slate of matchups across the league, highlighted by several key games that could help shape the NFL playoff picture. The Indianapolis Colts are 3-point road favorites against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a matchup between potential AFC playoff teams, and the Buffalo Bills host the Kansas City Chiefs (-1.5) in another showdown between Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.

When officers arrived, the suspects had already fled the area and no one was inside the home at the time.Police said no arrests have been made and did not disclose whether any property was stolen.The break-in occurred as Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning NBA MVP, was at the Paycom Center in downtown Oklahoma City, where the Thunder defeated the Wizards, 127-108. A heavy police presence was seen in the neighborhood for several hours as investigators searched the property and Thunder general manager Sam Presti was spotted at the scene Thursday night, according to KWTV.\nPolice said there is no indication the incident poses a broader threat to the community but noted that patrols will be stepped up in the neighborhood through Halloween weekend and beyond.Property records reviewed by The Oklahoman show the home associated with Gilgeous-Alexander is valued at nearly $4 million.\nGilgeous-Alexander scored a game-high 31 points in the win for the reigning NBA champion Thunder, which improved to 6-0 on the season. Oklahoma City is back on the court against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

The Raiders are coming off a bye following their Week 7 shutout loss to the Chiefs, putting them at 2-5 and last in the AFC West. The Jaguars, who are also coming off a bye, sit at 4-3 and second in the AFC South after their most recent defeat, a 35-7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in London.Both teams are slumping. The Raiders have lost five of the last six games, while the Jaguars have lost two in a row.The Raiders offense may get back some key pieces this week. Tight end Brock Bowers (knee) and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe) have missed time, which has not helped Geno Smith's struggling offense. Coach Pete Carroll said earlier this week that he expects both pass catchers to return for Week 9.Here's everything you need to know for the game this weekend: \nWhere to watch Jaguars vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 2 | Time: 4:05 p.m. p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las VegasTV Channel: Fox | Streaming: NFL+Follow along: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -2.5, OU 44.5 (via DraftKings)    Jaguars vs. Raiders: Need to knowJaguars defense: The Raiders defense has been the highlight of their team. They are top five in the league in takeaways and have at least one takeaway in each of their wins. Forcing turnovers could be a major difference-maker in this game. They are also holding their opponents to 22 points a game, so if the offense can get some momentum, the defense is doing enough to help them win.Raiders offense: The Raiders are giving the ball up a lot, tied with the Dolphins for most interceptions in the league with 10. Their seven passing touchdowns are tied for second fewest in the league and their three rushing touchdowns are tied for least in the league. Against a solid defense, Geno Smith and Co. may struggle.Travis Hunter: The two-way player was one of the more talked about this offseason. His impact on the offense has increased week to week. Last week he made his biggest impact, with eight catches on 14 targets and recorded his first touchdown in the NFL. But now he'll miss at least the next four games after being placed on injured reserve with a knee injury sustained in practice this week.Jaguars vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nI think the Raiders offense will see improvement this week, but not enough to get the win over the Jaguars. Neither team is consistent, but the Jags have been the better team thus far. Pick: Jaguars -2.5, Under 44.5\n            \n    ",

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday that Purdy will not start in Week 9 but that he could be available if the 49ers need him to jump into action. Mac Jones will line up to take the starting reps once again.Shanahan on Monday expressed some optimism that Purdy could be back in the lineup on Sunday but said that the team would wait for more information throughout the week. Purdy was a limited participant in practice all week.Purdy initially injured the toe in Week 1 but was able to return for Week 4 -- only to re-aggravate the injury. So what does Purdy need to show in order to return to the field? Shanahan said it's confidence. \"If he gets out there, and he's hobbling around and stuff, he won't be out there [on Sunday]. So he's got to go out there and go through the practices and stuff and really let us know how good he feels because it's hard to know what's going on with the toe,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"They're really iffy things. Last time, we felt like he was feeling pretty good, looked pretty good in practice and then in the game, one hit and it set him back five or six weeks, whatever this has been ... four weeks.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 9 injury report: Lamar Jackson good to go for Ravens, Bryce Young returns to practice\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe team wants Purdy, who signed a five-year, $265 million extension in May, to avoid another setback, but Shanahan noted it's not easy to detect whether one is coming.\n\"It's kind of a sensitive situation and hopefully getting some reps in practice and stuff will give him that confidence that it's better than it was last time,\" Shanahan said. When asked if Purdy will let them know by the end of the week if he feels good enough to play, Shanahan quipped, \"I mean, I didn't give him a deadline.\"\"It's not as black and white as you guys want it to be\" the coach added.\nJones is dealing with a knee contusion but was a full participant in this week's practices. He will get yet another start as the 49ers (5-3) look to bounce back from last week's 26-15 loss to the Houston Texans. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The scenarios on the NWSL's second-ever decision day on Sunday may be straightforward as two teams compete for the final playoff berth, but the circumstances vary for the last two teams in the mix. The North Carolina, a postseason perennial, may have a chance but it is Racing Louisville who lead the charge for eighth place – and may just book their first trip to the playoffs in the process.Louisville carry not only a two-point advantage heading into the final weekend but have a favorable fixture waiting for them on Sunday against Bay FC, a team whose playoff run officially ended weeks ago and are on the cusp of a coaching change that almost ensures the club has one eye on the future even as they close out the season. The Courage have less room for error – they need a win to cap off a tumultuous regular season on the field, but face a Gotham FC side that will be incentivized to win in order to secure home-field advantage in the postseason.It is an unusual position for both playoff hopefuls but especially Louisville, who have been close to the postseason but are a regular fixture in the bottom portion of the table. That is not to say their status as the favorites to reach the playoffs is undeserved – steady progress under head coach Bev Yanez has subtly improved their standing in recent years, another contrast to a Courage side that underwent a managerial change when Sean Nahas was fired over the summer. Questions about how deep a playoff run Louisville can actually make are valid but, for the time being, almost feel secondary. The more pressing inquiry – is this, at long last, Louisville's year?NWSL Decision Day scheduleSunday, Nov. 2Kansas City Current vs. San Diego Wave | 3 p.m. | ESPN, Fubo (Try for free)  Utah Royals vs. Washington Spiri | 5 p.m. | NWSL+    Portland Thorns vs. Houston Dash | 5 p.m. | NWSL+    Orlando Pride vs. Seattle Reign | 5 p.m. | NWSL+North Carolina Courage vs. Gotham FC  | 5 p.m. | ESPN, Fubo (Try for free)  Racing Louisville vs. Bay FC | 5 p.m. | NWSL+    Chicago Stars vs. Angel City | 5 p.m. | NWSL+    \nA tale of two inconsistent teamsA playoff berth comes with the hopeless optimism that truly anything is possible in a one-off but even then, there is something unglamorous about a battle for eighth place. Louisville and the Courage are middling teams for a reason this season and share some commonalities as a result, but the Courage's campaign is an example in extremes that have proven to be very costly.If the league table was rearranged on expected goal differential, both would rank inside the top eight alongside just about every other playoff team. Neither side has quite lived up to their own potential this season, though – Louisville's goal differential is -4 despite posting 2.56 xG, while the Courage's season has played out as if a data-savvy person was asked to make a joke about expectation vs. reality. The three-time NWSL champions currently boast the league's second-best xGD at 9 but instead have a goal differential of minus three, that difference between expected goal difference and actual goal difference the worst in the league for teams in the top nine.Both sides have just three wins in their last 11 but the Courage's underperformance this season means Louisville's imperfections pale in comparison. Inconsistency has wreaked havoc on the Courage's season, making the prospect of reaching the postseason seem like an uphill battle. They will benefit from the fact that Gotham have been inconsistent in their own right recently, posting just one win in their last six, but the onus will be on the Courage to get the job done on Sunday. Gotham will be chasing a win so they can rise from seventh to third if other results are in their favor, which may play well for the Courage's cheat code – individual brilliance.\nIndividual talent leads the wayFor both Louisville and the Courage, inconsistency has reigned supreme in their seasons but each side has had a standout attacker who has offered some much-needed reliability. Louisville's Emma Sears and the Courage's Manaka Matsukubo each have 10 goals, nearly 30% of the goals scored by their teams this season. Sears and Matsukubo, both tied for third in the NWSL's golden boot race, are essentially in a class of their own on their teams – Taylor Flint is the next highest goalscorer in Louisville with four goals, while Brianna Pinto fills that slot in North Carolina with three goals.Matsukubo's impressive run of form will be key for the Courage on Sunday, her individual talents potentially enough to break through a Gotham defense that has conceded the fewest goals in regular-season play so far this season. The Courage might be overly reliant on Matsukubo on Sunday, though, especially considering the team's collective attacking showing this season. They have underperformed their expected goals tally by a margin of seven goals, behind only Bay FC in that regard, just one of several issues that may soon become issues for next season as they lock in a head coach with Nathan Thackeray acting in an interim capacity.Louisville may also be overly reliant on Sears but the circumstances on Sunday favor them in almost every sense. While the Courage's attacking inconsistencies may be exacerbated by Gotham's sturdy defense, Sears and Louisville may benefit from Bay's flimsiness in the back. U.S. women's national team player Sears is a tough physical match for any defense but Bay's has not covered itself in glory this season, outdoing their expected goals against tally of 34.62 by conceding 40 goals so far.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Angel City FC captain Sarah Gorden and vice captain Angelina Anderson spoke on behalf of the club's lockerroom following an op-ed in the New York Post by teammate Elizabeth Eddy. The duo had a joint statement that rejected language they called \"transphobic and racist\" throughout the article, which was addressing the National Women's Soccer League's lack of a gender eligibility policy.\"Before we start, I just want to say that going into this, I'm a little bit nervous, because I think it's a big job to represent your team and speak for your team, and not just that, speak for others who this will be important to. We've all seen the article that was written in the New York Post earlier this week. So I really want to start off by saying that that article does not speak for this team,\" Gorden said at the beginning of her statement.\"In this locker room, I've had a lot of convos with my teammates in the past few days, and they are hurt and they are harmed by the article, and also they are disgusted by some of the things that were said in the article. And it's really important for me to say that, and we don't agree with the things written for a plethora of reasons, but mostly the undertones come across as transphobic and racist as well.\"What did Eddy writeThe infrequently utilized Elizabeth Eddy, who has played 87 minutes across three seasons with the club, with zero appearances this year, wrote a lengthy post on social media that called for more guidelines around gender eligibility policy. She has often been on deep club rosters in the past and won NWSL titles with Western New York Flash, North Carolina Courage, and Portland Thorns.\nEddy also stated that NWSL players must be born with ovaries or undergo genetic verification or other gender testing. \"I'm concerned that without clarity about who the league is for, it will lose its identity and its momentum,\" Eddy wrote online, which was then editorialized in the New York Post with specific images of Orlando Pride player Barbra Banda throughout. As more African players arrive in NWSL and achieve success, they have also been subjected to bullying, both online and in the stands. There are currently zero players in NWSL who identify publicly as trans or intersex, and to call for genetic testing of cisgender athletes in sport is widely considered policing one's body.\n\"The article calls for genetic testing on certain players, and it has a photo of an African player as a headline, and that's very harmful, and to me it's inherently racist, because to single out this community based on them looking or being different is absolutely a problem,\" Angel City captain Sarah Gorden continued.\"As a mixed woman with a black family, I'm devastated by the undertones of this article, and I feel very protective of my teammates and this community who are also hurt by this, and that includes staff and everyone who is a supporter and a fan, and there are players in this league and in this locker room that are directly harmed by what was written in the article.\"What did the league say?Not a whole lot. In a statement to The Athletic, a league spokesperson said the NWSL is \"committed to working directly with the NWSL Players Association on any changes to our league policies\" to ensure players' voices are \"central to our processes and (this) reinforces our commitment to inclusion, trust and transparency.\"\nThe NWSL Players Association also took a similar stance, referring to policies through collective bargaining. \"The NWSLPA serves as the collective voice of all NWSL Players. Any matter of policy must be collectively bargained. Any position the NWSLPA takes on behalf of the collective in collective bargaining is and will be the product of a thoughtful, deliberate process that engages all our members and the issues that are important to them.\"Angel City FC also put out a statement on Tuesday following Eddy's opinion piece. \n\"In response to an op-ed published on October 27th, we want to make clear that while we respect the right for an individual to express their opinion, it does not reflect the opinion of an entire organization,\" the club statement read. \"Since our founding, Angel City has remained committed to equity, inclusion, and belonging. These principles will always guide how we show up for our team, fans, and community.\"Players shape the leagueAs the league prepares to close the chapter on its 13th year, it's still an organization that is young and growing. As the NWSL tries to evolve, it'll likely do so through the leadership and example of its players, and that's why Sarah Gorden and Angelina Angerson's statement resonated.\"I just want to say I am so, so sorry for anyone hurt by this, or anyone harmed by this, and please know that I do speak for the team when I say we do support you. You don't have to look like me, you don't have to look like Ang [Anderson], or you don't have to look like somebody from Orange County to be accepted and celebrated here. And it's really important that you know that that is the true message from this locker room and the team,\" Gorden concluded.\n\"For me personally, when I think of LA and I think of Angel City, I think of a place that was founded upon inclusivity and love for all people,\" Anderson added.\"That's what our locker room is, that's what our staff is, that's what our fan base is. Angel City is a place for everyone. It always will be. That's how it was from the beginning. That's how it always will be, period.\"The team has one final game on Sunday, Decision Day, against Chicago Stars FC. Both clubs are eliminated from playoff contention, and while there are no high stakes involved in the match, Anderson wants the group to close out the difficult 2025 season with a good moment.\n\"I think this situation, there's an element of timing to it, where this feels like another really big challenge that we have to go through as a team on top of an already really challenging year, and it's definitely not the note that we as a group want to end on,\" Anderson explained.\"So I just want everyone to know that we're doing our best in the locker room to preserve respect and belonging on this team, and we look forward to ending the season on as positive of a note as possible.\"\n            ",

On Friday, Rollins announced that his shoulder injury will keep him sidelined from WWE well into 2026.Rollins provided the update while guest-hosting \"Good Morning Football\" this week. Dressed in a bear suit and a No. 76 Chicago Bears jersey for Halloween, Rollins told the program that he wouldn't be back in the ring for another six months.\"I wish I could rip this thing off, man, but I'm out, guys. I'm out of action for six months,\" Rollins said. \"My world championship is going to be worn by some schmuck, either Jey Uso or CM Punk. It's awful. It really is the Halloween scaries, but I'm here. I'm here in a full bear suit.\"\nRollins was written off television on the Oct. 13 episode of WWE Raw. The Vision's Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed attack Rollins, sidelining their faction leader for the foreseeable future. It's believed the segment was booked after Rollins legitimately injured his shoulder in a winning effort against Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel. A new world heavyweight champion will be crowned at Saturday Night's Main Event. CM Punk was granted the match after Rollins was forced to vacate the title. Jey Uso subsequently won a battle royal to qualify for the vacant title match with Punk.\nBack in July, LA Knight prematurely pinned Rollins after Rollins suffered what appeared to be a knee injury. Subsequent reports were split on the legitimacy of the injury, with even Rollins' manager, Paul Heyman, telling CBS Sports that media misdirection was part of WWE's creative direction. The previous injury proved to be a ruse after Rollins returned one month later at SummerSlam, cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Punk.\n            \n    ",

But Wisconsin counters with elite ball security, ranking 9th in offensive turnover percentage,\" SportsLine college basketball expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When forced into half-court defense, Iowa struggles-ranking 16th of 18 Big Ten teams in 2-point defense. The Hawkeyes' defensive numbers also plummet on the road, where they've allowed 74 or more points in five of seven Big Ten away games.\" Back Wisconsin at DraftKings here:\nCeltics vs. Lakers Over 228.5This game takes place in Los Angeles, and no NBA team has hit the Over at a higher rate at home than the Lakers, with an 18-8 mark. These teams just met a few weeks ago, and that contest went over, despite the Lakers missing the firepower of both LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Meanwhile, Boston has seen each of its last two games surpass the total, as the model forecasts a dozen players scoring more than 9 points. With that, the Over hits 61.8% of the time in an A-rated pick. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Suns (+3.5) vs. Trail BlazersPhoenix is 8-4 against the spread over its last 12 home matchups with Portland, while also outright winning in eight of those 12. This season, the Suns are unparalleled when it comes to spread success as they boast the best ATS record in the league at 35-22. Two of those ATS victories came against Portland earlier this year, and the Blazers are mired in a slump versus the line as of late. They are just 3-6 ATS over their last nine games and are coming off a 54-point defeat to Denver on Friday, which is the second-biggest loss of any NBA team this season. The model has Phoenix covering almost 60% of the time. Back the Suns at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The 2024 Paris Games revitalized what those five recognizable Olympic rings mean as a symbol of athletic competition, global community, ambition and achievement on the world's stage. As soon as the most recent Summer Games concluded, the reviews were near-universal in agreement. The Olympics were officially back, with Paris' moment widely recognized as one of the best Games in history for a bevy of irresistible reasons: the jaw-dropping backdrops and unique stages for competition; the record-setting performances; the star power drawn in by one of the most famous cities in the world; and, crucially, the return of a normal Olympics after COVID had severe impacts on the previous two.The just-concluded Milan Cortina Games couldn't hit the same highs or have quite the same worldwide reach of the Paris Games -- the Summer Olympics will always out-rate Winter -- but all medals and moments considered, what we just watched over the past 16 days immediately vaults this fortnight competition near the top of the list of the best Winter Games of all time. What's more, for the first time since Vancouver in 2010, the world's best cold-weather athletes competed in a place that was both visually stimulating for TV watchers and viewership-friendly in the United States. As for the U.S. delegation, this has to be regarded as the country's greatest go on snow and ice ever. Those in red, white and blue put on an epic showing, with Americans bringing home 12 gold medals, the most in any Winter Olympics. The 33 total medals were four off their best haul during those Vancouver Games 16 years ago.\nMy primary gig for CBS Sports is to write and talk about men's college basketball, but longtime readers know all too well how much I love the Olympics. And even in the midst of what I think will wind up being an all-time season in college hoops, I had my attention split for two weeks between American hardwood and Italian ice due to the gorgeous vistas, powerful storylines, emerging star power and ever-reliable drama that came across my TV screen with 16 disciplines in eight sports taking place an ocean and a continent away.The redemption stories and breakout stars and anguishing images of failure that developed over two-plus weeks in the mountains of Northern Italy produced enough narratives to fill a 500-page novel. I'll go much shorter than that, but please join me on a look back at the stars and moments that made the Milan Cortina Games one of the best Winter Olympics ever.Team USA sweeps hockey goldWe start with ice hockey. The United States men's and women's teams won gold in the same Olympics for the first time, which is a monumental achievement in its own right. But then consider the details: The two teams did it three days apart in games, in games that that both ended 2-1, in games that both reached overtime, in games that both downed a perfect rival, Canada.\nFor the women, Megan Keller became an American hero for her overtime goal that won the gold medal. And Hilary Knight, a legend in her own right, for getting the game to the bonus session and setting an Olympic scoring record in the process. For the men, Jack Hughes is an immortal -- right alongside goalie Connor Hellebuyck (who should have won MVP) -- for getting the men's team its first gold since the \"Miracle on Ice\" in 1980, 46 years to the day, no less.It's only the third time men's hockey has won the Olympic tournament; 1960 being the first. The 1980 team has been subject to documentaries. Both of these champions will be as well.\nMikaela Shiffrin's redemption arcMikaela Shiffrin, 30 years old and far from finished in her one-of-a-kind career, has become one of my favorite athletes. Shiffrin got the third Olympic gold medal of her career on Feb. 18, but it was the only one of these Games. It came in her best discipline, the slalom, and in staggering fashion. Shiffrin exorcised her previous eight non-podium skis in the Olympics by winning her two slalom races by 1.50 seconds, marking the largest margin of victory in an Alpine Olympic event since 1998. The gap in her win was so large, it was actually a longer amount of time than the advantage of the six previous Olympic slalom winners -- COMBINED!She entered Milan as the only two-time slalom gold medalist in U.S. history. And now Shiffrin is the first Team USA skier to ever win three gold medals, too. She was already the youngest (18 in 2014) to win the women's slalom event at the Olympics, and with last week's gold she's also now the oldest to ever do it as well. One barrier after another, broken. She did it after failing to medal in giant slalom and also shockingly blowing a first-place lead in the Olympics debut of the team combined event with teammate Breezy Johnson -- whose downhill gold was one of the United States' 12. Shiffrin responded with one of the best races of her life. She earned it not because of the hard work, but because of how she so willingly put herself out there, time and again, with her struggles.\nEvery time I heard Shiffrin talk, or saw one of her social posts, it was nothing but positivity, affirmation of teammates and competitors and transparency over accepting the challenges of these moments, of living through them instead of going against them. When she won gold last week, cameras caught her expression, goggles still over the eyes, and the first word out of her mouth? Dad.I almost cried when I watched it live.Shiffrin unexpectedly lost her father to an accident in 2020. She'd won races since then, and had high-profile failures too. But winning a medal on the Olympic stage hadn't happened since he passed. Her honesty at her medal-winning press conference about processing grief is something everyone should watch.\nWomen provided so many inspirational performancesJohnson, not only won gold here, she did so on the course that was the stage of a pre-Olympics crash in 2022 that caused her to miss the Beijing Games. And so not only did she make a grand comeback at 30, she also got engaged after her final race.\nThe most uplifting performance of the past 16 days came via the carefree radiance of 20-year-old Alysa Liu, whose infectious personality and impressive singles free skate that delivered her a gold medal. She also reached the top of the podium as part of the team event for the United States. A few years ago, Liu retired from competitive skating. But the bug bit back and it's become a decision that will change her life forever. Her golds have vaulted Liu to stardom. Should she keep at it, she'll enter 2030 at just 24, and among the handful of biggest stars for those Games.\nIt was an amazing Olympics for women in the United States and beyond. Thirty-five-year-old Italian Federica Brignone is an immediate legend for how she recovered in less than a year to win two gold medals for the home country, boosting Italy to a record 10 golds and 30 medals (third overall in both) set a record for most by a host country.  The Netherlands' speedskating duo of Femke Kok and Jutta Leerdam each won a gold and a silver and they have flipped a niche sport into must-see competition. They are bona fide uber celebrities in their home country, where speedskating is treated there like football is in the States. Italian Arianna Fontana made history by competing in her final Olympics at 35 and winning a gold and two silvers in short track speedskating, and finishing with a medal at six straight Olympics. No one else has ever done that! She's got 14 medals to her name, second most ever to Norways Marit Bjøgen's 15.\n\n\nSpeaking of peaking at the end: Elana Meyers Taylor competed in her fifth Olympics and finally, as a 41-year-old mom of two, won her first gold in the monobob. Imagine hitting the peak of your athletic life after the age of 40? Lindsey Vonn tried to do that, only to see it end in disaster. But Vonn's tragic final Olympic race -- which has required three surgeries already and will need at least one more -- served as a scary reminder of the very real stakes of competition in the Winter Olympics. Nothing compares.Men who seemed to be immortal, and a 'God' who proved to be humanAmerican speedskater Jordan Stolz hoped for four medals, perhaps even four golds, but came away with two and a silver. His pair of individual first-place finishes represented the only American to pull off the feat in Italy. Stolz was a breakout star, though his failure to medal in Saturday's mass start means he'll likely enter 2030 as the male face of Team USA while also having all the motivational storylines to set up what could be his grand Olympic moment. The same can be said of the Quad God, Ilia Malinin, whose failed routine in the men's free skate goes as the biggest stunner of them all at these Games. A shocking reminder that, although there is so much storytelling attached to the Olympics, the Games can never be scripted.\nBut they sure are sculpted. Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Høsflot Klæbo might be one of the 10 most fit humans on the planet. Cross-country skiing isn't a sport so much as it is an action in pain tolerance. Klæbo has done the impossible and become a global star. His six gold medals over a two-week span are a Winter Olympics record. He skied almost 62 miles in Italy. The 29-year-old joins Michael Phelps as the only Olympians ever to have double-digit gold medals (Klæbo now has 11; Phelps is untouchable with 23). Klæbo's six helped get Norway to the top of medal table; the country finished with 18 golds and 41 overall, both records.Klæbo wasn't the only cross-country skier to earn big headlines. The weirdest story of the Games goes to his countryman, Norway's Sturla Holm Laegreid, who decided to cry and admit to being a cheater on television, only to see the story go global. To date, there is no indication he's won back his ex-girlfriend. (Seriously, man. What was the plan here? Yikes!)There was the glory of Brazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who won the first medal (a gold, nonetheless) for a South American country in a Winter Olympics ever, and then celebrated with an instantly iconic gesture atop the podium after winning the freestyle skiing competition.\nThe bravest moment of the Games didn't happen on any course, ice, snow or field of competition. Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych was not allowed to compete in skeleton after he refused to compete in anything other than the helmet that bore the images of his fellow Ukranian athletes who were killed in the Russian invasion in recent years. By trying not to make a political statement, the IOC wound up making one anyway and Heraskevych emerged as a disappointed but principled and proud hero who was as clear-eyed in his pursuits as any of the 2,800-plus Olympians who earned invites to Italy.I loved American snowboarder Nick Baumgartner, a 44-year-old with the spirit of a happy kid. He's still going for medals in snowboard cross, and he very much intends to be back in four years. If he can do it, so can Austrian Benjamin Karl, who won gold as a 40-year-old and celebrated by going topless.Why next two Winter Games will likely top 2026Here's one major reason I've long loved the Winter Olympics: the skill it takes to be the greatest in the world in the toughest of settings. For the most part, no sports are tougher on mind and body. The big rule of these Games is that all competition must take place on the surface of snow or ice. And so there they went on those slippery surfaces every day. Downhill skiers barreling down an icy mountain piste at 80-plus miles per hour. Snowboarders and freestyle skiers scooping themselves dozens of feet in the air above a halfpipe. Balancing on the thinnest of edges while skating on ice, or uncorking acrobatics wonders before gracefully landing on a slim slab of riveted silver, those who put blades below their feet continued to push the boundaries of what is physically possible.\nLuge, skeleton and bobsleigh athletes throw themselves down verglas slides on sleds at speeds going faster than the legal limit on most American highways. Others endure organ-bursting snow pursuits in cross-country skiing, or take on heart-stopping flight risks in a variety of ski and snowboard aerial competitions.It's truly some of the most thrilling athletic competition known to man. And I think we just witnessed an all-timer of an Olympics.Now scroll back up and look at the names of the athletes that medaled. So many of them will be back, as will the likes of Eileen Gu, Chloe Kim and more. The United States outperformed expectations here in 2026. In four years, Stolz, Malinin, Shiffrin, Liu and more to come onto the scene will have gold medal expectations. In ice hockey, the American rivalries with Canada are sure to hit all-time highs. The Winter Olympics are in the midst of a revival, and this is merely Phase 1. The next will hit big in France in 2030, and then just wait. In 2034, Salt Lake City will again play host after 32 years, and with it, the culmination of a renaissance on ice and snow both for the United States and the world.\n            ",

The Buckeyes are forecasted to have the game's two top scorers, but MSU counters with eight players projected to have more than 5 points, twice as many as Ohio State.

Teammate Luis Suarez grabs his arm in an effort to pull him away, the pair emerging from that doorway moments later in Suarez's attempt to de-escalate the situation. It was initially unclear how close Messi got to the officials' locker room but in a statement from PRO, which is responsible for all refereeing assignments in MLS and other U.S. professional soccer leagues, they said the World Cup winner did not get far enough to put himself in danger of breaking league rules.\n\n\"After speaking with the match officials, we can confirm Lionel Messi did not enter the officials' locker room,\" PRO said in a statement on Sunday.No match officials filed complaints against Messi after the match and an investigation concluded that he did not enter any restricted areas during the incident.\nMLS previously fined FC Cincinnati's Matt Miazga for three matches after he entered the referees' locker room following a playoff match at the New York Red Bulls, angered by the yellow card he received that would keep him out of the next game in the postseason. Miazga's suspension was subsequently reduced to two matches.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky dropped its third consecutive game Saturday in a 75-74 loss at Auburn, and it came in controversial fashion. Coach Mark Pope was audibly frustrated with the officials who whistled the Wildcats for a pivotal foul which set up a game-winning bucket for Auburn's Elyjah Freeman. After dancing around criticism of the officials during his postgame media availability, Pope could be heard on a hot mic laying into the SEC and the crew that called the contest.\"If those mother-effers try to fine me, screw 'em,\" Pope said after he left the media room. \"I did not say a word about how they cheated us.\"Pope's frustration stemmed from a critical call with 14.3 seconds to play. Leading by a point, the Wildcats inbounded from underneath their own basket when a whistle blew the play dead. Officials called Collin Chandler for an offensive foul when he shoved Auburn's Kevin Overton to the floor to gain separation. While Chandler clearly extended both arms on the shove, Pope was bewildered by the call.In Kentucky's defense, there was mutual contact between the players. Overton wrapped one of his arms around Chandler's back before the push-off for what could have been called a holding foul.\nBefore his comments on the hot mic, Pope addressed the situation with care not to place direct blame on the officials.\"We're not allowed to talk about the referees, but you guys saw it, and I think sometimes it's just super personal,\" Pope said. \"I'm not allowed to comment on the referees. I won't comment on the referees. It's unfortunate. It didn't cost us the game. We're in control of the game, so we'll find ways to go win.\"The foul turned the ball over to Auburn, which scored a game-winning basket on the ensuing possession. KeShawn Murphy missed a close-range shot, but Freeman flew in for the rebound and tipped in a putback with 1.1 seconds remaining, pushing the Tigers on top by a point.\n\"We refuse to give control to people that are outside of our program,\" Pope said. \"Refuse. Regardless of how personal it might get or how bad it might get. We refuse to give control to fans, to give control to anybody else associated with this game, regardless of how blatantly people are trying to make this not happen.\"We're not giving away our power. We're not. We don't make excuses. We don't do that regardless of what is happening, regardless of how disgraceful things are. We don't give away our power regardless of how embarrassing, personal, awful, unacceptable things are. We refuse to give away our power.\"Every loss for Kentucky adds to the disappointment of what initially projected to be a national championship-contending season. The Wildcats slipped to 17-10 with the defeat and are a projected No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, per CBS Sports bracketology.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- The man who turned them down to pursue his boyhood dream, rolling up the Seven Sisters' Road to add two more to the hat trick he scored last time out, Eberechi Eze the playground bully who reveled in the humiliation of the kids from up the road. It is at this moment that we have to deliver that immortal line from Giorgio Chiellini. \"It is the history of the Tottenham.\"What future history books might tell us of this Tottenham team is worryingly unclear at this stage of the season. Spurs shouldn't get relegated. They probably won't. Bookmakers will happily offer you quite a bit of money to put yours on Tottenham going down.Suppose, however, you were looking back in May, trying to explain how a club that takes three-quarters of a billion dollars in revenue has found itself bound for the Championship. What would have been the early warning signs? A hellacious injury crisis. No real sense of an on-field identity after years of muddled recruitment for players whose physical qualities do not offset their technical limitations. A manager in Igor Tudor with no experience of the Premier League, who might have less bounce than a dead cat after beginning his tenure with a hammering at Arsenal's hands.\"I don't know where we are going now,\" was the cry that echoed from the stadium PA at the final whistle. The gags write themselves.\nIt didn't need to end this way, mind. Tottenham hadn't been the better team at halftime but the game was where they would have wanted it. Eze's opener was cancelled out within 24 seconds of the restart, Randall Kolo Muani preying on overplaying by Declan Rice to thunder Spurs into a lead they held at the interval. It felt like dicing with danger when Tottenham's pre-match MC Paul Coyte declared that Arsenal were \"worried, nervous as hell\" but when the visitors had frittered away another lead you could see his point.The next steps looked relatively obvious, repeating the gameplan of the first half. Sit deep, soak up pressure and have a spring on the counter when the opportunity presented itself. Prey on those insecurities that keep rearing their head for Arsenal. It's hardly the Tottenham way but given the talent disparity between Mikel Arteta's side and hosts that have been laid low by a dozen injuries, it would have been a perfectly valid approach.Instead, Spurs played as their manager had been urging them to in the first half, when every time you glanced at the touchline, you could see Tudor gesticulating for his center backs to get up the pitch. He wanted to see Tottenham press up against Arsenal, to engage them in one-on-one duels. When his players did as he wanted, the outcome was disastrous. There was no downturn in the number of progressive passes the Gunners completed, 33 in both halves, a negligible upswing in Arsenal's touches in the opposition third that probably reflects them taking their foot off the gas at 3-1 and only one instant in which Spurs recovered possession in the attacking third.\n\"We wanted to press high but to press high from the back you need to jump,\" said Tudor. \"If you are late, you don't take the ball and run again. We prepared to press high but we didn't take the ball. We didn't take the ball.\"For 45 minutes the Gunners got to play the sort of game they relish on European nights, their build-up players able to brush past physically inferior opponents and advance the ball into acres of space. Viktor Gyokeres has less space in some of the warm up drills than he did when he smacked the ball past Guglielmo Vicario to restore Arsenal's lead.They never looked like ceding it again. Some of that was due to the composure of Eze and the excellent Bukayo Saka, a lot of it was Tottenham pressing ahead with a gameplan they were incapable of implementing. \"Nice to understand where we are,\" was how Tudor put it postmatch. A harsher assessment would follow, that this was a moment to \"look in the mirror\". \nTudor surely didn't understand the cruelty in the following line to a club for whom the term unserious might be best applied. \"What is this goal of this coach, these players, this staff? To become serious.\"\"We need more time to be in the physical moment and situation that we can go strong and take the ball,\" was another of the eye-opening remarks from Tudor. Time is one resource that is rapidly draining in this season. There are 11 Premier League games to go and the table is looking dicey to say the least. The gap to West Ham in 18th is just four points. At full strength Spurs have the talent to ease away from these sides but look at the XI Tottenham named Sunday. Would you definitely take that over Vitor Pereira's?Since the turn of the year, Nuno Espirito Santo's side have gained seven on Spurs, Nottingham Forest five. In that time, they have had a non-penalty of -0.46 per game. Forest's is worse but West Ham's points trajectory looks to be backed up by the data. Meanwhile Spurs' looks altogether too sticky.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            It will probably all be just about fine. Tudor said he was hopeful of shaving two off his injury list in time for next week's trip to Fulham. Cristian Romero's suspension is up over the international break, though whether his kamikaze temperament is well suited to a relegation scrap is an open question. It shouldn't be too long until Pedro Porro, Destiny Udogie and Kevin Danso are back. The defense can improve. The attack? The inconsistent Mohamed Kudus is a way off and even if James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski play again this season, it is hard to believe they will be anything like the best versions of themselves. Spurs might have added one to their tally of 37 Premier League goals this season but that is off the back of by far the biggest xG overperformance in the league. Tudor will need those long-injured stars to immediately return at the peak of their powers to enliven an attack that barely produces one non-penalty expected goal per game.Framing this as a reality check was an understandable move by Tudor, a high point set by what he termed \"probably the best team now in the world\". It is not the new manager's fault at all but that moment of realization should have come months ago, perhaps the last time Eze and Arsenal were running the goals up against them. Since then a January window has passed by in which pledges of investment resulted in a prospect left back and, in Conor Gallagher, a better version of the sort of up, down low touch midfielder that Spurs were already well stocked with. That is yet another of those touchstones that might be looked back on with such grim \nOf course, the picture might never look as grim as it does when you've just been beaten again by your greatest rivals, inspired by the man who left you in the lurch late in the transfer window. Right now it isn't the gap to Arsenal that matters, it is the one to West Ham and Nottingham Forest.That is looking altogether too close for comfort. Come the season's end it should be just about big enough. While, however, this is still a team that fulfill those essential qualities Chiellini identified eight years ago, you can never be entirely sure that they won't find a way to snare another defeat for themselves.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA consequential week awaits in Europe as the UEFA Champions League's knockout phase playoffs continue with a batch of second leg matches, several of which will be fiercely contested with spots in the round of 16 on the line.Three first leg matches concluded in a draw or with a team boasting a narrow one goal advantage, a trip to the next round no sure thing for several high-profile teams.

They have made it to the round of 16 on all but two occasions in the last 12 seasons and are still the favorites to advance on Tuesday but after last week's 3-3 draw at Club Brugge, reaching the next round is no guarantee. The Belgian side went toe-to-toe with Atleti, revealing some of their opponent's shortcomings in the process. Diego Simeone's side still boasts a handful of talented goalscorers, headlined by Antoine Griezmann and Julian Alvarez, the pair supported by impactful players like Alexander Sorloth and new signing Ademola Lookman. Their defensive performances, though, have been all over the place – they have one clean sheet in their last five, a 4-0 win against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, conceding nine goals in that stretch. Brugge have sneakily been a strong attacking side in the Champions League with 15 goals in eight league phase matches, gifted at finding a way to exploit vulnerable defenses.Are Italian sides in trouble?: Coupled with Juventus' first leg capitulation at Galatasaray, Inter's tie with Bodo/Glimt will serve as a bellwether for the state of the game in Italy, the pressure fully on the Serie A leaders after losing 3-1 in Norway last week. Glimt are riding a high after beating both Manchester City and Atleti in recent weeks and have the benefit of a familiarity with Aspmyra Stadion's artificial turf but even then, Inter failed to match the tempo of the opponent in the first leg and return home with a sizable disadvantage. They rebounded in domestic play with a 2-0 win at Lecce but may have to cope without Lautaro Martinez, who came off with a calf injury at Glimt and missed Saturday's match and may be at risk of missing Tuesday's Champions League encounter. They will likely count on Marcus Thuram to lead their attacking charge but Inter have not exactly an attacking force in Europe with 15 goals during the league phase, an average tally during those eight games, a worrying sign for a team in need of goals on Tuesday.Wednesday's storylinesReal Madrid's up-and-down season: From a results standpoint, things were coming up Real Madrid last week – their win over Real Sociedad and Barcelona's defeat to Girona meant they took top spot in LaLiga, while a 1-0 win at Benfica means they have an important advantage heading into the second leg. Their four-match win streak came to an end on Saturday, though, with a 2-1 loss at Osasuna, a game that served as a reminder of the team's longstanding issues. There's a longstanding imbalance to Los Blancos' squad, even as coach Alvaro Arbeloa commits to playing Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior alongside each other. The strategy works sometimes but is far from foolproof, as was the case on Saturday – they only managed 1.7 expected goals from 15 shots at Osasuna, while the hosts had 2.29 xG from 13 shots. There is no reason to expect Arbeloa to drop Mbappe and Vinicius when Benfica come to town on Wednesday but against a visiting side that limited Madrid's offense to just 0.89 xG from 17 shots, finding the correct balance may be an all-important task for the coach.Paris Saint-Germain bounce back:Paris Saint-Germain entered their first leg at Monaco with just four wins in their last eight and a chance to end their rut, which they did – even if it was the hard way. An early brace from U.S. international Folarin Balogun ensured PSG had to come back from a 2-0 deficit in order to come out with a first leg advantage, while a 3-0 win over Metz on Saturday ensured they would have more wind in their sails in time for Wednesday's second leg. They will have to manage against Monaco without Ousmane Dembele, who came off early in the first leg with an injury and may still be unavailable on Wednesday, leaving Luis Enrique to call upon the likes of Desire Doue and Achraf Hakimi to hold down the attacking fort.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In 2010, Sidney Crosby propelled the Canada men's hockey team to a gold medal after scoring the game-winning goal in overtime against Team USA. On Sunday, though, Crosby looked on from the sideline as Jack Hughes' overtime goal lifted the Americans to a 2-1 win over Canada as Team USA won the gold for the first time since 1980. Crosby missed Canada's final two games of the Olympics after he sustained a lower-body injury during the quarterfinals. He said that the decision to sit out Canada's eventual loss to Team USA was his and his alone. \"I was pretty close,\" he said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins who also helped the Canadians win the gold medal in 2014, said that this Canada team deserved a better outcome than what ultimately unfolded on Sunday. \"I think everyone should be proud the way the team performed,\" he said. \"I thought that, obviously, we did everything but score. In every facet, we were just so good today. I thought we deserved better, and unfortunately, you know, didn't come away at the win.\" Canada's Nathan McKinnon was a little more blunt during his postgame presser. \n\"You be the judge of who was the better team today,\" said McKinnon, who missed a golden chance to give Canada a 2-1 lead in the third period.Crosby's absence was certainly felt, especially on the offensive end. Canada got just one of its 42 shots past Connor Hellebuyck and were unable to take advantage of an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period. The Canadians lost despite out-shooting the Americans, 42-26.\n        \n            \n                Team USA honors Johnny Gaudreau after defeating Canada to win the gold medal\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTeam USA got on the board first on Matt Boldy's first-period goal.

    "body": "\n        Shortly after winning America's first gold medal in men's hockey in 46 years, members of Team USA honored Johnny Gaudreau, a former Team USA member who tragically died in August of 2024. Zach Werenski, who played alongside Gaudreau during his final NHL seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets, held up Gaudreau's Team USA jersey along with team captain Auston Matthews and assistant captain Matthew Tkachuk shortly after he fed Jack Hughes for the game-winning goal against Canada. The gesture occurred with members of Gaudreau's family looking on in the stands. \nAfter receiving their gold medals, Werenski and Dylan Larkin, who played with Gaudreau at multiple world championships, brought Gaudreau's young children out to the ice for a team photo. \n\"It means everything -- we all know he should be here with us,\" Larkin said of Gaudreau prior to the gold medal game. \"He should be with us. We love him, and I like that we continue to think about him and I wouldn't imagine it any other way.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Johnny and his younger brother Matthew Gaudreau were killed after being stuck being an alleged drunk driver while cycling in New Jersey. Like his older brother, Matthew Gaudreau was also an accomplished hockey player who played professionally in the AHL and ECHL before becoming a coach. A seven-time NHL All-Star, Johnny Gaudreau was a six-time All-Star for the Calgary Flames. He was the 2017 recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which is given annually to an NHL player \"adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\"\nIn 2022, Gaudreau shocked most of the hockey world by deciding to sign with the Blue Jackets as a free agent. He was named to his seventh and ultimately final All-Star team during his first season in Columbus, who has continued to honor his legacy following his untimely death. Gaudreau helped Team USA win the gold medal at the 2013 IIHF Junior World Championships. He most recently played on Team USA during the 2024 IIHF World Championship. He never got a chance to play in the Olympics, though, as the NHL did not participate in the previous two Olympics. \"He wanted to be on this team,\" his father, Guy Gaudreau, said during the third period of the America's win over Slovakia. \"And it would've been nice if he'd been here.\"\nMembers of the Gaudreau family made the trip to Italy after being invited by Team USA. \"Our two daughters, for 24 hours, they just kept at us: 'You have to go. The boys would want you to do this. This would mean so much to John,'\" said Gaudreau's mother, Jane. \"It just means so much to our family, and we're so excited to remember what our boys meant to hockey.\"Their presence was certainly felt by Team USA. \"It's great having them here, and it's super special,\" Werenski said prior to Sunday's game. \"We're happy that we made it to the gold medal game so they can watch that and be a part of it. It's on us to make them proud.\"\nGaudreau served as inspiration throughout the Olympics for Team USA. His uniform was on the locker room throughout the Olympics, and it was on the ice on Sunday when the Americans made history by winning the gold medal for only the third time. \"He was one of America's very best,\" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. \"He's just a good person on the ice and off the ice, and I think he's an inspiration to our players to this very day.\"\n            ",

The most significant change (of many!) will be a new No. 1 team for the second time in as many weeks after No. 3 Duke downed No. 1 Michigan in the nation's capital, 68-63, on Saturday night.Duke will likely supplant the Wolverines at No. 1 after a brief, one-week stint at the top, bringing forward a fifth team on the season to hold the No. 1 spot. Houston also held the No. 1 spot one week (in Week 2), while Purdue and Arizona also had stretches as the top-ranked team.Duke's rise will obviously come at the expense of its Saturday victim, Michigan, which -- along with Houston -- is expected to drop in the rankings. But with eight of the top 10 teams stumbling this week, voters have their work cut out making heads or tails of how to slot teams in their ballots.\nHere's our best guess at how the rankings will look and how voters' ballots will shake out.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke was named the No. 2 overall team by the selection committee on Saturday, the second No. 1 seed behind only Michigan, so its head-to-head win over the Wolverines later in the day should catapult it into the top spot Monday and in the driver's seat to be the No. 1 overall seed.2\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Arizona won 73-66 over Houston on the road Saturday to claim its second consecutive ranked win in as many tries. The Wildcats are 25-2 and look like they haven't missed a beat without the services of star freshman Koa Peat. They're that good.3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    A fall is likely for last week's No. 1, Michigan, even if a large fall is unlikely.

After out-muscling Nathan MacKinnon for a loose puck, Zach Werenski found Hughes coming down the weak side. Presented with a chance to end the game, Hughes didn't miss as he fired a shot past the glove of Jordan Binnington.Connor Hellebuyck was undoubtedly the Americans' best player on Sunday. Hellebuyck played the best game of his career, stopping 41 of 42 Canadian shots and making some miraculous stops when the United States needed them most. Hellebuyck lived up to his billing as the best goalie in the world.Meanwhile, the Canadians missed one opportunity after another to win the game. Canada failed to score on an extended 5-on-3 power play in the second period, Devon Toews was stopped by the stick of Hellebuyck with a wide open net in front of him and Nathan MacKinnon missed on a glorious opportunity to give his team a 2-1 lead.Team USA took advantage of those Canadian miscues and finished its Olympic run with the country's first gold medal in 46 years.U.S. men's hockey scoresAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalWednesday, Feb. 18: USA 2, Sweden 1 (OT)Semifinal\nFriday, Feb. 20: USA 6, Slovakia 2Gold medal gameSunday, Feb. 22: USA 2, Canada 1 (OT)\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State and Ohio State will meet for the first time on the hardwood this season Sunday on CBS in a pivotal Big Ten showdown with NCAA Tournament seeding and conference championship implications on the line. The two teams enter the day having won earlier in the week -- Michigan State over UCLA and Ohio State over Wisconsin, respectively -- setting up what should be a terrific matchup from East Lansing.Michigan State has been tough to beat on its homecourt this season, but it has not been infallible. It is 13-2 in games played in the Breslin Center, with both losses coming to teams ranked inside the top five. That should inspire at least a little confidence in the Buckeyes, who are in desperate need of stringing together some momentum after alternating between wins and losses in their last nine outings.Where to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Ohio State vs. Michigan State: Need to knowBig Ten title hopes: Michigan State enters Sunday 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings and likely needs to run the regular-season table to be in contention for a conference title. Given the way the Wolverines have played, it seems farfetched, but the Spartans can't lose sight of the goal against a Buckeyes team that could be easy to overlook if not taken seriously. Consistently inconsistent: Ohio State has alternated between winning and losing in its last nine games dating back more than a month, proving to be consistent only in its inconsistency. A win Sunday would be its first two-game winning streak since mid-January. It is coming off an 86-69 home win over Wisconsin.\nFearsome Fears: Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears Jr. leads all of college basketball in assists per game (9.3) and also leads his team in minutes and points per game with 31.6 and 15.1, respectively. He's made a significant jump in production from last season and is coming off his fourth consecutive double-double in which he had 16 points and 10 assists in an 82-59 win over UCLA.Ohio State vs. Michigan State prediction, pickOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook\nMichigan State's 13-2 at home this season and 7-5-1 against the spread as home favorites. I'm taking the Spartans to win and would probably lay the points with them as they prep for their penultimate home game of the season. The way Fears has played of late should inspire confidence, but more than that, this Michigan State team has leveled up defensively, too. If they can find a way to slow Bruce Thornton they can win -- and perhaps handily. Pick: Michigan State -9 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal restored their five-point lead atop the Premier League table with a 4-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby on Sunday, taking full advantage of their injury-riddled opponents in a must-win match.Though Spurs returned to play for the first time since hiring Igor Tudor to replace Thomas Frank, the match went as expected for two sides in full contrast. Arsenal dictated play and were rewarded with a 32nd-minute goal from Eberechi Eze, who scored from close range as a frantic Spurs defense failed to cope with the Gunners' attacking charge. The visitors' lead was gone in a matter of two minutes courtesy of Randal Kolo Muani, who won possession on the left side of the penalty area and then cut inside for a strike right in front of goal.The stat sheet at halftime was reflective of the realities that the visitors were in the midst of a title charge and the hosts are technically staving off relegation and entered the weekend with 13 fit senior team players, as well as Spurs' stylistic tendencies. With only two true attack-minded players on the pitch and boasting a roster that, even at full fitness, is not built to be an offensive might, they had just two shots and 0.29 expected goals at the halftime break. Arsenal, meanwhile, took full advantage of an understaffed Spurs defense that was missing the suspended Cristian Romero and the injured Kevin Danso and had 12 shots and one expected goal.Things finally tipped in the Gunners' favor in the second half, first with Viktor Gyokere's impressive strike from distance in the 47th minute and then Eze's second strike in the 61st minute, the England international capitalizing on a sloppy moment from Spurs' defense along the way. In between Arsenal's second-half goals, Spurs thought they had an equalizer through Kolo Muani but he was called for a push on Gabriel in the process of scoring.\nSpurs attempted a attacking surge towards the end of the match, substitute Richarlison managing two shots in the dying minutes of the match, but their efforts did not pay off and in one of the final moments of the match, Gyokeres completed a brace of his own to ensure the Gunners would take all three points home.Eze, who joined Arsenal this summer from Crystal Palace and nearly signed with Tottenham, scored a hat trick against Spurs earlier this season.\nThis is Arsenal's first Premier League win in three, their grip on first place slipping slightly over the process. They finish the weekend five points ahead of Manchester City, who kept pace with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday and also have a game in hand.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arguably the biggest stop en route to the NFL Draft is the NFL Scouting Combine, which brings well over 300 of the most talented football players in America to Indianapolis. There, the prospects will go through drills that test everything from their athleticism to their ability to fulfill the duties of their specific position on the football field. Every year, players utilize the combine, where all 32 NFL teams are represented by scouts and front office personnel, to improve their stock after putting together film in their final collegiate season. The NFL sent invites to 319 players in February now that the 2025 season is in the rearview mirror. It should come as no surprise that some of college football's top brands, like Alabama and Ohio State, will be sending plenty of players to Indianapolis. But upstarts like nearby Indiana, which completed one of the best Cinderella stories in college football history with a national title last season, have plenty of talent headed to the combine. \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Senior Bowl standouts Caleb Banks, Lee Hunter change Round 1 conversation\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's a look at the college programs that produced the most invites to the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine: \n1. Texas A&M -- 13 Notable players: WR KC Concepcion; OL Ar'maj Reed-Adams; DL Cashius Howell; LB Taurean York; DB Will Lee III Texas A&M, fresh off of its College Football Playoff debut, will have plenty of representation at the combine. Many eyes will be on the dynamic Concepcion, who has a chance to put up some eye-popping numbers. But the Aggies will have plenty of trench monsters going through drills as well. Four of their five offensive line starters and three of their top defensive linemen from the 2025 season are headed to Indianapolis. 2. Alabama -- 12 Notable players: QB Ty Simpson; WR Germie Bernard; OL Kadyn Proctor; DL LT Overton; LB Deontae Lawson \nThe combine should be a great opportunity for Simpson to boost his draft stock even further in a relatively weak quarterback class. He's already viewed as a first-round pick and his accuracy should show through in the routes-on-air period. Bernard is another potential riser to keep an eye on. He flew under the radar for most of the season, though he was Simpson's favorite target in the passing attack. Bernard's best work may come with the pads on, as he's a tough-running magician after the catch, but solid testing numbers could push him into an upper echelon. T-3. Ohio State -- 11 Notable players: WR Carnell Tate; TE Max Klare; DL Caden Curry; DL Kayden McDonald; LB Arvell Reese; DB Caleb Downs It should come as no surprise, given how dominant Ohio State was in 2025, that its defense leads the way among combine invites. Seven of the 11 prospects that will represent the Buckeyes in Indianapolis played on the defensive side of the ball. That includes several likely first-round prospects. Reese has a chance to be the first defender taken off the board. He can play off the ball or at edge rusher at the next level. McDonald was a unanimous All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year. Downs has been one of the top defensive backs in college football since he stepped foot on campus, and he's only solidified that status over the last couple of seasons with the Buckeyes. He'll be a rare early safety picked in the 2026 NFL Draft. \nT-3. LSU -- 11 Notable players: QB Garrett Nussmeier; WR Barion Brown; LB Harold Perkins Jr.; DB Mansoor Delane; DB. A.J. Haulcy LSU may have had a disappointing season, but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of talent. Nussmeier did underperform while battling through various injury issues. Maybe he can use the combine to remind scouts why he was once thought of as a top prospect. Brown will certainly turn some heads. He's a top candidate to post the fastest 40-yard dash time of the entire event. T-5. Georgia -- 10 Notable players: WR Zachariah Branch; WR Colbie Young; DL Christen Miller; LB CJ Allen \nSpeaking of impressive 40-yard dash times, Branch will be a must-watch for those that enjoy speed. He's a fun gadget player that could find a nice home at the next level as a return specialist. Young is a physically impressive wideout. If his 6-foot-3 and 215-pound frame is verified by combine measurements, that will certainly stand out. T-5. Oklahoma -- 10Notable players: TE Jaren Kanak; DL Gracen Halton; DL R Mason Thomas; LB Owen Heinecke; DB Robert Spears-JenningsKanak is a fascinating prospect. He spent the first three years of his career as a linebacker before transitioning to tight end ahead of the 2025 season. He was a third-team All-SEC selection after finishing third among Sooners with 44 catches for 533 yards. It will be fascinating to see how he tests and where he lands in the draft. Oklahoma has seven defenders headed to the combine after its defense led the way to a College Football Playoff appearance last season. Four defensive linemen will rep the Sooners, who were gritty in the trenches in 2025. \nT-5. Miami -- 10 Notable players: QB Carson Beck; OL Francis Mauigoa; DL Rueben Bain Jr.; DL Akheem Mesidor; DB Keionte Scott Miami has a lot of extremely talented big fellas headed to the next level. Stalwarts like Mauigoa, a dominant offensive tackle, and Bain were a big reason why the Hurricanes made it all the way to the College Football Playoff National Championship. The edge-rushing duo of Bain and Mesidor played some of their best football in the postseason. They combined for a whopping 10.5 sacks during Miami's four-game run through the playoff. T-8. Clemson -- 9Notable players: QB Cade Klubnik; RB Adam Randall; WR Antonio Williams; DL T.J. Parker; DL Peter Woods \nKlubnik had a very disappointing 2025 campaign, but perhaps he can revive his image at the combine. As it has been so often with Clemson, though, defense is the focus here. Parker and Woods are two of the best defensive prospects in the draft. Both should hear their names called very early. T-8. Florida -- 9 Notable players: OL Jake Slaughter; DL Caleb Banks No matter how much Florida struggles on the field, it will always be well-represented in the draft. The Gators are good at churning out talent thanks to their ideal recruiting situation. Slaughter is arguably the top center prospect in the draft and Banks is a highly regarded defensive lineman that should have a solid professional career. T-8. Indiana -- 9 Notable players: QB Fernando Mendoza; WR Elijah Sarratt; OL Pat Coogan; LB Aiden Fisher; DB D'Angelo Ponds \nThe reigning national champions, obviously, have plenty of stars worth mentioning. Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy and, in all likelihood, he'll follow that up by going first overall in the 2026 NFL Draft. Ponds has a great shot to hear his name called in the first round as well, though his size may hold him back. Fisher has all the makings of a mid-round steal. He's a fundamentally sound linebacker that's always around the ball. It will be interesting to see how his athletic profile stacks up, but the tape doesn't lie. T-8. Iowa -- 9 Notable players: WR Kaden Wetjen; OL Gennings Dunker; OL Logan Jones; DB Xavier Nwankpa Don't sleep on the Hawkeyes. Wetjen is a fun player to watch. He's got a chance to carve out a solid career as a return specialist. Dunker and Jones are two of three starting offensive linemen from Iowa's 2025 squad that are expected to be drafted. \nT-8. Penn State -- 9 Notable players: QB Drew Allar; RB Kaytron Allen; RB Nicholas Singleton; OL Olaivavega Ioane; DL Dani Dennis-Sutton Allar probably won't compete at the combine as he continues to recover from an ankle injury that cut his 2025 season short. An NFL team will likely still take a late-round flier on him given his frame and natural talent. Allen and Singleton are both intriguing talents in their own right. Allen was the better of the two last season, but both had great moments in their collegiate careers and both should hear their names called in April. \n            ",

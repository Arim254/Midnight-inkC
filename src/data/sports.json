    "body": "\nTeams coming off wild-card comebacks will meet in the 2026 NFL divisional round as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Chicago Bears on Sunday. This matchup will complete the final four teams of the 2026 NFL playoffs. L.A. (12-5) defeated Carolina, 34-31, last Saturday via a game-winning touchdown pass with 38 seconds remaining. Chicago (11-6) overcame an 18-point deficit to knock off Green Bay, 31-27, on Saturday. The teams have split their prior two postseason meetings, with the home team winning each game.

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained. Meanwhile, the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests and have allowed multiple passing touchdowns in five of their last seven games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Bears, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

Plenty of the betting action will center on the spread, money line and over/under, but bettors are also always looking to push the envelope to put together huge parlays. The Rams vs. Bears matchup has the highest over/under (48.5) despite frigid temps and heavy winds expected, so many will look at the alternate total in that contest.From NFL player props to alternate lines to exact score predictions, there are several plus-money NFL bets one could pursue in their playoff parlay for a shot at a massive return.

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the market for a new coach following Mike Tomlin's shocking decision to step down, which is unusual given that Pittsburgh has had just three head coaches since 1969. The Steelers have now requested to speak with nine candidates, and the most recent reported interviewee could be a natural fit. The Steelers have scheduled an interview with former Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy, according to NFL Media. Not only is McCarthy a Pittsburgh native that worked as a grad assistant and then wide receivers coach at the University of Pittsburgh, but Tom Pelissero says that McCarthy's father was a firefighter and Pittsburgh police officer who owned Joe McCarthy's Bar and Grill. McCarthy was even raised a Steelers fan.McCarthy is very much unlike the coaches the Steelers have hired in the past. In fact, their last three head coaching hires were all defensive coordinators in their 30s that didn't have head coaching experience. McCarthy is a 62-year-old offensive mind who has served as the lead man for two different organizations. Still, he could be what the Steelers need as they go through this transition.\nMcCarthy is 174-112-2 in his 18 seasons as a coach, spending 13 seasons with Green Bay and five in Dallas. He went 49-35 with the Cowboys, and owns the fourth-best win percentage in franchise history. McCarthy led the Packers to a Super Bowl XLV victory, which came against the Steelers, and left Green Bay with the second-most wins (125) in franchise history.When it comes to who the Steelers are looking at for their next coach, it's an appropriate smorgasbord of talent. They will interview young offensive minds, young defensive leaders and also a couple of men who have previously led teams.\nSteelers interview trackerNameMost recent jobMike McCarthyCowboys head coachNathan ScheelhaaseRams pass game coordinatorChris ShulaRams defensive coordinatorAnthony WeaverDolphins defensive coordinatorJesse MinterChargers defensive coordinatorBrian FloresVikings defensive coordinatorEjiro EveroPanthers defensive coordinatorJeff HafleyPackers defensive coordinatorKlay Kubiak49ers offensive coordinatorWhile the Steelers are considered to be one of the premier franchises in the NFL, there are plenty of questions to answer this offseason. Aaron Rodgers is not expected back, which again puts the Steelers in the market for a new quarterback, then the defense finished the season ranked seventh-worst in the league, and some of the talent is aging. Many view Pittsburgh as a team that is in need of a reset. Depending on who Art Rooney II hires, that reset may not take long.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina played at Coppin State on Sunday, an unusual sight since high-majors don't typically play HBCUs on the road. It all started with a tweet from Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley while trying to finish her 2024-25 schedule.\"Really sorry I have to resort to this but-we need a game,\" Staley wrote in August 2024. \"I've had some nice, funny and outlandish convos regarding scheduling a game H/H with a guarantee and guaranteed a great student-athlete experience -any interest please let me know. Need to finish this schedule.\"A few days later, Staley gave an update saying the Gamecocks' schedule had been completed and gave a shoutout to HBCUs. Although she didn't reveal it was Coppin State at the time, South Carolina hosted the Eagles on Nov. 14, 2024.\nThis Sunday, it was time for the Gamecocks to travel to Baltimore. South Carolina picked up a 90-48 victory, but the lopsided result doesn't take away from how beneficial scheduling a game like this can be for HBCUs. Staley made the deal with coach Jermaine Woods, but it was honored by first-year head coach Darrel Mosley.\"It's a big revenue (draw) for HBCUs\" Mosley said to Greenville News ahead of the matchup. \"We're not well-funded so drawing ticket sales at the door. A regular game we have 200 people in the building, just (Staley) coming to play it's going to probably be roughly 4,000 people. The university is able to capitalize on that revenue.\"\nOther than helping a roster build confidence early in the season, there are not too many benefits for top-ranked opponents to travel for a game against mid or low-major teams. There are costs involved in traveling and losing that game could be a huge hit on their resume.Regardless, Staley talked about the importance of shining some light on HBCUs. During Sunday's postgame press conference, she said the crowd of 3,371 was the second highest attendance in Coppin State history, only trailing the game against LSU on Dec. 2023 when Maryland native Angel Reese was on the Tigers' roster.Despite this being a road game for the Gamecocks, there was a lot of appreciation for South Carolina, with fans even lining up to take pictures with Staley.\n\"Scheduling is hard...Instead of the big competitive games, we've added some HBCUs just to lift up every aspect of our sport,\" Staley said in September. \"Not every team will play an HBCU on their home court. And we feel like, you know, it's a great game, great competition, great coaching. If we can lift because we play the game and get some notoriety to some HBCUs, then we'll do that.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When New York Knicks forward Karl-Anthony Towns put up a 3-pointer with about a minute left against the Phoenix Suns Saturday night to try and cut into the vistors' seven-point lead, Knicks fans inside Madison Square Garden were cheering in anticipation in what could've been the spark to ignite a comeback. But the shot sailed wide left, missing everything and landing out of bounds.Fans began booing the Knicks, and the players' body language following the airball showed visible frustration as they were headed for their third consecutive loss, and eighth in their last 10 games.\nAfter the game, Knicks coach Mike Brown sided with the fans in their booing, saying \"the fans have every right to boo\" after another disappointing loss.If the Knicks' resolution for the new year was to win an NBA championship, this certainly isn't inspiring confidence of that happening. They have a 2-7 record in January, and the only team with a worse record is the Utah Jazz, a team that has just 14 wins on the season. \nWhile it may seem like just a rough patch in a long season, in the history of the league there haven't been a significant number of instances where a team has gone 2-8 at any point in the regular season and went on to win a championship. In fact, only six NBA champions have ever done that, per CBS Sports' research department.NBA Finals teams with 2-8 span in same seasonSeasonTeamResult2021-22Golden State WarriorsWon Finals2017-18Cleveland CavaliersLost Finals2014-15Cleveland CavaliersLost Finals2010-11Dallas MavericksWon Finals2003-04Detroit PistonsWon Finals1980-81Houston RocketsLost Finals1977-78Washington BulletsWon Finals1977-78Seattle SuperSonicsLost Finals1975-76Phoenix SunsLost Finals1974-75Golden State WarriorsWon Finals1970-71Baltimore BulletsLost Finals1969-70Los Angeles LakersLost Finals1966-67San Francisco WarriorsLost Finals1962-63Los Angeles LakersLost Finals1958-59Minneapolis LakersLost Finals1956-57St. Louis HawksLost Finals1951-52New York KnicksLost Finals1947-48Baltimore BulletsWon FinalsThe last team to do it was the 2021-22 Warriors, who had the greatest shooter in NBA history on their team in Stephen Curry and caught fire in the NBA Finals en route to his first Finals MVP. That's not to say the Knicks can't rebound from this poor showing, and there's certainly tons of evidence showing that a team can still make the Finals despite having a 2-8 span. But the Knicks don't want to just get a participation trophy for getting to the NBA Finals, the goal is to hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy in June.So what's been going on with this team as of late? Jalen Brunson's has missed the last two games with an ankle injury, which certainly doesn't help matters. But even with Brunson back fully healthy, he's not covering up the biggest issue plaguing the Knicks this season.The defense has been awfulThe Knicks have no problem putting points on the board. Yes, in this 10-game rough patch they've fallen from a third-best offense all season to 21st, but that can be explained by a matter of shooting variance. The Knicks have been the third-best 3-point shooting team all season, but in January that's fallen to 23rd. They're still getting up roughly the same number of 3s per game (around 39 per game), so no one's taking that shot away from them, but the efficiency has dipped. Mikal Bridges, who has hovered around 43.1% on his 3s through the first three months, has fallen to 35.6% in January. Across December and January, OG Anunoby has been ice cold from deep.Because of that poor shooting there's been a tendency to over-rely on Brunson's ability to take a defender one-on-one, which creates a more stagnant offense, but those are easier fixes. And we've seen the Knicks cut down on the isolation attempts this season compared to the last few years where the gameplan was typically just letting Brunson dominate the ball and either take it himself, or collapse the defense and kick it out to a shooter. There's room for the offense to bounce back.The defense, however, hasn't been good at all this season. What was once a calling card for New York has now become its Achilles heel. The team rank is 19th in defense, and over the last 10 games, that's been even worse, as only the lowly Jazz have allowed more points than the blue and orange during this pitiful stretch.Part of the issue can be summed up by this single possession in a recent 112-101 road loss to the Kings.\nBrown called Towns out for his lack of urgency to get back on defense, as well as several other instances not just by him, but by the whole team. \"When you fall down, you got to get up,\" Brown said after the game. \"You got to sprint down the floor, and even if you're the last guy down the floor, you got to get down there, just in case there's a long rebound. But there was no urgency. Now, that wasn't the only play. There were a handful of plays where we did that, but there was no sense urgency on that particular play to get back. And it was a five-point swing.\"Against the Warriors, the Knicks built up a 17-point lead in the first quarter, and then things began to fall apart defensively. There was no communication to make up for breakdowns in rotations, and they were caught sleeping on a number of occasions that created easy backdoor cuts for the Warriors.Jimmy Butler took over in that game doing typically Jimmy Butler stuff. He's going to outwork you, he's going to fight for second and third scoring opportunities and make life difficult for you on the other end. The Knicks have great individual defenders in Bridges, Anunoby and Hart, but, as a team, the constant breakdowns make this group vulnerable.They're one of the worst teams at defending the 3-point line. Opponents are shooting 37.3% on 3s this season against the Knicks, which has increased to 39% in the last 10 games. Guys aren't putting in effort to close out on the perimeter, as most of the 3s opponents take against the Knicks are coming on wide-open looks.Knicks' 3-point defense, 2025-26 seasonClosest defenderFrequency (%)3PA/G3P%/G0-2 feet (Very tight)0.2%0.242.9%2-4 feet (Tight)4.3%3.833.5%4-6 feet (Open)17.6%15.336.5%6+ feet (Wide open)22.9%19.938.7%Brown predicted his team's defensive struggles a few weeks ago after a win against the Pelicans, where where the Knicks narrowly escaped with a five-point victory against a New Orleans team that to that point in the season had only won eight games.\"We haven't figured out how to be physical for 48 minutes in the last I don't know how many games,\" Brown said. \"We pick up some some silly fouls that we have to do a better job of. I feel everybody understands that, but now we just have to go do it. Our physicality is not good. I don't know if we're tired or what, but we have not been able to sustain anything defensively for 48 minutes. We've won a lot of games, and you want to win games, and you feel good about it. But at the end of the day, if we don't figure out how to sustain what we're supposed to do on the defensive end of the floor for 48 minutes it's going to be a long year for us, and it's going to eventually catch up to us.\"Just two and a half weeks after Brown said that and it's already caught up to the Knicks in the worst way possible.Should the Knicks be concerned?Absolutely. If they can't figure out their defensive issues, then forget winning a championship, they could get taken out far before then if they're not careful. Sure, teams have been known to flip a switch when the postseason rolls around, and the Knicks could certainly become more engaged with the motivation of winning a title fueling them. But right now is when that should be put into practice. If this worrying trend doesn't turn itself around, it could be an issue the Knicks try to address on the trade market. There's been trade rumors in the past connecting the Knicks and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and he'd certainly cover up a ton of weaknesses defensively. The Knicks have also been attached to Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado, whose made a name for himself as an all-out effort guy who is also a defensive pest. Think of him as another Josh Hart out there, which something that the Knicks would certainly love.If there's not a trade that materializes, then the Knicks will have to look in the mirror and figure out how to mitigate this issue from within. Otherwise they could be the next in a long list of teams who might make the Finals, but fall short of capturing a title because their defense just isn't up to the task.\n            ",

Sometimes the label has been attached to St. John's or Kentucky. Right now, it's probably UCLA.In early December, it was maybe Florida.Yes, the reigning national champ started 5-4 (with a loss to TCU) after being ranked third in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 poll. Neither transfer portal addition in the backcourt was looking like money well spent. The Gators dropped to as low as 33rd in the NET and to what amounts to 35th in the AP poll.But now look.Since dropping four of their first nine games, the Gators have won eight of their past nine with the latest victory representing the biggest. Final score: Florida 98, Vanderbilt 94.\nThat was Saturday's most notable result, I think. The Quadrant-1 win on the road inside Nashville's Memorial Gym pushed Florida to 13-5 overall, 4-1 in the SEC and up to 14th in Sunday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings. Vanderbilt dropped to 16-2 overall, 3-2 in the SEC. The Commodores are 15th in the Top 25 And 1.\"I'm incredibly proud of our group,\" said Florida coach Todd Golden. \"I just told these guys in the locker room: this is an incredibly challenging place to play a great team that I believe plays better at home, by a wide margin, than on the road. So a little disadvantage for us, only playing them once here. And we talked about it -- that if our goal of winning the league was realistic, that this would be a game that was really important to make that happen. And we got it done.\"Indeed, they did.And, just like that, KenPom.com is now projecting Florida to finish atop the SEC with a 14-4 league record -- two games ahead of Vanderbilt and Alabama. If things do unfold that way, it would be Golden's first regular-season conference championship in a seven-year head-coaching career that already includes one NCAA Tournament championship (2025) and one SEC Tournament championship (2025).\n Top 25 And 1 rankings \n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                5\n            \n                Duke\n            \n                9\n            \n                North Carolina\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Arizona\n                                \n                            Jaden Bradley finished with 23 points and six rebounds in Saturday's 84-77 win at UCF.

    "body": "\n        At long last, DJ Lagway has made a decision regarding his plans for the upcoming football season. The former Florida Gators' sophomore quarterback is signing with Baylor 10 days after he had committed to them. A former five-star recruit, the 6-foot-3, 247-pound Lagway entered the transfer portal on Dec. 15 following two seasons at Florida. He had early visits with Florida State and Virginia before visiting Ole Miss after Trinidad Chambliss was denied a sixth season of eligibility. There were also rumblings that Duke could be in the mix for Lagway's services after Darian Mensah entered the transfer portal at the 11th hour. In the end, though, the 20-year-old Lagway has decided to sign with Baylor while following in the footsteps of his father, Derek, who played running back for the Bears from 1997-01. While he showed flashes of his potential at Florida, injuries prevented Lagway from having more success during his time with the Gators. Multiple injuries, for example, prevented him from taking part in Florida's spring practices ahead of the 2025 season. A calf issue that was sustained in July further hindered his practice availability. Those injuries and the subsequent loss of practice time undoubtedly impacted Lagway's effectiveness once the 2025 season began. He and the Gators endured a 1-3 start to the season that included a 20-10 loss to LSU that saw Lagway throw a season-high five interceptions. \nLagway finished the season with 2,264 yards and 16 touchdowns while completing 63.2% of his passes. He also threw an SEC-high 14 picks for the Gators, who finished the season with a 4-8 record. Lagway showed his potential at the end of the 2024 season by leading the Gators to four straight wins that included throwing for a season-high 305 yards in a 33-8 win over Tulane in the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl. He also led the Gators' to wins over then-ranked LSU and Ole Miss before Florida defeated rival Florida State in their regular season finale. A former USA Today Offensive Player of the Year, Lagway was named Mr. Texas Football in 2023 after throwing for 4,631 yards and a Texas 6A record 58 touchdown passes during his senior season. He also ran for 975 yards and 15 touchdowns while showcasing his impressive versatility. \nLagway will be going to a Baylor team that went 5-7 last season and 3-6 in the Big 12. Despite last year's struggles, the school decided to retain coach Dave Aranda, who went 36-37 during his first six seasons with the Bears. His best season with the Bears took place back in 2021, when he lead Baylor to a 12-2 record that was capped off by Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason continues to wind down, with just over three weeks to go until pitchers and catchers report for camp across sites in Florida and Arizona. There's still some business to be conducted during that interim period, with left-hander Framber Valdez, outfielder Cody Bellinger, and third baseman Eugenio Suárez standing out as the best remaining free agents. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Sunday's top murmurs and moves in one spot for your viewing convenience.Mets still have interest in BellingerEven after signing Bo Bichette, the Mets retain interest in signing outfielder Cody Bellinger, according to The Athletic. It is believed their preference is to do another short-term, high-dollar contract similar to Bellinger's. The Yankees have stated their priority is re-signing Bellinger this offseason and they have a five-year offer on the table.\nBellinger, 30, is now the top unsigned free agent position player. He signed a three-year, $80 million contract with the Cubs two years ago and opted out of that deal to become a free agent this offseason. It's unclear if he's willing to go that route again. Bellinger hit 29 home runs and was a 5-WAR player in 2025. He may never be better positioned to sign a long-term deal.D-backs reiterate no Marte tradeFewer than 10 days have passed since Diamondbacks executive Mike Hazen ruled out the possibility of trading All-Star infielder Ketel Marte. That hasn't stopped reporters from asking if Hazen could reconsider in light of infielders Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette finding new homes, but Hazen doesn't sound like someone who is entertaining the possibility.\n\"We've already engaged in that process. I said at the time that I set the deadline for a reason, to avoid this,\" Hazen told MLB.com.Marte, 32, is under contract through at least the 2030 season and has regularly been one of Arizona's most productive players. Yet he reportedly angered the clubhouse with his availability last summer, fueling speculation that he could be on the move this offseason. The D-backs were rumored to have interest in signing Bregman themselves (before he inked with the Cubs) and then trading Marte. With that option off the table, Hazen seems content to roll with Marte to begin the 2026 campaign.Mariners, Giants among those interested in DonovanThe Cardinals have had a busy offseason under new top executive Chaim Bloom, trading away right-hander Sonny Gray, third baseman Nolan Arenado, and first baseman Willson Contreras.  Utility player Brendan Donovan figures to join that group at some point before Opening Day.\nIndeed, Donovan continues to draw interest from a collection of teams that includes the Mariners, Giants, Red Sox, and Royals, per the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Donovan, 29, is a popular target thanks to his above-average stick (he's never posted an OPS+ below 114) and defensive versatility. He has an additional season of team control remaining, too, making him a potential multi-year fix for whichever team employs him.Braves' Kim out until the summerBraves shortstop Ha-Seong Kim is expected to miss four to five months after injuring a torn tendon in his right middle finger that required surgery, the team announced on Sunday. As such, Kim will miss the onset of the season, with his return timetable putting him on track to rejoin the lineup sometime during the summer, depending on how he recovers.\nKim, 30, signed a one-year pact worth $20 million with the Braves earlier this winter. He was expected to enter the season as their everyday shortstop after hitting .253/.316/.368 (93 OPS+) in 24 games with Atlanta in 2025.With Kim sidelined, the Braves' top internal option to fill in at shortstop is Mauricio Dubón, obtained from the Astros earlier this winter in exchange for Nick Allen. If Atlanta wanted to add to their depth chart, the top remaining free-agent option is Isiah Kiner-Falefa.\n            ",

The league levied the $11,593 fine for a violation of the NFL uniform and equipment rules, citing the display of a personal message.Al-Shaair's message was in reference to Israel's policies in Gaza. He has supported the \"Free Palestine\" movement in past seasons through the NFL's \"My Cause, My Cleats\" initiative, which permits players to highlight social issues and nonprofit organizations during select games.\"If my platform can bring even a little hope to families in Palestine, then that is what I want to use it for,\" Al-Shaair said earlier this season.The Texans selected Al-Shaair earlier this season as their club winner for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which is given annually to a player who demonstrates excellence on the field and a significant commitment to philanthropy and community service off the field.\nAl-Shaair earned his first Pro Bowl selection this season after racking up 103 tackles, nine passes defended, a forced fumble and a career-high two interceptions. The second-year Texan is a former undrafted free agent who has blossomed into one of the NFL's most outstanding linebackers across stints with the San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans and Texans.Personal messages are prohibited unless approved ahead of time by the league office. The NFL does not grant permission for players to convey messages pertaining to \"political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns,\" according to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 8 of the league rulebook.\nThe first offense constitutes an $11,593 fine. The second offense carries a $17,389 penalty. All NFL fines are collected and donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation and NFL Foundation.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nMonday night's College Football Playoff National Championship Game between No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami shapes up as a grueling, physical battle between two teams that have embraced that identity all season. The unbeaten Hoosiers are trying to become college football's first 16-0 national champion, but they must get past a resurgent Hurricanes team playing on its home field.Miami's path has been anything but easy. The Hurricanes knocked off No. 7 Texas A&M on the road, eliminated No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl and outlasted No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl to reach the title game. Powered by a massive offensive line, Miami has created running lanes for Mark Fletcher Jr. while quarterback Carson Beck distributes the ball to elite playmakers such as Malachi Toney, giving the Hurricanes a balanced, efficient attack.First-year defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman has elevated Miami's defense into one of the nation's best, bringing to life fourth-year coach Mario Cristobal's vision of a big, punishing roster. Still, the question remains whether that physicality is enough to test Indiana.The Hoosiers have overwhelmed everyone in their path, blasting No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl and dismantling No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl. With Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza at the controls and no obvious weaknesses on the roster, Indiana enters as a more-than-touchdown favorite.Second-year coach Curt Cignetti has orchestrated one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history, putting Indiana on the brink of its first national championship.Keys to victory in CFP National Championship: How

been telling them all season? It has blown out Alabama and Oregon in consecutive playoff games and comes into the championship in much better shape than the Miami Hurricanes do health-wise. I don't expect we see a blowout along the lines of what the Rose and Peach Bowls provided, but I do expect the outcome will be clear before the fourth quarter starts. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 13Chip Patterson: I do think that Miami has the defense to be able to limit what Fernando Mendoza can do pushing the ball deep down the field and also a better rushing attack than Ohio State, which should help no bungling red zone opportunities like the Buckeyes did in the Big Ten title game. The Hoosiers' efficiency and effectiveness should keep them in control most of the game, but the playmaking potential should give Miami enough splash plays to keep it interesting. As long as Miami executes on its scoring chances, it will have a chance to win, but I've got Indiana (best TD% red zone defense in the country) winning those key plays to emerge as 16-0 national champions. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 30, Miami 20Brandon Marcello: Miami is still the most physical, violent team remaining in the playoff. Indiana has been unbreakable all season, even in a pair of close calls against Penn State and Iowa, but this Hurricanes team is relentless along the offensive and defensive lines. The problem for Miami is that it still doesn't quite trust quarterback Carson Beck to throw deep, leading to more underneath throws. Even against Ole Miss, drives stalled in the second half when the Hurricanes pulled away from running the ball with Mark Fletcher Jr. Indiana's offense gets a lot of attention with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza, but it's the defense that has won games. I trust both quarterbacks in 2-minute situations, but Mendoza protects the ball and Beck is a bit more unpredictable. This will be a slugfest at times, but Indiana will pull away to make this the eighth straight title game with the champion winning by double digits. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 21John Talty: Indiana has been the best team all season long. They are elite offensively and defensively. They have America's best coaching staff. They have my favorite curmudgeon in the sport. I've been riding with the Hoosiers since the spring, and I'm not stopping now. What once felt unbelievable will become reality: Indiana as national champions. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 34, Miami 20Shehan Jeyarajah: Indiana has been a perfect football team in 2025, and it will ultimately end with an elusive first national championship. It won't come easy. Miami's top-rated defensive line will force mistakes, including at least one turnover from Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza. However, Mendoza's legend will be cemented with a fourth-quarter touchdown to ice the game and deliver the Hoosiers an unlikely title. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 17David Cobb: Miami's offensive line is sturdy enough to prevent Indiana's defensive front from completely taking over, a necessity if the Hurricanes hope to stay within striking distance. On the other side, Miami has enough punch up front -- led by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akeem Mesidor -- to make the Hoosiers uncomfortable at times. Ultimately, Indiana looks like a team of destiny and should win outright. But Miami is capable of turning this into a fight. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 20Richard Johnson: Indiana will get the job done largely on the strength of their defense. With all the post-snap movement and zone drops that Indiana incorporates to their defense, my expectation is that eventually Carson Beck will get fooled and give the Hoosiers a couple interceptions. It's all they'll need to outlast Miami and tip the scales in their favor with the extra possessions. It's also the path that could see the game get truly out of hand. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 34, Miami 17Chris Hummer: Miami is playing a national championship game at home. What a story. What an opportunity. What a moment. The Hurricanes can't lose it, right? Well ... here comes Indiana. It feels ridiculous to type that with a 15-0 Indiana. It's Indiana! History tells us this isn't possible, but Curt Cignetti has created a monster in Bloomington. They're the most well-coached, most disciplined and best team in the country. Plus, they have a Heisman Trophy-winning QB and, if you talk to coaches around the sport, have a roster that athletically matches up with anyone. As crazy as it feels to write, I'm picking Indiana to win a national championship. How could I not? Maybe Miami finds a bit more magic at home. But this has been the season of Indiana. As long as Indiana's o-line can hold up on the edges, it wins this game. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 24, Miami 21Who will win and cover in Indiana vs. Miami?

    "body": "\n        Only one ticket to the AFC Championship, and a trip to Denver to face the Broncos, will be punched on Sunday afternoon when the Houston Texans and New England Patriots duke it out from frigid Foxborough in the divisional round. Both clubs emerged out of wild card weekend victorious, thanks largely to some tremendous efforts on the defensive side of the ball. Against Pittsburgh, Houston engulfed Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense, holding them to just six points in a blowout win that saw two touchdowns scored by the defense. They also allowed Pittsburgh to move the chains on just two of its 14 third-down opportunities. Meanwhile, New England had an equally stellar day defensively in its win over the Chargers. They were able to take down Justin Herbert six times in the winning effort, while holding the L.A. offense to a mere field goal. With those defenses hitting their strides, it poses quite a challenge for two of the brightest young quarterbacks that the league has to offer, C.J. Stroud and Drake Maye. For Stroud, this is his third consecutive year advancing to the divisional round, but he has stopped short of a conference championship berth in his prior two visits to this playoff plateau. As for Maye, he's looking to become the eighth-youngest quarterback all-time to win a divisional round game. So, the stage is set quite nicely for a heck of a game at Gillette Stadium. Before we dive further into this matchup, however, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this game. \nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Texans liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough)TV: ESPN, ABC | Stream: fubo, try for freeOdds: Patriots -3, O/U 40.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsCan the left side of Patriots OL hold up?\nThe left side of New England's offensive line -- spearheaded by rookies Will Campbell (left tackle) and Jared Wilson (left guard) -- had a game to forget against the Chargers last week. Campbell finished his evening allowing five total pressures to go along with a sack, while Wilson also gave up five pressures and two sacks. No bueno. Drake Maye was hurried quite a bit in that game, which contributed to his two turnovers (an interception and a fumble). The challenge only gets tougher now that they'll have to fend off a lethal Texans pass rush headlined by Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Houston finished second in the NFL with a 42.5% pressure rate this season, and if they can get to Maye early and often, it'll drastically tip the scales in the Texans' favor.   Will C.J. Stroud protect the football? \nWhat got lost during Houston's dominating win over the Steelers on Monday night was that Stroud had a bad game. While the Texans dropped 30 points for the game, 13 of those points were scored by the defense. The most jarring aspect of Stroud's performance was his inability to protect the football. He threw an ill-advised interception in the red zone and had five total fumbles in the game (two lost). The two lost fumbles were strip sacks, and while some blame can be put on the shoulders of the offensive line in that regard, Stroud also held onto the ball too long at times, which allowed the Pittsburgh pass rush to get home. He also appeared to have some miscommunication with his center, which also saw the ball hit the turf. Stroud was fortunate to have his defense bail him out, as they allowed just three points on his three turnovers. If he gives the ball away this time around with MVP contender Drake Maye on the other side, it could be a different story. Has New England's defense actually leveled up?One of the big takeaways from New England's win over the Chargers was just how dominant their defense was. While we've come to expect that kind of brilliance from Houston's unit, the Patriots' defense seemed to level up against Los Angeles. They held Justin Herbert and Co. to just three points, sacked him six times, and allowed just one conversion on 10 third-down attempts. While that's outstanding, it is fair to wonder just how much of that domination was due to the Patriots' evolving play and how much to the Chargers not being ready for the moment. After all, the L.A. offensive line had been in shambles all season after losing both star tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, and Herbert was one of the most pressured quarterbacks in the league during the regular season. However, if this is a sign that this New England defense has gone up a level, it raises their ceiling remarkably. \nX factor\nWhile there's no official word yet, it does appear as if the Texans will be without their No. 1 pass-catching weapon in Nico Collins, after he left Monday's matchup due to a concussion. That's a big blow to the offense, but Houston did see veteran Christian Kirk step up in that playoff win over Pittsburgh, catching eight of his nine targets on the night for 144 yards and a touchdown. They'll need another performance like that for the Texans to confidently move the ball with any regularity. If he cannot, and no other pass catcher steps up, that'll once again see Stroud hold onto the ball far longer than he should and open the door for New England's pass rushers to take him down throughout the game. Texans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nHouston's pass rush is a real challenge for the Patriots' offensive line. However, I think New England's defense could prove just as big an adversary for C.J. Stroud, especially if he does not have Collins. It looks like the Patriots will have star corner Christian Gonzalez for this matchup after he also suffered a concussion on Sunday, further emboldening the idea that this New England unit can shut down the Texans' offense and potentially create a turnover or two. If Stroud coughs the football up, the Patriots should be able to capitalize more than Pittsburgh was able to a week ago. On top of that, this is also a tough spot for the Texans from a scheduling perspective. They just had to play on the road in Pittsburgh, fly back to Houston, and then jump back on the plane to head to New England, all on the short week. That's a lot of adversity to overcome, so I see the Patriots advancing to the AFC Championship. \nPrediction: Patriots 24, Texans 20 | Pick: Patriots -3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills have once again been eliminated from the playoffs in heartbreaking fashion. Their 33-30 defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs was rife with both mistakes and controversy, and their season has ended the same way so many during the Sean McDermott and Josh Allen have before: with a trip back home to Buffalo before reaching their ultimate goal. The Bills during this era have made the playoffs in seven straight seasons and the divisional round in six of them, but they've only advanced to the conference championship twice and have not yet made it to the Super Bowl. What hurts the most about this particular defeat is that this may have been Buffalo's best chance to break through. While the Bills came into the playoffs as the AFC's No. 6 seed, the usual suspects with whom they would have to contend for the AFC title were all sitting at home. \n        \n            \n                Irate Sean McDermott reacts to Broncos' controversial overtime interception in Bills' stunning playoff loss\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens missed the playoffs. So did Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals. And so did the Bills' biggest boogeyman of all, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. \nYou can't help but wonder, if the Bills couldn't make it through the AFC field this year, then will they ever be able to do so? Or will they instead go through Allen's entire prime -- perhaps his entire career -- without making it to the mountaintop?With that existential question hanging over everything, the Bills have some soul searching to do, some big decisions to make and some key areas where they need to improve between this year and next, if they want things to be any different in 2026 and beyond.The coaching staffMcDermott is a good coach. He's compiled a record 98-50 in the regular season, giving him a .662 winning percentage that is third-best among active coaches and which ranks 15th all time among the 207 coaches who have coached at least 50 games, according to Pro-Football-Reference. He's gone 8-8 in the playoffs and, as mentioned, has made the divisional round in six of his seven trips and the AFC title game in two of them.\nBut if the Bills are going to make a big change in the wake of their latest defeat, it's likely going to be moving on from McDermott and trying to find someone who can take them to the next level. The quarterback obviously isn't going anywhere, and not just because of his six-year, $330 million contract. The only other sizable change available to the Bills is to swap out the coach and hope that an injection of something new becomes the difference between heading home and heading to the Super Bowl. It doesn't help, though, that this isn't exactly the best hiring cycle. There are surely some attractive options out there, but it's not like last offseason when Ben Johnson and Mike Vrabel were the lead names and some of the most sought-after coaches in recent years. That fact, plus the stability that McDermott has brought to what had been a moribund franchise before he got there -- remember, the Bills had not made the playoffs since 1999 before McDermott arrived and had not played in the AFC title game since their four straight trips to the Super Bowl before McDermott and Allen led them there -- could add up to McDermott returning for at least another year. He and general manager Brandon Beane are under contract through the 2027 season, and with the Bills soon moving to a new stadium, they may not want to rock the boat too much in the meantime. \nIf the Bills decide to bring McDermott back -- which is probably more likely than deciding to move on, to be clear -- then they could instead opt to make a change at one or both of the coordinator positions. Joe Brady's offense has been very good overall since he took over for Ken Dorsey late in the 2023 season, but it's also been inconsistent. There are times where it looks unstoppable and times where it looks like it's lost. He's leaned into multiple tight end sets and heavy personnel to mold the offense to fit the roster, but the Bills might look to go in a different direction. That said, Brady would also be just as likely to be a candidate to replace McDermott if the Bills moved on there. He's in a very interesting situation.Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich's unit was a disappointment this year. Some of that is on the personnel and the injury issues the Bills faced, but when a team is facing an existential crisis and the head coach isn't necessarily on the most solid ground, coordinator changes are always possible. It's also possible that McDermott could just reclaim play-calling duties for the defense, which is something he has done before. (McDermott said in October that he and Babich call the plays together.)\nIt's also worth noting that offensive line coach Aaron Kromer, who has built one of the best units in the league during his time in Buffalo, is expected to retire. The Bills will at least need to find a suitable replacement there.Josh Allen's weaponryIt's somewhat fitting that Buffalo's season arguably swung in the wrong direction on a deep ball to Brandin Cooks -- a 32-year-old wide receiver who was claimed off waivers from the New Orleans Saints and suddenly became an important piece of the Bills' passing attack down the stretch of the season. That kind of personifies some of the issues with Buffalo's receiver corps, which has unquestionably regressed over the last few years. Gone are the days of Stefon Diggs, or even of Cole Beasley and John Brown. Instead, the Bills heavily rotate through guys who are specialists like slot man Khalil Shakir or primarily blockers like Tyrell Shavers or deep depth pieces and cast-offs like Cooks, Curtis Samuel, Elijah Moore, Gabe Davis, Joshua Palmer and Mecole Hardman. \nKeon Coleman, the team's second-round pick in 2024, was supposed to be different, but he has instead been unreliable both on the field and off it and doesn't look like a key piece of the future unless he dramatically turns things around. Tight end Dalton Kincaid was supposed to be a premier weapon as well, but has instead largely been a part-time player because he's not a very good blocker, and hasn't been quite as advertised as a receiving threat. The Bills need to get more explosive in their pass-catching corps, and they especially need someone to do the X receiver type of things that they thought Coleman would bring to the table -- stretch the field from the outside, win in contested catch situations and create spacing for guys like Shakir and Kincaid to work underneath and over the middle. This isn't meant to excuse Allen's performance against the Broncos, during which he turned the ball over four times, with two interceptions and two fumbles. It's true that he played his own role in the loss. It's just also true that the Bills need to improve this area of the team so that they're not relying on guys like Cooks -- who, to be fair, did some good work during his stint -- in key situations like they were on Saturday afternoon. They can't be so dependent on Allen putting on his Superman cape in every game.\nThe defensive front, againBuffalo got absolutely clocked in the run game throughout this season. The Bills allowed 5.1 yards per carry, which ranked 30th in the NFL. They allowed at least 100 rushing yards in 12 of their 19 total games, at least 150 in eight of them and at least 200 in four.They were 26th in yards allowed before contact per rush, according to Tru Media, and dead stinking last in yards allowed after contact. They allowed opponents to gain five or more yards on 39.3% of their carries, which ranked fifth-worst in the league, and they allowed an explosive run on 11.3% of opponent rushes, which tied them with the Dallas freaking Cowboys for the worst mark in the NFL.The Bills, as has become a trend in their playoff losses, also struggled badly to get pressure without blitzing during the playoffs. According to Tru Media, they generated pressure on just 25% of opponent dropbacks when sending four or fewer rushers. That's a truly abysmal figure.\nThey have annually tried to alleviate that issue by signing edge rushers, but it annually has not quite worked in the biggest moments of their season. They tend to have a bunch of B to B+ players up front, but in the playoffs you really need those A players who can take over the game. The Bills just flat out haven't had that type of player, despite their repeated attempts to find one.The Bills won't have much in the way of cap space and will be picking late in each round of the draft, but figuring out a way to find a dominant force along the defensive front should probably be priority No. 1 for the offseason, just as it has been over each of the last few years. Moving forward in BuffaloTo begin the playoffs, my colleague Douglas Clawson broke down why the Bills' slate was tantamount to a golden ticket for Allen. Give Buffalo credit for winning a tough game at Jacksonville, in which it was an underdog, but there may not be a set of circumstances this favorable again. From Clawson's piece: \nAllen and the Bills have hit the jackpot this year and they need to turn in that golden ticket because this year is a blip. I assume Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow will all be back in the postseason looking like themselves. They've all got injury or some kind of adversity to overcome, but they are just too darn good.Meanwhile, the other young blue-chip quarterbacks in the conference are still a little green. Bo Nix, Justin Herbert and Drake Maye have all yet to win a playoff game in their careers. Trevor Lawrence and C.J. Stroud has flirted with excellence, but haven't sustained it for a long period of time like the current mount rushmore. These could all be rising powers, though.The Bills could have their hands full with Drake Maye in the AFC East for years to come, especially when the Patriots build out a better roster around his rookie deal. Right now he's still a one-man band. No, Buffalo's Super Bowl window is not closing. But it may never be that open again. It will be a long winter in Buffalo.\n            ",

The Bears outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to erase a three-score halftime deficit. Williams shook off two interceptions and finished with two touchdown passes and 361 passing yards, including some clutch fourth-quarter passes that got Chicago back in the game. While the Bears have some deficiencies on defense, they boast a top-10 scoring offense as Williams has spread the ball around to DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III and others. They are getting more than a field goal at home this week against a Rams squad that was shaky at Carolina this week, giving them a great chance to cover. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverDespite failing to cover in the wild-card round, Los Angeles has been one of the best NFL teams against the spread this season. The Rams are 12-6 ATS overall and 11-5 ATS as the favorites. Stafford leads the league's best scoring offense as the Rams are the only team in the NFL that averages more than 30 points per game. They also have a top-10 scoring defense, giving up just 20.9 points per game. Stafford has been in the MVP conversation this season, and he has an extremely strong supporting cast. Running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum have combined for nearly 2,000 rushing yards, while receiver Puka Nacua led the NFL in receptions (129) in the regular season and ranked second in receiving yards (1,715). The Rams should be able to exploit a Bears defense which ranks 29th in yards allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears picksHartstein is leaning Over on the total.

    "body": "\n        If Indiana beats Miami on Monday night to win the College Football Playoff National Championship, the school will have completed one of the most shockingly fast turnarounds in sports. Just two seasons ago, the Hoosiers were an also-ran in the Big Ten, to put it politely. Now, under Curt Cignetti, they're a national powerhouse.That got us thinking about some of the quickest turnarounds in modern sports history. Which teams came from nowhere only to reach the pinnacle of their sport in just a few short years later after a dramatic turnaround? Some may have forgotten how bad a legacy team like the Boston Celtics were prior to their 2007-08 championship run. And then there was an expansion team like the 1997 Florida Marlins, who won it all in just their fifth year of existence.Sometimes, all it takes is one key player to make all the difference. Just ask the 1999 St. Louis Rams or the 2010 Auburn Tigers. Those squads got major shots in the arm from the right spot at the right time, and then just rode that to championships.Before Indiana tries to complete its dizzying ascent to the college football throne, let's look back on some of the fastest turnarounds ever in the sports world.\nNew York Rangers (1992-94)Despite boasting a wealth of talent, the 1992-93 Rangers just couldn't put it all together and finished last in the Patrick Division at 34-39-11. Perhaps the biggest issue was that star defenseman Brian Leetch was limited to just 36 games due to injury. On top of that, Mike Richter had one of his worst seasons between the pipes with a 3.82 GAA and a .886 save percentage.The very next season, Leetch was fully healthy, and he tallied 79 points from the blue line. Forward Adam Graves exploded for 52 goals, and Richter bounced back with 42 wins, a 2.57 GAA and a .910 save percentage. After a year in which nothing went right, the puck bounced the Rangers' way constantly in 1993-94, and the team rolled to a first-place finish.The Rangers made quick work of their first two playoff opponents, going 8-1 against the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals. Then, with the Rangers down in the three games to two to the Devils in conference final, Mark Messier guaranteed a road Game 6 (at New Jersey) before advancing and taking out the Vancouver Canucks in seven games in the Stanley Cup Final. Leetch took home the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nFlorida Marlins (1993-97)Let's first all agree that time is relative. The Florida Marlins lost 98 games in their 1993 debut, and then -- along with the rest of Major League Baseball -- lost games in its second and third seasons due to the 1994 strike. Fans in South Florida would have been downright giddy at the prospect of going 80-82 in 1996, but then came the unthinkable: Winning a World Series championship the following season, in only the team's fifth year of existence.Seeking a win-now strategy, team owner Wayne Huizenga busted out the checkbook heading into that 1997 season, signing veterans everywhere, including left fielder Moises Alou, third baseman Bobby Bonilla and pitcher Alex Fernandez. Jim Leyland, a manager with World Series experience, was also brought on board, and those acquisitions joined a roster that already had a young Gary Sheffield and rookie shortstop Édgar Rentería. Darren Daulton and Craig Counsell were picked up at the trade deadline, and in the playoffs, Cuban rookie pitching sensation Liván Hernández sparkled, winning NLCS and World Series MVP honors.A five-year turnaround might not seem fast-fast, but when you consider the team Florida beat in that 1997 Fall Classic was a Cleveland franchise that -- to that point -- had gone five decades without a World Series title, yeah, we'd say what the Marlins did was relatively quick.\nSt. Louis Rams (1998-99)The Rams went 4-12 in 1998, and they did so with a Hall of Fame quarterback sitting on the bench. Instead, Tony Banks led an offense that scored just 17.8 points per game.Going into the 1999 season, Kurt Warner wasn't even supposed to be the starter. The Rams brought in Trent Green, but he tore his ACL in the preseason. That gave Warner his shot, and he didn't miss. He threw for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns while Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim formed a three-headed monster at receiver.Joining Warner in the backfield was running back Marshall Faulk, acquired from the Indianapolis Colts via trade after the 1998 season. Faulk totaled 2,429 yards from scrimmage and 12 touchdowns and he finished second in MVP voting. The Rams went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV in early 2000 in a 23-16 thriller against the Tennessee Titans.\nDetroit Shock (2002-03)The Shock won just nine games in 2002, and they were the only team to finish the year with single-digit victories. Detroit was especially dreadful on defense, allowing 70.8 points per game, which was one of the worst marks in the WNBA. Of course, that overall record disguises a positive upward trend that occurred after Bill Laimbeer took over for Greg Williams, who led the team to an 0-10 record. The Shock went 9-13 under Laimbeer, and they carried that momentum into the 2003 season.The defense didn't improve much in 2003, but the offense took off with 75.1 points per game. Swin Cash led the way with 16.6 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. The biggest addition was No. 3 overall pick Cheryl Ford, who won Rookie of the Year with 10.8 points and 10.4 rebounds per game.The Shock took down the Cleveland Rockers and Connecticut Sun in the first two rounds of the postseason before beating the Los Angeles Sparks in the WNBA Finals.\nBoston Celtics (2006-08)The 2006-07 Celtics were about as far away from an NBA title as you can be. Their 24-58 record was the worst in the East, and only the Memphis Grizzlies had a worst record overall. An injury limited Paul Pierce to 47 games, and the team around him collapsed. The following offseason, general manager Danny Ainge got to work.Boston swung blockbuster deals, landing both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, to assemble a Big Three. That trio -- combined with ascending players like Rajon Rondo and Glen Davis -- proved to be lethal. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA in 2007-08, and they fought their way through an arduous postseason.Two series went seven games and the other two ended after Game 6, one of which being an NBA Finals championship over the Kobe Bryant and Boston's arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers.\nAuburn Tigers (2008-10)In 2008, the Tommy Tuberville era on The Plains came to an unceremonious end with a 5-7 season. The Tigers were 2-6 in SEC play, and they scored just 17.3 points per game, which ranked 111th in the country.The following season was the start of Gene Chizik's tenure as coach, and while there were some improvements, Auburn still had its fair share of flaws. With Chris Todd and Ben Tate leading the way on offense, Auburn's offense rebounded to 33.3 points per game. Unfortunately, the defense didn't hold up its end of the bargain, and the Tigers finished with a respectable 8-5 record, although they were 3-5 in league play.In 2010, Auburn found lightning in a bottle thanks to one of the greatest seasons from any college football player ever. Cam Newton came in to play quarterback, and he was a one-man wrecking crew. Newton totaled 4,327 yards and accounted for 51 touchdowns, and those gaudy numbers earned him the Heisman Trophy. Thanks to Newton, the Tigers ran the table and beat Oregon to win the BCS National Championship.\nLeicester City FC (2014-16)There are long shots, and there are LONG SHOTS. Leicester City's drive to the 2015-16 Premier League title doesn't only fall in the all caps category it practically screams in 48-point font that there won't be anything like it ever again. Claudio Ranieri's men were an unfathomable 5,000-1 shots before the season began, but there was, indeed, a chance.After losing half of their game in their first Premier League season of 2014-25, For magic to happen that season, the club needed a few things to go right. First was that the traditional powerhouses in England all struggled to some degree or another with Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool all falling apart while Arsenal and Tottenham narrowly failed to catch the unlikely winners. From there it was the magical alchemy of a trio of yet to be appreciated stars in N'Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy surrounded by a consistent, workman like set of role players that danced between the raindrops to become the unlikeliest story in Premier League history.\n            ",
